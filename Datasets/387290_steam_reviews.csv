Was looking for other platformers to play and picked this baby up for $4.99 love me a good sale.

Big fan of the overall gameplay, just ""feels"" smooth and the large host of movement options you get is really fun and opens up some interesting puzzles and whatnot. I also love how you're naturally just really fast, i love SPEED!

The game also looks beautiful which is a nice bonus and the map is really nice too. You get a pretty good amount of that classic backtracking metroidvania thing, or you could just not do that that much if you want and just have a nice progression.

Great game took me around 9 hours to complete just chillin yaknow, probably will go back for a Hard mode run and maybe 100% more areas and stuff.

The game uses movement-based progression (subjective) like hollow knight, metroid demon's crest etc. Essentially, as you progress in the game, you get more abilities that help you traverse the game. However, some of the abilities just lose their usability and only exist to bar you from certain areas.

The Gameplay
The game is a platformer, do not focus on the combat; the combat is pretty bland and repetitive. You're playing this game for the platforming
Personally I didn't find the platforming as hard as I wanted it to be. If you aren't very well versed in platformers ~~or don't particularly like them~~, you'll probably enjoy the game more.
The difficulty setting only affects the damage you take, so there isn't much of a difference between the difficulties depending on how good you are.
The game is also VERY forgiving. You can save almost wherever you are, making it a great platformer for beginners

OH YEAH THE STORY I FORGOT ABOUT THAT
Uhhhh it wasn't very noticeable, I guess you could find it heartwarming??? The game doesn't really try to engage you in the story and nor is there enough character development to feel anything. You SORT OF have to assume and make up the story in your head if you really want to feel the impact. 
Hopefully the sequel will handle the story better? I still haven't played at the time of writing this review.


Overall, it's a pretty mid game IN MY OPINION. If you're new to platformers it's a pretty good introduction to them. It's a simple and (debatably) easy platformer that is also very forgiving.

Do not get me wrong, because I liked the gameplay a lot. What I mean by 'horrifyingly hellish' is that the level design consists of so many different kinds of puzzles and traps that there is not a single one-for-all solution for the challenges presented in the game. Jumping and running without thinking won't help you no matter how many skills you unlock. You have to constantly observe situations and adapt accordingly, which is without a doubt a solid proof of the excellent craftsmanship of the developers. I can see that they are seriously committed to the best of the best gameplay experiences they can offer.

That being said, this game has pretty straight-forward, and fairly predictable storyline. The developers did their best to maximize the dramatic effect of the story with their supreme art style and excellent camerawork, but the story itself is nothing special. Maybe this was intentional because this simplicity of the writing makes the audience feel like reading a fairy tale. Still, it's a solid conclusion that they did not invest as much effort into the writing of this game.

If you are looking for a game featuring the greatest kind of Metroidvania gameplay experience with stunning visuals, I recommend this game without a moment's hesitation. If you are someone just wanting to chill out and relax, go find some other game.

The story follows Ori and Naru living a quiet, undisturbed life somewhere deep in the forest of Nibel. Once the forest [strike]starts dying[/strike] goes blind and does not bear fruit anymore, Ori leaves his only family and embarks on a journey to save the magical woods. While he makes new friends, he does also brave many dangers and the game’s main antagonist - Kuro. 
The game has a few cutscenes. Sein is guiding our character through the game and the narrator that is supposed to be the light-god I guess, gives the broader context of the world. But beside him and Sein speaking in their funky language that is just subtitled on the screen, there is not much dialogue. Even if it’s just a few cutscenes and the story is not that long, the careful combination of music and aesthetic makes the way how it is presented a very beautiful plot. 
While ultimately the story revolves around the idea of maternal love, I also view it as a parallel to good and bad. One of the interpretations of the Yin-Yang motive you can make is that even in the absolute evil you will find a crumb of good and vice versa. The idea that the darkness is evil and the light is good loses its meaning once given proper context and perspective. 

Ori’s moveset starts with simple jumps, but with time it evolves into a very dynamic and flexible system. While the game doesn’t do anything too original besides the bash, an ability letting you bounce off enemies and their projectiles in whatever direction you want resetting your double jump, the quality of all the moves and how you can chain them in combos makes platforming with Ori very enjoyable. The game rewards skill and thoughtful usage of its moveset. 
Throughout the map you can find several types of collectibles – life cells, energy cells as well as experience and free ability points. The skill tree branches into 3 paths – combat, utility and efficiency. Leveling and unlocking the new abilities is fun and useful. 
In terms of combat, it starts with this weak flame homing-missile attack. Progressing through the game rewards you with stomp and charge jump. Once you unlock these the game encourages you to mix those attacks together in explosive combos, because the basic attack, even if upgraded, can take too long to kill the endgame enemies. 

The game looks amazing, the hand-painted environments, playing with colors and shadows makes this production a very aesthetic and eye-pleasing experience. Any screenshot of this game could be my wallpaper. 
The sound design has the proper oompf!, you can feel the power surging when you level up or smite the enemies or stomp your way forward. But the game’s score is something else. I needed to look up a fancy, new word to describe the music for that game – and it’s [b][i]amazeballs[/i][/b] it seems. It’s a great part of this production’s identity and success. It complements the aesthetic and story of this game perfectly. Fav tracks would be [i]Up the Spirit Caverns Walls[/i], [i]Returning to the Spirit Tree[/i] and [i]Light of Nibel[/i] as it is the ending theme of course. 

The definitive edition adds two new areas to explore and two new abilities for you to utilize. Additionally, it makes some quality-of-life improvements and adds some general polish to the game. 

I can for sure say that Ori and the Blind Forest is one of the most beautiful games I’ve ever played. Its picturesque graphics, amazing soundtrack, moving story and enjoyable platforming make this production worth playing for everyone. The game’s level of quality shows itself on every front, with every aspect of the game being at least very good. You can really feel talented hearts put into this work. 
Also it seems like a good starter for somebody new to video games. Engaging, easy to learn-hard to master and it does not require some crazy tier hardware.",1708469206,1708469289,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

These levels required dozens of attempts for me and it spoiled my overall enjoyment of the game - especially the final level, where after I finally beat it, my feeling was simply thank **** that's over, and I didn't connect with the games ending at all because of that, and I won't be replaying it.",1708463411,1708463411,False,2,0,0.502074718475341797,0,True,False,False

I also bought the bundle which comes with both the sequel and the definitive edition of blinding forest.

Things Ori did better than Hollow knight-
1. Movement: the movement in this game is very smooth and enjoyable, and the game uses it to great extent.

2. graphics: although hollow knight has great stylized graphics, this game overall looks great,

3. Platforming: the game has great movement and it also uses the great movement in boss fights, most of the boss fights in this game are heavily platforming focused. a lot like the game Celeste. 

4. Puzzles: Hollow knight lacked a lot of puzzles, which this game has a lot. There are a few puzzles that just get annoying after a while but at least they have puzzles. 
----------
Things Hollow knight did better than Ori and the blinding forest,
-combat: overall in terms of combat the game was lacking and hollow knight easily takes combat

-world building: I think the world is great and has wasted potential. the world is easily 2x the size of hollow knight but some areas simply seem dead and nothing seems to be going on in the areas.

-enemy variation: the enemy variation is very lacking, most of the time different regions just have re-skinned versions of previous enemy you encounter.

Game Length- now its no question that this game is shorter than hollow knight, and I don't think there was any way they could make the game as long as hollow knight, but I beat the game in about 13 hours with 70% completion. I was missing a great sum of hp and the blue things. I also missed 2 abilitys somehow? which my friend pointed out. A dash would have been helpful. 

------
should you buy this game? 
- yea, it satisfied me for the most part, the game lacks combat but is overall a way more chill and laid back experience compared to hollow knight, 
-I would also buy the bundle, although I have not played the second game, I think it is a overall upgrade compared to blinding forest, although I have not played will of the wisps yet.

From its breathtaking visuals to its emotionally resonant storytelling, every aspect of this game is crafted with care and attention to detail.

First and foremost, let's talk about the visuals. The hand-painted art style is absolutely stunning, with vibrant colors and lush environments that draw you into the world of Nibel. Every frame of this game feels like a work of art, and it's clear that a lot of love went into creating each and every pixel.

But Ori and the Blind Forest isn't just a pretty face – it also has a compelling story to tell. The narrative follows Ori, a small guardian spirit, as they embark on a quest to save their home from an encroaching darkness. Along the way, they'll encounter a cast of memorable characters, each with their own motivations and struggles. The story is told primarily through visual storytelling and environmental cues, which adds an extra layer of depth to the experience.

Of course, no discussion of Ori and the Blind Forest would be complete without mentioning its gameplay. At its core, this is a platformer with Metroidvania elements, and it excels in both departments. The controls are tight and responsive, allowing for precise movement and platforming challenges that are both challenging and rewarding. The addition of abilities that can be unlocked and upgraded as you progress adds a layer of depth to the gameplay, giving you new ways to traverse the environment and overcome obstacles.

But perhaps the most impressive thing about Ori and the Blind Forest is its emotional impact. This is a game that knows how to tug at your heartstrings, with moments of joy, sorrow, and everything in between. The relationship between Ori and their adoptive mother, Naru, is particularly touching, and there were more than a few moments that brought a tear to my eye.

In conclusion, Ori and the Blind Forest is a truly special game that deserves all the praise it has received and more. Its stunning visuals, compelling story, and tight gameplay come together to create an experience that is as unforgettable as it is beautiful. If you haven't had the chance to experience it for yourself, I highly recommend giving it a try – you won't be disappointed.",1708342899,1708342899,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I own both Ori titles on Steam, Xbox and Switch and have all the achievements for the first game on the last two platforms which just leaves the Steam version and I'll get to that one of these days. The point is Ori and the Blind Forest is a solid Metroidvania that has pretty much everything I want from the genre, a beautifully realized world with adorable and lovable characters and wonderful traversal mechanics as you explore and unravel the mysteries of the forest. Overall Ori as a character and as an IP means a lot to me and about the only negative thing I can say about this game is that the combat can be a bit repetitive though there are more options than people often realize. If you like Metroidvanias with quick and nimble movement and are into the more fantasy and magic oriented setting I would definitely recommend giving Ori a shot though as I established at the beginning I would probably recommend it to everyone anyway.

this game is great. i wish it had a larger world or a longer experience with more to offer.
the visuals and audio design are seriously amazing. there are optional major powerups (FUCK YES NON LINEAR EXPERIENCES), lots of cool secrets to find and the story is very heartwarming.

i kind of dislike the way the save system works (having to spend resources to save only makes the early game more annoying, it's a completely irrelevant feature later on) and some of the sections (ginso tree water section for instance) send u back quite far when u fail while also disabling the ability to save, which can be frustrating

There's a number of incredibly glaring game design flaws in this original, but the biggest one of them all is the lack of auto-saves. In a game that is all about surviving hazardous environments. To save your game you need to get and use Energy to create a manual save point on the map. Obtained this one item but made a wrong step or got hit by a stray mob projectile? Have fun doing everything **again** from where you last saved and acquiring it again - or going out of your way to find an energy cell somewhere so that you can create another save point further ahead. And believe me, you need a save a **lot** - everything either hurts like a truck or one-shots. You can easily get stuck in one segment for hours upon hours because you have a save point with 1hp in the middle of another endless corridor of one-shot hazards.

Only 2 small gripes with it:

1.) Jumping, and especially double jump, are disappointing and pathetic.  That said, the game gives you some really cool alternative ways to gain latitude, arguably much cooler than double jumping.

2.) A small issue with the story.  Overall the story is great, but this one decision the writers made kinda irks me.  Still enjoyed it and would recommend.  Spoilers ahead: [spoiler] Ori's caretaker/friend dies at the start of the game, and is later resurrected.  The death is hilariously silly, but I think the authors were trying to make it serious.  Basically, this creature couldn't go 10 minutes without eating, and despite having tons of fat reserves starves to death while Ori is taking a nap.  As for the resurrection, it just happens perfectly.  NO downsides, no costs.  Don't like this kind of resurrection in stories because it cheapens any deaths that might happen.

Pros:
+ Very beautiful landscapes

+ Well optimized
+ 'Cute' story and main characters
+ It rewards exploration with many power-ups which give access to new skills
+ Character can be customized. Game can be finished with just the basic skills, but some upgraded skills may be quite useful.

Cons:
- Most puzzles are easy, but some details are easy to miss and you may get stuck in front of something without knowing exactly what to do (this is different that knowing what to do but getting constantly killed in the process. That happens, too, but that's not an issue for me)

Introduction to this game is just amazing, and I thought this game would offer interesting story, but soon it became clear to me that gameplay is what this game is about.

You play as some unknown creature and your goal is to help the Spirit tree recover three light elements: water, wind and warmth of the forest Nibel, where game takes the place. There is not much to say about the story, it's pretty simple, but I thought ending was done done well and it's pretty sad. The beginning of this game is also pretty emotional.

Gameplay wise this game is great. Combat mostly consists of simple attack which is like an orb that you shoot at your enemies, and also you have charge attack. There are also some other ways to attack the enemy, but I mostly just used the basic attack. Enemies aren't hard, and I played on hard difficulty and there are no bosses in the game, so combat wise this game is fine, suitable for this type of game. However, platforming is the strongest point of this game. Through the game you will unlock many different abilities, like climbing the wall, double jump, gliding through the air and so on. Platforming was really fun to me, and there were some really hard looking sequences, but most of them didn't feel like challenge thanks to these awesome abilities. Even though this is metroidvania, I never felt like I needed to go back and collect stuff which I couldn't before, because the game isn't hard, so you don't really need to go back. One ""unique"" thing about this game is how you save the game. Aside from some main events where game will automatically be saved, most of the time you will save by filling your blue orbs, which are used for charge attacks and saving, and then spending one of these orbs to generate a save point. Once the save is done, you can come back to this save location to save as many times as you want, or just create save location somewhere else, but you can only have one save location at the time (previous one will dissappear as soon as new one is created). Blue orbs get filled while fighting enemies, breaking stuff etc. This save point is also used to upgrade your abilities. Overall gameplay is pretty good, and I enjoyed it.

I already mentioned that there are no bosses in this game, however there are 3 rush sequences which happen once you find one of the three light sources. As soon as you find them and press action that area will start falling apart and you will need to run for your life. Those sequences were the best parts of the game for me, and they were done really well. Epic music during them helps too. The world is beautiful and not too big, just how I like it. Game took me 10 hours to beat it. Music is also great.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
- Rush sequences are amazing
- Great gameplay
- Ending is done good, and it's pretty sad
- The world is beautiful

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
- The story is a bit confusing and barely there

[h1]Verdict:[/h1] I enjoyed my time playing this game, and even though at times you feel like game can get a bit repetitive, you get introduced with new abilities, so it helped the game to stay fresh. I think it's a pretty good game, but I can't say that beating this game filled me with desire to play the second game, especially since I heard that world is bigger, and I prefer games like this more linear.

Combat as well is horrendous.  Reduced to an auto target system that you simply mash an attack button and hope the game shoot what you want.  Evasion on part of the player is nigh impossible due to everything glowing with so much bloom it renders enemy projectiles near invisible.

The game looks and sounds (not a huge fan of this melodramatic fantasy fairy tale music, but it's well done) great. The graphics detail and animations are worth of a movie.
But the character movement absolutely kills this game. It's so sluggish, there's a one second delay in jumping and moving that breaks everything I want to do. 
From trying to land in a little platform (SO FRUSTRATING to have to waste time in such a simple thing traversing the map, it's probably one of the worst movements I've played in a supposedly perfect game), to trying to avoid the super fast attacks and projectiles from enemies. 
It's just horrible and it absolutely frustrating because I'd really love to play this game further and see all the beautiful sceneries, but it's just such a pain..
Everything else seems to be just top quality, but a metroidvania platformer with bad movement is just a bad joke for me. 

First review:
Well, again the Steam rating system is a misleading and useless one.
Here we have a beautiful production, that out of question. Beautiful graphics, sound (nothing special or new, though) and animations.
But what is this? A Metroidvania platformer with frustrating movement, 8 jumps out of 10 you'll be short or the character will run off the small platform when you're trying to get him in the centre, it's so annoying that something so simple is so hard to do, it pisses me off.
So, the very core of the game is a platformer where the character can't jump or move little bits properly. That's a fail from my point of view.
I see how it's hard to give this game a thumbs down, is not a bad game, but I don't find it fun, and Metroidvania is one of my favourite genres, but I get frustrated often enough to leave the game before I get to 2 hs straight play. 
I wish Steam would change the score system to points and allow the users to be specific on what they like and what they don't just rating aspects of the game, besides leaving a long explanation on a review and a Like/dislike system, it's absolutely obsolete.",1584903012,1707073735,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The platforming game play in this game is great, however it is clear that the combat isn't supposed to be a selling point of this game as it is very simple and fairly unsatisfying. This isn't a huge issue as all of the ""bosses"" in this game are platforming based and does not use combat, however a little more effort into combat would make this game a 10/10. Will of the wisps however fixes this issue, with much better combat as it is a more combat focused game and even better music and world. This is why I highly recommend you play will of the wisps after this game as it is a much better game overall, and builds upon the brilliant story of ori and the blind forest.

As a metroidvania, its a pretty linear one, and it doesnt have many moments where you NEED an ability from later on an early game area to progress, as most of the times, it just holds an ability/health/energy cell and thats it.

And while the combat kind of sucks, since all you can really do is just hammer M1 and spam stomp to kill shit, the moveset is where this game shines the most, while sure, the floaty controls may be disorienting at first if you're coming from a precise platformer, you WILL get used to it at some point, and once you do that and get Bash, man, pulling bash chains is just dopamine generator, and when you pair it with the Light Burst, there's not a SINGULAR area you can't just fly over to if you know what you're doing.

The only real critism I have towards this game (outside of the combat) is the insta-kills, since most dont really have a need to be instants, and its kind of annoying when you're running around with like 13 life cells collected and just fucking die because your pinky toe touched a laser.

Also the save system, while interesting, since it makes you choose between having access to things like Light Burst or not be sent like 3 years back after dying, can be kind of hard to get used to since most games just auto-save. For those struggling with this, if you see an area with a lot of lava, spikes or those lasers on a timer, just save, especially early on where you wont have many ways of using energy anyways, its risk reward system also becomes moot when you backtrack and collect a bunch of energy cells so you can also do that.",1706590744,1706590744,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Developed by Moon Studios and published by Microsoft Studios, this game stands out not only for its breathtaking visuals but also for its compelling narrative and engaging gameplay.

From the moment you embark on Ori's adventure, the game envelops you in a lush and vibrant forest filled with enchanting creatures and a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack. The hand-drawn art style is nothing short of spectacular, creating a picturesque environment that feels alive with every pixel. The attention to detail is evident in every frame, making Ori and the Blind Forest a true work of art.

The narrative is a poignant tale of friendship, sacrifice, and resilience. The game introduces players to Ori, a guardian spirit, and his journey to save the dying forest from impending doom. The emotional weight of the story is conveyed through minimalistic yet powerful storytelling, making it easy for players to connect with the characters on a deep level.

The gameplay mechanics are well-crafted, blending tight platforming with a cleverly designed progression system. As Ori gains new abilities, the world opens up, revealing hidden paths and secrets that encourage exploration. The platforming challenges are both exhilarating and challenging, requiring precision and quick reflexes. The balance between difficulty and satisfaction is finely tuned, ensuring that each triumph feels earned.

The game also features a unique checkpoint system that allows players to create their own save points, adding a strategic element to the gameplay. While the difficulty may pose a challenge at times, the sense of accomplishment upon overcoming obstacles is immensely rewarding.

The musical score, composed by Gareth Coker, deserves special mention. The evocative melodies enhance the emotional impact of the narrative, creating a truly immersive experience. The combination of visuals, storytelling, and music forms a harmonious trifecta that elevates Ori and the Blind Forest to a level of artistic brilliance rarely seen in video games.

Ori and the Blind Forest is a masterfully crafted game that transcends the boundaries of its genre. It offers a visual and emotional experience that is both enchanting and memorable. Whether you're a fan of platformers or simply appreciate the artistry of video games, Ori and the Blind Forest is a must-play title that leaves a lasting impression. 7.5/10",1706384685,1706384685,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is a must play game that is worth more than its price. As soon as I saw the trailer for this game, I immediately knew I had to buy this. Everything about this game simply makes this a masterpiece. The different difficulty levels allows anyone to enjoy the game regardless of skill. Mechanics wise, many of the skills are fun to use and there are some puzzles that really makes the most of the environment.

The game doesn't take very long to beat, and the story is rather simple. But in the relatively few hours that Ori takes to beat, the game gives an unforgettable and beautiful experience. Within 5 minutes of opening the game, I was already invested in the characters, and by the time I beat the game, I was sobbing very hard. It's such a touching story!

This game has the most ethereal visuals and music. The title screen music is enough to give anybody chills, and the soundtrack is just. I wish I could play this game again for the first time just to re-experience hearing the music for the first time. Pure art.

In this game instead, you can't access certain areas yet, mostly because you don't possess skills like a double jump)
+ beautiful environments and music (though I sometime couldn't distinguish background and foreground)
+ fun and diverse ways to deal with enemies
+ game is not at all repetitive, especially because it is a <10h game

- before unlocking multiple skills the gameplay is quite boring 
- sometimes there'd be an event where you have to escape from something and basically ace a parkour in a certain amount of time. This parkour is often very long and if you die, you have to start from the beginning of the whole parkour, which can be quite frustrating

Summary: If you like Metroidvanias, then this game is a must. Otherwise I'd still suggest at least trying it, since I enjoyed it as well.",1705701260,1705701260,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The gameplay and movement also feel great, with each ability being unique and open up so many oportunities across the map the more you progress.
My only gripe with the game is that a lot of deaths feel out of one's control, maybe its because of unresponsive keys, maybe its because of the inconsistent gravity, or maybe im just bad at the game, who knows.

It reminds me of Metroid series. There is a lot of back-tracking when getting new specials to collect things previously inaccessible areas. You can save often, which is nice, because there is a lot of dying. There is a lot of instant kill rooms that need to be done a certain way. Some areas were frustrating. Re-spawning is quick to try again. Overall I like the game and played it to the end. It took me 10 hours to beat as a casual player. 

The graphics are very bright and look great. My main complaint would be projectiles are often lost in the bright graphics. Your character is shooting their sparks and the enemy is shooting their sparks. It is difficult to dodge because you can't see what is happening with all the flare. I had to predict if there is another shot hidden in the explosions because I really couldn't see it. And most enemies in the game have projectiles so this was an issue throughout the entire game.

The game is a 2D platformer. There is a background and foreground plane for nice visuals. But a few times I was unable to differentiate the play field from the art. Like there were some lava waterfalls that block passage as a game mechanic. But one or two lava waterfalls were foreground elements and I didn't know I would walk behind it. There are spikes everywhere in the game. Some just hurt you, other ones are instant kill. I still cannot tell the difference even after finishing the game. Many times spikes were difficult to see and I walked right into them. The foreground layer hid a lot of spikes. The traps in the game were often unclear because the graphics are so busy.",1705271195,1705272580,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While this is a fun game, it’s not really what I think of when I think of metroidvania.  Ori and the Blind Forest is extremely linear, both in level design and progression. I never felt like I had to look at my map top figure out where to go next and I never unlocked a new ability that made me go “I can use this to to get past that obstacle I saw 2 zones ago”. In fact, I don’t think I ever felt the need to go back to previous zones. To me, backtracking, non-linear design, where upgrades are exciting because you know exactly where to use them in a previous zone is a staple of the metroidvania genre, but I am by no means an expert, so maybe I am just misinformed.

Ignoring my metroidvania complaint, what you do get is a decent linear platforming game. Ori controls well, the world is quite good looking, but combat sucks and there are sections that feel very badly designed. To start with, the combat auto targets with no way to manually target, so its just you spamming attack while dodging enemy projectiles. It’s extremely simple. While most of the areas were fine and some even provided a fun challenge, there were a small hand full of sections that relied of memorizing environmental patterns through trial an error with no saving or checkpoints for decently long stretches of time. These sections could feel quite frustrating, but luckily there were not too many of them.

Overall, I did have fun with Ori and the Blind Forest, but I do not think it lives up to the hype. Still, I enjoyed my time with it and would say I had fun, so considering you can pick this up for a fiver, I’m still going to recommend it.

So to get the confusion out of the way: Yes the game does a lot of things right and it's well done for it's audience.
The art and the music are an easy drawing point, obviously gorgeous.

The movement of Ori feels good, but has the kind of acceleration that Sonic has. Looking at the included early prototypes it makes much more sense. It looks a lot like Sonic or similar games that focus on platforming. So if you keep pushing you'll accelerate your jump. Movement in general has a sort of momentum which makes it fun to run around. On the other side of that is the problem that precise jumping and sometimes seriously minimal margins for error and such a control scheme don't really go that well together.

Generally I'd fault the margins that you have to make mistakes one of the worst points of the game. The balancing doesn't scale well either. Either they wanted to have spikes to make players stop midgame and sort out scrubs who don't deserve to get the ending or they just were bad at testing.

Another thing is the huge arsenal of jumps and movement options you have.Jump, double jump, loaded jump, projectile deflecting jump, dash, mid-air dash, float. Not sure if I didn't forget some. You might think that that would be great as you have various options for solving the jumping puzzles. Yeah, sorta. But it means that you stomp a barrier, jump, dash, double jump, float, projectile deflect, wall grab, load jump and float with projectile jumps again. It's as if the designers couldn't decide which of those fancy movement patterns they should keep when they made their first prototypes and kept them all in. I don't remember any game that has 5 dedicated jump buttons that have further variants due to where and how you trigger them. It makes for quite some useless complexity.

When you play this game, you need to be aware what it offers. If you like getting chased by a boulder and have to figure out where to jump (which means you die a lot while figuring out where to go), then Ori got you covered. If you don't like to die 15 times to some strange falling rock because you missed one projectile to jump up from, don't play this game. Mind inconsistencies as well: there is a lava rain that you avoid while moving upwards. You still need to go further upwards, but suddenly, there is nothing to be fast enough anymore. Did the lava blobs work for jumping from them earlier? No. Do the work now? Yes. Why? Well, they are smaller now! Random rule-changes like that are really common as well. Often it's trial and error what is background and what is dangerous foreground. Looks great, but isn't very readable - specially since the design changes quite often. The developers see that as offering variation, but readability of obstacles should not be sacrificed in my opinion.

I did expect a bit more from the story as well. It's cute, don't get me wrong. It's rare enough to see protective mothers take the main stage, so that's a positive. The story is just a lot like the game: evoke some mood, then there follows some action. The action made rarely sense to me. It is cute though and therefore enjoyable.

So generally the game is quite hard mostly due to being unfair. If you like to bash your head against a wall until it breaks, or kaizo traps in general, it might be one of the entry point games with a beautiful world and high production value. To me, those design patterns are awful - and even after completing the challenge there is no relief or feeling of a win left. It's a game held in high regard, but I'll be very cautious to recommend it to anyone. I can see that happening, but in general I'd recommend to search for alternatives.",1704811633,1704811633,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Lore/Storytelling: Compared to other games I have played/reviewed in the past, the story-line lacks depth, however it makes it quite easy and simple to understand. For me, I actually enjoy this ""easy-to-understand"" style of storytelling, when compared to similar games such as Hollow Knight (which I kinda never understood). Since others may find it too simplistic, it ranks about average - 6.5/10. 

Art/Design: AMAZING!!! Stunning visuals, which feel smooth and flush. Due to the ""high resolution"" nature of the game (not pixelated), it makes it seem more 3-d and more of a modern game. The use of color is perfect, and the colors are quite saturated/powerful in nature, resulting in the game standing out more. Even if the game is quite old, it still holds its own as my singular favorite ""eye pleasing"" metroidvania game - 10/10.

Game-play: Decent would be the word for the game-play. The exploring aspect of the game is decent, albeit a little overdone (similar things over and over again), while the mechanical aspect of the game is better. It includes similar movement abilities to other metroidvania games, with the use of wall jumps, dashs, etc. I found that the movement was decently flush, however there were too many different skills/controls for my liking (Also, the dash was kinda wonky, imo). The flow of the game was amazing, with the difficulty progressively getting harder at a linear rate, resulting in the game always feeling challenging to play. Lastly, the game in my opinion is WAY TOO SHORT! I always explore all regions, and it still only took me less than 10 hours total. Taking everything into account, the game play ranks at a 6/10.

Final Score: 7/10
Decent/Meh metroidvania, with some flaws mainly in the gameplay region, resulting in a lower score. Honestly, the art style of the game absolutely carries the game itself, and without it, the game would rank horribly. 
Probably wouldn't play again, however I will be writing a review on its squeal soon! (""Ori and the Will of the Wisps""), and hopefully it ranks higher.",1703740134,1704769761,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It fails to be a metroidvania and a 2D platformer. While you do find new abilities in each area, there is no reason to backtrack as the upgrades from backtracking are useless. The platforming doesn't get good until the very end once you have unlocked all the abilities, early to mid game you either don't have any cool abilities yet or you have to carry a heavy orb which strips you of all your cool abilities.
Even if it wasn't sold as a platforming rich metroidvania, it still isn't a very good game. The combat is pointless, you just tap x and a floating orb shoots things for you. All the bosses are platforming set pieces so the combat doesn't matter anyway. There is only 1 mini boss enemy but its incredibly easy, it just has lots of health (press x lots of times while walking left and right).
The save system is awful, you have to create checkpoints yourself. In a first play through, you will forget to save many times, losing you a lot of progress which would be avoided with auto save or physical checkpoints.
The tech tree adds nothing to the game, it simply serves to make the combat, platforming and secret hunting more bearable.
I don't think the visuals are as noteworthy as some others seem to think. They can sometimes make it hard to differentiate spikes and platforms, especially when wall jumping - a touch too far will get Ori impaled on the tiniest grey thorn, other times you can walk through a pit of spikes without a scratch. The backgrounds can also interfere sometimes in the same way.
The story is a joke. A forest creature is dying, Ori says ""I am the Lorax, i speak for the trees."", then the forest creature is magically revived by tree energy. This is then repeated throughout the game.
I don't understand how this game is so overrated, but I am glad it is, as otherwise it wouldn't have got a sequel. The only redeeming feature of this game is the 'bash' platforming ability but its also in the second game too, Ori and the will of the wisps, which is so much better than this game in every way.

Ori and the Blind Forest is a game that I've known for the longest time but never gotten around to playing - until now. And while my first impression of it was very strong, that initial reaction slowly waned and fluctuated as I continued to play. That's not to say I didn't enjoy it. I certainly did, but overall, I'd say Ori and The Blind Forest had the potential to be a lot better than I expected. It's visually stunning, fun, and annoying all at the same time. My thoughts in more detail: 

[h2] The Positives ▼ [/h2]

[b] 1. The Art [/b]
The most impressive thing about Ori and the Blind Forest has got to be its strong visual and artistic direction. Despite releasing in 2016, it hasn't aged a day, and I'm confident it will continue to look timeless for decades to come. Never have I ever played a game that looks more like a painting in motion, and considering this is the very first game Moon Studios has ever made, I can't imagine how much better it's going to look once I move on to Will of the Wisps.

[b] 2. Great Soundtrack [/b]
Aside from the incredible art direction, another aspect that stuck with me long after I finished the game was its beautiful OST. It does a fantastic job of setting the mood and atmosphere of a scene, situation, and location. It's the backbone behind many emotionally hard-hitting moments, and I can't praise it enough. 

[b] 3. Enemy Variety [/b]
One of the things I appreciate most about Ori is the respectable amount of variation when it comes to enemies. Overall, there are around ten unique kinds of foes, each with distinctive looks and strengths that force players to adapt and use different evasive strategies when approaching them. Because of this, it helps to prevent the gameplay from ever feeling too stale and repetitive.

[h2] The Average ▼ [/h2]

[b] 1. The Action [/b]
Ori and the Blind Forest is an Action Platformer, and while the platforming held up its part of the bargain, I can't say the same about the action. Truthfully, it's not that mechanically exciting or engaging to play. And most combat encounters, especially in the early game, can be won by mindlessly spamming the attack button or some slight variations of it. It's serviceable and decent enough, but it's nothing to write home about. 

[b] 2. The Story [/b]
In general, I think the writers succeeded at what they set out to do, and that's to tell an emotional story about parental love and the pain that comes with losing those we care most about. However, it left me with some questions, especially regarding how certain things in the world of Ori work. Even after reading multiple wikis, I'm still just as confused, and I can't deny that it certainly did take some enjoyment out of the experience. If you're wondering what those questions are, I'll post them below, so unless you've finished the game, don't look. 

 [spoiler] The Spirit Tree is supposed to act as the caretaker of the forest. Why release a fatal flash of light if it means killing dozens of innocent forest-dwelling animals? [/spoiler]

 [spoiler] We learned that Ori isn't the only member of his species. Why does it matter so much to the spirit tree if one goes missing? How is that a valid reason to release that deadly flash of light? I could understand if he were the last of his kind and the spirit tree was desperate enough to trade dozens of lives for his, but that wasn't the case. [/spoiler]

 [spoiler] How does Gumo know where to look for Naru to revive her? He conveniently showed up despite never knowing her location. [/spoiler]

 [h2] The Negatives ▼ [/h2]

[b] 1. Annoying Level Design [/b]

Pretty much every fault that I find annoying about Ori and the Blind Forest, in one way or another, ends up having to do with its level designs: Unsatisfying to explore, trial and error gameplay, and environmental hazards. 

‣ Let's talk about what I believe to be the game's biggest flaw: It's just not as satisfying to explore as it should be. Allow me to explain why. Exploration is a crucial part of the gameplay loop of Ori and what makes it so fun. It's the driving method by which players collect items and upgrade their many stats. However, these items are almost always locked behind some obstacle that prevents players from getting them unless they have unlocked a specific ability needed to solve the problem. While this design choice is normally appropriate when done in moderation, the problem in Ori is that it feels lopsided. When I explore an area, it feels like, constantly, I'm running into items that I cannot obtain at least half of the time, if not more. All it does is create unnecessary and excessive backtracking, make exploration unrewarding, and encourage players to wait until the very late game to begin fully exploring the map rather than during. This dichotomy is the epitome of blue-balled level designs, and it's annoying. 

‣ Another aspect of the level design that I found annoying is how it progressively got more trial and error as time went on. There were many times when you, as the player, would simply die because you had no idea what to anticipate. Falling down and not knowing there are spikes at the bottom, Kuro slamming into a cavern and causing rocks to fall on you, etc. It's moments like these when players would have no idea what to predict or anticipate and are given next to no reaction time to evade danger, are annoying and make every death feel less about your lack of skill as a player and more to do with the game creating an unfair situation where dying feels almost a requirement before one knows what to do. 

‣ I kept the least impactful issue for last, and it has to do with how [u] some [/u] of the environmental hazards just don't do a good enough job contrasting against the rest of the background, thus making it very easy to get hurt by them on accident. And for anybody playing on hard like I did, the problem only gets worse because these hazards often deal insane damage to your HP, and sometimes, there are environmental hazards that will just outright kill you in one hit. Keep this problem aware in your mind, and you'll be surprised by how often you'll get screwed by it. 

[h3] My Final Thoughts [/h3]
Despite my problems with Ori and the Blind Forest, I believe it remains a worthwhile experience. It's a good game, albeit with some rough edges, but one that I still think has a lot of entertainment and artistry to offer to the players. I recommend considering Ori and the Blind Forest on your list of games to buy once it goes on sale.",1702736810,1704414344,True,26,1,0.77570420503616333,0,True,False,False

Ori and the Blind Forest is a visual treat of a Metriodvania that is a tad limited due to it's simplified map and it's art style in game play. Ori also has a story that got me thinking about it's themes more than I thought I would, which is a testament to how it tells it's plot over the course of the ~10 hour runtime.

While really appealing to the eyes, the visual style in game play through me off a bit. Something about Ori's frames and animations made the game hard to follow sometimes. This doubled for some enemies as well; it wasn't clear sometimes what could or could not hurt me due to the colors, particles, and how the background and foreground meshed together. By the end of the game I got mostly used to it and by no means did it ruin the experience. The visuals should be seen as a positive, as they are absolutely gorgeous. Even playing this in 2024, there is no clear comparison. Each area has visual identity due to the wide variety of colors used, with the game even going as far as to not re-use background elements. 

While the game is pitched as a Metroidvania, it feels much more like a linear platformer in terms of it's progression. To me, part of the fun of the Metroid titles is the piecing together of the map utilizing both your new abilities and knowledge. Instead, Ori and the Blind Forest points you right where you need to go. There is no real mental ""mapping"" step that occurs when piecing the map together. The only time I needed to note places to return to was for upgrades, not story or mandatory progression. 

Some smaller cool things of note is it's checkpoint and upgrade system. Checkpoints are made by you, created using a resource in the game. There aren't too many abilities competing for that resource, so I never felt like the mechanic was explored to it's full potential, but it still was a neat idea. The interesting thing that I found in Ori's upgrade system is that by the end of the game, I was maybe only 3/4 through all the upgrades. This made choices throughout the game more meaningful as I knew I wouldn't obtain enough resources to fully flesh out the upgrade tree without farming. I like that, wish more games followed that lesson. 

Overall, it's a solid Metroidvania I would recommend to anyone, even those that aren't particularly invested in the genre.

I can enjoy hunting hidden extras, but the way difficulty in Ori works makes health upgrades unsatisfying. You've gotten more health? Good job. The same set of enemies with a different colour to the last do three damage this time. Even spikes work like this. 
This attempt at scaling difficulty is so transparent and uninteresting (contrast with how Axiom Verge introduces new enemy types and reuses old ones in interesting ways) that I question whether it's worth including at all. If you're gonna reuse the same few enemies anyway, why not forgo player-upgrades so you don't need to buff enemies? If anything there'll be players drawn to this sort of beautifully rendered game who'd find concept art and the like more rewarding for reaching hidden goodies.

Regrettably, there are also problems with the escapes concluding dungeons.
I can understand making them peaks of drama and difficulty, but the result is frustrating and tiring. If anything it reminded me of the soulsborne experience. In Dark Souls after every failed attempt at a boss you're returned to your last bonfire. Sure, sometimes the run back to the boss is more long and annoying than necessary, but you get that breathing space before it's back to rolling for your life to epic music.
Meanwhile Ori does not give you that breathing space. The escapes are sprints and with each failed attempt you're just back at the start with the music still going strong. That's why it feels tiring. The difficulty makes breaks necessary, but there isn't a natural place to take one. The music loses any feeling of awe as you (well, the likes of me anyhow) struggle to overcome the same obstacles.

If you can overlook these flaws then Ori and the Blind Forest is lovely. But they impacted my experience to the extent that I cannot.",1704022924,1704022924,False,1,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Unfortunately, the grindy and annoying game mechanics gradually wear away any enjoyment I was getting from my first impressions. 

As mentioned, the game is visually beautiful, and the definitive edition really shines. The environments, characters, and effects are all designed with a compelling and consistent art style. The animations are also wonderful and full of character.

Unfortunately, the art style is SO consistent, it makes visually parsing the environment extremely difficult. Determining the difference between an environmental hazard and background decoration is a bit of a learning curve, leading to a lot of unpleasant surprises. 

This game is also full of a LOT of sudden, cheap, and unavoidable deaths. Many areas rely on you having died before and knowing what's coming. Personally, I'm not a fan of that type of 'tutorial'. The save system is very manual, and you need to spend energy on saves, so if you are either low on energy or forgetful, these cheap deaths can set you back pretty far. 

This game also has a metroid-vania style world that you can traverse freely, but will need to come back to areas after unlocking abilities that allow further progression. This is fine for the most part, but enemies respawn immediately upon leaving an area, meaning you will have to fight through the same group of enemies multiple times just to get from A to B. 

The enemy respawning and non-linear progression also makes it difficult to figure out where you need to go next, re-killing the same enemies over and over are you wader around aimlessly. Some people might like this style, but it feels like a frustrating waste of my time. 

If you really like metroid-vanias, then this game might be for you. Personally, the gameplay is more frustrating than fun, and the nice aesthetics aren't enough to overcome it.",1703975618,1703975618,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've played it all the way through at least twice at this point and I can easily see myself  playing it through every other year or so. It's just a spectacular game and I'll outline my reasons for saying so below. As of this review I have logged just over 40 hours, have of course played the second one (Will of the Wisps) and for reference I play on PC and enjoy other games such as Terraria, Hollow Knight (although I never finished that), Spyro, Gris, and Kena Bridge of Spirits. 

1) Game-play is fantastic. And I mean this in every sense. No where is the game clunky, glitchy, or buggy (at least not in my experience). Movement and platforming are extremely smooth and not frustrating (when it was frustrating it was only a skill issue not a game issue). You progressively learn more skills that you can mix and match to fit your play-style and different combat situations. Combat itself is challenging but if you've been playing the way the game teaches you to play and use  your abilities appropriately it's not overly challenging (punishing combat is why I didn't finish Hollow Knight for reference). 

2) Puzzles are just challenging enough and very rewarding. I love puzzles-platformers/games, I love finding secret collectibles and generally enjoy games where the main character is trying to make the world better or fix it from evil. Like the combat, the puzzles can be challenging however if you are learning the skills the game is trying to teach you usually they are self-explanatory and I don't recall having to watch many walkthroughs to figure things out (plus that takes the fun out of it). The Puzzles themselves are training for whatever combat you may need in that level or beyond and I think they do a fantastic job at preparing you for that. 

3) Like most - if not all - other reviews rave about, the atmosphere is incredible. Again, I mean this in every sense. The emotional story-telling is on point (I've cried every time). The level/map design is superb with every area so distinct and unique. And THE MUSIC. The music is absolutely incredible, and it also is unique per section of map which I love it's not just the same music the whole game. The game is so beautiful to look at and play, it's actually not annoying to run around at the end collecting everything and finding hidden places because it's just so pretty (yes, I'm a bit of a completionist and so I had to get that achievement😂).

Developed by Moon Studios and published by Microsoft Studios, released in 2015 for Windows and Xbox One, and later gracing the Nintendo Switch in 2019 through the further improved Definitive Edition, Ori and the Blind Forest captivated me throughout my 22-hour playthrough. For an overview, Ori and the Blind Forest is a 2D Metroidvania, a genre known for its focus on exploration, item collection, and backtracking to previously unreachable areas. You play as Ori, a delicate white spirit, and guided by Sein, the embodiment of the Forest's Spirit Tree, players embark on a story filled with challenging platforming and surprisingly complex puzzles. The game beautifully balances agility and precision as Ori navigates the lush world while Sein provides the means to battle foes and shatter obstacles with Spirit Flames. The most enthralling element is the stunning attention paid to the artwork that paints the environment of Nibel. Mahler explained, ""You see this tree in the background and this mushroom and this rock? That's the only place you'll ever see those assets."" What feels like endless gorgeous artworks paint the environment of the ancient forest world known as Nibel. This pairs with a simple but elegant story that made me tear up as the credits rolled, with the ethereal orchestral soundtrack composed by Gareth Coker (Halo Infinite, ARK: Survival Evolved). 

With the definitive edition comes behind-the-scenes filming the recording of the soundtracks, and seeing the live performances of these pieces really put into perspective the effort that went into making this game. It is no wonder it was nominated for best independent game. This is by far the most satisfying character to control I have experienced. Best played with a controller, platforming with Ori is enough to maintain the game's enjoyment alone. This is combined with numerous mechanics that all blend into what is the best platformer released for the modern system generation. One standout feature is the ""Soul Links"" save system, which allows players to save their progress at any point, provided they have collected enough energy cells. The scarcity of these cells forces players to be careful with their use, adding an extra layer of depth to the game.

Additionally, a simple but effective upgrade system lets players enhance Ori's abilities, making the journey more manageable as they progress. Newly unlocked powers align with the following unlocked areas: the ability to jump from forest lanterns. These are also present in the early area of Nibel but can only be accessed later to reward those who retrace their steps. This is further expanded upon in the definitive edition, adding 2 new areas that provide a deeper backstory to the character of Naru, along with 2 more abilities and the inclusion of the spirit wells, which give the ability to fast travel between areas. This reduces any slight tedium in backtracking. However, it does not make backtracking a fruitless effort for those who wish to refrain from using the wells. For a first playthrough, the story is an emotional story of reunion that genuinely brought a tear to my eye. The balance of the account to gameplay enables subsequent playthroughs to not be marred by the repetition of the story beats; it does not become **** overall; this game is absolutely unmissable.",1703739010,1703739010,True,8,0,0.642953753471374512,0,True,False,False

- Moving forward in this story is such a pain.
- Horrendous save system. (Why can't it have autosaves??) 
- Ori sometimes feels like moving a boulder or like moving on ice.

I truly wish that I would love this game, however I find it hard to love.

The art style, soundtrack and story is good but I find it frustrating to move around and actually play the game. Firstly the saves. It works on the fact, you can create save in a safe space that cost energy. Good... if it wasn't unintuitive to save the game manualy when platforming. I can't even count the times when I have covered great chunk of the game, died and then appeared half map across because I forgot this game does not have automatic saves. 

Doors that are energy locked cost energy, so it isn't just about how many energy balls you have collected but if you have managed to get there without spending energy. Together with having to manually save that cost energy it was frustrating to find gates that I could possibly past but I couldn't because of how it worked.

The shooting mechanic seems alright, however it takes so long to kill the enemies and there is no way how you can fight back at a close combat to knock the enemy off you if they are about to hit you. When you have flying enemies dashing at you, this becomes quite annoying.

The labyring misty woods felt wonky and horrendous to navigate through. 

And then there are the controls. Movement abilities should make you be able to cover more areas in the map. What they shouldn't be though is that getting them is necessary for Ori to be actually controllable. Before you get double jump it is pain to jump onto any platform that is just a few pixels too high for ory to climb on. Jumping on walls is hard and even when you get the double jump traversing through the world is such pain in the ass before you get bash ability that makes it at least somewhat playable.

If you want to play Ori, just play the sequel.",1703671413,1703671413,False,7,0,0.556512176990509033,0,True,False,False

Pros

World/Art design:  Ori's forest and its inhabitants are a visual feast. The meticulous artistry brings characters and settings to life, imbuing each place and stage with a distinct ambiance. The cold tribe emanates a sense of mystery and a haunting history, while the volcano exudes intensity. The exploration of the intriguing mom tribe is a highlight, showcasing a unique and captivating design.

Story and world changes: While the narrative follows a simple premise, it evolves into a compelling tale, centered around Ori's quest to reunite with their mother. The motivations of the main villain add a heartbreaking layer to the story. As the plot progresses, subtle changes in the environment, such as the purification of water, enhance the world's vibrancy and sense of life.

Escape sections: The game's pinnacle moments come during escape sections, offering a perfect blend of challenge and visual splendor. From cleansing water to floating out of the cold tribe and escaping the bird, these sequences are both visually stunning and audibly captivating. The cinematic and beautiful design of these segments elevates the gaming experience.

Music: Gareth Coker's musical composition deserves high praise, seamlessly complementing the game's theme and design. The soundtrack excels in delivering tranquility during serene moments, such as underwater sequences, and intensifying emotions during challenging sections like escape sequences. A remarkable job in enhancing the overall experience.

Mobility: While initially feeling a bit sluggish, Ori's mobility becomes a source of enjoyment as abilities are gained. Glide with the feather and navigate through enemies and projectiles, offering an interesting and entertaining mechanic. By the game's conclusion, the sense of accomplishment from mastering these abilities is truly satisfying.

Cons

Death and saving mechanics: The frustration lies in the dying process, especially during platforming sections with thorns. It's easy to succumb to these hazards, and the saving mechanic exacerbates the issue. While it's effortless to save frequently, it feels more like a chore than a strategic choice. A different approach, encouraging less frequent saves and more substantial retries, could enhance the overall experience.

Enemy design and Combat:  Combat lacks the engagement expected from a metroidvania. Although new abilities spice up the combat, the primary mechanic — the spirit flame — feels mundane. Dying easily during combat, combined with a lack of impact from hits, leads to a less satisfying combat experience. The enemies themselves lack excitement and prove more enjoyable to avoid than confront.

The story moments and cinematics are gorgeous, paired alongside soothing music (or intense when needed). The game play itself is honestly the weakest part of the game, but it doesn't mean it's terrible. The movement and platforming can feel really smooth at times, but I am not the biggest fan of the combat. The majority of combat is letting the attacks auto aim while you stand somewhat close to the enemy, jumping every once in a while to avoid their attack. Overall, it's a fun game that doesn't take too much time to complete.

Contrary to what some critics say, the scenery and platforms are perfectly obvious and we easily understand the element we can interact with. The scripted action scenes are just completely gripping. It's been a long time since I've been so emotionally involved in a game with pure mindblow moments. 

The difficulty level is well balanced if we take time to build-in the character power and we always know what to do even if precise instructions are not provided. 

There are a few negative points : 
1) only 10h to 100% the game and only 6 hours to finish the game (it definitely mean I loved this game if 6 hours lifetime is among the critics!)
2) The gameplay of the saving points. 

Point 2) was for me the most frustrating. This is really unusual in modern game that the player has to deal by themselves on the saving points. That being said, I am not sure developpers could have made it differently without affecting the game experience (that is amazing!). They even provided a healing mechanic with the save such that players have some ""interest"" to save regularly.

This frustration is just arising because such gameplay mechanic is almost never encoutered and usually developpers pre-determine the locations of checkpoints, such that players are not used to ""keep in mind"" to save ! When thinking about it, this could make any game easier when used with wiseness since each player could choose to save between hard obstacles, fixing by themselves their own difficulty treshold. I have to admit that the fact that I forgot to save during a few very long phases challenged my self-control at few occasions (even twice or three times in a row...) and that's why I decided to put it in the negative points. But this is more a warning for future players : Do not forget to summon your checkpoints !

Cute presentation and fun traversal abilities, and I found the pacing to be just right - individual gimmicks rarely outstay their welcome, and are replaced with something fresh on a pretty regular basis. I enjoyed exploring the world and progressing through the adventure.

However, it is rough around the edges. I found many hazards blended into the environment too much or were poorly telegraphed, which led me to run straight into them; and the controls in general aren't tight enough for some of the more demanding platforming sections to be truly enjoyable. Missing a few QoL changes, like allowing me to skip certain dialogue/story beats if I've seen them once, because I made a save point just before them and keep dying just after them.

I have heard about this game for Ages and the art style was always an attraction, but i felt the platforming might be beyond my Skill set, as i am more of an RPG/FPS player. I even tried to refund it within 2 hours as i felt i was not enjoying the game. Somehow common sense prevailed and i persisted. I am Happy i did.

The game has 3 major positives :

1. The Artstyle : its a beautiful looking art piece. The Setpieces, the colours and the lighting is so damn good
2. The Music : If i don't speak about the masterpiece music, it would be a disservice to this game. The Music against the environments match  and the chase sequence music puts you on the edge. 
3. The platforming : Once you slowly get the hang of the controls and abilities the platyforming is butter smooth. You can seamlesly pull combo moves and its so fluid that you feel its a GOD ( though you are a sweet little spirit)

Cons : The platforming can be a bit hard at times and some boss fights are a pain. 

I highly recommend everyone plays it once, and slowly plod away and enjoy this masterpiece.",1702658297,1702658297,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Using them in tandem with your own kit is incredible, feels nice and fluid. Some levels feel like just that, levels. They don't feel very immersive at all, then when you inevitably start the death snowball you begin to hate it even more.

But there's a FAR better game out there and its name is ""Ori and the Will of the Wisps"".
Ori and the Blind Forest feels like a semi-roguelite because of how many baffeling trial-and-error passages the game has. Its saving grace is a save-system that lets you save yourself in exchange for a magical ressource. The problem stems from the fact that you'll forget the system exists A LOT a first and so will eventually see annoying/unskippable cutscenes a lot. Enemies and their placements feel punishing sometimes - not in a good way and the main character tends to feel ""floaty"". I applaude the devs for trying some new sort of ""battle system mechanic"" (Ori mostly attack over homing-missle-attacks) which sounds cute in theory but plays rather disconnected and ... not all that great. 
The music and artdesign are the bomb tho..

Overall: The story itself isn't deep (good but not deep!). You can watch a summary on YT and walk right on to the next game.",1702273679,1702273809,False,1,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False
387290,153350981,76561198878672108,0,9,653,0,653,1703329145,"Lets get the CONS out of the way:
Keybinds: Ori doesn't let you change the keybinds, which sucks when the defaults are less than optimal. This was the most glaring issue for me as my pinky finger would constantly be dying from pain trying to juggle between the shift key and control key while the rest controlled the character with WASD. It went to a point where i used both hands on the left side of my keyboard to get through an area without mobs, just had difficult platforming.

Combat: The game's combat is shallow, the main combat system only allows u to spam left click for it to auto target and kill mobs. There's some variation like charged attacks but thats more or less all it offers.

OST: While Ori has some absolutely beautiful scores, it lacks in variety. They become a lot less special by the time u hear the same soundtrack for a similar sequence for the 4th time.

Mobs: To be specific, mob variety. Often time it will be the same mob I saw in the last area with a different coat of paint. Instead of throwing poison, it now throws magma.

Pixelated sprites: speaks for itself, a lot of the times i was noticing a lot of compressed image cards, specially during cutscenes.

Most, if not all of these issues can be stemmed from it being an Indie game, and aren't really an issue throughout the amazing 10hr content (and more) that Ori offers. And I hear all of these were not only fixed, but even improved upon in the second game so my expectation and hype for it is real high.

Now onto the goods:
Gameplay(8/10):
Despite the combat being ""meh"", Ori's platforming is next level. It gives you a bunch of skills to help you traverse the world. The different obstacles you face are all unique and really feels like the devs made the different skills first, and then found out every possible obstacle for it instead of doing it the other way around. I almost never found myself doing the same thing.
Speaking of abilities, bash has to be one of the most unique things you can do in a game. It is easily one of the most satisfying maneuvers you can pull off in a video game after Sekiro's deflection.
The skill tree is very minimal, but it's necessary and doesn't feel shallow. It allows helpful upgrades to your skills or just percentage increases to damage for combat. 
The gameplay loop in Ori is always changing right until the end even with just a handful of abilities and its really fun and fluid. 

Story and Narrative(7/10):
Ori's story isn't all too complicated but the narrative makes it a bit hard to understand at first. It really is gameplay focused where it shines the best. But Ori's story had some pacing issues at the beginning I felt, but building slow and lasting characters for players to care about in a 10hr game with rapid fast gameplay can be difficult, and the game it felt like just wanted to get on with it to the actual gameplay part. The game tells the story about Ori trying to save the forest by restoring its different elements back to how they were in hopes to save his friend, or guardian rather, Naru. The story is fine, and really wraps everything together, but don't expect it to leave a lasting effect or anything 

3.Visuals(9/10):
Artstyle > Graphics is a motto I live by and Ori is a prime example of this. The visuals of Ori speak for themselves. The animations are fluid, with a painterly artstyle combining 2d and 3d imagery to make a final lively product. It really feels like the devs were able to portray exactly how they imagined the game would look like in their minds and it is absolutely mesmerizing. I have no doubt a large majority of people bought the game just off of visual appeal because it looks absolutely gorgeous in every setting. It is now in my top 5 favorite games in terms of visuals.

Score(8/10):
Ori's score is magnificent despite the lack of variety. They fit the scenarios and really make you feel like you are about to achieve something great putting a great deal of pressure in your mind during timed sequences. For a small indie studio, OSTs like this isn't expected, I will absolutely be listening to some tracks in my offtime.

Final score - [8.5/10]
Ori and the Blind Forest is an amazing short experience providing satisfying gameplay elements focusing on platforming, incredible visuals and astonishing soundtrack along with it.

There were some positives, for example the art style is pretty unique, the skill tree was a cool consept and a couple of areas actually were fun to go through and felt unique (I really liked the water area).
But I had a lot of negatives which are: most area look similar, the combat is the worst combat i have ever experienced in a video game, the escape were cool but restarting every death makes it for some anoying memory sections and some of the puzzles felt really dumb, like figuring out that I can apparently push certain rocks or that I'm not suposed to go to the final area without a certain upgrade.
I came to this game after playing hollow knight thinking I would like this game but maybe It's just me not being a fan of the genre like I thougth I was.

Everything else is extremely bad. This game is annoyingly difficult. The saves system is ridiculous. Because of these two facts, you have to repeat the same thing again, and again, and again. (Did I ever tell you what the definition of insanity is?) The gaming process is as follows: You navigate the map a little bit. If you are lucky, you don't die in the process. Most times, you are not lucky. The controls are very hard, and the map design is built around the idea of pressing the correct button (usually the jump one) in a very exact and precise moment. If you fail to do it, you fall. Then you have to repeat the same thing again. In some cases, you just fall, then it's simpler, you just retry. In other cases, you fall to your death. Then you have to retry much more, from the last point where you saved. Things as simple as jumping up to the next platform of the level can take dozens of retries and a lot of time which I cannot consider anything else then wasted because this process does not bring any joy and, when and if you finally succeed after many failed attempts, there's no taste of satisfaction, only bitterness and frustration. I mean it. Here's the platform right in front of you. In order to jump to it, you have to press the button at a very specific point. One pixel below, and you will miss and fall. A fraction of second earlier or later, and you will miss and fall. And the worst thing is that you cannot even save. Yes, you can technically save in almost any point of the game (arbitrarily chosen by you, not a predefined checkpoint, wow), but only if you are lucky and have the specific resource which runs out very quickly. So, in the end, you cannot really save often. If you die, you respawn at the point where you saved last time and have to repeat the whole navigation process from that point. Let me give you an example of how it works: You just spent fifteen minutes trying to jump to the next platform. Nothing complicated, just a trivial jump, but this game and its controls are so hard that you had to spend fifteen minutes on about hundred jump attempts. Finally, you succeeded. You cannot save because you are out of the save resource. Then you get the next jumping challenge. You fail it and fall to your death. You respawn at the save point. Remember I mentioned how you needed fifteen minutes and a hundred attemps to jump to that first platform? Do it again. No, it didn't get any easier. After that, you'll get another attempt at the second jumping challenge. Guess what, you failed it again. That's normal, in the end you probably need a hundred attempts for this one, too. Respawn at the save point. Now do the first thing again for several minutes. Then you get you third attempt on the second challenge. And so on. Sounds easy, right? Let's add some enemies. The combat isn't hard, but enemies can and will kill you many times. When it happens, you respawn at the latest save point and have to repeat the whole thing again. Sometimes, enemies and jumping challenges are happening at the same time. For example, you have to climb the wall, and directly under you there is an enemy which will instally kill you on first touch. Don't fall. (You will. Many times.) In other situations, an enemy can attack you while you are trying to climb the wall or jump the platforms. It was already hard, now it's closer to impossible. You die, and repeat, and die again. To make it even less fun, the enemies respawn crazily. You walk away just a little bit, and then you get back, and the enemy you just killed is there again. I had a case where I was stupid enough to, after killing a particularly hard enemy, save on that very spot. In a minute or two, I died and respawned at that place, and guess what? The enemy respawned at that place, too. And remember that enemy under the wall you have to climb? It respawns immediately after you start climbing the wall. You kill the monster (which wasn't easy and took several attempts), then you start climbing the wall, and the monster reappears directly under you in that very second. Have fun. (You won't.) Die and do the same thing. Again, and again, and again. Did I ever tell you what the definition of insanity is?",1702084102,1702084340,False,10,3,0.55089336633682251,0,True,False,False

For context I'm a metroidvania fan, and hollow knight is the gold standard for that genre in my eyes. I played the game on hard mode and I think my only regret is that the game would have probably been a little faster if I had picked normal. I really wanted to like the game and I saw a lot of yt vids recommending it and the Overwhelmingly positive reviews. This was not my experience.

This game wasn't a through and through a bad experience. The story was sentimental even if it wasn't that deep. I think that it has a few strong emotional moments including the very beginning that resonate well, but I don't know if there enough to really call what we experience a compelling story. The presentation of the game is 10/10 though. It feels like every aspect of the visuals and the audio are working together to convey a theme or feeling. It all feels unique and stylistic in a good way.

My main issue is the gameplay. While I think the pace of progression is good, I don't like the ability system. You can unlock abilities as you go but there isn't very much decision making going on in that section. Pick all of the 1 point abilities, then the 2 point abilities, and then decide which 3 point abilities to pick. Also I really feel like Ori doesn't jump high enough. Maybe that's a strange complaint to have but I never felt like Ori felt good to control. The best feeling is when you're blasting past screens using you're abilities perfectly, but that rarely happens and I think the controls can sometimes not work well together. My main complaint is that there are a few sections of the game where you have to escape an area, and on paper I love that. It's a way of merging gameplay and story while re contextualizing levels you've already gone through. At the end of the day though I just found those parts annoying as I repeatedly died.

The rest of the game was easy but those escape sequences would always take what felt like way too long to beat and by the end of it, those 3 events turned my experience from just positive enough to give a thumbs up to a negative one.

Again, I hope this review doesn't apply to you. I really would like people to love this game because the developers clearly put a lot of love into this work. I didn't like it however and I think it's useful in case anyone out there is like me,",1702045599,1702045599,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In the end, it turned out to be my favorite platform game ever. Frustration and satisfaction were mixed inside of me through the whole game: I would scream at the screen, alt+f4 the hell out of it and then still come back-- just to get mad all over again lol When I finally got through some really difficult levels, however, I felt like I was at the top of the world. It's this kind of game. 

The mechanics are endless: You can jump, you can hover, you can thrust yourself into any directions using enemies/enemies' attacks, you can swim, you can climb, you can run... This brings lots of possibilities when getting through some levels. The controls confused me a bit at the beginning, since they're so many, but nothing that 10 guides and a lot of hard-work wouldn't fix. (lol)

The visuals... I don't think I even have to say anything, do I? My ex-boyfriend actually studied this game at college because of how beautiful it is. I mean, look at it. Each level you find yourself in, there's a new world waiting. Things can be soothing or scary, and yet they're beautiful at all times. You don't even mind dying 1300 times in your first gameplay! Just look at the scenery, dude. 

The soundtrack is extremely relaxing and melancholic/nostalgic... I don't even know. The visuals + soundtrack combo are what make your eyes teary. And boy did I cried way more than I thought I would playing a platformer game lol If you think you'll only shed tears in the prologue, you're wrong. 

Anyway, I love this game a lot. It made me feel a bunch of emotions, and also brought this part of my human soul that is connected to nature. Yeah. I think even people that aren't into platformers should give it a try. I wasn't really into them (lol) until this. Now I guess I'm really taking Celest and Hollow Knight out of my wishlist...

Teaboy's Basic(ish) Reviews....I read a lot of reviews when looking at games on Steam, and it quickly gets tiring – those who write involved, down to the micron scale reviews, although helpful, end up like looking at War & Peace when you’ve only got time for a quick 5 minute dump!  This is middle of the road and to the point – not easy for me as I tend towards sesquipedalian loquaciousness!  Vociferously Verbose?  Alright, verbal diarrhoea.  (Although I hate panning a developer’s work and all the time, effort and love they put into designing these – it is their life after all – this is my honest, personal opinion of my level of enjoyment.  Sorry devs!).  

A note on time played:  My Steam clock does not seem to work properly, indeed, it even minuses time on occasion!  Plus, I have a tendency to wander off and leave games running at times, so time played may not be entirely accurate!  


Teaboy’s Tonsil Titillators or Toenail Titbits!  (Rating)  

Tonsil Tickler (Totally Tops):  The frenchy of which you always dreamt!  To quote a master, “She’s got a tongue like an electric eel and she likes the taste of a Man’s tonsils!”.  An absolute masterpiece and joy to play.  

The Tits (Terrific):  Everyone loves playing with these!  Not THE best bit, but such fun on their own you can be lost for hours....mmmm.  What most games you really like score – perfection is so rare after all.   

Torso Teaser (Taker of your Time):  It’s a flat stomach....sure it’s nice to look at, run your fingers over, slobber on a bit, sometimes that bellybutton gets your motor running....but it's just basically the corridor between the two ‘gaming rooms’.  The definitive ‘Meh’ - the middle ‘sideways thumb’ option for which everyone on Steam cries.  

Todger/Tadger & (scroTum) Taters (Tedious):  Is it an ‘a’ or is it an ‘o’?  Who cares!  The meat can be fun to play with for about 5 minutes of your entire day, the rest it just hangs there and generally gets in the way of doing something else.  The main problem of course, is the two veg sticking to your inside thigh.  This is what this game feels like – the occasional/rare bouts of fun, the rest bobbing like a 19th century British Policeman (now you know why!).  

Toenail Tornado (Total Toss):  A playthrough so appalling it’s like being trapped in a Turkish sauna with the ugliest, hairiest, fattest, sweatiest beast of a neolithic hominid who’s trimming his toenails using pliers and the splinters are reminiscent of a scene from the Normandy Landings.  My god how did this get released!?  


Teaboy Touts (Score):  TONSIL TICKLER!!!!!!!!!!!!


The Review:  

This is for both Ori And The Blind Forest & Ori And The WIll Of The Wisps (they are effectively the same game).  

I think this is my Favourite Game Of All Time - hence the dozen exclamation marks above (my fave number)!  When I played the 2nd one, I preferred the 1st, and I Still LOVED IT!  

This is an action platformer that is more platformer than combat but plenty of both - unlike things like Blasphemous which to me is just hack n slash.  This one requires learning and skill with a bit of timing to boot.  Both games have the same controls and movements and map type and controls.  The differences are obviously a different map (same layout format) and a change in the skill progression.  In the 2nd game you purchase upgrades from a couple of creatures and you have to juggle abilities by selecting appropriate ones as you go through the game (there are many more than 1st game).  I'm not much of a fan of this, after playing Baldur's Gate on the Playstation 2 with my brother (we always pronounced it Bal Jers - sounds so much more fantastical than the Boulders they pronounce it in game!) so many times as we Loved it, then the sequel introduced crafting and we spent So Much Time in the selection screens reading n swapping n forging....it totally destroyed the flow of the game.  Luckily, Ori is not like that, it's much more basic/easy, but due to my personal experience I don't like the interruption.  But for others it adds choice.  It also is necessary for progression on a few occasions.  

Other than that, both games are pretty much a continuation of each other.  Playstyle is identical, which is the Perfect decision by the devs because the first game was Excellent.  Don't fix it if it ain't broke!  You increase a dual power bar as you level up, allowing more/stronger abilities.  The abilities you get are great fun and vital at the same time - they get assigned to buttons of your choice as you unlock them.  

A lesson to newbies I learnt the hard way - if you can't do something/get somewhere, it is because you yet lack the ability!  I tried for ages to get places until I finally learnt that I had to go somewhere else and earn an ability!  So if stuck, go to another area of the map you've yet to do.  Trust me, you'll find a new way to jump or whatever and then you go, ""Ahhhhhh! 
 NOW I can go to that other place.""  In the 2nd game I deliberately upgraded one skill tree to get a particular ability I knew from the 1st game makes it so much easier, however, I could not get it after getting all the upgrades it required....it was the same old story as above - some abilities are earnt through in-game progression, you have to open a part of the map/do something/complete some quest AND upgrade!  Take note!  

Movement speed is super important in platformers as many games are so sloooow.  This game is, yet again, perfect!  You move quickly, and the abilities can boost that significantly.  This is important as the map is large and there are, in my opinion, too few jumpgates.  Still, going back and forth is a lot more acceptable than most games that force you to backtrack.  The hardest part of this game is finding all the hidden items which will be the greatest reason for backtracking.  There is sadly a single glitch in the 2nd game whereby about half of players, myself included, could not 100% the game as one 'complete the set' never goes above 97% (one gem short kind of thing even though you've found them all).  

The action AND platforming can be frenetic at times, which is actually massive fun.  Boss battles can be a bit annoying - like a side-scroller where you have to learn the right way by dying constantly and repeating.  This the ONLY flaw in this otherwise perfect game in two parts!  

And the music....the opening title screen tune....It is heartbreaking that it is so short - it's one of the most brilliant little tunes I've ever heard.  Pure joyous magic.  

Sadly, it seems from the ending that they will not be making another.  I'd buy it without a second thought if they did.  I wonder if it's like Batman and Halo - originators didn't want to spend their entire career developing the same game so handed it over....and they got worse.  Still, I'd buy it and hope!

A short but sweet platforming adventure!

GAMEPLAY:
The platforming in Ori and the Blind Forest feels great to play through. The game really starts shining once you unlock a multitude of abilities, such as being able to cling onto walls, charge jump boosts, and dashing. I wish dashing was an ability unlocked earlier, because it feels so satisfying to use in sync with jump boosts (but understandably, it's introduced late because it wasn't an ability in the original version of the game). Surprisingly, gliding was a mechanic in this game as well. Combined with wind bursts present in the overworld, it made for really smooth and fun gameplay that I wasn't expecting from a platformer. Mashing the shift button to glide and re-equip my glider to control my height was funnily enough, reminiscent of Breath of the Wild. One of the most surprising mechanics that I ended up loving was the ability to launch yourself in any direction after making contact with enemy projectiles. The game devs did an amazing job creating intentional sequences involving this unique mechanic (in particular, I'm looking at you, Mount Horu)! For completionists, you'll have to do a lot of backtracking later to get all collectables, as there are plenty of segments of the game where you can't proceed without a specific ability. I do wish that teleporting around the world was a little more accessible to make this more convenient (e.g. instead of having to be at a tp spot, you can teleport to one of your choosing from any area). However, with all things considered, I didn't find backtracking later as repetitive as I thought it would've been because I was having a blast with all the new abilities I had (especially the ones that made me be able to traverse the world faster!)

The game peaked for me in all three ""chase"" sequences that followed all the main areas of the game, whether it be climbing out of a massive flooding tree, or gliding out of a collapsing ice cavern. The difficulty felt just right, and with stakes on the line, successfully escaping was satisfying. The puzzles given throughout the game were quite fun as well for the most part (a select few were perhaps a bit more tedious than fun), and gave more identity to the platformer. The combat was an interesting element for the game. I believe that at its core, the game serves as a platformer, and the abilities that accompany that is what makes the game feel great to play. The combat, consisting of left clicking near enemies to get an orb to attack them, felt separate from the identity of what made the game fun to play. While I didn't necessarily dislike the combat, it felt unrewarding in the literal sense of what it gave you (small amounts of points to spend on skill trees) but also in the sense that it took me away from constantly moving. There are also no boss fights in the game, so combat never gets put to the test or goes anywhere meaningful, further creating this idea that the combat was an afterthought to the core of the gameplay.

NARRATIVE:
There's a story here, but to be blunt, nothing too notable. Ori lives in a forest, the forest loses its life force, they travel to three locations to revive the forest, succeeds in doing so, and the forest is saved. As the game is a platformer, I suppose the main purpose of a story is to provide the player a reason to explore and go places, and the story does just that. There are a few cute themes sprinkled here and there, like a parent's love for their child, but it feels like the story doesn't go above and beyond what it needs to.

GRAPHICS:
This game looks great. Having beautiful visuals to look at while zooming through the world made it all the more engaging. The darker areas of the game had the perfect, uninviting atmosphere, while the well-lit areas were breath-taking to look at.

SOUNDTRACK:
The ambience of the overall music felt on point with the game, but wasn't particularly moving or memorable.

OVERALL: 4/5
Ori and the Blind Forest is definitely a game to remember. I haven't played through that many platformer games yet, so I might be biased when I say this, but this game has its own identity within the genre. Some things will feel familiar, and some things will still yet surprise you. What more could a platformer enjoyer ask for? Anyways, if you haven't Ori-dy tried the game yet, do it! ...(i'm so funny guys i can't)",1701476333,1701476660,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- The soundtrack is good and complements the environments
- The story was good
- I played casually through the game not knowing anything about it and collected everything on the map under 10 hours (there are still some achivements I could do but they require to complete the game from start again without dying once / under 3 hours or killing a bunch of enemies using different abilites)

I love Ori(the game, not the little thing). I played the 2nd one, before this one and it's gorgeous! Such a beautiful scenery, interesting puzzles and platforming sections.

I don't really like the attack, I think in the 2nd one, combat was really well made, but I guess the point here is more on the puzzles side.


Definitely worth! Both Ori games are top-notch and are one of the best metroidvania games, ones that define the modern metroidvania term. They also serve as a good stepping stone for Hollow Knight, so they are the key to a lot of new experiences.

However, perhaps I set my expectations too high coming from Hollow Knight. This game is still amazing and was a fun experience for me. Play this before hollow knight though. I'll look forward to playing Will of the Wisps.",1701141039,1701141039,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Rating: 8/10

[h2]Gameplay and Difficulty(8/10):[/h2]

Ori and the Blind Forest has really satisfying platforming mechanics and map traversal options. At the start the game may feel clunky at times, but after an hour or two you unlock your first few new abilities that allow you to travel faster through the map and you can access new places. The definitive edition added the fast travel to the spirit wells, but the spirit well locations were quite few and far, so they were only useful occasionally. Otherwise I don't have anything else that bothered me about the movement in the game.

The combat is quite basic though. You basically have only two types of attacks: rapid fire and larger explosion type of attack. You can upgrade some of the traversal abilities to deal some damage to your enemies, but those don't feel that convenient. So all in all, the combat is OK.

From gameplay standpoint everyone can find fitting difficulty level for themselves. There are normal mode that is good for most people and then there is the hard mode for those who are looking for more challenge. Most hardcore gamers may also try to beat the whole game with only one life.

[h2]Graphics and Sound (10/10):[/h2]

Graphically Ori and the Blind Forest is phenomenal. Even after multiple years the game doesn't show any signs of aging. It still looks very impressive.

The soundtrack is also very good and complements the environments and the story. Peaceful places have solemn soundtracks and when the gameplay needs it the music can be quite thrilling at times.

[h2]Story(8/10):[/h2]

I liked the story. The story really tugs at your heart strings and it does it successfully and the end leaves you wanting more.

[h2]Replayability (6/10):[/h2]

After you have seen the story there is only the achievements and leaderboard positions that you can try to climb as far as possible. You can try to run the game as fast as possible and you should be able to finish it under the 3 hour mark to get all the achievements. If this interests you then it might be a positive.

Of course, your first run is not that fast. I played quite casually through the game and collected everything on the map and I completed the game under 10 hours. So the game still has fair amount of gameplay in it.

[h2]Conclusion:[/h2]

I can recommend this game for everyone who enjoy platformer games and metroidvania type of games. The story, music and graphics were the high points of this game and very rare games have all these as good as this one.",1701035435,1701035435,True,15,0,0.707200169563293457,0,True,False,False

Exploring in this game was very frustrating because I was constantly dying in one hit.  Once I learned how to get past this spot I would die at the next spot within less than five minutes.  This cycle continued repeatedly over and over again.  I wish there was some breathing room in between these deaths to enjoy exploring this beautiful game.  Ori would also sometimes not perform certain actions at critical moments leading to more deaths.  I also do not like it when these deaths are related to something that was off screen or very hard to see.  It feels cheap and adds to the frustration.  

Combat was boring.  Only one button to press for a limited range homing projectile to attack a random enemy.  There were also no bosses to do combat with.  Escaping seemed to be the bosses.  Ability upgrades were also generic and did not add much to the game-play.

Overall I was more frustrated getting through this game rather than having fun.  I was given the next Ori game as a gift and heard it improves a lot from the shortcomings of this game.  Watch and enjoy someone else complete this game and then play the next Ori game.

-Resources (spirit light, energy, life) are more abundant, and upgrades cost less (helpful for sure)
- Enemies have less health and deal less damage, but there are still looooots of enemies/obstacles that will kill you instantly. Overall, i found the combat difficulty to be easy even as someone who doesn't usually play these sorts of games, but then you land on a spike and you have to do it all over again anyway.
-  The boss sequences (e.g. [spoiler] escaping the ginso tree, battling kuro, etc [/spoiler]) have a checkpoint in the middle so you don't have to do the entire thing in one go.

I like the game, but man is it not fun sometimes.
I went into hard mode thinking ""im pretty good at platformers"", and what I was met with was fairly limited gameplay and infuriatingly unfair and unfun enemy's.
The game does really shine in the chase scenes and very difficult and fun platforming, but almost completely fails at making the combat fun and interesting. It basically boils down to standing still and holding a button for most encounters. 
I've seen that in the sequel that has been fixed but I've yet to try it myself. Also I do want to mention that the story seems pretty bland and feels like its trying too hard to get you to care for the various characters.

Ori and the Blind Forest is an action platformer, featuring beautiful artwork and music. The game's story is simple and linear.

[h1] Movement and Platforming[/h1] 
The movement system starts off slow and gets interesting during later parts of the game. I found ""Bash"" and ""Light Burst"" working together as unique. The platforming overall is good. Once the player has collected enough abilities they can zoom across the map fast.

[h1]Combat[/h1] 
The combat is poor and boring. Your choices of killing enemies is to mash your attack button, reflect bullets, dash and stomp, throwing bullets. You can also charge up your attack by holding however this consumes ""energy"", which has to be managed for saving. Basic attack focuses multiple enemies at once with splits but doesn't have a priority system in place for assisted aim, example closest enemy has a chance to not get hit when fighting multiple enemies. The enemy variety is also lacking.

[h1]Cons[/h1] 
Art getting in the way of the player during platforming.
Lack of auto-saving during escape sequences and the escape sequences being frustrating to go through due to unpredictability as well trial and error. Auto-saving only happens when the sequence starts and ends.
Poor saving system overall, Cutscenes and dialogue will replay when player hasn't saved and dies. Having to manage your ""energy"" during gameplay for fighting, saving and platforming. 
Teleporting to a new place does not save the game, making it an extra step to do while watching a long animation each time.
Clunky controls and too many buttons, including no key/controller remapping.
Getting stuck because of the game throwing a switch into an odd place or using a mechanic in a specific way that has not been introduced before to progress further.

[b]TLDR[/b]: Beautiful and good platformer with questionable game design. I would recommend this game for a try, however if you are prone to frustration, i would not recommend it.

This is one of those games that kinda peaked my interest because I love metroidvania's. So, I bought it, put it in my ""I'll get to it later pile"" and left it there for years..... what a mistake that was. I cannot believe how long I waited to play this masterpiece. And that IS what this is, a MASTERPIECE and so is its sequel.

I won't spoil the story here but I will say that this game is all about loss and dealing with loss. While there are moments of true sadness (this is one of 3 games ever to bring me to legitimate tears, The Last of Us and Mass Effect 3 [Mordin!!!] being the others) but it is so much more than that!

Gameplay - A masterclass in metroidvania design. Exploration, discovery and character advancement and development are at their best here. Combat is very well done. Simple but still possesses depth. Challenging but  not overly so. It's definitely not Soulslike levels of challenging. But it is also rewarding and rarely feels unfair. Movement (especially late game with some added abilities) is seriously satisfying. 

Graphics - Incredible! Beautiful! The art style perfectly compliments what this game is trying to achieve and accentuates the themes and mood that permeate every aspect of this game. There are also some seriously breathtaking set pieces on display here.

Music & Sound - The sounds are completely adequate. More than is needed for a game of this type. The music is again, best in class. Yet another example of a perfect pairing between theme and mood to fit the game. I love it so very much.

I know it's not fair to review an older game using a newer game as comparison, but after playing Hollowed Knight, you realize just how absolutely annoying every enemy in Ori is and how it is a chore instead of fun fighting them. Also, your one main attack is one that you constantly have to button spam; no just holding down the attack button because we are apparently going back to the 80s Nintendo days. The only reason why the game doesnt let you to just hold down the attack button is because it would just reveal how weak the combat is; since there is never a moment in the game where you shouldnt be attacking and there's no punishment for always attacking regardless of the enemy and situation, the game would just devolve into holding down the attack button from the moment the game starts to the moment the game ends.

The level designs way overuse floor spikes, with many of them impossible to see until you land on them and will immediately end your run. Levels are not designed in such a way that they are fun to explore, because they are not made so that the players intuitively know where to go next, and it's never clear if you are in the right area the game wants you to be or if you are in an area that is designed to come back at a later time. And before someone calls me a casual, understand that every single game with deep exploration and branching paths, even Dark Souls, cleverly tricks and guide the player into going where the player needs to go next, in such a subtle way that the player doesnt even realize it. This game doesnt know how to do that at all.

I recommend trying it on the discounted 5 EUR price, but I believe it's not worth the 20 EUR base price.",1698692872,1698692890,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros
-The artwork is phenomenal.
-The bash mechanic.
-Good to great music.

Cons
-The combat is miserable. Mash X to fire glowing blobs while enemies try to ram you or fire their own glowing blobs back (some of the enemies are basically just glowing blobs).
-Visual clarity is awful. So many enemies, items, and attacks in this game are glowing blobs that things can get confusing pretty quickly in combat. Also, sometimes the background/environmental art gets in the way of gameplay.
-The story loses any sense of weight once resurrection gets involved.
-Their is no fast travel mechanic so if you want to go around the map and get all the secrets you missed/were unable to get earlier you need to walk there.
-The mist woods as an area is kind of a pain in the ass.
-Can't disable help/tool-tip popups (reminding you that you have an upgrade point, etc) and they sometimes interfere with gameplay by obscuring platforms, enemies, etc.
-Sound effects are bland to annoying for enemies/combat.
-Music  and sound effects get way too loud in the chase sequences.
-Buttons on the controller cannot be remapped.

Neutral
-You have a Navi but it is less annoying.
-Controller vibration is crazy, I strongly recommend turning it dowm.",1698607717,1698607717,False,0,1,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

This enchanting adventure, developed by Moon Studios, takes players on a captivating journey through a lush and mysterious forest.

Visually, the game is a masterpiece. The hand-drawn art style and attention to detail create a stunning and immersive world. The forest's beauty is juxtaposed with its danger, giving the game a unique atmosphere that keeps players engaged and in awe.

The game play is equally impressive. The platforming mechanics are tight and intuitive, offering challenging yet satisfying experiences as you navigate through the forest's perilous terrain. As Ori, the game's agile protagonist, you'll unlock new abilities and upgrades that keep the game play fresh and exciting.

One of the game's standout features is its storytelling. ""Ori and the Blind Forest"" weaves a touching and emotionally resonant narrative as it explores themes of friendship, sacrifice, and the power of determination. The characters, particularly Ori and Sein, are endearing, and players become deeply invested in their journey.

Gareth Coker's musical score is a perfect companion to the game's visual and emotional elements. The music sets the tone beautifully, enhancing the emotional impact of the story and the game play.

While the game is a true gem, it's not without its challenges. Some players might find its difficulty level to be on the high side, with certain sections requiring precise timing and quick reflexes. However, this difficulty adds to the sense of accomplishment when you overcome obstacles.

In conclusion, ""Ori and the Blind Forest"" is a must-play title for fans of platforms, artful storytelling, and immersive experiences. It's a visually stunning, emotionally engaging game that leaves a lasting impression.

The game balance shifts from careful save energy management to just letting you drop a save point after every jump so rapidly that it feels like the game's only way to compensate is to throw more no-mercy challenges at you to kill you with a single mistake. It could have easily had you respawn at the last safe platform when you fall into a pit, but instead it forces you to save literally everywhere just in case some bullshit enemy is around the next corner and one-shots you and your pitiful health pool. Not helped by the fact that sometimes its difficult to tell what's in the foreground and whats a danger on your plane of movement, or the fact that all the blurry light particles flying around sometimes makes it difficult to tell what's a threat in time to dodge it.

And the story, while presenting a veneer of wholesome adventure about love and family, falls apart at any level of scrutiny. It feels like the morals of the story are that it's fine to behave with reckless disregard for others' safety if you miss someone (whom you've never properly met), choosing found family over biological family is a mistake, anger over legitimate wrongs done to your family is bad if the target of your anger is more important than you, and so on.

The artstyle is incredible, and it's just calming to look at the game.
The soundtrack is also great.
Gameplay is near perfect, i just wish the controls for a specific ability you unlock were a bit better, i would love to have played with just dpad and not having to switch to joystick.
One thing i dislike is the lack of combat diversity, with being stuck to a simple moveset.
The world of Ori is amazing to explore, I just wish it was a bit bigger!

I understand that it's a beautiful game with a memorable soundtrack. The themes are there and the characters get introduced in a natural way without too much explaining.

However, art or not, it's still a video game. I want to play it. The very first moment I get the control of the intro character, I want to see what happens when I try to walk off a ledge. You cannot, there's an invisible wall. It's a minor flaw (barely a flaw at all) but personally it's infuriating and lazy design. You want to put a mandatory slow walking introduction but you don't want to think outside the box [i]at all[/i]? You could easily put an alternative hidden route there and you don't need an invisible wall. Art games and invisible walls, Mona Lisa and rotten teeth.

Not to mention Ori's very much a game for kids (and manchildren). If I was under 15 I could see it becoming a favourite. The story seems simple and effective and the visuals kick ass.

How about the gameplay? Brace your mouse arm to get tendonitis because you are going to mash the mouse button for a ridiculous amount of time. For the short while I played the enemies got noticeably more bullet-spongy and every time you plan to hit an enemy once, it's one mouse click. I see no reason for it, you could easily just hold the mouse button to fire continuously. Wall jumping controls felt awkward and most of the reviews state that the end game platforming gets more and more difficult.

I'll leave this one to people who instantly want to immerse themselves into Ori. I'm just a cynic who wished the whole intro sequence for the fat kidnapper to die off.",1696001228,1696001228,False,0,0,0.458015263080596924,0,True,False,False

Adopted by a curious creature named Naru, she quickly takes the role of a loving adoptive mother and cares for Ori as they grow up. Life is peaceful and idyllic until one fateful summer when a strange darkness creeps in and twists the forest, withering the fruit trees and poisoning the water, bringing famine and death. Newly orphaned, Ori flees from their home and meets a mysterious light named Sein who knows why the forest has changed - and needs Ori's help restoring it to its natural order.

9-40+ hours to complete, Ori and the Blind Forest is a fantasy metroidvania RPG with puzzles and platforming. This game is difficult. In my first playthrough on Hard mode, I died over 400 times and truly didn’t enjoy playing until after the first “dungeon”, The Ginso Tree, where the world suddenly opens up after gaining vital movement skills. Regardless, this game is a genuinely wonderful experience that I wish many more people would play. The story was handled amazingly well despite having such little dialogue. Areas are fun to explore, and you are frequently rewarded for your curiosity with lots of hidden places and secrets to find.

in other news, it's relatively short (with me having beat normal mode with most collectibles in around 12 hours) but the difficulty is incredibly high. mostly platforming sections, though. if you want to face off against bosses, this isn't the game for you. it does have some mandatory arenas and enemies are everywhere, but generally i find that the combat section of the skill tree is the least useful, as by the endgame, your main damage will likely be from the abilities that you've picked up along the way and not your main attack.

I've played 2D platformers for years.  Decades, really.  Metriod, Zelda, and Mario; Castlevania; Mega Man, and the wide plethora of knockoffs.  I wouldn't brag, but I certainly would categorize myself as reasonably competent.

This game's gorgeous graphics pulled me in right away.  The plot, while simplistic, was captivating.  The intro was moving, even.  And off I went, to solve puzzles, earn experience, and gain power-ups, all the while keeping a weathered eye on my mana and life totals.  Very throwback; very classic; with a touch of newness.  I was hooked.  Oh, look; an [obstacle] that I can't circumvent; surely therefore I'll find [power-up] to help me with that, later on.  Don't forget it's there!  Probably something juicy behind it!

Then I started encountering some more challenging areas.  More difficult enemies.  More convoluted jumping around.  Eh, no problem.  Just takes getting used to.  I got used to Mario.  I'll get used to this guy.  That's part of the fun; it's a puzzle world, filled with danger, interlaced in jumping around challenges.  If you like that sort of thing.  And I do!  So I pressed on.

Then I started encountering some *really* challenging areas.  Skin-of-your-teeth jumps.  Unforgiving monsters.  But you can save your game almost anywhere.  So repeating attempts is not that inconvenient.  Aside from the tedium and frustration of attempting the same series of jumps, dodges, and attacks over and over until you've circumvented the situation.  Only to find a similar scenario right around the corner.  Hrmph.  But hey, that's, uh, still part of the fun, heh, right?  It's a challenge!  It's uh... it's an experience!  Something to relish when you finally triumph!  Yeah, that's it!

Then I started encountering some really, REALLY challenging courses.  Like, five or more absolutely flawlessly timed jumps in sequence, in different directions; or instant death.  Ouch.  And you know what?  After my eleventeenth attempt, it just stopped being fun.  Mind you, I'm only a small fraction of the way through the game at this point.  And I'm already frustrated beyond my tolerance point -- which, I really do want to say, is pretty flexible when it comes to these sorts of games.

Since I'm throwing the game under the bus, at this point I'll also mention its somewhat silly experience point system.  It'd pretty easy to farm exp if you really wanted to, since if you walk five steps off the screen after defeating a big, fat monster, you can walk back and find that big, fat monster has respawned.  And it has three talent trees (well, lines), but the trees are locked against acquiring various power-ups, so you end up just spending points in all three lines anyway.

Perhaps it's harsh; it is, after all, just a 2D platformer.  But the level of challenge it presents reminds me of a sugar-hyped-up pre-teen bulding the ""Ult1m4t3 M4r10 Ch4ll3ng3 L0L"", where you have to jump perfectly nineteen times in eleven different directions at just the right moment or you die and start over.

It is one of the most visually stunning games I have had the pleasure of playing, the art style is great, the sound fits the game very well, the story while simple is told in a way to evoke very powerful feelings and the basic platforming is very very enjoyable. What is my problem with the game then? Simple, it is the chase scenes and I will try to explain why.

First of all to understand my point of view, you have to think where platformers started. They were made to be arcade games where every try cost you a quarter (or an equivalent), thus the games were made to be hard, but if you yourself got better at the game you could definitely feel it throughout the game. Also there was no cheap difficulty of having to replay the level several times to know exactly where damage will come from, since it would have been a blatant money grab. In this game death means nothing (except for a waste of time), but the frustration lingers.

Now imagine two worlds, in one world the difficulty of chase scene is dynamic, meaning no matter how well you executed the first part of the chase scene, it gives you nothing. No additional time whatsover. Thus the whole chase scene is just a series of precisely executed moves, that even if you make just a small mistake at the end, means you are replaying the whole thing again. When you finally finish the scene, you are not happy you did so, you feel relieved.

In the other world, the chase scene itself is on a timer. After several tries you execute the first half of the chase extremely and you have some stumbles in the second half, but since you did so well in the first half you manage to recover from your mistakes and eventually finish the whole. You feel proud of your accomplishment, because you steadily got better, you saw the progression and even if you stumbled a few times along the road, the fact that you got better managed to carry you through the whole thing.

I am fairly sure you know which of these worlds you would prefer and which of these worlds you will encounter in this game. The chase scenes in this game are not a challenge, they are an inconvenience.",1694123071,1694140942,True,16,0,0.607434451580047607,0,True,False,False

The bird had every right to eliminate Ori and his cult of the tree!! I didn't realize I was on a journey to restore a tree who kills baby birds just to find one child of his, and then when the mother bird tries to help fix things in the end, the evil tree comes back to life and kills the mother bird in the process!!!! WHAT A NICE REWARD FROM THE GOSH DARN TREE!!!!!!! The first time I died should be canon because it leaves the mother bird to take care of her only child left PEACEFULLY, and that murderous tree can stay in it's slumber FOREVER, and never kill another bird!!!!!

Besides the story of restoring a bird-killing tree, the gameplay and controls took some time to get used to, but with a little time spent in the game, I got the hang of it and was swinging and gliding around like Tarzan (or George of the Jungle, if you prefer). Was super satisfying to pull off maneuvers and chain beautiful platforming combos in diverse and challenging environments. Also glad their was no final boss, since the real final boss was me trying to platform through this 2D-platformer (hahahahahahaha!!!!)!!!!!!!!

Ori and the Blind Forest : Definitive Edition is a great game.  I am a big fan of Ori and the Blind Forest, as well as Ori and the Will of the Wisps.  I have written reviews for both of those games, so if you want a more detailed review you should check out my review of Ori and the Blind Forest, it's essentially the same thing.  I think that the Definitive Edition adds some quality of life improvements such as the ability to fast travel.  Personally, I think that this makes the game better, but the game was already great, so I almost didn't even notice, and I don't really remember if there were any other changes.

It's just fun to control Ori, which is good, given the games focus on platforming and movement. The Story is intriguing and touching and the art style and music are obviously gorgeous.
Though it ends up a bit linear for a Metroidvania with not much reason to revisit areas, I don't see that as an issue, it's moreso an open world platformer and it pulls that off really well, as everything does still intertwine over the course of the linear plot.
Insert obvious comparison to Hollow Knight here.
Excited to play Will of the Wisps once I've finished Blind Forest, since I heard it improves the combat some more (which is rather lacking here, though the ""parry"" mechanic in this game is already amazing).
It sits at Overwhelmingly Positive overall, why are you even bothering with text reviews it's clearly worth it if you want a good platformer/metroidvania game

Ori and the Bind Forest was my first metro-vanilla 2D game. This is a perfect game if you want to get into the metro-vanilla genre. Here are my pros and cons 

[h1] Pros [/h1]

Music - The music of games is something that I do not pay attention to much in many games, but this game is special. The music score is so incredible and makes some areas feel very atmospheric.

Art Style - The art style of this game has held up incredibly well considering that it is a 9-year-old game at the time of writing this. The art style of fantastic, and the world and the characters are made incredibly well. 

The World - Each part of the world has its unique look and thing to it. Each part is unique and enjoyable to explore 

The 100% achievement grind - This game will take you around 25 - 30 hours to get all the achievements to expect for the super hard 4. They are the following

-Complete a game in under 3 hours
-Complete a game without using any skill points
-Complete a game without dying once
-Complete a game in the One Life difficulty (This achievement was added in the definitive edition of the game. I would recommend just doing the One Life difficulty to complete the final two in one game)

The achievements that I mentioned force to you play at your best and are hard to complete. They probably added 30 hours to my playtime. I just completed the last two today, and I broke down crying because of how happy I was. What I like how this game has incredibly rare and incredibly hard achievements. Of course, you can install SAM and get all the achievements with a click of a button, but deep down, you will feel guilty. 

[h1] Cons [/h1]

Combat - The game is not combat-focused, which could be a positive to some, and negative to others. Anyway, the few pieces of combat that this game does have is pretty shallow. You just spam your attack button while stomping when you get that ability. Also, the game has no bosses, only escape sections which are very good 

The amount of One-Shots - This con is what made the last two achievements so incredibly hard. There are many, many things that one shot you, no matter how much health you have. Some things do a ton of damage that one hit kills you. 

[h1] My Final Thoughts [/h1]

This is a simple, yet incredibly good metro-vanilla-type game that I would highly recommend you try. You will have fun playing, and be immersed in the atmosphere. However, if you do not 100% of the achievements, it might be expensive due to the amount of playtime. I would recommend waiting until this game is on sale because you can get really good deals. I got the first and second games for only 11 dollars, which is a steal.

Ori and the Blind Forest offers a certain experience, and it just wasn't for me. I enjoyed most of my time with it. It was fun - not necessarily amazing, but good. But over and over, I found myself getting annoyed by small things - unclear mechanics, puzzles that require you to do something you've never done before, the fact that you can practically softlock yourself by saving deep in enemy territory with low health (you respawn with the same amount of health you save with). Individually, they wouldn't be a big deal, but there were a lot of them, and they added up.

Tangent (no spoilers): [spoiler]That last one might sound like something you'd only do on purpose, but because you can save anywhere [i]and the game is designed around you being able to do that[/i], it's easy to repeatedly save with a little less health and a little more progress and run out of health before you reach the next heal. It is possible to reload a previous save, but it's really not obvious that it's an option, and in my opinion it's a mistake that it has to be an option at all.[/spoiler]

The best analogy I can think of is Apple products vs Android/Windows/Linux. Apple products are smooth, sleek, and easy to use by default, but a lot of people dislike them because (among other reasons) there are so many limitations and lack of advanced features/customization/tweakability. If you want something to just work with as little effort on your part as possible, I would guess you like Apple products (a totally valid opinion), but if you want it to work [i]well[/i], I'd imagine you prefer to avoid them (which is where I personally stand).

Ori and the Blind Forest is the embodiment of an Apple product here. It does an amazing job at the aesthetics - everyone says it's a beautiful game, and I agree. I just wish it didn't come at the cost of everything else.",1692467814,1692468111,False,2,2,0.493979692459106445,0,True,False,False

It's an unquestionably beautiful game with stunning artwork and exceptional detail. You could truly get lost in the visuals which might be some of the best in any video game ever. It's truly that breathtaking and evocative.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3007766422

The audio is similarly well done. Not quite to the peerless excellence of the artwork, but the OST is ethereal and pretty, and the in game tracks all are perfect for what they are.

The platforming and combat are extremely tight and the controls are as responsive as I've seen in such a game. Also, the upgrade system gives you a very real sense of progression, allowing you to access new parts of areas you've already visited, and just to enjoy a steady flow of new abilities.

The story, so far as I got into it, was pretty dark and sad. The intro can really make you feel pretty bad, and as you progress, you realize that while the game steers you in a hopeful direction, the path is littered with heartache.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3007766385

So, this all sounds like a winning combination of aspects that come together into a brilliant gaming experience, and that is actually factual. What I realized however, is that I don't have the patience for the increasingly complex puzzles, which require very precise platforming, multiple reflex based phases, and aiming that I can do, but not without getting pissed off lol. The actual solutions are pretty obvious, but the actual act of accomplishing them is more than I am personally willing to put myself through.

So...I definitely recommend this game if you are patient and don't mind repeating the same thing over and over trying to get it just right, rinse and repeat. If instead, you are at all impatient or prone to rage quitting games, this is a game better YouTubed instead.

The platforming is hard at first, or the enemies feel like they kill you too quickly. You feel clumsy but as you put points in to your abilities you find that Ori is actually a bouncy bean and hops from place to place with the ease of someone who's done parkour all their lives. I'm slightly biased now because whenever I think of Ori I'm reminded of my Ma and funny memories with her while playing this game, but the story should resonate with most people. Loss, hurt and anger are all emotions we've felt at one point in our lives. The graphics and music soundtrack is gorgeous, just be prepared to listen to the same part over and over for a section you can't get the parkour or timing right on.

This is another example that proves that graphics aren't everything. Gameplay is what matters most.
The graphics look good, the story is light and interesting, the music is great, but the crushing difficulty broke everything for me. I tried to get through the game to see how the story ends, but the extremely difficult gameplay made me rage quit at every session.
The developers were really creative in making the enemies really annoying, designing insta-death traps everywhere, weird platforming mechanics and other shit. I give them that.

Controls are a big issue as well. The character always moves a bit further than you intend, the movement acceleration is weird (I can't find the correct words to describe this). You can easily get stun locked to death or get snapped to a death trap, which feels really cheap. I'm not new to this kind of games and not a newbie gamer. This game has serious issues with controlling movement, which is a crucial aspect of the game. I could swear I can make all jumps and platforming with much more ease if it was any other game of the same genre. I like a good challenge, not cheap artificial so-called difficulty.

Most of the skills you unlock feel useless. I'm already past half of the game, unlocked half of the skill tree points, and they only have very little to non-existing effect on the gameplay.

FYI The game doesn't have auto-save. You save manually anytime and almost anywhere as long as you have a power cell left. So save often.. if you still decided to play the game...

I didn't want to win a medal or get a world record, I just wanted a good game to enjoy and relax, and have a good time. This game clearly doesn't offer that. I would rather play Dark souls than this game. At least Dark souls is fair, Ori isn't.
I'm glad I didn't buy the second game (Ori and the will of the wisps). What a waste of time and money.. and what a disappointment.",1691054700,1691054700,False,9,0,0.637937784194946289,0,True,False,False

Why in the world would you give the player a total of 15 health points, damage reduction, and even difficulty options (???), and then design tons of instant-death hazards? Ori is obviously inspired by games like Metroid, and yet I don't remember *any* Metroid game with as many tedious deaths as this one. It also flies in the face of the pretty visuals and the traversal mechanics you unlock that give you freedom of movement; you're moving along swiftly enjoying the visuals, and then if you get hit by the wrong thing, instant death.

This game stands out as the most challenging platformer I have ever played. Unlike other platformer games, Ori and the Blind Forest does not include any boss battles. However, the enchanting soundtracks and stunning art style make me love Ori and the Blind Forest even more.

The game's ability to create such an immersive atmosphere sets it apart in the platformer genre. When combined with its emotional story, Ori and the Blind Forest becomes a true masterpiece.

The game also suffers from lack of ability to reload, so you have to basically constantly commit suicide if you take a hit because there is no point in going any further if you screw up early in long segments as enemies and spikes do so much damage. I probably spent half my time just wasting time killing myself on spikes on purpose. I used to hate instant death spikes but ori made me want them back because the time waste trying to kill myself was immense. The devs knew this too - there is a death counter. How many platformers have a death counter?

The game accidently let me save on spikes and softlocked. You can find many posts on steam forums you will see lots of posts of people with softlock situations. You have to quit to menu to find the hidden mechanic to load a previous save. It's not hinted to exist at all. 

Now the art style. It's nice, high def, muted pastel asthetic, but has a lot of visual clarity problems. Spikes and hazards blend in and often overlap with edges of what is normally walkable areas. The problem is even non-spiky parts of spikes will hurt you. How do sides of long shafts of spikes hurt you? Some of your and enemy projectiles look the same and are the same color, especially with spiders. You are both making big multishot flashes all over the screen and so you can't even see their projectiles. You have to stop shooting so you can even see them shoot back at you. 

There are also areas you can't ever get back to with upgrades that can be missed forever. Fun! Oh, I and hope you enjoy playing 5 minute long escape sequences from these forever gone places where you die in 1 hit and have to redo them over and over to find that couple pixel on the map where you can hide don't die. Die at the 4 minute mark, well start over before you can find those pixels.

The game gives you, surprisingly, a save button to save anywhere in exchange for resources, and it even has the kindness to let you recover health by doing so. This sounds great: auto-balancing challenge with resource management. It is all, however, a dirty lie, because the resource is so abundant that you can just save after every challenge, practically.

This makes the game a constant back and forth between saving, the devs laughing at your face for not knowing what was to come, then you avoiding the trap, and repeat. The game does have difficult sections, so it's not like it's all a breeze. My favorite ones, are, however, those in which they don't let you save, but still set a bunch of gotta-know traps so you have to reset from the start of the level sequence.

I can't say much about level design of secrets, because although I began taking notes of places I wanted to re-visit and clues for that, I dropped it when the game dropped the ball. Also, minor complain, why is it so frequent in this game to have foreground elements that look like background elements. Which kill you. Aa.

Besides all of that, it feels mechanically nice. Maybe a bit too much buttons to press, but that's just getting used to it. I don't like how Ori just accelerates like a motorjet, but again, that's just me. Also, the game pretends to have mini-bosses. They are not, they are a joke. And not even a funny one. Then again, with the level design matter, I wasn't going to recommend it anyway, at this point I'm just clowning.",1690582807,1690582807,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
- This game is absolutely stunning visually. Every environment feels distinct, and the vibrant color palette ties it all together to bring this intricate world to life; animations are also fantastic. The game manages to be melancholic, oppressive, adventurous, and lighthearted all in the same breath.
- You can't mention Ori without talking about the soundtrack. Each song is composed beautifully, accentuating key moments and making exploration all the more enjoyable.
- Ori himself controls phenomenally. Every movement feels fluid, and all of the many abilities you will unlock over the course of the game fit together to make some of the most satisfying movement from a platformer I've seen in quite a while (Bash is the greatest thing ever).
- Combat is basic but there is still a good amount of enemy variety that helps to keep things fresh.
- The narrative is executed very well for the most part, and delivers a simple yet touching story.
- Exploration is great, and each level was a joy to go through, especially the action-packed escape sequences following each of the three main 'dungeons'.
- Extra Definitive Edition content is also a welcome addition, providing yet another fun and well-crafted area to traverse.

Cons:
- For a metroidvania, Ori is almost completely linear. This is not a bad thing inherently, as each section of the game is masterfully crafted your first time through. However, side content/exploration/backtracking that followed the main story did not feel particularly inspired, and ended up being lots of locked doors that I simply needed late-game power-ups to access (Which I do not mind, but most of these were simply that and nothing more. I would have liked to see a bit more effort here - such as extra puzzles or combat encounters). It can't have been that bad though, because I still decided to 100% my save file.
- Soul Link is an interesting and unique mechanic, but I do still have somewhat mixed feelings about it.
- Despite the commendable enemy variety, the combat mechanics themselves are a bit lackluster, and fighting enemies did feel somewhat repetitive by the late-game.
- There are admittedly a couple story moments that I found a bit pointless, lowering the impact of other events considerably (will not be elaborating to avoid spoilers).


Ori and the Blind Forest is a triumph, and it's insane to think this was Moon Studios' first game. I am greatly looking forward to playing the sequel.

Ori and the Blind Forest is a great platformer, but it might be lacking in replayability if that's something you like about metroidvania games.

The platforming itself feels great, with every new mechanic you get access to throughout the game lending itself very well to making movement feel fluid and seamless. Combat is a bit on the dull side, with very few differing enemy designs across the whole game, the player often getting to meet reskinned enemies with slightly different behavior and upgraded stats as they progress. As such, there are no bosses, with chase sections that test your platforming skills taking their place. This admittedly fits the game's strengths to a T.
Outside of gameplay, the game's visuals, sound design, OST and the storytelling complement each other perfectly to deliver a great atmosphere and make the forest of Nibel feel alive. Exploring the wilderness is made very intuitive thanks to how the in-game map functions, though it might make it a bit too easy if exploring is what you enjoy most out of a metroidvania.

Very fun, and I'll likely play it again! For sure recommend it.

The soundtrack and sound design is just as good, really fitting the tone of the situation and feeling like a movie. I'm afraid, though, that the gameplay doesn't live up to this game's presentation.

The platforming physics are incredible. Near the end of the game, after obtaining all of the abilities, platforming through the final section felt immensely satisfying. Being a long-time Mario fan, I love 2D platformers to death, so needless to say, those segments were my favorite part of this game. Of course, since I've already played so many 2D platformers, I've become quite good at them. This, I believe, is why I enjoyed this game so much. Which leads to my next point.

Here's the big platforming nitpick: This game can be hard. The wrong kind of hard, the frustrating kind. The way you save your game is quite unconventional, using entirely manual saves that take some of your magic energy to create. Imagine Celeste's respawn system, but instead of it triggering at the start of every room, saving is entirely done by the player, and can be created on any solid ground. Forgetting to save and needing to replay sections can be discouraging, and I ended up doing that throughout the entire game. even up to the final area I was forgetting to save at times. If you're out of magic energy, it can be very tough to make progress. And if you're in a section with very few energy pickups, you might just get stuck there for a while.

And now we talk about the combat, the weakest part of this game for most people. It's just as simple as people say it is. The whole thing is just spamming the X button, which is less than ideal, but I didn't mind it much. The enemies can be tough to dodge at times. I don't know what it is about them, but some enemies' attacks are so frustrating. Think of the Primal Aspids from Hollow Knight, but this time there's more like 3 or 4 enemy types in this game that are like them.

The Definitive Edition adds two abilities to the game which I have mixed feelings about. These abilities are the Dash and the Light Burst, and they make platforming a bit too easy. They are entirely optional pickups, but the strange thing is that the skill tree lets you unlock upgrades for these two powerups without ever picking them up in the first place. For example, I saw an upgrade on the skill tree with the description ""Allows Ori to also dash in midair."" (something like that) and when I spent my points on it, I was quite disappointed when I realized it was an upgrade to an ability I hadn't found yet. So please, if you end up playing this game, and you unlock or see something you don't understand, just look it up. This doesn't mean the Definitive Edition is the worse version though. It adds a fast travel system, which I used extensively during my playthrough, as well as more accessible difficulty options. So in the end the positives of the re-release outweigh my problems with the new abilities.

This is the longest Steam review I've ever written, but I've never played through a game where I had this much to say about it. This game isn't perfect, It's quite flawed actually. But I really, thoroughly enjoyed playing through it, and I hope whoever is reading this decides to try it out.

Ori and the Willow of the Wisps discussion is more suited for its on review but I'll comment that the sequel 100% improves in every aspect from the first game. 
A lot of reviews mention the comparison between Hollow knight and both Ori games, but I think the comparison does not apply nearly as much to the first game. Apart from being in the same genre (metroidvania 2D platformer) Ori and the Blind Forest and Hollow Knight have very little in common. Mainly because the first Ori game focuses on platforming, escape sequences and puzzle solving rather than fighting or exploration. The game is essentially linear compared to Hollow Knight's multitude of ways you can traverse the map. If you're looking to get Ori and the Blind Forest, it won't be like Hollow Knight.

The progression of the game is really intuitive, when you get a new skill, the difficulty and the learning curve is really easy, and a neophyte of metroidvania and even video games in general can understand and come up with difficult passages quite easily.
The level design is well thought out, and when you think you can't access parts, you just have to watch carefully.

[b] Negatives part [/b]: Got too much bugs for the achievements, could finish the game more early.

[b] Warning [/b] (for those who wants to 100% the game or for those who wants to get some achievements) :

- For the achievements who need to kills ennemies with some specifics attacks, there is a chance to not get the achievement if you have died in the session before, so for this restart the game and steam, it should work
- For the One Death achievement, if you have died and you have restarted directly through the game, instead destroy your save and start over in another one.
- If you play a big game, to discover the game, be careful with the ""difficult mode"", do not try to have all the skills, it requires 1.5 x more points or even twice as many to obtain them all.

It's very pretty, but that aside the mechanics are just meh. Not offensively bad, but far from being remarkable. The combat was way too simple. Your basic attack essentially boils down to button mashing at a distance and the other skills presented (with maybe a single exception) are just somewhat generic and boring at times. The other reviews I read also hyped up some mind-blowing emotional story which I simply didn't think was there. It was a fine story but other than maybe the intro it never really pulled me in and make me feel for the characters and world the way some reviews would make you believe.

That isn't to say this is a bad much less weak game, it's still a great metroidvania worth your time! The way the world begins to open as you go somewhere new, gain a new ability, have a tutorial built into the environment as you climb/explore outwards, and then backtrack through once unreachable paths is handled to a masterful degree. As well as most mechanics overall working for what the game wanted to accomplish.

I will say, some sections can easily feel uncomfortable to play, and they can easily overstay their welcome due to issues I find in the movement system and pacing, I find that the ice temple (I forget the name of it, sorry!) is generally poorly communicated as well as designed, the puzzle mechanic is hard to pick up on because it never gives you a space to tinker with the gravity mechanic used there, as well as the chase section being unreasonably difficult and poorly communicated to the player in most aspects, this made it hard to trust that I would enjoy following chase sections, and sadly, I think the final chase before the credits is also pretty bad in communicating to the player. Adding on to that with the end-game area being a massive spike in difficulty from the rest of the game, it can get frustrating to play with generally poor pacing of difficulty and easily frustrating execution of mechanics. However! I find that majority of the game is a genuine pleasure to go through and experience, the rough edges do not ruin the whole package for me, as there's lots of great aspects here! (This is also where I mention I think that Will of the Wisps executes basically everything here I had problems with to an extremely phenomenal level of game design and you should totally play that game too)",1689143552,1689143552,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Bought the game to relax from my examination week. However, to my surprise, the game turned out to be an exceptional experience, surpassing my expectations of it, so I decided to create a review. Ori and the Blind Forest effortlessly blends stunning visuals, enchanting storytelling, and tight gameplay mechanics to create an unforgettable gaming experience(mainly due to dying), like literally I can't recount how much I died from this game, which made me more stressful which is a good thing right?..

[b] Story [/b]
The game introduces players to Ori, a small guardian spirit tasked with restoring the forest's balance after a catastrophic event. Through the course of the game, Ori's journey becomes a metaphor for self-discovery, friendship, and sacrifice. The storytelling is done primarily through visual and atmospheric cues, with minimal dialogue, yet it manages to tug at the heartstrings and elicit genuine emotions from me.

[b] SOUND DESIGN [/b]
The game's sound design and music deserve special mention. The orchestral score composed by Gareth Coker perfectly complements the game's visuals and emotional beats The melodies are hauntingly beautiful, capturing the essence of each moment. Combined with the atmospheric sound effects, the audio immerses players in the world of Ori and adds an extra layer of immersion. 

[b] VISUAL [/b]
One of the most striking features of Ori and the Blind Forest is its breathtaking visual design. The colors are rich and varied, seamlessly transitioning between serene and tranquil moments to intense and action-packed sequences. The visual beauty of the game is further enhanced by the fluid animations. In short this game is good in sense of atmosphere, visuals, sound design.

[b] GAMEPLAY [/b]
Beyond its aesthetics and narrative, Ori and the Blind Forest boasts polished gameplay mechanics that are both challenging and rewarding. The platforming elements are finely tuned, demanding precise timing and nimble reflexes. Although I recommend this game [b] I WOULD NOT [/b] recommend it to people who are looking to play [b] tension-free gameplay[/b]. While Ori and the Blind Forest offers an incredible gaming experience, it's important to note that the gameplay can occasionally be intense and challenging, leading to moments of frustration. It's like a relationship with a mischievous spirit that tests your patience, and occasionally makes you question your life choices, but you can't help but keep coming back for more for the sake of completion. ㅜㅜ

[b] CONCLUSION [/b]
Ori and the Blind Forest is an extraordinary game that excels in the visuals, storytelling and.. gameplay(if you like intense challenges I guess). Would I play it again? YES AND NO, I have a love-hate relationship with this game so I can't really decide.

First and foremost the Ori games look and sound beautiful, the artwork and animation are impressive with special attention being paid to lighting and particles that give the game's ethereal world so much atmosphere only added to by the orchestral world-music score. The game looks like a high quality animated feature every step of the way. The gameplay is all about mobility. The world is built to be a playground that you slide, twirl, jump, and bound through making Ori feel like they're truly at home in the forest through control alone. 

Every motion naturally flows into another and the world design encourages you to make use of every option, with the later movement unlocks only making every journey even more swift and natural to counterbalance the world map's constant expansion. Combat is simple and revolves around button mashing to bypass foes but this game isn't about fighting its the puzzle platforming. Using the high quality movement mechanics to navigate spatial challenges in beautiful spaces collecting items to continue forward. 

Each area has an elemental gimmick that is used to provide new movement challenges keeping things fresh throughout. It goes to show that creativity doesn't require crazy new ideas, even basic platforming and old level themes can be executed well to provide a rewarding gameplay experience. This game even foregoes boss fights, instead presenting big cinematic platforming sections that challenge you to get from A to B using all the tricks you've learned in the previous area. It's actually really clever to see Ori playing constantly into its biggest strength.

The story is minimal but revolves around the cycles of life and death in the large ethereal forest setting. Just as the gameplay focuses on doing one thing well, so too does the story focus on singular strong themes that resonate throughout the entire game and left me tearing up on several occasions.

Overall Ori is a solid metroidvania and while it doesn't have flashy tools or hardcore combat its game design goes to show the strength of minimalism and remains a masterclass in moving through 2D spaces.",1688903936,1688903936,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I spent a good amount of time on this game when I was younger (10, 11, 12 maybe) and tried to pick it up again to finish it which I had never done before. I did this because one of my most trusted game reviewers said it was one of his favorites of all time and because it was on sale for cheap. I still refunded it because it didn't feel worth keeping.

What are the issues? From what I either experienced or looked up on YouTube after refunding it, this is what I can gather:
- The environments are ugly and dark. No, this is not a setting on my computer. Everything feels so abysmal, even the lighter and cheerier areas. Never once did I see something and go ""Wow! That looks visually impressive, or even visually tolerable!"" 
-The story can literally be explained in thirty seconds or less. There are no captivating details or lore or intricacies to the world that make it worth mentioning. When I say within thirty seconds, if you're a fast enough talker, you can probably explain every lore-related game mechanic in an additional twenty.
-The save system is so lame. I don't want to have to see the same cutscene over and over again because I don't have energy or just forgot to save. Either they should have done autosave or they should have just done a more integrated and widespread checkpoint system of sorts, making ability upgrades a mobile endeavor.
-The mechanics are truly awful. What kind of combat is there? You click a button and it hurts enemies. No aiming or anything rewarding associated with it. You can also hold down a button if you feel saucy. The platforming is punishing, but not really punishing for the sake of difficulty, more like punishing because the jumps aren't outlined well enough to land consistently. The jumping, climbing and other mechanics didn't feel polished at all.
In summary of that section of the review, traversal, managing saves and combat were just chores on the way through a semblance of a story that literally could have been cranked out in twenty minutes in a conference room.

What does this game have to offer? It's not intellectually challenging or emotionally moving enough to grab my attention, but the ""spiritual"" adventure that it pushes is almost equally underwhelming when the world feels so uninspired almost all of the time. I might just be a hardass but this game is an incredible letdown. I'm going to buy the next one at some point to see if it improves upon the formula, but if it doesn't then I really have nothing good to say about this series.

It's not bad, I just personally think there are better alternatives for pretty much everything it has to offer, and my experience didn't come close to the hype surrounding it. The art is outstanding, but as a metroidvania, it feels to me like it falls short on every single aspect compared to its peers – which is apparently a sentiment [i]not[/i] shared by many people. I'll go into detail below, spoilers will be marked.

The exploration is not very interesting or rewarding – the game tells you exactly where you need to go, and due to its extreme linearity, you get absolutely nothing from going off the beaten path; in terms of secrets, most of what you get is XP that you'll have probably maxed out by the time you get to the last dungeon regardless of how much you've actually explored, the rest is health/mana upgrades that become basically useless down the line due to unlocking skills that drastically reduce damage received and mana costs. The only case where I can see these secrets being actually meaningful is in hard more, but it's pretty clear that this difficulty setting was not intended for a first playthrough due to the fact that almost everything one-shots you in the early game, aka the part where you're supposed to play around the most to figure out the ""rules"" of the game.

Combat gets stale real quick; bash is a very cool power – if you play on controller, that is – but it completely erases the need to dodge enemy attacks, so encounters become a matter of mashing the (auto-aim) attack button as quickly as possible while holding the bash button as soon as you see something move. It could've turned out interesting nonetheless if the devs had gotten more creative with enemy designs, but alas, only two of them have gimmicks that actually require you to approach them differently; for everyone else, spamming attacks and bashes is more than enough. The other powers are basically useless in combat, aside from the insanely powerful ground stomp whose AoE is so humongous that you're more likely to hit enemies by accident than miss them.

Platforming is nice, arguably the best part of the game, but it's not as good as dedicated platformers, and I personally don't think there's anything that makes up for the difference. Besides, I feel like some sections are somewhat poorly balanced, with hazards either dealing so little damage that you can just walk on them without issue or instantly killing you for a single mistake – in which case, you'd better have set up a save point not too long ago, or you'll have to make your whole way there all over again. Admittedly, the sheer speed you can traverse the map with in the late game is quite satisfying, but it feels like the game actively tries to slow you down at times, making it feel kinda pointless.

Finally, the story. It starts off great, and you get the sense that things aren't quite the way they seem from the beginning. But in the end, it left me really confused about its message. Like okay, [i]""don't let hatred consume you or you'll lose the things you care about the most"",[/i] but how can you look me straight in the eye and tell me that [spoiler]Kuro is the bad guy for desperately trying to protect her only remaining child from the god that murdered her entire family along with Ori's adoptive mother just because he lost track of Ori, and [i]HE's the good guy???[/i] The one you serve throughout the entire game with no second thoughts? It doesn't make any sense to me. I was expecting a nuanced take on the balance between light and darkness, something about neither of the two things being inherently good or evil, and as such, neither deserving to be overwhelmed by the other. What I got instead was a banal [i]""light is good, and if darkness has to be suppressed for its sake, then so be it. What's that? Innocents dying because of this? It is what it is, man.""[/i][/spoiler]

That's about it. As I said in the beginning, I don't think the game is terrible, but I just don't see any reason to recommend it over pretty much any other metroidvania I've played, unless you're a fan of platformers trying to get into the genre and you're put off by ""traditional"" combat, or conversely, you've exhausted all other options and are itching for yet more metroidvania (which was more or less my case, but in hindsight, I should've picked something else).",1688760602,1688760602,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False

Pros:
- Very good graphics for a 2016 game, i love it. even my friend said the same thing when playing it the first time

-Good story telling  and world building.a little guardian ghost charged with restoring the forest's equilibrium following a disaster. The tale is told mostly through visual and ambient clues, with little language. very little but i feel emotions kicking back to me.

- amazing soundtrack, every music in this game changes through different levels and scenarios, some make the game more intense thought out the chase. Every music is perfect through different levels because it represent a very rich characteristic and surroundings to that level itself to make the game more alive

- one of the best level design, even though there are some level that are really annoying and hard to time it right, i enjoy playing it nonetheless. bu i think this section lead to its cons since you have to really have a checkpoint save after going through so far so you wont have to restart to all over again

To start off, the combat is almost non-existent in this game, it consists of button mashing a single button to kill enemies while standing completely still and once you are 30% through the game there is really no reason to ever kill enemies again. the damage done to enemies is so small its a complete chore to sit there for 15 second to kill a single standard enemy. Once you get the ability to launch off enemies, I think I maybe killed 10 enemies the rest of the game. You do not scale with the enemies and the abilities you obtain through the skill tree are all but useless.

Movement in this game is not smooth in the slightest, it is way to floaty and non consistent. CLimbing up walls is a headache, trying to land precisely on a platform is a gamble and waiting for a specific enemy to line up perfectly for a platforming section is a casino slot machine.

When traversing the world, it is near impossible to see what is going to kill you. Are those just boring bushes or are those spikes? It is so unclear when something will damage you it is hilarious. This game greatly sacrifices any clarity for the sake of art direction. The least enjoyable parts of the game were the ""escape"" portions in each of the area. These were not a test of skill, but a continuous beating your head against a metaphorical wall until you finally escape. You are running along and a rock falls on your head with no visual clue, time to restart the entire sequence until I get surprised again by some BS. The only way to know is through trial and error, so you end up being forced to do this portion a ton of times until you know all the gimmicks that will be thrown your way. A skilled individual should be able to do these in just a few tries not be forced to die at every step of the way because of lack of clarity.

Exploration is almost non existent in this game unless you are trying to 100% the game. Extra health doesn't matter, extra soul doesn't matter, getting new skills in the skill tree do not matter. Unless you want to explore to see a hole in ground and get a shiny orb to get more useless stuff, exploration is worthless. There are no cool ares or power ups that you get from going out of your way to explore the world. Also there are so many points in the game where you can't go back and get something you missed so if you are trying to get everything and miss it once, you're fucked.

(spoilers) And for a game that is known for its ""great story"" I was appalled at what was going on. The purpose is for you to restore the forest and save this magic tree while trying to escape the wrath of an owl. Turns out the tree absolutely murders the the owl babies and now we are still supposed to save the tree?? Fuck that I'm teaming up with the owl and burning this place down. I'm not trying to save a baby owl murderer. And at the end the only way for the owl to save his last baby is to get himself killed by the tree. That is so fucked. I hope in the sequel I get to burn the tree down.",1688621164,1688621164,False,1,0,0.476377934217453003,0,True,False,False

While the challenge is very clearly present, it doesn't make world progression overly cryptic which is quite nice - most of the challenge comes in navigating hostile environments, which  can get a little annoying at times. To give an example, some environmental spikes have extremely deceptive collision detection, and there are certain parts of the game involving extreme timing and perfection and may require several restarts. There were a few areas that felt like some of the harder levels in Super Meat Boy (very challenging). That said, if you play the game right, you won't be backtracking too much, which is a particular peeve of mine typically present within this genre. Acquired abilities are useful outside of their progressionary intent, which is also refreshing.

I can't however mention enough how beautiful this game is. The art style is lush and vibrant; terrain and backdrops look almost as though they have been painted, creating a truly joyful atmosphere. The soundtrack is also pretty solid and only adds to the games charm. There is a story present, albeit a basic one, but this certainly doesn't detract from the general gameplay, and some feels were had in certain parts of the game. I thoroughly enjoyed this game and will look forward to playing the sequel! The most important advice I can give regarding this game, is to not be fooled by the Ghibli-esque visuals. This is a TOUGH game, harder than Hollow Knight and instead more comparable to the Path of Pain sections at certain points.

The soundtrack is incredible and fits in so well with the different parts of the storyline. The controls and mechanics are introduced at a pace that keeps the game interesting, while also giving you time to learn them so you don't get overwhelmed with all the moves and abilities that can be used. I have completed the main story on normal mode, and the gameplay is challenging (and sometimes a bit rage-inducing) but it stays interesting by giving you a vast range of unique areas to explore, and puzzles to solve. The main character, Ori, is animated so well and when using all the different abilities, the animation is smooth. While there are no 'bosses' in this game, this is greatly redeemed by having [spoiler]various fast paced escape sequences where you utilise what you have learnt in a challenging race against dangers that are so beautiful and they make you feel so good once you complete them :)[/spoiler]
My only criticisms are that the manual saving is a bit awkward and a lot of the enemies are just re-skins of previous ones, with slightly different abilities.  

However i have a few tips for those who are new:
- You will die a lot, Don't let the graphics fool you, this game is difficult. If you wanted a relaxing game, this is not what you are looking for
- Save your game a lot. The game doesn't autosave very often and if you die you will go back to your last save so do this to avoid losing your progress.
- Early game spoilers: [spoiler] Collect as many life/energy cells as you can earlier on so that you will find late game a lot easier. Often in late game you wont be able to save due to a lack of energy so more energy points helps with this :)[/spoiler]

I especially loved the escape sequences for their added tension, and the feeling of flow that they create. I do have one complaint that took away a decent bit from my experience, though.

I typically enjoy the hard difficulty on most games. But on Ori, I would recommend avoiding this. The combat in this game is a bit of an afterthought, and hard mode REALLY demonstrates this. Mashing one single button while an orb does all the work for you is NOT fun, especially when hard mode just nerfs your health and damage making these sections last even longer. Pop it in on normal or even easy to hide these issues and you're in for a fun time.

This game deserves praise for its good ideas (the bash move is especially genius), but even more for its presentation. The visuals and soundtrack are both stunning. Combined with the story, this feels like playing through an A-tier Pixar movie. Also, without this game, Ori and the Will of the Wisps wouldn't exist-- and that game is an absolute masterpiece.

Floaty controls, auto-grabbing/hopping of ledges, an art style that makes background hard to distinguish from foreground, unintuitive hazards and mechanics, a completely uninteresting combat system that involves spamming a single button which auto targets enemies which is 100% invalidated and made pointless by bash, a single path upgrade system, pickups that don't matter, special moves able to be bought before they are able to be used, all enemies that exist solely as a means to attack you and interrupt platforming, boss fights that are beyond meh, forced cutscenes which cannot be skipped that replay every time you respawn unless you save afterwards, and a map that is the same in every area except with different background textures ... this game is the most overrated thing I have ever come across.

It is very clear the game designers were artists and not gamers. There is nothing fun about this game. There is no real incentive to exploring, no gratification in the platforming, endless frustration with the game taking control out of your hands, the areas are uninteresting, the levels are designed in ways that are annoying and not fun, mechanics are applied inconsistently, there's hardly any variety of enemies, the screen moves too slowly and can't keep up with your character which is too zoomed out to see clearly with all the foreground/background objects being intermixed ... it is literally almost every single aspect of the game that is the problem.

For a platformer, the motion feels too floaty and uncontrolled for the environment. It might be better with a controller than with a keyboard, but a [i]remastered[/i] version of a game should just get this right. But that's only where it starts; it's often very hard to estimate, from looking at the environment and having had some exercise with your motion, whether you should or shouldn't be able to make the jump with your current abilities. If you're making a Metroidvania platformer, this should be a disqualifying quality.

Not only is it hard to estimate whether you can make that jump, but also whether the enemy that's barely even on screen can jump on top of you. This makes you want to run away at the first sight of any enemy that you haven't seen before (or sometimes even that you think you've seen before, but this shapeless blob looks slightly different and has wildly different attacks), and get ready to spam your attack when it gets near, because enemies take a ton of hits before you're done with them. And this is ""normal"" difficulty.

But what prompted me to uninstall the game, where the two times that the game design, in the sense how the game signals to you how to progress towards a goal, wasted my time.

In [spoiler]the first half of Black Root Burrows[/spoiler], the game will teach you a new mechanic by sending you through a whole obstacle course. After you're done with it, you're in a nearly empty room ([spoiler]the jumping puzzle immediately before you dispel the darkness in Black Root Burrows[/spoiler]). This is usually a game's way to tell you that [u]you don't really have to learn any new tricks, you just have to apply them[/u]. And that will leave you stuck, until you figure out that you can also drop the object you're holding, which is not something you were taught (through necessity, or hints, or by accident) during the obstacle course. What's worse, once you drop the object, all your dynamics have changed, so you'll jump over [spoiler]the ghost platform next to you[/spoiler] the first time around. You're going to need a few attempts, which each take a frustrating half a minute of retrieving the object and using it to get back up again. There's a reason that failures result in fast retries in games in this genre, but this game missed that memo.

I only did that puzzle because I was stuck on another puzzle. I had pushed a rock into what clearly was a ""slot"" near [spoiler]the well near Thornfelt Swamp[/spoiler]. If an object ""slots"" into something, then that's usually a game's way to tell you [u]it is in the right place and you don't have to touch it anymore[/u]. At that point, I could wall jump, so I tried jumping up from this rock onto a wall next to it, but I only grazed the corner of that wall each time. I didn't have the double jump ability that the ability tree hinted on, so I figured I needed to get that first. After scouting the entire map for something I might have missed, and getting stuck in the aforementioned part of [spoiler]Black Root Burrows[/spoiler], I returned to the rock. As it turns out, you can't push or pull the rock out of the slot, but your attempts to do so ever so slightly rotate the rock, giving you just enough pixels of extra jump height to jump up that wall.

[i]Ori and the Blind Forest[/i] really has nothing on [i]Hollow Knight[/i] (Metroidvania platformer) and [i]Celeste[/i] (not a Metroidvania, but a focus on skillful platforming). Those games at least left me with the feeling that I should've known better and could've done better each time I died or failed a jump.",1687887406,1687889416,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Never once was i frustrated whilst playing this game, everything felt fair and clearly explained. I found that backtracking was less prevalent in Ori compared to other metroidvanias I have played. 

The platforming was very satisfying and chaining together abilities always felt amazing and empowering. Compared to Hollow knight (the gold standard, some might say) the platforming is more forgiving but still a reasonable challenge.

[b] Ori and the Blind Forest [/b] is a [u] platform-adventure Metroidvania video game [/u] developed by [b] Moon Studios [/b] and published by [b] Microsoft Studios [/b]. The game was released for Windows and Xbox One in March 2015, and for Nintendo Switch in September 2019. Players assume control of [u] Ori [/u], a small white spirit, and Sein, the ""light and eyes"" of the Forest's Spirit Tree. Players are tasked to move between platforms and solve puzzles.

Let me start off with saying how [u] BEAUTIFUL LOOKING [/u] this game is ( and [b] Will of the Wisps [/b] gets better ). From the first 10 minutes into this game you already are amazed by the beauty this game throws into your eyes alongside tears because of what happens and how they set up the game of telling a story of [b] friendship, selflessness, and loss [/b]. This game indeed made me shed a few tears at a few moments of the game. The [u] Soundtrack[/u] of this game is also super chill and amazing to listen to be it in-game or outside of it. The [u] Gameplay [/u] is pretty straightforward and expected from a platform-adventure Metroidvania game but there is something about the movement that is in this game that is super easy but hard to master. As you play through the game you learn new [u] skills for combat and movement [/u] to use like powerful jump, hanging on walls or slamming into the ground with force BUT with new skills comes new challenges to master, an example is that Ori can fire energy orbs at nearby foes when he isn't avoiding them completely, and those creatures can be difficult to overcome. The blobs that stick to walls and ceilings? They aren't much of a hassle, at least until they coat the surfaces you need to cross and spit acid onto the ground. This game is in no shape easy even on easy difficulty, you need to learn from your mistakes and failure and master every move to be able to move into next area. Not gonna lie i actually did almost rage quit the game or shouted few bad words when i was playing on the hard difficulty but it was not that i was frustrated or game’s fault but instead it was just me failing on a part cause i either miss-timed it or rushed and the custom save system where you can use one energy point to save whenever you feel like to was the best choice developers did for this game 👏. The best part of this game has to be the [spoiler] the escape sequences few rooms have to offer as you restore light to this lost forest. They are intense and pulse-pounding BUT it makes you appreciate the game's visual artistry.  Multiple layers give each environment a lovely sense of depth [/spoiler]

[b] Overall to summarize. Ori and the Blind Forest is a beautiful, heart-touching and very clever game from Moon Studios and its story, soundtrack, world, graphics and art style is beautiful from start to end. Gameplay is also super fun to play and level design always keep you on thinking to be fast and responsive. I HIGHLY Recommend this game for its price point and looking forward to playing Will of the Wisps next [/b]

the story is beautifully crafted, evoking a range of emotions with little to no voice lines and very few expositions from a third-person perspective, akin to storytelling in a book. the characters and their relationships are endearing. i found myself genuinely invested in their fates, which made the game all the more immersive.

one aspect that truly impressed me is the game's attention to detail. every pixel feels meticulously placed, and the level design is a work of art. the controls are smooth and responsive, allowing for precise platforming and satisfying combat encounters. backtracking to older maps once you unlock higher-tier skills also felt very rewarding, always offering new exploration experiences.

above all, Ori and the Blind Forest Definitive Edition is a testament to the power of storytelling in gaming.
it effortlessly combines breathtaking visuals, a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack, and a touching narrative to create an unforgettable experience. the only unfortunate thing for me is that this game is relatively short, but there are ways to challenge yourself if you're looking for more playtime.",1686895267,1686895267,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

OatBF is a musical and artistic masterpiece, telling a simple but fairly interesting story full of emotion and magic. There is a lot to like here, including many good gameplay ideas that should work in theory.
However, the experience is unfortunately soured by some frustrating level design, repetitive combat, and sometimes overly complex/clunky controls which WILL cause unnecessary deaths. The manual save system also caused a lot of frustration for me.
You will find out quickly that this is a DIFFICULT GAME, even on normal difficulty, and I was very close to changing to easy a few times just so I wouldn't have to rerun whole sections for the 6th time (e.g. chase sequences which do contain checkpoints on easy), but I only gave in to 1 section.
I was mainly playing this for the story, and given I'm not an avid metroidvania player, had I known how frustrating it was going to be, I might not have bought it.

However, after taking some time to collect my thoughts, I am glad I got to experience it, and while I personally won't be playing it again or buying the sequel, for anyone who enjoys this style of game, there's plenty here to satisfy your tastebuds, and the experience alone is worth the discounted price.",1686503736,1686504712,True,6,1,0.616724729537963867,0,True,False,False

Pros:
- Graphics - it is really good, and the game doesn't require cool hardware to show its beauty. And there is something to show you for sure.
- Puzzles - they are really fun and kinda complex, don't know if i got stupid with primitive games that are common place these days, but i had to look for solutions a couple of times, or simply got lost, not knowing what to do and where to go.
- Variativity - sometimes i couldn't reach a secret place, or get through these obstacle courses, and i had to improvise, and it worked. Though later I would find out how i could do it with some new skills, or simply there were another way, still this is some satisfying feeling. But what makes it more thrilling - you don't even know, was that a developer's idea, or you simply doing it wrong, but at the end of the day you got what you were coming for, and this is still a small victory.
Cons:
- Length - I don't know if that's only my personal opinion, but I got the feeling like the game pretended to be longer, but this is a small issue since you already beat the game in like 10+ hours.
- Game design - I guess, this is personal too, but still, I thought you have to acquire a lot of skills to move forward and complete the game. I finished it and had like 40% of these soul link upgrades, but what made me ask a more serious question - I didn't have all the abilities that come from ""trees"". How is that possible for a metroidvania game? If I don't need all of these, why would I even bother vacuuming the map and playing for another 20 hours - to collect orbs that give me nothing? To make my playthrough easier because I didn't git gud?

In conclusion: if someone asked me if he should play this game, I'd say ""if you don't, you won't miss anything, and this is actually not that great"". I felt like I just wasted my time and achieved nothing.",1586080430,1686475229,False,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

As for the gameplay, you may have heard that the combat is bad but that only apply's to the basic attack. The ""Bash"" move you get early on is incredibly fun. It lets you catapult yourself off enemies and projectiles and even redirect projectiles into other enemies. Just use that as much as you can.

The platforming is where you'll really be tested anyway. The dungeons and boss fights are all platforming gauntlets. There's an occasional puzzle, but this game is a lot more Super Meat Boy than you might guess.

The game was challenging, sometimes frustrating, but overall a decent balance if you're willing to tough it out. I liked the puzzle sections but I won't lie about some of the solutions being unclear. I had to cheese some of the platformer puzzles to progress in the game lol. 

Now let's get down to my skill issues: I had a hard time 100% my save file due to an area that I missed which the map didn't indicate. I guess maybe that can be due to user error but it was literally a small section in the Ginso Tree that I visited but didn't step on. I literally went up and down the whole tree a good half a dozen times and let me tell you, I was about to cry lmao

With that being said, I didn't have as good of a time that I hoped I would with this game. Maybe it's because of the game's reputation and I expected a lot more from it. That's definitely a me problem though. There's various gimmicks throughout the game, especially in the major sections, most involving puzzles and platforming. I enjoyed a lot of them and when I figured out the solution to some of these section I was like ""Ohhh, I get it now. That's really that's cool."" 

I also liked the save anywhere mechanic but I do realize it could be a problem for some. You have to be strategic as it uses your energy but if you're like me then you did lots of the collectibles and abilities to mitigate this problem. Although, I can totally see this being extremely frustrating for younger players. 

I liked this game overall. The story was predictable and a little too saccharine for my tastes. It's the visuals and gameplay which I would say are mostly really good. The music was also good but some of the sections where the music is supposed to be emotional didn't really hit for me.

Once you get the full arsenal of movement the game becomes a lot more fun and almost trivial once you get the hang of things. I did have lots of fun zipping around and using enemies as bounce pads. The game rewards exploration and searching every nook and cranny to find something that can make Ori a much more fun character to play as.

I'd say the hardest parts about this game for me was honestly the sections with the owl, especially the last one. I was getting so mad after dying over and over that when the ending of the game occurred I didn't really care. I wish I felt some type of happiness or satisfaction with the ending but I didn't. Again, a lot of my problems boil down to skill issues and minor gripes with gimmicks, puzzles, and difficulty in some parts. 

I definitely would recommend this game if you're into platformers and/or metroidvanias. It's challenging and it has lots to offer in it's core gameplay loop. Would I play this again? Maybe but I don't plan on doing so anytime soon. If you're a completionist then this is probably gonna be one of more simpler games that you can 100%. I don't like giving out number scores for things but if I had to then I'd say this is a high 7, low 8.

The movement is very smooth - from the painfully restrictive state at the beginning of the game, it gets ridiculously round and multifaceted towards the end. It really is a platforming game, with added combat elements (compared to Blasphemous, Hollow Knight, Gato Roboto etc where the combat is just as if not more important than the parkour). 

What sours the impression somewhat is the writing. While the platforming is satisfyingly challenging, the story is basically on the level of childrens television - kinda like the Trine series. We solved all our issues with the power of friendship!- and then it ends... rather unimaginative for an IP of this quality.

Further, the dialogue of the wisp and the tree might as well not be there, as it brings nothing to the table (kinda just worsens the game, really). To compare with a different but similar game - Hyper Light Drifter has literally no dialogue in the entire game, and handles story and would-be dialogue exclusively through images and a wonderfully executed visual design. Gris has no dialogue to speak of either, and it probably functions better for it. Having what's essentially just the wisp from Zelda constantly explaining everything in all-too-concrete terms (we need to go to Fire Mountain and get the Fire Stone!) ruins the immersion more than it helps the player - it's a reminder that it's all Just A Game, and after experiencing HLD (or any other game in which the dialogue is handled in a less obtruse manner), a ""Just A Game""-game just doesn't cut it. At least not for a perfect 10.

Review:
Ori and the Blind Forest is an over-hyped game that fails to deliver on its promises. The captivating visuals and beautiful music may initially deceive you into thinking it's something special, but underneath the shiny surface lies a game that disappoints on multiple levels.

The difficulty is not a rewarding challenge, but rather an endless source of frustration. The relentless obstacles and punishing gameplay overshadow any enjoyment that could have been found.

The violence within the game feels excessive and unnecessary, disrupting the enchanting atmosphere that initially draws you in. The stark contrast between the stunning visuals and the grim violence leaves you feeling disconnected and disengaged.

Ultimately, Ori and the Blind Forest relies heavily on its superficial charm to mask its shortcomings. It's a disappointing realization that the game's appeal is nothing more than a bluff, leaving you with a hollow experience.

In conclusion, this game fails to live up to its reputation and falls short in delivering an enjoyable experience. Don't be fooled by the shiny look and pretty music, as they are mere distractions from the lackluster gameplay and overall disappointment that awaits you.",1585356841,1686184742,False,0,0,0.458333343267440796,0,True,False,False

- Attacking requires spamming one button while jumping around dodging enemies (just make it auto-attack FFS)

They attempted to make a game to please platformer fans and metroidvania fans all at once which just doesnt work. I saw a steam review that stated ""Your average platformer fan doesnt want to be drip fed power ups and be lost with tedious back tracking while your metroidvania fans dont desire the more linear powers that have to be given to appease the platforming. It just doesnt mix."" and as a platformer fan myself i have to agree

The pros:
- Amazing art design and world
- Emotional story that never fails to tug at your heartstrings 
- Decent combat with exceptional parkour.
- Amazing first 1/3 of the game where i would make no changes.

Hugely massive con:
- The level design is absurdly bad even for a metroidvania game. After the first of the 3 artifacts i had to look up a specific guide for where i was every 15 minutes and this is apparently really common. Every quick 1 minute long ""here is the dumb way to go/solution"" video got posted by unknown channels but they all got 200-400k views. That is insane that so many people have to flock to help because the level design is something to be ashamed of. Even on repeat i would probably be lost replaying an that is no fun so i decided to not go for 100% even tho i love the story and the actual gameplay.
- Another massive problem on my run was the developers not level designing for agility upgrades, since i got triple jump early i entered areas i should not of even been in...... i was in misty woods before the first artifact and another time i got lost because a crusher also shot me through the floor and i thought it was supposed to happen. When you unlock new areas too the game wants you to go to a specific area that isnt even near the new area because there was a crack in the ceiling that you can now break even tho the room was forgettable and you ran right past it and its in the middle of the map. Sometimes no hand holding just leads to sloppy level design


TLDR: Story is amazing and so is the artstyle and gameplay but idk if i would recommend due to lazy level design and unforseen player upgrades that can get you lost with no sense of how to return. I will give a thumbs up but i would suggest watching a walkthrough for the story instead. Literally cant give a thumbs down because the story rocked



EDIT AFTER 100%. Opinion on level design hasn't changed and this game is a nightmare for achievement hunters. No stone unturned is literally bugged, good thing i had a back up save to do a certain strategy to raise my secret count. Be careful if going for 100%, so many bugs. Even having any save game on your files where you bought an ability will void the achievement to do a run without buying abilities.... Had to download someone else's save online to correct that issue.",1685940880,1686033680,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I fell completely in love with Ori - the visual masterpiece along with the heartfelt story behind it and the immersive music.

The title says it all. And unbelievably fantastic representation of the Metroidvania genre with more of a focus on platforming than combat. A must-buy in my book.

Story-wise, this game has only a handful of characters with no dialogue in-between them (other than narration) and yet somehow puts every AAA game to shame with how emotionally impactful it is. A lot of people found the first 10 minutes of the game to be a tear jerker and the ending is somewhat similar. We witness character growth between 2 of the characters and honestly its great how nice and minimal yet well done the story is. 

The game is one of the most beautiful 2D games I've ever played (and the sequel is even better). There's more of an emphasis on platforming than combat in the gameplay and that is mirrored by the level design as well. This is opposed to Hollow Knight - which is more combat based - and Metroid - which is very mixed. It also lacks any of the RPG elements in Symphony of the Night and instead takes a Metroid approach, which is totally fine. There are plenty of times throughout the game when I thought ""That has to be all the skills in the game... right?"" they hit you with another one completely changing the way you can traverse some areas. 

Unlike Hollow Knight, which I found to be almost devoid of power-ups, this game has plenty. Although I will say by the end of the game they aren't nearly as useful. The game is chalked full with every corner having invisible walls, and short little puzzles to unlock more health, magic, or XP. 

Since combat is not nearly as important in this game its understandable that combat is also the weakest part of the game. You get an auto lock-on projectile, a ground-pound, and an one that lets you bounce off of enemy projectiles. But since combat isn't that important they never really throw that many enemies at you too often and the boss battles are non-existent. The sequel improves on this aspect considerably.

The Definitive Edition adds two optional new areas to explore and that have power-ups as well. Its not that huge of a difference, and so I wouldn't say its absolutely necessary to buy the Definitive Edition. 

All in all, this is one of the best Metroidvania games of all time. I've played every Metroid game and would have to put this up there next to Super Metroid in my opinion (not as revolutionary though, just enjoyment wise). You're getting a good 8 hours of gameplay with fantastic art direction and great potential for exploration. And for the price it's at? [b] 100% you must purchase this game! [/b] The sequel is also just as good and improves upon many of the mechanics in the game.

Beautiful environments and a cute story - there's a recurring theme of loss and new beginnings. Nice to see Ori go from a fragile weakling to a powerhouse over the course of the journey, which doesn't feel like a slog. Finished the game in 11-12 hours.

I do have a few gripes though. First off, there's no new game plus. I learned it's not uncommon for players who've played hard mode to attain only around half the upgrades by the end, which is what happened in my case. I discovered a power that's pretty much used to unlock doors to get stat and ability boosts just before I finished the game... by that point there's no incentive to level up unless you like returning to the places you've been and goofing around, which I don't.

This could just be an issue with my laptop but I also had an issue with the audio/video sync during cutscenes.

Unfortunately, they do not stand up to scrutiny and this mainly comes down to the unnecessary and inelegant inclusion of its metroidvania elements, which hinders the platforming core that is the crucial aspect that makes Ori stand out from the rank and file. 

Firstly, we must acknowledge that platformer fans and metroidvania fans are more dissimilar than they are alike, in spite of the latter´s frequent inclusion of the former´s elements. This means that by making a platformer metroidvania hybrid, the developers had to juggle several conflicting priorities that arose from trying to please both crowds, ultimately culminating into an experience that does not know what it wants to be.

Platformer fans appreciate and thrive off the inclusion of fun movement mechanics, engaging and demanding levels and the knowledge that they are improving at their parkouring skills, whereas Metroidvania fans tend to appreciate more extrinsic rewards, where improvement and progress is dictated by the constant drip-feed of power-ups, stat buffs and keys, whether they be power ups or just resi style keys, to open up the world. In essence, one thrives off the challenge faced and the dexterity acquired to match such odds where as the other is more concerned about the power fantasy.

Moon studios has NOT juggled these two divergent demands sufficiently deftly. The metroidvania world is both too simple to satisfy metroidvania fans but enough of a time waster with lack of relevant obstacles to bore even the most patient platformer fanatic. The mechanics are fun, but they are never pushed to their true limit by the level design, souring the experience for platforming fans, yet being too complex for metroidvania fans that want the progression in the game to level out the difficulty rather than feel the technical demand ramp up as the game progresses.

Even when given the chance to mitigate these conflicting demands by having the metroidvania platformer hybrid become more than the sum of its parts via tasteful mixing of platforming and metroidvania ideas, moon studios fails to deliver.

All optional secrets lead to a power up and little else, rather than, let´s say more fully fledged levels that rewards players who engage with the game and expand the initial scope of the world map, aspects that both types of players would greatly appreciate. Or how there´s a dearth of glitchless sequence breaking that the metroidvania genre is known for, creating diverse path for all the players, yet the game prefers to railroad you constantly.

What hurts most about any game, is not its faults but rather its missed potential. When I see what moon studios could have achieved with Ori, but ended up compromising with a middle of the road release,  I can´t help but tear up. 

Feel free to buy the game, I am sure it will last you a playthrough; now as to anything beyond that? Well, I have my doubts there, that´s for sure.",1685469361,1685480666,False,3,1,0.565217375755310059,0,True,False,False

It's fun to explore, get lost, backtrack, unlock new abilities and rediscover how you can interact with each of the many diverse environments. Upon completion, I got a very satisfying feeling of accomplishment and well-spent time.

I'm a slow player, but it took me around 15h to 100% the map and get all achievements that are available on the first play-through. At first, I thought it's a pity that the map doesn't have markers, but in the end I was able to get all collectibles and discover all secrets without getting bored with repetitive backtracking or looking up online guides. Once you unlock some abilities or beat some ""bosses"", it becomes easier to traverse other environments, which makes it faster and less boring to go back and get some collectibles that were unavailable before. 

The game is pretty well-balanced in my opinion: there were plenty of challenges that required multiple attempts and a combination of puzzle-solving with precision, but it was never so hard that I would rage-quit. I also liked chase challenges instead of boss-fights, just a personal preference, but it was more fun and less anxiety for me.

I usually play several games in parallel, depending on the mood, but once I started Ori, I couldn't stop until I finished it. Surprisingly, this wasn't because of an engaging story, but because of the fun gameplay and overall very enjoyable experience. I think the story-telling just didn't click with me (the god-like tree talking), but the animation in cut-scenes was amazing, just like watching a professionally made short animated film. The animation in the game itself is beautiful, it has an original style, detailed backgrounds and interesting character designs. I played it on a Steam Deck, but always connected it to the big TV screen to enjoy the visuals in details. And to just add to the complete experience, there is a beautiful, elaborate soundtrack, it really creates a great atmosphere and doesn't get old after playing for a while.

The first being the brainless combat where your projectile automatically locks onto enemies, making fights just dodging and mashing the attack button. Second being the ability to place checkpoints almost anywhere with no punishment for dying, making it easy to cheese parts of the game or mindlessly kill yourself with no care because there are no repercussions.

Ori has many things going for it - it's gorgeous, for starters. The music is beautiful. The art style, the aesthetic, the tone, it's all nailed to a T. The story, though simple, is evocative and simply told with minimal exposition. Honestly, the first 5 mins of this game has more story than Breath of the Wild does in it's entirety (fight me)

Where Ori really needs to be criticized though is in it's difficulty curve. Don't get me wrong, the gameplay is fun, challenging, and can be really rewarding. The platforming mechanics that you unlock throughout the game are really fun and integrated well into each area. However, the game really isn't combat focused, so it doubles down on insane platform challenges and puzzles, that get progressively more obnoxious as time goes on.
I've played Celeste. I am used to punishing pixel perfect platformers. But Celeste typically restricts things to being short loops, one screen in length. Ori makes you go through guantlets of difficult platforming sections that are riddled with one hit kills. Not really much point in having a difficulty setting if you just die in one hit 90% of the time anyway.
I actually played Ori when it first came out, and I couldn't beat it. It made me angry dying and really felt like I was being punished by the level design rather than not knowing how to use the mechanics. I swore I would replay it at some point, so now, here I am after having beaten it. It was still as obnoxious as I remember, maybe even more so, but I am glad I played it.
Ori is not for the faint of heart, and I wish it was actually an easier game that was more combat focused so that casual gamers could enjoy it's beauty. I still recommend it, but if you want to beat this game, you gotta be a ""git gud"" gamer. 
I'm gonna play the sequel next as I've heard it's better, hopefully it alleviates the problems I had with it.",1516343612,1684871879,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Didn't think much of it at the time, but I thought it would be a nice gift for her. I remember seeing her playing it from time to time, the message indicating that she'd started playing it popping up on the corner of my screen. There was always a certain small pride in seeing that, because to me it meant that she was enjoying my gift.
Last September she committed suicide.

After everything had more or less settled down from that, I sat down and booted up her computer. All that was on there was Chrome, Steam, Word, and a few games. One of them, of course, was Core keeper.
She had played this game to pieces, clocking over 170 hours and owning practically everything the game had to offer. She had used every square inch to its maximum potential, and was making ridiculous amounts of loot. It was only then did I see just how much she loved my present. No other game she played quite captured her affection as much as this one. None of her friends really knew about it, however; it seems like she preferred to keep it to herself. Like it was her own little bit of heaven she could turn to whenever she wanted.

And because of that, I can't help but smile whenever I play this game.

I cannot recommend it enough; every bit of hard work the developer put into this masterpiece shows in every single aspect. The music is catchy and memorable (I'll often find myself humming certain tunes from it), the world feels lived-in and natural, and the gameplay is incredibly laid back and enjoyable. It's hard to stop once I get invested in the game; minutes can easily turn into several hours. And now, with the multiplayer beta, I play for even longer with my friends, each of us dedicated to our desired jobs.

Story: 
Overly emotional, poorly implemented and uninteresting. Overall, pretty terrible.

The story is all about some magic trees that you need to revitalise. It doesn't hint at anything, or give you insights through clever world/level design, it pauses the gameplay, and makes you sit through annoyingly long cutscenes. It does this a lot, for pretty much every minor thing. There's a statue here? Better make you stop and wait while i explain the significance of it. No you can't skip it, and no you don't have a choice. You aren't allowed to do your own thing and have fun.
Honestly this really bugs me. If your game is story focused, that's fine. If you game has a deep lore or backstory, awesome. If you don't let me discover things through my own curiosity, then you may as well not bother. Grab my attention and pique my interest, then let me find out more. Don't force it, encourage it. Whenever something is added to an area to give backstory, it stops the game and starts a cutscene explaining everything in more detail than i care about. It makes a big deal out of everything, and even slows down my character as i approach the cutscene, as though it knows i'm bored and wants to spite me. Frankly, i don't care. If i want to know the significance of this random thing, i'd be paying more attention to clues and hints, or i'll interact with it. The story is honestly bad enough to completely ruin the game for me. I would let it slide if it weren't so intrusive, but it's too obnoxious to ignore.


Gameplay:
It's okay, but it's not good.

Your main attack is shooting little energy bullets. You don't shoot on your own, you have a little Navi like sidekick who does it. You don't control him. You tell him when to shoot, but not what to shoot at, or how he should position himself. If an enemy is behing a stick, you're screwed. How could this little flying fairy ever reach the other side of a stick. He doesn't hover a tiny bit higher, or move forward a little, he just waits until you have bad positioning. It's also extremely boring. Fighting is just standing somewhat near the enemies and repeatedly pressing X. It couldn't take less skill. You also get a lot of abilities throughout the game. These are really cool abilities with a lot of variety, and they all feel great to use. The way they're incorporated into the game is terrible though. One of the first ones you get is a little explosion ability that lets you break things. It only breaks these specific things at the start though, not anything later on. This cracked wall is different from the other cracked walls. Not visually, but why make sense, when you can instead add artificial length and more backtracking. Some of the abilities also have more complex capabilites. They aren't intuitive, and aren't explained at all though. The game has already shown that it is more than happy to pause everything while it sits there and talks, but that's only for the unimportant stuff. It doesn't stop to tell you how the game actually works. It doesn't explain the things that you need to know, and it's not designed well enough to teach you without explanations.


Controls: 
Meh.

Platforming is floaty and slow, fighting is bad, and the abilities aren't worth noting. The upside is the animations are outstanding and make everything feel really natural, but they are at a lower frame rate than the rest of the game for some reason, which kinda ruins the only good aspect of the movement.


World:
Pretty, but poorly built.

Graphics are great, the map is dense and detailed yet simple enough to understand and explore without getting lost; and the world is really nice to be in for the most part. This world is pretty great, but from the moment you get the dash you realise how not great the world is in terms of playability. This is also extremely apparent when using abilities outside of the area you got them. It feels like the abilities were added after everything else, which makes exploring extremely uncomfortable. The game also tries to prevent sequence breaking in a terrible way. If you try to just damage boost past spikes it's usually fine, but if you do it in certain places you will die instantly. Some spikes deal 3x as much damage as other spikes right beside them, as though the devs realised their mistake last minute and fixed it in the quickest way possible.
I forgot to mention the enemies, but overall they're pretty great. Not much to complain about. Wide variety, and interesting. The only issues with them steam from the controls, not the enemies themselves.

The best part is definitely the stunning visuals, every area of this game is absolutely gorgeous. And the accompanying music that plays is beautiful. I actually like this OST more than Will of the Wisps'.

This is a more platforming focused metroidvania than other metroidvanias I have played. It's where the gameplay really shines, as the combat is probably the game's biggest downside. The sheer amount of different movement options you have at the end of the game is insane. And the well designed levels compliment the movement system as you can almost always figure out where to go and which ability to use to get there.

The great platforming is probably at it's peak in the escape sequences of the game. These are the game's replacement for bosses. Now, these are masterfully crafted as they don't feel out of place like in many other games. And they aren't extremely easy either, you will fail at least a couple of times before you do them right. And the songs that play in these are so freaking good. I swear there is no better feeling than restarting the escape sequence right as the main theme leitmotif starts playing.

I don't know how to explain the story too much without spoiling a lot but know that it's very touching.

The main flaw of the game is the combat. It's just a button mashing simulator with absolutely zero depth because you don't even have to aim the attack. Although the abilities you can use for combat are really fun. I have seen many people point out the game's save system as a flaw because of the save points that you can create. I personally don't find these that bad, I usually forget they exist most of the time.

There are a bunch of other smaller flaws, but even with all of this, the good aspects heavily outweigh the bad aspects of this game. Almost everything besides the combat is amazing. I highly recommend checking out this game and it's sequel.",1678919402,1683932141,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False
387290,138202763,76561199140466249,0,1,1461,0,1417,1707106831,"Ori and the Blind Forest: DE is easily one of my favorite games of all time, if not my favorite of all time period. I've beaten the game so many times now, and three times on its One-Life mode--once on my Switch, once on my friend's Steam account, and most recently again on my own Steam account (with 100% completion!). So even though I'm listed as 23 hours into this game, I've played it for many more.

There are many things that make this game wonderful in my mind, but I'll give an overview of my favorite things in a non-spoiler fashion.

TL;DR: Give this game a shot; it's well worth it.

GAMEPLAY (Excellent!)
First off, Ori and the Blind Forest has easily some of the best movement in any platformer I've played. Ori feels very responsive.  In the early game, Ori feels good enough as you just run and jump through the map. But, as the game progresses, the various abilities you unlock allow you to soar across the map with high speed and high precision. Ori spends a ton of time in the air, but you always have a ton of control.

The game isn't easy, either. You're given a wide variety of abilities that string together in very interesting ways, and the game expects you to learn how to use them and use them well. The challenges the game throws at you demand a certain degree of mastery over the controls and Ori's skills, as you'd desire for a platformer. Given how I've played it to death, the difficult is somewhat diminished in my mind now, but I do recall that I took hundreds of deaths in my first playthrough--a good thing in my mind as a gamer who likes a challenge. But, even if you prefer easier experiences, you're allowed to save (almost) anytime and anywhere, so you can typically lock in your progress after clearing a difficult challenge only once. This allows the game to be difficult without being too punishing. The game also has an Easy mode for inexperienced/relaxed players.

As a side note--you may have heard Blind Forest described as a metroidvania. This is nominally true, but it honestly it plays fairly linearly; if you're looking for a distinctly metroidvania experience, this isn't quite the game to find that. Most of the metroidvania parts will be missed entirely unless you're going for 100% completion, and even then they play more as a ""come back to this area later with a new ability to explore this small nook with bonus rewards.""

I say all that to say: Treat Ori like a linear platformer game. that's where it shines, and it shines brightly.

STORY (Simple but Heartfelt--no spoilers, I promise)
Because I'm promising no spoilers, I won't say much. All I'll say is that the story is deeply heartfelt, which I always love in a game. It's not particularly deep, so if you're looking for a story that will leave you with something to chew on for an extended period of time, you won't really find it here. Instead, the story is simple--which is the right fit for what Blind Forest is--and it ties the game together beautifully.

GRAPHICS (Beautiful!)
This game is gorgeous. If I recall correctly, every environment was painted by hand and then imported into the game. 

MUSIC (Stellar!)
Gareth Coker is a stellar composer, and it shows in this game. I do think he outdid even this soundtrack in Will of the Wisps, but I still find myself pulling up the Blind Forest soundtrack on Spotify here and there. Every track is memorable in its own way, and helps the game really hit home with the wide range of emotions it explores throughout.

REPLAYABILITY AND PLAY TIME (Depends on you! But probably honestly not too replayable.)
In my mind, replayability is a non-factor for a game's quality, and way too much emphasis is placed upon it in modern game reviews. But that's a side rant that I'll spare you for now. I'll just cover this since I know some people care about that sort of thing.

Ori and the Blind Forest's replayability is contingent upon the type of gamer you are. If you like beating a game once and then calling yourself done, Ori will give you an experience that's loads of fun but won't last too long--maybe around seven to ten hours on a first playthrough, depending on your skill with plaformers? (Again, I've played this game to death, so I don't have a good sense of this anymore, but my playthroughs nowadays tend to take three hours to 100% the game--given that I die infrequently, if at all, and already know where all the secrets are.) If you want to get all the achievements, including the ones related to One-Life mode, you'll need to replay the game several times to do so. Again, given the game's linear nature, the repeated playthroughs will be similar to one another, so most of the replay value comes in refining your abilities in the game and watching yourself improve.

In a nutshell, if you get a kick out of grinding and watching yourself improve your skills--and won't be TOO devastated by dying to an instakill two-and-a-half hours into a One Life run of the game for the final achievement (and there are many, MANY instakills in Blind Forest)--Ori has a ton of replayability. Otherwise, don't expect too much from repeat playthroughs.

CONCLUSION (BUY THIS GAME!)
BUY THIS GAME! It's well worth the price, well worth the time, and well worth the tears if you happen to be an emotional gamer.

- Chain someone to your gaming chair;
- Make them play first ten minutes of Ori and the Blind Forest;
- Listen to any ""awwww"" sounds. 

Seriously, this game is so awwww-some that I don't think most human beings have a capacity to withhold such overwhelming cuteness, unless something is terribly wrong with them. Going through Ori's intro sequence is like watching a duckling that falls to sleep next to a bunch of small kittens. This game enchants you quickly, sucks you into its world in a matter of seconds and just like someone who failed the aforementioned test, it will never let you forget it.

In case it wasn't obvious before and by some miracle you've missed all the screenshots, I'll state the obvious: it's a TRULY BEAUTIFUL GAME. Vividly drawn landscapes and happy fluid animations are parts of its charm, but combined with an ABSOLUTELY GENIUS SOUNDTRACK create a true feast for the senses; one that will only be depreciated by inventing edible strawberry-flavored monitors. The simple act of just pacing around is a great audio-visual experience, but along with the looks comes a surprisingly well-written story, giving our movements a deeper purpose. Despite its simplicity and Disneyesque qualities, it's told quite well, shifting the moods along the ride. While Ori is generally a joyful experience, it can also be full of tension or filled with grim solemnity. Each area has its own mood, making the world feel incredibly alive.

Game's great atmosphere and soothing colors are important for other reasons, namely calming us down. Ori has a QUITE HIGH DIFFICULTY LEVEL, that's usually somewhere between ""that's gonna be a challenge"" and ""Oh, hell no"". The whole game area is one giant level, divided into smaller areas, creating something that gaming PhDs would call ""Metroidvania-inspired platformer"". While at first the road ahead is quite easy and straightforward, Ori quickly learns a bunch of new abilities that broaden the area of exploration to the size of New Caledonia. Curiosity and good eyes are often rewarded with the additional XP and power-ups, so there's a good reason to stray often from our path, but it's also incredibly easy to get lost in the huge sprawling environment. And sometimes you're going to waste time trying to beat a challenge that looks do-able, but it can only be done with certain skills that you don't yet possess. Some sections are just also old-fashionably hard, especially when you had the misfortune of saving the game with a low amount of health. When you painstakingly try to make your way through the level for the 20th time even the beauty of the world around can be lost. 

Despite giving us a harsh time now and then, Ori and the Blind Forest remains a PHENOMENAL game. The definitive edition is probably the best way to start the adventure with it, since it offers more content, new abilities, option to adjust difficulty and various quality of life improvements, etc., but you still won't be disappointed by going for the original version. It is still one of the best games I had the pleasure of playing and after 200 titles I'm not stating this lightly. It's an incredible experience and a total must-play. 10/10.

I played the entire game, start to finish, and completed all achievements not requiring subsequent runs, so I feel like I have a good understanding of the game.

To start, I'll admit that the art is objectively, beautiful. However, with so much detail on the screen, combined with the size of your character often makes it hard to understand what is hitting you. Projectiles from enemies can either camoflague into the backdrop, or just be small enough that you can't see them among the many other things on the screen. I understand that the size of your character is supposed to make the world seem bigger, however I feel it negatively impacts the game to an unreasonable level.

The movement in this game felt like shit to me the entire time. This game is some of the worst implementations of wall jumping and double jumping that I've experienced in my entire life. I see many ways in which this game strives to be unique, with the mechanics being one of them. Admittedly, some of the concepts I like, like the Bash movement allowing you to launch yourself off of enemies. Some I wasn't fond of, but I understand the purpose for, such as the saving. Saving in this game is much more of a risk reward mechanic, and while I personally don't like the way saving works, I don't think the decision to treat in game saving in the way it is is a particularly bad thing. However, referencing back to the double jump, it seems that this mechanic was changed from the typical double jump system just for the sake of being different. Being different doesn't automatically equate to being better. If the goal was to make the game harder, you can do this much more effectively through more difficult platforming sections based on environment, rather than player control. 

While I did praise the ""Bash"" system earlier, I found that the hitbox within which I could activate the ability was spotty, especially during the tree climbing segment. I found many hitboxes to be illogical, be it some of the spikes or enemies jumping next to you and failing to indicate the area in which you are able to be damaged.

The damage scaling in this game really doesn't make sense to me. When you have 3 hit points at the beginning of the game, spikes deal 2 damage. As you progress, you gain more hit points, but the damage from spikes and other enemies scales with you. Supposedly this system really forces you to explore and find as many secrets as you can to raise your health, but it still is an illogical way to scale difficulty throughout the game, at least to the degree that it is. 

The story for this game to me is, for lack of a better word, average. Without spoiling what happens, it is at first glance a meaningful story, however if you put even an ounce of thought into it, the story is in no way deep or special. I don't even think this game necessarily needs to have a sprawling beautiful story, but people treat it like its the greatest story ever told by man, while in reality it's on par with a Disney movie. 

The world building in this game feels highly disconnected. While each of the locations is beautiful, they all feel very separate from each other. You have your typical water section. Your lava section. Your forest section. Your dark section. Each of these environments in an echo chamber is great, but as I played through the game I felt no sense of coherence between the areas that had been created. 

Finally, the combat system is just all around disappointing. No thought has to be put into any sort of fighting throughout the whole game, it's just repeated left clicking. This would be fine of combat was sparse, but there is frequently enemies that you need to take care of, and the clicking becomes monotonous. 

In short, I feel like there's just always a better game for you to be playing if you feel the urge to play Ori. If you want world building and combat, play Hollow Knight. If you want platforming and a meaningful story, play Celeste. I'm hoping I enjoy Will of the Wisps more than this one.",1683762734,1683762734,False,5,0,0.574809670448303223,0,True,False,False

It is simply too hard for me. I started with Normal difficulty, then switched to Easy, but it didn't help. I'm a middle-aged casual gamer, and I play with a keyboard and mouse.
The game atmosphere and music are beautiful, story is interesting, but I just could not enjoy the game due to constantly dying (at the moment of writing I had cca. 1700 deaths). That's not fun.
Some parts seem deliberately nasty, it's like the developers just wanted to push the player into rage-quitting. It feels like Meat Boy - if you like such a gameplay, go ahead and prepare yourself for a lot of dying - but that doesn't suit the game's atmosphere IMO.
Many parts of the map are inaccessible until you get the required ability, and I had to learn that by watching youtube walkthroughs.

I almost quit because of one sequence that required either near perfect inputs for a long stretch of time, or to previously grind like a madman to spec out the protagonist's mobility. The difficulty of this game comes mostly from trial-and-error, that I despise in videogames as it punishes the player in a first, blind run, and from confusing level design, which again, punishes the player for no reason. Physics are a wee bit junk, first run and I got clipped into a wall and didn't know what to do, it can get a bit grindy, easy mod is normal mode, levels are a bit too set in stone, not a ton of space for creative manouvering unless you unlock another movement ability. 

In the end it was 100% worth it, would buy again. It's a seriously good game with some tearjerking moments and tight movements.

Not only is the visual style quite appealing, but the difficulty level on normal difficulty is actually NORMAL. If you - like me - ever played Hollow Knight and got frustrated over the difficulty level, then you will love Ori!

It's not based on boss fights, it's all about arcade - jumping, dashing, evading, attacking. No part of the game gets frustrating, even the hardest parts seldom require more than ten tries to get past. Also, the saving system is quite nice: basically, you can spend an Energy point to save before a hard passage and then immediately return to this checkpoint if you fail.

The only critique I might have is that sometimes it requies quite some precision when trying to land on a slim platform - without it, I would probably have died 20% less.

All in all, it's a superb game. I beat it in 10 hours on normal difficulty and spent another 5-6 hours to collect everything and explore the whole map.

Secondly, the game has no checkpoints. Instead you make your own checkpoints consuming the same resource you use in combat. That took me a lot of getting used to, so be sure to save as often as you can to avoid having to redo a difficult section over and over again.

There are some long stretches where you will have to do it right or you will have to do it again (because you will die)

You only start the game with basic skills so as you progress you can upgrade and get more abilities. It starts you out with the basics then give you a little something extra.

The game deeply held my interest throughout the entirety of the game, not because of the story (which is hard to make sense of until later on in the game, but was 'cute', for a lack of a better word), but because it was just fun and challenging, even when I died, I didn't want to give up!

I don't usually like platformers but the movement is so smooth that it makes this game a joy to play. The projectile redirect mechanic is one of the most fun abilities I've used in a game. All the upgrades feel natural and play into each other to make your movement increasingly complex and satisfying. I didn't think I'd really like this game but I ended up binging most of it in a day, so I think they achieved something pretty special with how this game controls.

The devs also clearly put a lot of work into the animations and responsiveness of the environment. So many things react to the physics of the world such as floating rocks temporarily sinking under your weight. It really makes the game world feel alive. Coupled with the relaxing, lovely music and art direction, the game looks gorgeous.

My one major complaint is the amount of camera shake, especially during the escape sequences. It does help add to the tension of the moment, but the amount of shake is completely overkill and makes for a frustrating experience when I can't see what's going on. And the escape sequences in general are just stressful and un-fun because death means starting from the beginning. It can get really tiring. Not to mention it can take the wind out of the final moments of the game because instead of feeling the thrill of an exciting escape, I just felt relief that the annoyance was over.

In all honesty, while I did have fun at times, I didn't like this game very much, and I have very little interest in revisiting it. 

The platforming can be brutal, and I hope you remembered to save, because if not, you're losing progress. The combat is kinda bad, mostly due to how simple and bare-bones it is. My biggest annoyance though is the lack of bosses, instead championing long escape sequences which simply aren't the same. I know it isn't a rule, but I really like my metroidvanias to have boss battles to put my skills to the test.

On top of all that, while the graphics and music are all great, the story isn't, and feels about as bare-bones as the combat. I'm generally not one to gripe too much about a video game having a mediocre plot, but the gameplay, for me at least, wasn't fun enough to justify it. Some people really like the plot, but I personally was not very impressed, nor was I especially emotionally rattled.

This game isn't a bad game. However, I didn't really enjoy myself all that much in retrospect, and because of that and the reasons behind it, I don't think I can actually honestly recommend it.

Three things you should not expect from this game:
1. Combat. You take out plenty of naughty critters but the emphasis is on platforming more than combat. Notably, there are special platforming sequences instead of bosses in the usual sense.
2. Puzzles. There are a few little areas that take a some planning or thought. This aspect of the game could have been taken to the next level while staying true to the overall feel of the game.

From the music to the graphics to the atmosphere the game presents is a masterpiece in motion.  the mystical forests, marshes, and caverns shimmer with radiance. It's like watching a painting of light dance about the screen. And Gareth Coker's haunting score keeps you enthralled for the entire story. When I hear the orchestral score that plays when you're climbing the Ginso tree it sends chills down my spine... in a good way.

The controls, especially when playing with an Xbox One controller, are very responsive and fluid. There was no delay whatsoever in input, and this is very important because the game has a massive number of platform jumping puzzles sending you bouncing all over the place where even the slightest error will send you careening down to your death. 

The game is pretty forgiving when it comes to life and death, allowing you to try again as many times as you like. There's also a system that lets you save your game almost anywhere. Without this I would have quit the game long ago.

7-9/10 difficulty (depends on choosing the difficulty in the settings)
Explanation: good music, gameplay, controls and lore, it is comparable to hollow knight but without bosses and more platformer and puzzle solving. Ori and the blind forest is more like if hollowknight and celest had a child. the adjustable difficulty level makes it possible for everyone to play the game without being an expert, and when you get through the game you can play it again on hard for the challenge. there will be times when you are thinking what to do now and how to get somewhere, but with some trial and error you can actually get through anywhere, or you get the ability later and you have to go back to that place.

Ori is tasked with restoring the forest to its former glory, but must first navigate through perilous environments and defeat powerful enemies. Along the way, Ori meets several characters who offer guidance and aid in the quest.

One of the most impressive aspects of ""Ori and the Blind Forest"" is its art direction. The backgrounds are simply gorgeous, and the character designs are both charming and unique. The game's lighting effects are also top-notch, creating an immersive atmosphere that draws players in.

In addition to its stunning visuals, the game features a beautiful and haunting soundtrack that perfectly complements the action on screen. The music ranges from sweeping orchestral pieces to more intimate piano compositions, and is one of the highlights of the game.

Finally, the game's story is both touching and powerful. The themes of loss, redemption, and sacrifice are woven throughout the game, and the characters are all well-written and sympathetic. By the end of the game, players will feel a real sense of attachment to Ori and the other characters.

Overall, ""Ori and the Blind Forest"" is an incredible achievement in game design. It offers a challenging platforming experience that is both visually and emotionally stunning.

Unfun platforming, uninspired music, boring and contrived story, difficulty is artificial (everything is a 1-2 hit kill, lots of cruel booby-traps you could only see coming with precognition, platforming sections with moving parts that aren't synced up so getting through is RNG), un-intuitive controls and UI, constant cutscenes always stopping gameplay in it's tracks for no reason, the entire game is riddled with bad design choices which punish the player for trying to enjoy it.

And it's still better than the original, this version has a dash(the platforming was not designed around air dashing at all, makes it much easier), ranged attack(you can miss this for the entire main story), fast travel(i know right, the last one didn't somehow, a metroidvania without fast travel), and some less major QoL changes and bug fixes.

I had quite high expectations due to the universally good reputation this game has and I have to admit that I was not disappointed. 

The game is beautifully designed and offers a good balance of challenging level design while not being overwhelmingly difficult. The combat is pretty straightforward and while being fun in the beginning, it gets a bit stale towards the end. The save feature is also pretty ingenious and I personally really liked the way it was implemented. I think some people might dislike it but I digress. 

I would've liked a bit more focus on the puzzling aspect in this game and an easier (or more accessible) way to quickly travel from one point of the map to another. Sometimes it also wasn't that intuitive to figure out where you had to go next to progress in the story but these were all minor ""flaws"" in an otherwise awesome game.

The first like 10 minutes of the game is extremely disengaging and a bitnof a slog, where it really isnt a game. Its a narrative setup but displayed in a way that just frustrates the player. Im ok with cutscenes of story elements to kick off a game, but 10 minutes of half forced slow walking and half slow animation, where the transitions are not even clear...it just completely draws you out of the game and was a huge turnoff. 
When the game finaply does start the movement feels ok, and you learn your new abilities and the progression felt nice. The metriodvania style of backtracking with new abilities wasnt awful to start but the game got unclear fast. There were lots of frustrating bits where it doesn't feel like you're dying because you did something wrong, but for something on the games end, which is not fun. 
Overall i was so excited for this game from what id heard about it and the look of it was gorgeous. Unfortunately the product i got was a quick refund after ultimately having next to no fun while playiing it.

The combat is a little bland (you can get through most encounters just by mashing X) with a few interesting abilities to spice it up, but using them is pretty much optional. The environmental puzzles are interesting and the platforming feels pretty good, albeit floaty. The level design is clever, but the map design overall is average (if we're talking metroidvanias).

Let's adress the elephant in the room - this game can get very difficult, expecially if you don't really play platformers all that much like me. I truly started to enjoy myself after around 2/3 of the game, when I mastered the controls and got some of the more interesting abilities (like dash, for example). Before then I got stuck quite a lot, but you could blame that on me being pretty shit at platformers.

The abilities are phenomenal and getting one was always amazing to see what you got.
Its also worth mentioning the music which is also great.
But I have 2 issues which makes this game to 9/10.
First the lack of editing your controls.
The game is at some sections atrocious to play with mouse and key boards, because you need 3 hands for some sections which is quite annoying.
So please play it with a controller, since its far more enjoyable with it.
You can still use Key board and mouse if you like.
Just know that its quite hard at first getting used to it.
My second one is small, but i didnt receive any achievements for sometime and now I lack a few from the begining, but I will replay this game someday.
Also the later achviements are very hard.
I have no idea how I am going to beat this game without dying once.

The visuals are stunning, and the sound design is wonderful, but the overall experience is not rewarding. In many cases you get stuck in repeatedly attempting clearing a sequence of events, where the only way to learn the correct set of move is by dying repeatedly. You always go back to square one (the most recent save) and you get severely punished even for the slightest mistake. For example, if you miss a jump and fall onto spikes, you die with up-to four strikes (I played the normal setting). Given spikes usually cover a large surface, there is no way to avoid getting multiple strikes, which effectively makes it 1-2 strikes before dying.

Experiencing this over and over makes the learning curve really steep, and non-rewarding. And when you finally get to clear a sequence, you are just met with another one of similar difficulty, This gets frustrating and dull eventually, to the point I just did not want to play anymore. I gave up in the second tree quick-action sequence (wind) since it was really long, spikes and geysers are semi random, and there is no way to save mid-way (which means, if you die you have to repeat everything from the start). 

Don't get me wrong, I am well familiar with action-platform-exploration games, and usually am all down with the ""git gud"" approach. It's just that even when you ""git gud"" the overall experience is not cathartic at all. It felt more like playing ""guitar hero"" than playing a platformer.

If you are into challenging, rewarding, action-platform games, I recommend ""Hallow Knight"" or ""Celeste"", which are much more rewarding (and boast much better controls). Your time is better spent there than playing this one.",1680030403,1680030403,False,2,0,0.52702707052230835,0,True,False,False

I sadly just can't recommend the gameplay aspect.My core issue with the game is the checkpoint system, and an overreliance on Trial & Error.Ori has a manual checkpoint mechanic, where you can pop down a respawn point by spending a point of energy. In the early game, this is made frustrating due to you having a very limited amount of energy. It gets better as the game goes on once you have around 5+ to spend, but the game is also incredibly stingy with refills on both your energy and health.Checkpointing saves your state as is, meaning if you happen to scrape by with little to no health, a respawn will bring you back in that condition. This means you'll have to complete long sections of the game starved of your core ressources, or bungling all the way back to a proper savestation to refill. There are energy refills scattered in the world, but the game is incredibly stingy with these drops. I ended up basically never using the explosion attack, since that takes energy too, and why would I spend it on an attack when I might lose out on a critical save later on?The absolute worst part of the game are the escape sequences after every dungeon. These are 95% trial & error, there are parts where you'll die half a dozen times because it just isn't clear where you're supposed to go. I almost gave up on the final one because I could not figure out what it wanted me to do on the final stretch, and keep in mind, you are replaying this ENTIRE section EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. YOU. DIE. At this point, I could probably play the final escape blind.The ability unlocks are also not particularly interesting, and just make number be bigger for the most part. I never ended up finding the dash that is mentioned in the air dash upgrade, which should probably already tell you the game isn't very invested in that side of it.I might just be past tolerating games with instantkill spikes and ""Do it again"" as their core gameplay-loop, but if you enjoyed that part of early gaming, you're probably gonna like Ori too.",1679756854,1679756854,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

387290,135241955,76561197999911303,0,8,676,0,495,1681101997,"TLDR: A visually stunning game marred by mediocre gameplay and a forgettable narrative. I played through the game on Hard, and some of my feedback may not be as applicable on easier difficulties.

PROS: The art and soundtrack are top notch. The opening sequence is fantastic and is very effective at engaging the player emotionally early on. The movement is fluid and satisfying, and the cinematic 'escape' sequences are exhilarating, at least for the first five or so attempts. Among an otherwise basic kit of skills (wall jumping, double jumps, dashes), a few of them felt innovative and refreshing, like the Bash move that allows you to catapult yourself off of enemies and redirect projectiles, which they utilize to great effect in the platforming.

CONS: Ori lacks the subtlety and ambiguity of its counterparts in the Metroidvania genre. Hollow Knight is a prime example, a game where you slowly unravel the mysteries of what happened to the broken world around you, and each new discovery spurs the player onward in search of more answers. Ori places you in a similarly shattered world, but by contrast, every time you happen upon something new or interesting, your Great Value brand Navi companion tells you exactly what took place and why, sucking all mystique and wonder out of it immediately. Good Metroidvanias make you feel like an explorer, and give you the satisfaction of piecing things together as you go along. Ori and the Blind Forest makes you feel more like a tourist:
""Here you'll see the abandoned mountain home of a dead race. They were trying to (spoiler), but then (spoiler) happened and they all died. Here's a half baked gravity puzzle, and then it's on to the next attraction.""
""This is the main antagonist. Watch this short cutscene, which will show you their entire backstory and plainly spell out their motivations. Yes, I know we're only 1/3 through the game, but we're on a tight schedule and still have at least three more biomes to herd you through.""

The cinematic 'escape' sequences mentioned above could have been really cool moments, but quickly lose their charm. They are littered with obstacles that insta-kill you, and are almost impossible to anticipate until they've already caused you to restart. This turns what would be really cool and memorable moments into exercises of frustration that require you to brute force your way through with trial and error, hitting every snag along the way at least once.

Ori uses insta-kill spike pits as a crutch, and while it offsets this by allowing you to spend energy to create your own save points virtually anywhere you want, it really stifles the movement-centric mechanics of the game. Slightly mis-timing a jump or getting the wrong angle on a Bash often sends you straight back to your last save point, and because the onus of placing them intelligently is left to the player, this can sometimes erase so much progress it made me want to turn the game off. It also forces you to sit through any cutscenes or dialogue you went through since your last save (because nothing says ""fun"" like re-watching the same unskippable gameplay interruption over and over).

Before anyone dismisses these criticisms with ""git gud"", I completed the path of pain in HK. I don't say this to brag or claim I'm some god gamer, only to communicate that these complaints are at least in part due to poor game design, and not just a skill issue.

If you're still waiting on Silksong and need something to tide you over, there are certainly worse options out there. Ori isn't a bad game, and if you enjoy the genre you should check it out while its on sale. It certainly has its flaws, but none of them are game breaking.",1679587455,1679587626,False,10,0,0.64754033088684082,1,True,False,False

Ori & the Blind Forest is one of the best platform/metroidvania games I've ever played.Although the sound & story may have been at exactly the same level, the gameplay alone makes this game worth every penny.

[h1][b]Gameplay[/b][/h1]For me, it's the very best part of this game. The mechanics are so innovative & crisp that every new skill you learn is a treat to use.It is sometimes difficult but not frustrating, just make sure to save frequently. The pace of the game itself is also quite enjoyable as you learn a new skill, are put to the test w/ it until you feel comfortable & then have to use that skill and all the others you learned to continue progressing, beautifully well crafted.[h1][b]Sound[/b][/h1]I really enjoyed the sound, the main theme is remarkable & I keep humming it now & then. I actually enjoyed the narrator's deep grumble & the sound effects were okay too. Nothing exceptional though, I believe it's not exactly at the same level of the gameplay.[h1][b]Story[/b][/h1]This is where I might differ from some of the other reviewers. I really enjoyed the story & the characters BUT, I don't think it is that extraordinary.I think it's a well crafted world, the foe is menacing but relatable too & all in all the characters are interesting.But I don't think it compares to the likes of, for example, Hades. It's quite bare bones & although I enjoyed it, I believe the main ""Story"" is still the gameplay.",1679315048,1679315268,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Great game, but I few details still annoy me:

1) Controls feel sluggish. Especially when wall jumping. Game developers often add a bit of limpness by adding slight delays between characters’ actions, but they went overboard here. If you are using a mouse and keyboard on PC, this is exacerbated by the fact you use the same hand for movement, jumping, wall climbing, dashing and so on, which makes some combinations a tad tedious, just enough to become annoying. 

2) Instead of using check points where you can save, the game uses energy which you collect to save (weirdly enough you even have to unlock the ability to create your own save points). This feels like a huge flaw to me as checkpoints are supposed to be part of a good game design. They should dictate the flow of the game, giving well-deserved respite to the player and control over the level difficulty to the game designer. In this game you can save at places I feel you should not and sometimes forget to save at places you absolutely should have.

There are a lot of pros though, the magical world and music being this game's biggest strength. I am about halfway through and I find the story and world-building compelling. The escape levels are absolutely amazing. I got this game on sale for about 10 USD which is absolutely worth it. I think even 25 USD which is its full price is good value.

Bottom line, the metroidvania platformer genre has had some masterpieces which set the bar high recently (I am thinking of Hollow Knight here). This game is not a master piece due to some issues, but it's pretty close.",1678848476,1679111728,True,3,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

As a tradeoff to the beautiful environments, there is very little visual clarity. Oftentimes you can’t make out which areas to avoid, especially on a whim. This makes sections with fast movement (such as falling) death traps.

BASIC DESCRIPTION:
This is one of those 'beautiful' games focused on visuals, but there is much MUCH more to it. 
First of all! Don't get the impression it's a solely ""kids game"". The story is simple, yet beautiful and as you grow attached to it, it has some moments, where you can't help but shed a tear and if you are a more of an emotional person... Then this is one of those games that will make you cry. 
Another thing is... The game feels a bit too difficult for children in my opinion. If you're a casual gamer though, it's going to be a comfortable challenge. Sometimes you have to think a little and when you get past an obstacle, the feeling is very rewarding. It's not overdone to the point, that would make you lose interest.
One of the things that really surprised me were the amazing and unique, yet simple game mechanics, that are mostly based on the mobility.
This title easily became one of the best games that I have ever played and the feeling after finishing the game was: ""Damn... Why did it have to end so soon?""

Overall traits of the game:
+ beautiful visuals and soundtrack
+ a perfectly polished, smooth game (haven't experienced a single glitch)
+ unique, amazing gameplay mechanics
+ simple, yet beautiful story
+ epic, dynamic sequences
+ easy and simple controls
~ especially early game there are ""you haven't unlocked this ability yet, come back later"" obstacles. (However it doesn't feel so invasive in this title like in LEGO games for example)
- There are rare occurances, where you're stuck and don't know what to do or where to go (happened to me 2 times), it's mostly the fault of overlooking something though.
- there's an ability explanation missing near the end-game that you have to find by accident or google up. (You need it to progress)

9/10

(40 years)  i am also a game Dev and this game, tho good, it is highly flawed. Floaty controls, impute drops,  weird impute designs ( down is a ground pound?!), bad enemy placement/ spawning, and along with poor trap placement (blind jumps). Instead of fixing any of these issues a save system that lets you save anywhere was introduced. Sadly,  you are forced to use it or else you will spend hours retreading difficult areas.  This breaks the immersion as it is easy to get lost in this beautiful world and then you end up paying dearly for that mistake. Also the saves are tied to your abilities which is REALLY odd design choice.

  The world falls into the same issues of many modern games. That being where a rich environment is created but its hard to distinguish background and foreground elements due to the amount of content on screen or just lack of hues to separate the elements. Particle effects also plague visibility too. Issues like this should not exist in games today and are usual a sign of poor beta or game testing with actual testers. As a dev you know your game and you can easily look past glaring issues like this as you become numb to many of these as time goes on. So having testers that are not part of the game design team is important. I don't know why this game is in the shape its in or if testing is the issue. I just mention the things i notice from my years that normally lead to these issues when you see a product that people obviously poured allot of heart and soul into.

Yes it's pretty but the combat never gets less dull or avoidable (yes even when you start flinging yourself around which is where this game is at its best). The save anywhere feature removes any sense of tension and in fact often makes dying preferable to carrying on because it will return you to higher health. There's such a minimal trade-off with saving that it incentivises saving frequently to avoid the drudgery of repeating dull platforming. The upgrade tree is also terribly thought through because early on you unlock an ability and then with no explanation nothing happens (even if you press the correct key from the controls settings) because Ori hasn't learn the base version of that ability yet, and won't for quite a while longer. WHY? Why is that a good design decision? What's the point of an upgrade tree if it's just as linear as the level progression?

So much of this game's 'challenge' is die - learn - try again. The cinematic boss fight-type sections at the end of dungeons are particularly bad at this because you can't save mid-way to shorten the learning loop. I know that sounds like Dark Souls but the difference there is that difficulty and harshness are part of that game's aesthetic. This game is really easy and cuddly, except you just have to die to learn more frequently than you should which just speaks to bad design imo.

[b]What it does well:[/b] I like the markers so I know where to go next if I'm busy and leave the game for a while, I like the option to change difficulty midway through the game (although I was already quite OP by the point I realised this), I really like the challenging pinging about sections - that should be the whole game.

Ori reminded exactly of that with more of an action replay save mechanic for deaths which is perfect if you don't like having to make huge trips across the map again just to be killed by a tricky jump or the environment.

Playing it again now in 2023 and having forgotten most of the paths and where all the skills are to get around for navigation, it felt really fresh to me again and I really enjoyed it, this time challenging myself with 0 Skills spent and doing the game on hard mode it felt really challenging and having found a ton of the items from just pure luck i'd put it down to I managed to have a really good time yet again with this fantastic classic.

Finished it on my first attempt on hard with 100% completion and the whole time it felt like a tutorial stage that had been stretched out into a full game. The combat is bland and underdeveloped and the game also suffers from being overly simple (you can easily finish it on hard in 2-3 days) while being frustrating at the same time. 

This is because rather actually implement fun challengers that reward skilful game-play, the developers simply threw in long sections that require memorisation and constant respawns due to the overuse of instakills , bad controls and poor hit detection. All these sections are easy to beat but the constant respawns and playing the same sections over and over again is just annoying rather than fun. It's made worse by how bad the controls are; other than basic movement, jumping and attacking you have 8 other abilities each of which is mapped to a different buttons/keys.  It’s insanely stupid to have to juggle directions plus 8 other controls in sections that require timing & precision, especially when you rarely ever need more than 2 abilities at any given time.  You often end up often triggering skills by accident causing further unnecessary respawns. 

The respawn situation gets even worse due how bad the hit detection is and the sheer level of visual noise on the screen. The glowing art style and number background and visual effects often means you can’t see exactly what can kill you and what hazards are around you. Even when you do see the obstacles you will often get hit by something that clearly didn’t touch you. This also happens when triggering abilities that rely on enemies to shoot at you. The game is very inconsistent about deciding whether a projectile is too close or too far and then you have times where the enemy AI decides it just not going to even fire at you. That doesn’t sound bad but this often happens in the middle of escape sequences where you are relying on the projectiles to trigger abilities so you can escape. But the game just says FU and get to respawn. 

Good metrovanias have a blend of good combat, deep exploration, fun challengers and an engaging story; Ori and the Blind Forest has none of those. Instead it feels about on part with a 2005 flash game that has been given AAA studio money for graphics and music. Metrovania’s are supposed to be about freedom and exploration and the skills system should have been about allowing the player to tackle problems in multiple ways and rely on skill rather than basic memorisation.  Even the story is extremely lacklustre; the intro tricks you into the thinking it might be something of a deep emotional story, but no the game basically has no story. A bunch of stuff happens and then everyone’s happy again.

Extra spoiler alert: This is still it's own masterpiece.

The focus of this game is the platforming. With complex platforming mechanics and some of the cleverest level designs of any game I've played, solving puzzles and challenges trigger that dopamine consistently. The clever level design is my favorite thing about this game. And I was personally surprised by the way the mechanics (skills/abilities) were implemented. The limitations they were given. The longevity of their relevance in the ever evolving challenges the game presents.

The platforming isn't the only thing great about this game. It's visually stunning with a moving story with some emotional moments and twists. The music score sets the mood and atmosphere well, and is both beautiful and memorable. I will definitely play the sequel with the same confidence I have in Hollow Knight: Silk Song.

Perhaps not my cup of tea, perhaps overhyped it for myself over the years, but also this is clearly not the best of modern platformers.

There is no autosave, so you need to spend magic/light/crystal/sadness. You also get to collect like a dozen more types of magic/light/crystal/sadness to open doors, other kind of doors and unlock broken ****. Somehow I think this could have been streamlined to be less complicated. Now the gameplay loop is: run to collect as much **** as you can, DIE, spawn far away because you forgot to save, run to another direction, get one-shotted by a random tank monster, spawn in the same place as before, run to the closest door/other door/broken **** and either incrementally advance the story OR, god forbid, open a door to a new place where to die.

After recently trying out the elegant masterpiece that is FEZ, the convoluted mechanics and artificial collect-a-thon nature herein feel even more pronounced.

The audio-visual presentation is fine, but I would argue this is also somewhat blown out of proportion by those who like the game. By modern (2023) standards, the visuals can actually be confusing, not knowing which parts belong to background and which are platforms. The controls are not very fluid in my opinion. Music is fine, fictional language nonsense sounds believable too, I guess... Not much to say about the story, other than it is a generic and sappy tale of magic/light/crystal/sadness...

Welp, went and deleted the sequel from my wishlist.

Projects like Ori and the Blind Forest, whose quality surpasses the barriers of their own genre. Although platformers have long been an alternative, Blind Forest bears the hallmarks of mainstream generosity, and perhaps that's why you'll fall in love with the game immediately. You will be thrilled by the visual artistry, the generously conceived game environment, the atmosphere full of emotions, the seductive gameplay, in short, everything.

In terms of functionality, all the concepts so typical of modern platformers appear in the game. For example, very soon you will try motivating movement and logic puzzles. Personally, I never get tired of just jumping between moving rocks, because I get really scared doing it in Blind Forest. Moreover, the game lets conflicting emotions compete, and although it portrays the danger as truly menacing, the hero among the stones dies with a rather funny crunch. Like cracking a nut.
A sense of levity is what makes small games big, too, and as much as Ori is more thoughtful than funny, it has no problem lifting itself lightly from time to time. A similar ability also accompanies many aspects related to the physics engine. Thanks to it, the protagonist sometimes breaks the laws of gravity and can fly above the ground for tens of seconds without wings. However, what stuck out to me was the glowing arrow indicating the direction of flight, with which he looks like a cupid.

On the overworld it's fun and quite enjoyable. But I got fed up after I got to the second timed section (not really timed but more like everything is collapsing around you). I'm fine with difficulty but the section feels tedious and frustrating since I don't feel like I have control over my character.
I know I'm not the best at platforming games but I beat celeste and felt like that was way more enjoyable. I died thousands of times in celeste but I never felt frustrated with it.

I probably would recommend it if the timed sections weren't there. so I'd say 90% of the game is fun enough but I really really don't like the other 10%.

First off, the graphics were absolutely stunning. The hand-painted world was like a fairy tale come to life, and the characters were so cute and cuddly that I just wanted to reach through the screen and give them a hug. But don't let the cuteness fool you, this game had some serious challenges.

The gameplay was a perfect balance of platforming and puzzle-solving. I loved how I had to use Ori's abilities to navigate through the world and defeat enemies. And don't even get me started on the escape sequences - they were like playing through an intense action movie!

But let's talk about the story. It was like a Pixar movie, except with more tears. I mean, I was emotionally invested in Ori's journey from the get-go. I cried when Ori's mother died, I cried when Ori's friend sacrificed themselves, and I cried when Ori finally saved the forest. It was like someone was cutting onions in my room the whole time.

And the soundtrack? Don't even get me started. It was like listening to a beautiful symphony, except with more whimsy and emotion. I found myself humming the main theme long after I finished playing.

Overall, Ori and the Blind Forest is a must-play for anyone who loves platformers, puzzles, or crying uncontrollably. The game is a beautiful work of art that will stay with you long after you finish playing. So grab some tissues and get ready for an emotional rollercoaster - you won't regret it!",1676989262,1676989262,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
387290,133289886,76561197971954857,0,27,474,0,314,1677288217,"Ori and the Blind Forest is a stunningly beautiful and emotionally rich game that is a must-play for anyone who loves platformers. Developed by Moon Studios and published by Xbox Game Studios, this game is a masterpiece of game design, with its breathtaking visuals, compelling story, and engaging gameplay.

At its core, Ori and the Blind Forest is a classic platformer, but it is so much more than that. The game takes place in a vibrant and fantastical world, filled with unique and interesting characters, and the story is one of the most moving and memorable that I have ever experienced in a game.

The graphics in Ori and the Blind Forest are simply breathtaking. The game is hand-painted with meticulous attention to detail, and every frame is a work of art. The colors are vivid and bright, and the animation is fluid and graceful. The character designs are imaginative and whimsical, and the world is filled with a sense of wonder and magic that is rare in modern gaming.

But what really sets Ori and the Blind Forest apart is its emotional depth. The story of the game is heart-wrenching, and it is told with such care and tenderness that it is impossible not to be moved by it. The game tells the story of Ori, a guardian spirit who must restore the forest of Nibel to its former glory. The story is one of sacrifice, loss, and redemption, and it is a truly remarkable achievement in storytelling.

The gameplay in Ori and the Blind Forest is just as engaging as the story. The platforming is challenging and satisfying, with a variety of obstacles and enemies to overcome. Ori can jump, climb, and use various abilities to navigate the environment and defeat enemies. The game also includes a wide range of puzzles, some of which are quite challenging, and they add a level of depth and complexity to the gameplay that keeps things fresh and exciting.

One of the most impressive aspects of Ori and the Blind Forest is the way it seamlessly integrates story and gameplay. The game's narrative is told through a series of cutscenes and in-game events, but it is also conveyed through the environment and the way Ori interacts with it. The game's world is full of hidden secrets and details that add to the story, and exploring it is a joy in and of itself.

The music in Ori and the Blind Forest is simply stunning. The game's soundtrack is composed by Gareth Coker and features a mix of orchestral and electronic music. The music is hauntingly beautiful, and it perfectly captures the game's sense of wonder and magic. The game's sound design is also excellent, with high-quality sound effects that add to the game's atmosphere and immersion.

Another thing that I appreciate about Ori and the Blind Forest is its attention to detail. The game is full of small touches that make it feel like a labor of love. From the intricate character designs to the way the wind blows through the trees, every aspect of the game is polished and refined to the point of perfection.

In conclusion, Ori and the Blind Forest is a game that everyone should play. It is a beautiful, emotional, and engaging experience that will leave a lasting impression on anyone who plays it. The graphics are breathtaking, the story is moving, and the gameplay is challenging and satisfying. It is a game that truly captures the essence of what makes gaming great, and it is a testament to the power of the medium to tell stories and evoke emotions.",1676983078,1676983078,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's a nice game but the difficulty setting is really ridiculous. I'm all for a game with a choice of challenging content, but there should be a good choice for the difficulty. Let me give precise examples.
I started with hard, thinking that I can simply change the difficulty later. So I encountered monsters that charge with high speed and would just one shot me with like 11 damage when my HP is only at 3 or 4. I find it difficult to pass the monster so I changed the difficulty to normal.
Turns out that monster still charge at me at the same speed, with damage down to 7 to one shot me. Wow.
And then just now I was at another flooding challenge. It's a pretty common stage in rpgs, running away from flood, you know, except the flood would immediately move faster when you run too fast. So running fast and doing everything perfect don't help anything, and there's no checkpoint......

But the fighting mechanics itself is pretty easy. It's the mobility part that becomes ridiculously difficult at some part of the game. As I said, difficult content is more than fine, my complaint is that changing difficulty to normal or easy helped NOTHING about it. At certain parts, frustration is an understatement. More like torment than a challenge. And I've right finished another resident evil game so I don't suppose I can't do basic controls. 

But then obviously the game receives generally positive feedback, and I agree the atmosphere, gameplay, music etc. are pretty well. But I'm not recommending this to anyone without good finger flexibility and real patience.",1676926768,1676926768,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Had I made this review after only finishing the game once, I would've meant that with a tiny grain of salt. However, after playing through the game multiple times and finally getting all the achievements, I realised that there's so much more to this game than a heartwarming story and gorgeous visuals. 

Some may have found it troublesome, but playing as Ori felt so amazing. The fluid movements, running around from place to place while chaining together bashes and dashes, gave me a level of satisfaction that no other game had given me before. Again, it's something that may be to another's distaste. I've personally had moments where I fatally overstepped a narrow platform or flung too far off a wall and into spikes. But once you get the feel for Ori's movement, getting from point A to B is downright addicting at times, and it's definitely worth getting used to, both for ease of progression and for the enjoyment factor.

Combat, while admittedly lacklustre, only stays that way for the first third or so of the game. Once you unlock bash and stomp, you pretty much have to try to die from enemies. And that's not to say that you can't deliver death as easily as well. With enough powers and ability points, Ori goes from a fragile tree spirit to an absolute power unit. As I mentioned before, chaining together all these movement and combat abilities feels so good and powerful, it was downright jarring every time I started a new playthrough. 

And of course, I can't forget about the music and sound design. From the area-specific music tracks, to the sound effects played when Ori uses a power, they all add to the game experience beautifully. They're great, they're memorable, and they can make you feel emotions ranging from second-hand grief to absolutely unstoppable savagery.

Overall, an absolute masterpiece of a game. It has it all: beautiful visuals, enchanting music and sound design, emotion-packed story, and fluid satisfying gameplay. I highly recommend giving this game a try, and if you enjoy it, you'll most certainly enjoy the sequel.

The game was released for Xbox One and Microsoft Windows in March 2015, and for Nintendo Switch in September 2019. Players assume control of Ori, a small white spirit, and Sein, the ""light and eyes"" of the Forest's Spirit Tree. Players are tasked to move between platforms and solve puzzles. The game features a save system called ""Soul Links"", which allows players to save their progress at will with limited resources, and an upgrade system that gives players the ability to strengthen Ori's skills and abilities.

The game was developed by Moon Studios, a collective organization without a set location. The distribution rights to the game were acquired by Microsoft a year after the beginning of the game's development. The game story was inspired by The Lion King and The Iron Giant, while some of the gameplay elements were inspired by the Rayman and Metroid franchises.

Upon release, the game received critical acclaim, with players praising the gameplay, art direction, story, action sequences, musical score, and environmental design. The game was also dubbed as one of the titles that represented art in video games. Moon Studios co-founder Gennadiy Korol said the game was profitable for the company within a few weeks after its initial launch. An expansion, called the Definitive Edition, was released in March 2016.

This game relies a lot on the artistic parts and has magnificent visuals and music. And it doesn’t stop there and has some good gameplay too, which is not a common thing in today's gaming. The number of abilities are somewhat questionable because of how towards the end you have this mess of a toolkit to work with which is not quite beginner friendly but since it’s not hard for the average player to get around, we can move on from it. Let’s say you got comfortable with the movement set, in that case, Ori offers a truly good amount of interesting level design and stretching mechanics in fun ways. At the price of making the game complicated, Ori introduces some fresh and clever platforming mechanics which to my knowledge have not been seen elsewhere. 

The story is a mix of “Disney cartoon” and stereotypical “video game story”. It acts as to just give purpose and meaning to what you do in the game. It’s not memorable, it’s not interesting, but it’s not annoying either. This little cute story is just there to be there and honestly that’s pretty much all a good game needs in my opinion so it doesn’t matter to me.

Unfortunately they’ve played it a bit safe in terms of design choices. The formula is too similar to Metroid. At the earlier parts of the game, there’s so little you can do and everything’s blocked. There’s this lack of simplicity and for every bit of interesting gameplay, there’s a new mechanic to be introduced. But I will give them the credit for making abilities usable in multiple cases and designing levels which give the player the choice to how they’re going to approach each level.

With the early game being quite boring it’s so easy to start the game and quit it after the first 2 hours. But the closer you get to the ending, Ori gets more and more fun and interesting.",1676379697,1676379697,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Edit: After playing some more after my initial review, I can say without a doubt that Will of the Wisps is considerably better. I honestly don't like this game as much for a variety of reasons. The progression here seems more restrictive and not as fullfilling. There are waaaaaayyy to many chase sequences that really serve absolutely no purpose. I get the feeling that the game just expects you to know what to do ahead of time, and if you don't then there is nothing you can do except die just so you can learn from it and account for it in the next go. Will of the Wisps was always good at allowing you to react and overcome anything if you were good enough. Whereas, in this game, you are doomed to die or fail certain parts due to not knowing what the game wants you to do or how the puzzle is to be solved until its too late. It makes you blindly jump into the abyss just so you can see that there was a small thing you were supposed to land on but you had no idea it would have been there without first jumping down and dying just so you can see it (and no, there's no way to react in time unless you got lucky and just happened to land on the small platform you needed to land on). There are countless examples of the game relying on you pushing forward and failing just so you can see what you actually need to do. Will of the wisps was not like this at all, and you could always rely on your abilities and skill to get through the unexpected, and if you died you didn't feel like the game was setting you up for failure from the start. I just think Will of the Wisps is better in every way, and because I played it first, it was very hard to play this game and enjoy it.",1672042587,1676328721,False,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

The story is simple and touching. The classic theme of light and darkness is pervasive and depicted in a yin and yang type fashion rather than good vs evil. The music's ethereal charm matches the visual style well; gentle and unobtrusive without betraying a sense of fight or flight urgency when appropriate. 

The developers did an impressive job of giving the player lots of mobility. Movement is fast and fluid, and combat is well polished. I seldom found myself frustrated by anything other than operator error. Many of the abilities to unlock enable you to traverse the world more gracefully, as well as access new areas of the map. There are situations where speed and timing are critical and your mastery of these skills is put to the test.

The soothing music when you enter, the fantastic music that they have worked on and fit very well to the theme they are portaying.
The game's reward system for doing the secrets and going the extra mile to actually have more of something made it fun and worthwhile to grind for it.
The gameplay and abilities you gain are fantastic, and the game makes you use them the second you get them, and then regularly to makes you use them so you remember about them and dont forget.
The map is very well-made, a fully connected map that adds a lot of secrets that you do not have the current skills for, making you backtrack at a later date, and getting you in the mindset of ""while im at it, i could go for {This}, making you lost in the map.

now, im gonna nitpick a little bit.
i disliked the save system, making you use [energy] to actually use save, which was tough in the start, and an annoying thing i had to do in the end.
Some of the abilities needed to use [energy] to fire, something that i lacked in the begging, and finding [energy crystals] was sometimes a hassle.

Ori and the Blind Forest[/h1]
Ori and the Blind Forest is a platformer that can be both thrilling and relaxing at times. Sometimes, you get to explore the phenomenal world of Nibel without much interference, other times, chase sequences and intricate platforming levels gets your adrenaline pumping and keeps you on your toes. The narrative, though not extensively voiced, is able to hit you with all sorts of emotions based on the animations of the characters.

Each biome in the world is being differentiated by their colour palette, and while some enemies are native to one biome, others can be found throughout the world. As you play, you will gain new abilities that will either help you in traversing or combat. There are also a skill that are designed to be viable in both situations, which I really loved. [spoiler]That skill being Bash, which propels you towards a direction while redirecting the projectile you used in the other direction. [/spoiler]I had so much fun playing with that spell. After obtaining said spell, enemies and projectiles that normally you can only avoid turns into a way to explore new areas or even kill other enemies, which is an incredibly smart design.

In the game you will encounter a huge amount of platforming sections. I am really impressed by all the different mechanics the game incorporates into the platforming levels to keep them fresh and unique even though you are doing the same thing: platforming. [spoiler] There really are a lot of unique mechanics that changes the level gameplay such as teleporting, wind, swimming and much more. Besides the small platforming sections, you also have large non-stop action sequences that will usually last 2 to 3 minutes. In these sections, you will have to make use of all you know to successfully get through it.[/spoiler]

Another thing I really liked about the game is that it is a lot less punishing than other similar games like Blasphemous and Hollow Knight. You don’t lose anything other than your progress, unlike in Hollow Knight where you’d lose all your money or in Blasphemous where your max mana will get reduced.

However, as with all games, there are definitely areas of improvements. For one, while I understand while saving is disabled in action sequences where you have to keep moving, in some other places that you can explore at your own pace, I think it’s bullshit that you can’t save because of “unstable ground”.

The game’s backtracking system is atrocious. You won’t be able to explore everything first time through because there are areas where you require abilities you obtain in later stages, yet there are no stats to show you what is missing within each biome (only shows how much you've collected relative to the entire world, which really does fuck all), forcing you to search around frustratingly. The energy doors exists to creates an arbitrary progression wall that blocks you from entering the area unless you have enough energy, which is rare during the story as you will be spending them creating save points or defeating enemies, which adds on to even more redundant backtracking.

That said, if you like platforming games, definitely try this out. Even if you don’t, give it a shot because not only is it less punishing compared to similar games, some of the platforming sections are really memorable.

[b] [h1] PRO [/h1] [/b]

- Goddamn the [b]MUSIC[/b] is good. When you open the game and it hits you. When you travel to parts of the map and music starts to play. Even decided to learn some tracks on piano

- [b]GRAPHICS[/b] is bbbeaauuuttiiful! Like how can you disagree after just watching the trailer, but I swear it looks better in game. [spoiler] Especially after you cleanse the water and you just go in to swim [/spoiler]

- The [b]STORY[/b] was good and was able to make me sad at times making the game feel more accomplishing

- The [b]DIFFICULTY[/b] was appropriate and with 3 different scaling you can have it to your tastes. Some parts will be harder than others but it isn't rage inducing. [strike]But if you choose easy you will be judged heavily[/strike]

- its cute :c

[b] [h1] EH [/h1] [/b]

- The [b]CONTROLS[/b] was honestly hard to perfect as I played with a keyboard so I would mess up alot. Especially after getting all the abilities quiet early since for some reason I ended up exploring Blackroot Burrows first. But I can imagine this being a sit back game with a controller

[b] [h1] CON [/h1] [/b]

- I ran through the game twice and my Valley of the wind always stayed at 99% which hurt. I can't find anyway to get it to 100% so it could be a bug since I have tried every way to get 100%

[b] [h1] OVERALL [/h1] [/b]

Because I am a broke, I waited till it was on sale and I can confirm that full price is just as worth. Had fun the whole time and even when speed running the second time (which I did immediately after playing the first run) it was good. At times the game is hard but that should be a given when playing a game. I would most likely recommend a controller since sitting on a sofa and playing this game seems really nice but with a keyboard it's just as good. I would stay this game is for all ages as long as you know the controls.",1588423178,1675953331,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Highlights:

1) Exceptionally well done visuals, with a 3D feel. This is a 2D platformer but the environment has things happening in the foreground, middle ground and background - creating a dynamic and immersive experience.

2) Beautiful design and FX creating a vivid and colourful experience from start to finish.

3) Masterful soundtrack that you could even listen to off game to just relax or feel good.

4) Very user friendly controls.

5) Relevant skills that you unlock to greatly diversify your platforming experience. Towards the end game, the platforming is exceptionally intense - making great use of your acquired skills; which in turn makes for a really satisfying experience, once you succeed.

6) Great usage of secrets and hidden power ups, in combination with stats on the pause screen; to encourage you to explore and uncover all this game has to offer.

7) Perfect length - I completed this game, 100%, in 13 hours. I'm only missing some combat trophies, but I explored everything and acquired all items, skills, and power ups. 

8) Excellent storytelling - This game uses some cut-scenes, but mostly uses in game text/narration as you progress, to tell you the lore and plot. These transitions were so smooth and packed with emotion that I didn't expect at all. The story also unfolded in a way that I didn't anticipate and I found it to be an awesome experience.

Important Note: The platforming gets very difficult as you progress. I died over 300 times in my 13 hours finishing this game. If you do not like platforming, then do not buy this game as it will drive you mad. If you are okay with a challenge and welcome it, then this game will blow you away; and you will feel great satisfaction in completing it. 

I have nothing negative to say about this game at all and I am really looking forward to now playing the sequel.",1675917842,1675917842,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you're looking for a metroidvania like Hollow Knight or, ya know, Metroid, look somewhere else.

That wouldn't be so bad, but it still tries to be a metroidvania with it's enemy placements. Again this wouldn't be so bad, but all you can do is spam an auto-targeting attack. Again, all of this wouldn't be too bad, but I've been playing on hard mode, where enemies take forever to kill and WILL one shot you for the first hour or more. Then, when you have more health, sure you don't get one shotted but the health pickups are VERY rare so you end up dying way too often.

Starts off pretty slow gameplay wise, became more fun for me the more movement abilities I collected.
I didn't follow the story too much, when I came back to this game to actually beat it, I skipped the entire prologue, which for me was very, very long.
I suggest you learn to read the map, as finding out whether or not that darkness is a wall or an unexplored area requires distinguishing between a fade and a hard line, and that allows you to find out where you're supposed to go. Mostly.
I didn't focus on *completing* the game, just beating it so I could let myself play Will of Wisps, but it did get fun and challenging in the end, even on Normal.

I'm pretty sure I tackled some things in ways the developers didn't want me to... Ah well.
I just wish there was some extra challenge parts requiring you to use all your movement abilities instead of just that final part, that would've been a great extra.

The visuals are absolutely breathtaking and the emotional story will leave you with a sense of wonder and awe. The game's platforming mechanics are challenging but fair, and the game's many secrets and collectibles will keep you coming back for more. The game's soundtrack is also one of the best I've ever heard in a game, it perfectly complements the game's emotional story and breathtaking visuals.

One of the things that makes Ori and the Blind Forest so special is how it manages to convey so much emotion without relying on dialogue. The game tells its story through its visuals, music, and gameplay, and it does so masterfully. The relationship between Ori and his companion, Sein, is especially well-done and will have you rooting for them both throughout the game.

In conclusion, Ori and the Blind Forest is a game that should not be missed. It's a true work of art that will leave you with a sense of wonder and awe. The game's visuals, story, and gameplay all come together to create an unforgettable experience that will stay with you long after you've finished the game.",1674965805,1674965805,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-Combat is braindead, avoid projectiles while spamming your own homing projectiles via the attack button.
-Exploration is too linear, and there really aren't all that many collectibles either. The platforming difficulty is nice, at least, but this is hardly a Metroidvania.
-The story seems moronic -- I can't tell if you're expected to feel sad every time someone dies, since if that were the case players would be crying nonstop after 100 deaths per hour.
-The aesthetic would be pretty if it distinguished between foreground and background, but as it stands, there are way too many instadeath moments from being unable to tell what is scenery, what is a living enemy and what is a deadly fall into spikes. The further I get, this seems to be an intentional design choice.

Between the floaty controls and the confusing artistic design, the game has a very ethereal feeling that could work well if it were not intended to be challenging. There's promise in here, it's just not for me.",1674825286,1674825286,False,1,1,0.450876384973526001,0,True,False,False

I had seen nothing else like it until this came out. Each area of the world is uniquely colored to give each of them their own personality and feel, and the same goes with the music and the enemies. The gameplay is nothing short of exciting as well. Fast paced, and responsive, it feels great to move around the world as Ori. Unlocking new abilities to traverse becomes so fun, and by the end, you master it and feel a very satisfying sense of flow.

There are no abilities on all of the levels I am playing but you can use the ability to switch between them so it is a lot easier if you can find the character with the ability.

However, for me personally, it commits a cardinal sin for the genre of Metroidvanias which renders it pretty much a glorified platformer. The combat... It's almost an after thought. Not only is the whole thing done with auto aim, SERIOUSLY the computer chooses which target to attack based on proximity (Often choosing the wrong target when multiple are on screen), but the computer auto connects each and every shot without any aiming on the part of the player. Further more, the enemies in the game are nothing more than rudimentary pattern driven obstacles to make the tricky jumping parts more difficult. And finally, because You don't even have to aim, you can basically skip the entirety of the uninspired and almost useless combat ability tech tree. Why use abilities that require mana and such when you can just spam the attack button while standing out of enemy range?

Often I would get pulled out of the immersion by yet another moving platform and spike pit arena, not because it was too difficult, yet simply out of tedium and disappointment. It became a game I want to finish not because I enjoyed it, so much as just to see the narrative end with slightly spiteful intent. 

When I finally get around to beating this one I will give the sequel a try to see what they did with it. Hopefully it learned for the previously mentioned mistakes.

Edit: On further play, I have seen that the story is actually garbage. Some how the magic light from the tree kills owl babies for no reason. Yeah, you heard me. A tree calls to some stupid forest rat with light. The owl babies see the light and die because ... They saw light? And the big owl gets mad and kills the tree. So the ""Villain"" is actually completely justified and the story makes absolutely no sense at all. Don't cry about spoilers either. I just did you a favour.

I will also take some time to reiterate just how tedious the jumping arenas in this turd are. It IS NOT a Metroidvania. It is a platformer...",1673021628,1674167712,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Overall, the gameplay is very good, as a person who plays a lot of indie games, I'm very familiar with the metroidvania and platformer genre and I must say that ori quite excel with both genre, although I wouldn't say the best. The metroidvania aspect of ori, in my opinion is a bit easy, all the secrets are pretty simple to find and the powers aren't super unique, so there aren't a lot of creative puzzles utilizing these powers, even with all that, I still think it is very fun, finding all the secret upgrades is still very satisfying and I like looking at the map to look for things I had missed.

The environments are beautiful, but there were many times where I wasn't able to tell what was background/foreground which led to frustrating moments. The soundtrack was pretty good.

I was recommended this game because I enjoyed Hollow Knight, but in my opinion they don't feel all that much alike. In Ori, you move fast, which is nice, but the jumping is kind of floaty, fast and inaccurate. Not a huge problem though. The combat is very boring, which is a bigger problem. But the worst thing to me is the save system. You can put down a save spot whenever you have energy cells, which recharge at a snail's pace unless you find crystals, and that save spot is an actual save spot, as in if you die, you're gonna have to watch any and all cutscenes again if you didn't save after watching them. On top of that, you'll need energy cells to do other stuff too later on, which means that either you'll have to run the risk of not saving and having to collect all the items and sit through any tips you got again if you die, or you'll have to wait for the cells to recharge. I don't know, maybe I missed something, but it felt really bad to me.

I can see why people enjoy it, and I can see why people who enjoyed this, enjoy Hollow Knight and vice versa. It's just really not for me.

It's quite short and navigating the world map is easy enough making this the perfect entry point to the genre. 

Positives 

Incredibly stunning game with a gorgeous artstyle 

Fantastic ost 

Quite a simple but very moving story that may have you in tears 

Very fluid controls, using oris abilities and navigating platforming sections is very satisfying. 

Short and sweet with many diverse locations and a skill tree that makes the game repayable 

Negatives 

Chase sequences which can be a bit frustrating, not sure if I just suck or what but they took me a few goes. 

Combat isn't bad but it's extremely basic to the point I found it be quite boring, not a massive drawback but not a positive either 

Again this is mostly personal preference but the save system was a bit annoying because I'd forget to save at crucial points 

Conclusion 

Whilst it's not my favourite of the genre ori and the blind forest is one of the best examples of the genre done right and I fully recommend this game to anyone who hasn't experienced it yet, just don't forget to bring some tissues.",1673340780,1673340780,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
387290,130542504,76561199182684718,0,7,10,0,7,1674967608,"This is a game I initially didn't love. The game is flawed in so many ways, especially compared to its sequel. I played its sequel first for no particular reason, and then the original (on my switch). From this lens, I immediately noticed so many ways the sequel was better, which made me paint blind forest negatively. Now I appreciate the original much more, it is truly a wonderful game. Visually the art style is simply superb, the way the character moves and flows through these natural yet fantastical environments is astounding. While unfortunately a large portion of this game's environments is either a trope or a forest, there is just enough variety throughout. To avoid spoilers, the extra content in definitive edition and the Southwest portion of the map was most memorable. Combat is awful, spam fire to win, don't play this game expecting good fighting. Enemies with their simplistic patterns serve more as obstacles to the overall movement, which is phenomenal. While some movement upgrades are superfluous, the way they all function to expand Ori's traversal serves the insanely well crafted platforming design. The unique options alter the way you think about the game, like bash, which re contextualizes every single enemy and projectile in the entire game to great effect. The act of moving as Ori impresses, she (he?) certainly shows off amazing platforming chops. While the world Ori bounds about is artistically well designed, the progression structure is very linear. Go here, go here, go here, is the name of the game. Every area you explore is far more dungeony than open, this allows the devs to create planned directions and challenges for the player to keep up the pacing. However, it takes away from that feeling of discovery. the only thing to find outside of powerups that match like keys to the story, is currency and health/energy upgrades. The skill tree feels very strange, I wouldn't call it bad, but something isn't right in this context. Moving away from those small points, the story is amazing, I would say better than the sequel. With amazing cinematography, and a way of delivering story through show (outside of some exceptions) rather than tell, the narrative driven home is very engaging. One small but important to me ""problem..."" While this isn't a big deal to me anymore, when I first played the game, most frustrating was the save system. Essentially, saves are almost entirely manual. While on one hand it's amazing to let the player save whenever they please, I personally don't want to think about saving when I'm encapsulated in a game world. So forgetting to save because I was having so much fun, dying, then being sent back upwards of 10-15 minutes was hugely disappointing. While in retrospect it is pretty easy to drive a habit of saving every couple of minutes, it was a massive deterrent early on. To cap things off, the score is great, though I prefer the sequel's. So many tracks in this game are full of life and energy, some incite feelings of fear or anxiety, and others just set the various moods so well. While I can recall about half of the games tracks though, many others were unfortunately not super memorable. 

In summary, I adore the storytelling and platforming. I like the world and music. I find the progression okay. But I despise the combat. In general, it's worth overlooking those blase elements to praise what Or excels at.",1673319427,1673319427,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Soundtrack is nice, and the game itself is very pretty. Unfortunately, it is also one of the most annoying games I have ever played.

I love complicated puzzles - but these are not even complicated puzzles: it is literally a matter of pressing the right buttons at exactly the right time in the right combination, hoping to get lucky this time. I have listened to the same three chords of soundtrack about fifty times in a row, because there are some traps that can only be overcome via repetition, as to learn perfect timing.

Definitely worth a buy, especially for 5 dollars. That's a steal for a game this good.

The visual design is terrible (the number of times I accidentally jumped on spikes because they look the same as the other platforms) and until you get the bash ability, the movement is super clunky and slow.  The combat is one dimensional and the chase sequences make me want to pull my hair out.

Granted there were a couple of parts where I found the platforming to be fun, mostly because the bash ability is interesting and created a lot of depth to the movement.

387290,129983339,76561197980472955,0,52,839,0,839,1672694412,"Running contradictory to the often serene and welcoming environments of Ori and the Blind Forest, this game is a seriously challenging metroidvania, with significant emphasis on platforming and combat. By the time I finished and then reloaded to go back and get 100% on the map, I was left mostly satisfied with little interest in replaying for some of the more difficult challenges/achievements. If you're looking for a ""one-and-done"" experience, you could certainly do worse and there's enough material here to fuel a long weekend's worth of play.

It's probably immediately clear that the game is gorgeous and has a distinct presentation in mind. Along with the vivid colours and natural shapes is an orchestral soundtrack that helps provide a ton of atmosphere for many areas and elevating already heightened energetic sequences. The best word to describe the world and its friendly inhabitants is charming. Even though most of the narrative is conveyed in non-verbal cut-scenes or with a spartan line of text here or there, there's enough meat to be engaged with what's occurring and can at times make for quite an emotive experience.

Unfortunately as well realised the world is, I found it too many times leaning towards form over function. Far too many times I was unable to gauge what was a hazard in the foreground or background, where certain hazards were in relation to platforms and so on. Though death has minimal consequence so long as you're reliable with placing manual checkpoints, it nevertheless is frustrating to go for a jump and die to what you thought was a safe space and not a trap. There are also several blind jumps requiring leaps of faith which I don't appreciate at the best of times, but especially not in a game with a difficulty such as in Ori. 

Though exploring the world can be fun when you have enough momentum from chaining jumps and bounces between enemies and platforms, I found that I was having more fun towards the end simply moving around when I had various abilities rather than a slower paced jump between ledges. Though you obtain a double jump fairly soon after starting, the game immediately gives the impression that it'd have been better if you started with it anyhow. There's also a dash found in an optional area that really gets you moving, but I only found this after initially beating the game and then going back to complete everything. That you can even upgrade the ability before you get it seems a bit daft to me.

The upgrade system in general seems very tacked-on. The upgrades themselves are useful for sure, but something like a triple jump being locked behind the end of an upgrade tree seems generally unnecessary. I will say though that being able to upgrade the ability to detect secrets is quite welcome, especially in a game of this type, but zooming in on the map can be frustrating at times as there's a lack of real granular control over zooming out. I think just generally unlocking abilities through discovery is far more meaningful than grinding enemies to get experience to spend. 

Combat itself is also massively improved by having more abilities at your disposal; again I'm left wondering if the game wouldn't just be more fun if some of these were available to you from the start. At any rate I found the combat to be fine, but mostly by way of button mashing. There are fun combos you can pull off, again typically towards the back half of the game when you have more abilities, but a lot of the time it boils down to fire, wait, fire, wait. Though I wouldn't call some enemies bullet sponges, they definitely feel like they take one or two hits more than would be ideal.

What compounds issues I have with both the platforming and combat though are the controls. Whilst most of the time they respond absolutely fine, there are moments, too frequent for my liking, where I'd be convinced I'm pressing to do one thing and having that not be replicated on-screen. A good example would be a ground pound and pressing to drop from a ledge. If you're rapidly moving it can feel like the game isn't quite keeping up with you. Sometimes this can be a minor hiccup, but it also led to many deaths.

Scattered throughout the game there are chase sequences. Though not quite auto-scrolls, they fulfil a similar function. With some of the above criticisms in mind, these can be incredibly frustrating and seldom satisfying when getting past them. Between instant-deaths through not being able to clearly see hazards due to the art design, to being bombarded with hazards that make first-time runs unlikely, I generally found them to not be fun. Though in retrospect these sequences don't last too long, they also have no checkpoints which can make them particularly frustrating if you die to something you didn't expect to. As a whole the game can be quite inconsistent with regards to what constitutes an instant-death, so having to hope that in these chase sequences they're not present isn't exactly a great feeling.

Despite my many issues with the game, it is still generally enjoyable to play. When everything is working fluidly it boasts dynamic movement in enjoyably challenging spaces. Though it has rough edges to it, the glue holding the game together is very strong. Enough that I had little doubt about seeing the end, but perhaps not enough to make me want to come back to it in the future to do casual replays or challenge runs.

387290,129982692,76561199162864482,0,17,805,0,805,1672635814,"A short, but decent platformer/metroidvania, wrapped in some of the most visually appealing Ghibli-inspired artwork, lighting and particle effects I have ever seen in a game. Definitely worth $5, but maybe not if it cost as much as a typical full-priced game. Due to the heavy post-processing going on, you might want to pass on this if your hardware is a potato.

Although Ori looks a bit cutesy and childish with its Pokemon-esque main character, this is a moderately challenging platformer. You will die, often. Thankfully it's gore-free and you instantly respawn at your last save point without any fanfare, and you can pretty much quicksave wherever you want most of the time. The drawback is you lose all progress since saving, and since you just pop back into existence like nothing happened, this can cause the player to forget to recollect any gained powerups. Save often, because the developers are very fond of instant death traps you don't see until they've killed you.

Although this is technically a metroidvania, most of the upgrades are typical platforming fare; double-jump, dash, stomp, climb. Ori's wall-jumping puts Samus to shame. Combat takes a backseat, and there aren't any real boss fights. The Three Plot Coupons of Power are sitting around unguarded, so you just collect them and then survive a lengthy instant-death escape sequence where you can't save, so you get to redo the entire sequence from the start each time you die (making these the hardest parts of the game).

Ori is a short game. A new player going in blind and doing plenty of backtracking for secrets will probably 100% it in less than twelve hours. There is an achievement for completing it in less than three. For some reason there is also an RPG-style upgrade tree which might give the illusion of customization and replayability, but the truth is it's just three linear upgrade paths, and you will probably max out all three by the end, so it doesn't really matter. Any replayability will come from doing challenges like the one-life mode or a playthrough without taking any optional upgrades.

Taking heavy artistic cues from Studio Ghibli, the story is an appealing, but formulaic, fairy tale. You are a forest spirit of pure light, your opponent is a not-quite-evil-but-hostile beast of literal darkness. Collect the Three Elemental Powers to restore balance, but the most powerful force of all is motherly love.

What I discovered is a great  platformer with some really challenging moments I really enjoyed. This is coming from someone who enjoys Supermeatboy so  be in now doubt this game gets frustratingly hard towards the end but rewards you with enough dopamine when you finally make it.

I would rate this 8/10 overall. Well worth a buy if you like a platformer however not as good as Supermeatboy or Celeste in my opinion however still a great game. I'm now downloading Will of the Wisp wish me luck!

It is a game where not only are the visuals breathtaking, but the music creates a sense of majesty, the story feels so intimate and powerful it can move you to tears, all while the gameplay is so smooth that you feel truly free while traveling through the world. 
On the note of the gameplay alone the ""Bash"" mechanic is singlehandedly one of the most innovative and great tools a platformer could ask for. It re-contextualizes combat from the enemies acting as obstacles to enemies becoming bridges and helping hands to travel around. The game was also bold in its execution of replacing boss fights with escape sequences (AKA the best parts of Metroid). 
The only critique I have for the game is that despite the main themes being forgiveness and compassion even to creatures that do a lot of harm, there is no way to beat the game without ""killing"" a lot of enemies which are described as brainwashed by the setting.

Ori and the Blind Forest was one of the first games I picked up as I was pulling away from online multiplayer games.

The game is a bit shallow, though. You don't have a huge variety of different attacks or moves (compared to, say, Super Mtroid), the game is fairly short, and none of the puzzles are particularly complex or difficult. If you want to play a classic Metroidvania I would recommend Bloodstained before this. If you want to play a platformer I would recommend Celeste (2D) and Neon White (3D) before this, especially Celeste.

That makes this game quite an odd one, because I have virtually nothing to criticize about it.
The gameplay, as far as my criteria goes, is just about perfect. It's smooth and responsive. It’s a tad bit limited, but I quite like that aspect. This is a platformer first, and a fighting game second. So having your primary damage source be a floating ball that follows you around is quite nice in my opinion. It also lends an air of innocence to the main character since it’s not them directly attacking things most of the time.
If I had to list one gripe with the gameplay, that would be in the level design. Specifically, a certain escape sequence early in the game. A similar, smaller scale sequence earlier on would have been a good idea, as the difficulty jumps very steeply in that particular sequence. Since this is the kind of game that could easily attract people who are new to 2D platformers, that escape sequence could ruin the day for a few of them.

On the topic of the story, it is quite lovely. It's not incredibly complex, but it is a slight step up from your usual predictable plot line.

I would go out of my way to praise this game for being a visual masterpiece, but I see no point in doing that, since its blatantly obvious from just one look at it.

It is worth mentioning that this is one of those games that is more about the experience, rather than the challenge. At least that is what it’s desighn seems to imply. Something I personally like since I find it to be significantly more enjoyable than the “You did something hard, welcome to the club” aspect of some games. Though that’s just me, and the game still can be challenging for some people.

Overall, this is a fine game. This is well and truly one of my favorite games. The few dozen hours I’ve spent in this game were more pleasant than the thousands of hours I’ve spent in most other games.

Ori and the Blind Forest is a quite fast paced game, I would describe it as a parkour metroidvania where trash enemies are mostly there to get around even faster. 

What I really found interesting was the idea that you change the world through completing parts of the game which enables you to get to formerly unreachable places. 

Through skillpoints you get the option to unlock passive and some active abilities. One path is a offensive path, another a defensive one and the third (the one I chose to complete first) helps with exploration. This shows you where the hidden items are (and what they are). This also plays into the whole fast paced stile, you never spend long to shoot on walls in order to find secrets (like in other Metroidvanias) but you exactly know where the items are. You ""just"" have to find how to get there. As far as I know those are all just upgrades to your health and energy containers... which is the reason why I won't bother to get them all. 

As I said, I saw the ending and I am satisfied and touched by how it all played out. 

I played it on normal difficulty and found it the right choice for me. I never felt like I have to do some backtracking for some upgrades to health and energy because of the way this game's save system works: You can either save on some of the few save-stations or with one special ability which creates a save spot almost anywhere in the world (you have to clear the area from trash enemies first). This uses up 1 energy container which can be refilled through collecting some kind of ore you see occationaly. 

Don't forget to save as often as possible though, since if you don't, all items you collected will have to be collected again. I wasn't happy about this at first, but as I got more and more energy containers, I learned to safe frequently. 

I recommend this game because it was a fun fast paced ride and the game had a few surprises of how to manoeuver the character through some passages and to solve some puzzles. There were some challenging platforming sections but it never felt unfair and it was so satisfying when you got through them alive. 

I expected it to be a 8.5 / 10, I was pleasantly surprised so my verdict is a solid 9 / 10.",1671317150,1671317150,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is undeniable that Ori and The Blind Forest is beautiful, but sometimes, that beauty with overloaded effects can work against the player. Moments where you simply cannot see where you are or what you are doing because the bright and colourful effects explodes around Ori are far too frequent. Sometimes the foreground blocks the view of the game. The game's graphics effectively hinders gameplay, instead of working to serve it as it should (you know, as a video game).

I usually don't care about linearity in a Metroidvania game, I love Metroid Fusion, but the way Ori's level design comes together really does not feel all that novel: when an area connects, it's less of the joy of discovery and more of ""oh, here again."" Much of the usual backtracking is also confined to simple items, and most of the games ""big areas"" are more or less separate, including the three main dungeons.

The level design at the local level for each of these dungeons is marvelous. Essentially, Ori and the Blind Forest is a puzzle platformer first and foremost; its openness is nothing too impressive, and its combat is quite mediocre. But the platforming challenges are design very well, testing the players both in their ability to understand how to navigate, as well as their platforming skill itself. The skills you unlock are used frequently in conjunction with one another in increasingly more elaborate platforming puzzles and set pieces, showcasing some of the most exhilarating moments.

The problem is, the control of the platforming itself is not that satisfying. The jumps and movements are far too floaty and momentum heavy, making it feel much more imprecise than it should be. This leads to extremely frustrating sequences in set piece moments where you are constantly dying because of input error that you didn't mean. For example, while gliding, the only way to lower your altitude is to let go of the gliding, since pulling down the analogue stick would result in stomp (and instant death in most areas that require gliding). However, the speed of your movement while you are gliding is very much momentum-based, and sometimes it's so easy to accidentally stomp straight down you the spikes.

Then there is the downright mediocre combat. Basically, you spam the attack button, which fires auto-targeted projectiles at your enemies. Problem is, the range and aiming is difficult to gauge in the mess of a fight. There is no way to snipe enemies either. Combat in fact does not evolve after getting stomp, which has pretty limited uses anyway. Considering that most of the enemies throw projectiles at you in a pretty random manner, it becomes far too hectic for it be sophisticated. These enemy projectiles also works to further frustrate platforming, since the last third of the game depends on you to use a skill that lets you bounce off of these enemy projectiles--which becomes incredibly annoying when these projectiles are fired in a random pattern and timing, while your in-air controls are pretty unsatisfying already due to how imprecise it is to keep the momentum.",1670471612,1670471612,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It does it's job really well, but personally, I don't think I would play it again, or play the second game. I originally bought the full pack because it was on sale; 2 versions of the first game, and ori and the will of the wisp because originally, I was intrigued. I was dragged in by the beautiful graphics, and I had just finished hollow knight so I thought I would give this a try. In the end, I finished the game, not because I wanted to or was invested in the storyline, but simply because I refused to give up and leave a game I knew that if I stopped now, I would never finish it. After pulling through, I swore off the game and though I recently gave Ori and the will of a wisp a try, I don't think I will be finishing that.

Pros:
The series in general is very well made. The art is beautiful and the music is just perfect. The game mechanics are pretty smooth and straightforward too, you gain abilities throughout the game, go through difference regions, defeat enemies, collect items, and progress. 
The movement is a little challenging sometimes and the puzzles are varied, so if you are an avid 2d platformer player, you'd probably enjoy this. 
The save system is very VERY nice. You can practically save anywhere as long as you have the mana for it. This has saved my life so many times since the map is so big and occasionally unforgiving. 

Cons:
I think it is just me, but sometimes I confuse the background with what I am actually able to step on. The art is so detailed that personally, sometimes I get a little confused. Speaking of confusion, there are a few moments where I just get confused. It varies from what I'm supposed to be doing, where I'm supposed to be going, etc. I don't see many other people running into this issue though so it may be me, but at the final stretch of the game, I got so confused that it took me 4 different sessions to find out where I was going, and by the end of it, I was just so sick and tired that it didn't even feel good to complete the game. 
The storyline and timed gameplay. Timed gameplay is great when done well, and personally, I think ori and the wisp only did decent on it. With the number of timed scenes, if you're not extremely comfortable with the controls, it can sometimes take several tries and I am talking SEVERAL. As for the storyline, it is sometimes easy to get distracted from the main story. Of course, there are some holes in the story but i'm not here to complain or point those out. The issue with the story, is how easily it is to just completely forget why you're doing what you're doing. 2 hours into this game, and I already pretty much forgot the main story because I was so busy being frustrated and lost. 

In Summary,
You should get ori and the wisp if you're a huge 2d platformer fan, the art and music is masterfully made and almost every aspect of the game is smooth. However if you're not a 2d platformer fan, I recommend you give it a little more thought.

This game is definitely more platforming-based than combat, any combat sections are pretty small and there is rarely a need to aim (when you do have to aim, it's often in a more puzzley manner, even in combat). There are a couple arenas where you must defeat enemies to progress, but they are few and far between, and generally not very difficult. Usually they serve to [i]teach[/i] mechanics, more than to prove mastery of them. Mastery of mechanics is demonstrated in dramatic quick-time platforming sequences.

For me, this game is a true masterpiece. As I usually don't have much free time (job and familiy), I cannot afford time checking reviews and comparing game suggestions to find the true videogame gems. And I feel lucky that I could find this one!

This game has an interesing way to save your progress. You get introduced to it within the first couple of minutes playing the game. Still, I consider this a very mild spoiler so read on on your own risk:
[spoiler] You may save the game anytime in most spots as long as they are considered ""secure"", e. g. not on spikes. But in order to save the game, you need some energy that doesn't recover automatically. This also means if you didn't save your game for 5 minutes and die - BAM! You just wasted 5 minutes of your life. With all those games with checkpoints today, this game felt harsh in the beginning but ultimately gives you more contol over your saves than most games today.[/spoiler]

[b]Music[/b]
Personally, I think good games need a good soundtrack and this one sounds great. Are you a fan of typical, modern Disney movies with it's sad-romantic-(sometimes)funny-happilyEverAfter-friendship stories? These movies also have some specific kind of soundtrack that I can hardly describe, but this game gives you the same feeling - but don't get me wrong, I am referring to the music only, not those Disney movies where they sing every 5 minutes for 10 minutes. 

[b]Visuals[/b]
Be aware, this game looks pretty colorful. Some people like that, some don't. Guess what? I like it a lot in this game. Also, some people don't like 2D games and then, too, you are out of luck here. Another issue with platformers can be that there are so many details drawn in the world that you cannot clearly distinct the background from the foreground - meaning you try to jump to something that [b]seems[/b] to be a platform but instead of landing on it you fall into your doom. This happened to me only a few times so nothing to be really frustrated about.

[b]Visuals[/b]
I have 2 healthy hands and I am used to play games with a controller - and for me this is a typical game to play with a controller. Should you prefer using mouse + keyboard or are somehow disabled regarding your hands, please ignore that part of the review. 
The controls feel great: Responsive as well as good and intuitive button assignment. Be aware that you gain more and more abilities as you progress through the game and you will encounter the principle of ""easy to learn - hard to master"". You get introduced to each ability but in the end you need to combine most of them to be able to beat the game. I have no comparison here but think it is an average difficulty for fans of platformers but probably (too?) high difficulty for more-casual gamers.

[b]Story[/b]
Guess again: Yes, I like the story. Most of the time you will be busy with doing your platforming stuff. I assume the ""amount of story"" could not fill a full-fledged movie. However, there are some parts that tell you more about the background and some parts continue the main story. Unexpectedly, the story is pretty emotional and again, it feels like a typical, modern Disney movie.",1670160699,1670160699,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The graphics and sound design/music are excellent, but they got too lost in overwhelming visual effects and repetitive sound effects (like the attack noise - I ended up mashing a lot as I never got a good handle on the controls and wanted to get back to exploring asap).  There are elements of the game that would work really well if fit together slightly differently but the overall flow of the game was too inconsistent and frustrating that I couldn't appreciate them even if I wanted to.  The story is also good - I wouldn't herald it as incredible, but it was serviceable -  but I wasn't able to appreciate it either because it tended to be paired with a game mechanic that frustrated me or felt too sharp a turn from the exploration parts of the game.  A prime example would be the chase/timed sequences that pop up a couple times; they're valid game mechanics on their own, but when the rest of the game is untimed and frequently saving your progress becomes common, it feels too unnatural to have to repeat multiple rooms multiple times because you didn't react to an offscreen falling rock fast enough or you accidentally used your double jump and were instantly killed by a spike.  All in all, I would recommend giving the game a shot as I'm pretty sure it's more that it wasn't my kind of thing, but I feel like it could have benefitted from a little more balancing and mechanic refinement.",1670049414,1670049414,False,2,0,0.493964284658432007,0,True,False,False

 [td]The game can be completed in approximately 3 hours if you follow just the main campaign. If you wish to collect everything on the map and complete the game 100% you need to spend over 12 hours to complete it. This game is worth replaying several times if you plan to 100% complete the achievements. Does not offer anything except a difficulty curve. [/td]

 [td]Played this game 50/50 on my Steam Deck and the other half on PC. It runs great, but due to the fact that the visuals are so small on the screen it really not that hot to look at in my opinion. It looks great, don't get me wrong, but due to low resolution, you can't see the actual details on put by devs. Still, if you want to play it and have the intention to play anywhere, this works without a single problem.[/td]

 [td]It took me a long time to pick this game up, but once I did I finally understood what makes this game so special. The visuals, the music, the story, and the gameplay for me make this a perfect game to play anywhere you want. This is one of the best platformer games I've ever played.[/td]

Ori and the Blind Forest is a Metroidvanian, adventure 2D platformer with great emphasis on exploration. You play as Ori, a white guardian spirit alongside Sein who is your guide in this world and helps you understand your role in this magical and beautiful world.

[h3] ⚔ Gameplay: [/h3] 
Rate: ★★★★★
 
Playing like Ori felt amazing. The controls are snappy, reactive, and fun. In the world, you collect special orbs to upgrade yourself and your abilities. You traverse through areas where there are puzzles and in often situations you are required to backtrack to unlock doors or pick up power-ups after collecting certain abilities.

Puzzles are at every step and the game can be rather difficult, but thanks to saving at any step of the game you get to traverse easily through a lot of them, with little difficulty once you get the hang of the controls.

At the end, once you collected and upgraded your powers to the max, you become a powerhouse that can melt enemies in seconds with a large variety of mobility skills that make traversing quick and effortless.

[h3] 😄 Fun: [/h3] 
Rate: ★★★★★ 
 
I've had a lot of fun in this game from start to finish. The world feels fun and puzzle areas aren't too difficult if you plan to play this game on normal for the first time. If you wish to have a challenge there is something like that for you. Once you are at the end-game part, everything feels great and it's just fun to mess around with the abilities. Everything you do interacts with enemies and the world and it's a lot of fun to play.
 
[h3] 🏞 Visuals: [/h3] 
Rate: ★★★★★
 
The game visuals were the first thing that actually made me curious to try this game out. It's a beautiful-looking game even if it came with the definitive edition back in 2016. This game doesn't look like it aged at all and even if you plan to pick it now, you'll have a lot to appreciate.

[h3] 🔊 Sound: [/h3] 
Rate: ★★★★★
 
One of the best soundtracks I've ever listened to. The main menu OST hits you in the feels right from the beginning. At the end, you're presented with a mix of the same OST that hits you right in the feels again. It has outstanding sound effects and could say voice acting is pleasant to listen to.
 
[h3] 📖 Story: [/h3] 
Rate: ★★★★★
 
This game is renowned for making people cry. I personally didn't have an issue, but it sure is a sad and beautiful story. You play as Ori, a guardian spirit sent into this magical world and looked after one of the last inhabitants of that world. Unfortunately, your parent dies and you're forced to find your way in this world until you discover Sein, the guide that introduces you in this world. From there your adventure starts and you discover who you are and what is your purpose.

[h3] 🧵 Length: [/h3] 
 
☑️  Short 
☑️ Average 
🔲 Long  
🔲 Unlimited 
 
The game can be completed in under 3 hours as a speed runner. If you take your time about 12 hours to complete 100% of a run.
 
[h3] 🧩 Difficulty: [/h3] 
 
🔲 Easy 
☑️ Normal 
☑️ Hard 
☑️ Brutally Hard 
🔲 Impossible 
 
There are several difficulties and I personally didn't play this game on easy. I started on normal and on my second and 3rd playthrough I've went for Hard and One Life Challenge. Saving at every step makes this a pleasant and easier platformer than most games I've played.

[h3] ⭕Conclusion: [/h3] 
Ori and the Blind Forest is a masterpiece. The story, the visuals, and the soundtrack on top of a great and snappy gameplay make this for a perfect platformer game that makes me super excited to play its sequel. I want to thank the devs for this awesome experience. It's a must-play game.

Being climatic does not make your shitty game design go away.
Movement and abilities are mixed package and sometimes feel super cool and sometimes clunky or unfair.
Default PC keyboard settings screem like a cereal game from 2005.
Saving mechanic feels very shitty. You can easily trap yourself with low hp in a terrible spot.
After dying your hp, energy, collectibles and even cutscenes are restored to previous state. You often times feels punished for not saving often enough. And later punished for not having more energy to save or saving with too low hp.
About half of mechanics are introduced by killing you, without built-in savespot just before them.
Some of platforming challenges are hard to read. Like a new mechanic that is introduced to you in the middle of longer challange and you cant play with it in isolation. Or multiple leap of faith, where you often die without knowing whats down there which force you to use energy to save even more often.
Spikes, spikes everywhere. And without proper save mechanic you die, and you die a lot. Often times you kill yourself, because there is no point in trying to finish a sequence with low hp.
Enemies are annoying or a slug to go through. ""Bosses"" are laughably easy.
Combat through most of the game means spamming one ability. You don't use most of other abilities as they share resource with saving the game. Like seriously, WTF?
Game is very linear. To the point where I really don't know why is it open world and not just separate levels you can go back to.
Story is meh.

To conclude. Game feels difficult not because of interesting challenges, but because on every step you feel like your character, terrain, enemies, level design etc tell you ""f*ck you, thats why"". If I wanted to suffer, I would play Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy. If you don't want to suffer, and you want hard, but fair game, then (re)play Celeste or Hollow Knight instead.",1669338994,1669338994,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

But I have heard all of these things criticized at one point or another (except the soundtrack, which really is excellent).

	Many have said that Blind Forest is not a “true” metroidvania - it is too short, and too linear. Most, if not all, backtracking is optional, and this is even more true of the Definitive Edition, which gives you fast-travel points to cut down on retreading of old ground. I would say this is fair, but I do not love Blind Forest because I love metroidvanias (although I usually do); I love it on its own merits, and while it resembles a metroidvania superficially it is truly its own thing. And while I’m sure I have played “better” titles, it is nonetheless my favorite single-player game of all time.

	Blind Forest is not so much a metroidvania as a platformer set within one massive, sprawling “level”. I have always loved platformers - back when I first saved up the money to buy a Nintendo Gamecube in, like, 2003, all the games I initially bought for it were platformers: Spyro, Mario, even Pac-Man World. Traversal of a perilous game world is a huge part of my gaming heritage, and Blind Forest delivers perilous traversal in spades. So while it doesn’t offer the freedom of exploration some might hope for, it seems custom-engineered for me.

	I have read criticism of Blind Forest’s movement, calling it floaty, or imprecise, but unlike the linearity I genuinely cannot understand this. Yes, Ori’s movement is lightweight - his jump is not that high, and his fall back to the ground is very gradual compared to, say, Hollow Knight. But imprecise it is not, and floatiness is not, of itself, a sin! Blind Forest’s platforming hugely emphasizes airtime and nimbly guiding Ori through obstacles without every really coming down to rest on the ground. Sometimes these sequences can be quite lengthy, not to mention formidably challenging, and in these cases the extra airtime empowers the player to make snap decisions on the fly - no other game has ever given me the feeling of almost literally improvising my way through a teeth-gritting platforming challenge like the Ori games.

	None of this would be possible without Ori’s signature move: the Bash. A little self-contained miracle of game design, Bash opens up new horizons for your traversal options. When you Bash on a suitable target, time freezes, you have a few moments to aim in any direction you wish, and then the pressure is released in a satisfying woosh that launches Ori in that direction and refreshes your midair jump. 

You can bash off hanging lanterns, which positively litter the game world; but you can also bash off enemies and/or their ranged projectiles, which allows you to incorporate them into your movement choreography. With Bash, enemies become stepstools rather than mere obstacles, and Blind Forest is elevated from being merely an aesthetically interesting game to a groundbreaking one. Bash is unique, and exciting, and is central to everything that makes the game work. It is supremely designed. The opening 30% of the game, before you unlock Bash, is by far its weakest as a result - my one genuine criticism of Blind Forest is that takes too long to become great. For someone less inclined toward platformers than myself, I can imagine giving up on the game early all too well.

But the other 70% is some of the most pristine and satisfying platforming I’ve ever had the pleasure of experiencing in a game. Nothing else scratches its itch. True, the combat is basic and unexciting, but the combat is not the point; Blind Forest knows to play to its strengths. Frankly, more games should.

All in all, it had fluid movement and played smoothly. My biggest gripes were the control and gameplay. Nothing being able to customise controls is one thing, but when the controls in place have a lot of finicky issues, it's makes things less enjoyable. I didn't care for S being two different actions, and also didn't like how many single buttons had 3+ purposes. The keyboard has dozens of keys guys, come on. 

Gameplay wise: 4 chase sequences? Really? 4? It got old after the second one, and when it dawned on me there would likely be more, I was pretty disappointed. When I got to them, I was thoroughly disappointed. Such a wasted use of the otherwise interesting abilities. 

I get thousands of people liked this but: if you're not into chase sequences, general fickle platforming, and single button-mashing, I don't think the art justifies the experience. It doesn't help that the plot felt incomplete too.",1668844436,1668844436,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are two reasons for this: One, my negative reviews get more attention and, two, I feel like it's more of a service to point out the negatives of a game for those of you who don't have a to of time to waste playing something that is aggravating. Let's get into it.

Ori and the Blind Forest is what some people would call a Metroidvania, but it is not that. Metroidvanias are not 'difficult by design.' I have played many. People who claim this is a Metroidvania lack the understanding of what a Metroidvania-style game actually is. That being said, what this IS, is a side-scrolling action-adventure game more in the vein of the Lion-King on Sega Genesis than it is a Metroidvania. While it shares SOME aspects with the Metroid series, it's more akin to Megaman as well, with many one-hit kill sections, and serious platforming perfection requirements. Platform perfection is not something which Metroid games, or as far as I remember, Castlevania, frequently required in the times from which they are most known for: The Gameboy/SNES era of gaming. Combine this with the fact that you can save wherever you want  for the most part, and this further distances itself from what a Metroidvania is. Now that this is cleared up, let's talk the usual four subject-matters: Story, Gameplay, Graphics, and Sound.

===Story===
Many people are lauding this story as something amazing, but I can pretty much sum this up in a single sentence, in a single trope. ""Young 'x' has village/home burnt down by marauding force that doesn't like what is happening, and 'x' must go on an adventure to restore the land."" It's a tale older than recorded history, but that doesn't make it fantastic. There is actually very little story here, and at no point will it surprise you. Even the end was hardly worth more than a watch on Youtube. Maybe this is a game for children. I could see it, as it requires exceptional attention to perfection and can easily suck you in with that all-too-well-known feeling of 'well, I HAVE to do it, because if I don't I'll have wasted my time and I won't be able to tell everyone I beat it.'

Which, as it turns out, is about all this game has to offer: Bragging rights. To explain why, let's talk about Gameplay.

===Gameplay===
Gameplay consists of tight, but exceptionally difficult platforming sections which, were it not for the hundreds of cheap deaths and intentional 'screw yous' that the developer put in the strangest places, would probably clock the game in at about five hours, tops. There are a lot of enemies that can one-shot you for no reason, a lot of terrain spikes that can do the same, and a lot of just weird places where said terrain spikes are. It's as if they made the map, made the game, then realized they couldn't feasibly charge 19.99 for it or whatever it went for back in the day, and THEN decided that their game should be difficult to the point of being tone-deaf. 

The story was never worth the difficulty which was posed. The art is nice, but not worthy of the effort needed to see it. You can see good art online for free, and without having to jump through a series of frustratingly difficult jump puzzles. In fact, some of these puzzles actually break up the flow, and there were a lot of times where I was just contemplating leaving this game in a sin bin. It still belongs there, but I finished it and now have the 'gamer clout' necessary to criticize the hell out of it for being more annoying than it was fun. 

Games should be fun. Not work. This was work. I'm warning you now: If you don't want your free-time to be taken up by 'work,' then this may not be the game for you. 

===Graphics===
This is where the game shines, but perhaps only on a surface level. There is some environmental storytelling, but it's difficult to make any conclusions about it. For instance, there's a volcano, and there are ruins, but no real explanation or way to find out why or how they got there, unless they're from that once race that built some stuff in the cold mountains, had the ability to make heated seats, but still froze to death anyways. So what little environmental storytelling there is doesn't even make much sense, but the backgrounds are beautiful and Ori moves with the kind of grace befitting a forest spirit, so there's that.

===Sound===
The sound is only second to the graphics. Things feel appropriate across the board. Big chunking hits from a giant bird sound like it would to someone as small as Ori, who itself makes cute noises every so often. It's all very adorable, and again, at odds with its difficulty. Tonally deaf, though the game may be in some ways, what isn't tone-deaf is the music. It's absolutely fantastic, and I would say that it's worth a purchase on its own, even without the game. Or you could listen on Spotify. Why not both? They really outdid themselves, and even if I don't appreciate this latest decade's obsession with difficult gaming, the composer and team who did the sound and score deserve props.

Shame the terrible difficulty took away from the synergy that the sound and GOOD, ENJOYABLE gameplay would have brought. This would have been one of my favorite games of all time if it weren't for those 400 cheap deaths I encountered.

Did I mention it counts? Does it matter? Absolutely not.

===Conclusion===
Ori and the Blind Forest is difficult. Too difficult for how cute it is, and unfortunately leaves a sour taste in my mouth that only listening to the soundtrack made even remotely palatable. That's it. Play it if you REALLY like platformers, but otherwise just buy the soundtrack and watch someone else. It'll be much more entertaining, especially if they suck at it, like I did. Go buy the soundtrack instead. Did I mention the soundtrack? Go listen, then go buy. Do it. I dare you. Just maybe not the game itself. Just the soundtrack.

The audio and music is delightful and accents the levels perfectly.

The game has a beautiful art style and the sound design is super solid.

Unfortunately that is all I can say good about this game. The controls were frustrating and felt unresponsive more than half of the time. The games escape sequences are brutal and usually aren’t difficult to figure out but the unresponsive controls or relying on the enemy to fire at a specific time to reach the next area is beyond annoying and frustrating. If shoving razor blades under your fingernails sounds like a great time you might enjoy this game because this is nothing but pain and suffering. No matter how good the story and art style is, it can't save the literal cancer this game play is.

I give this game a 1 out of 10.

I know how much people like a given media is subjective but I'm honestly sort of baffled by people saying they loved it over Hollow Knight. To be clear, I do like platformers. Celeste might be a good comparison; Celeste was also a bit too hard for me but I still enjoyed what I played and it was compelling right from the beginning in a way that made me want to push through it regardless of the difficulty. Ori just didn't do that for me. I also think the super detailed graphics impede the precision needed, especially at first when you're trying to learn the mechanics.

387290,124787476,76561199124586313,0,3,910,0,884,1667991861,"As the developers of Moon Studios who made this Ori and The Blind Forest, I have to admit this game is remarkable because of the soundtrack but the gameplay may be dark and a bit tedious but that doesn't mean it's a underwhelming game, this type of Metroidvania looks promising as I'm not counting Will Of The Wisps but for me who has completed it from start to finish, I shouldn't have to give this anything less but positive, here's my review below.


Ori And The Blind Forests starts off lifeless, no light just in a dark forest near the small river, now it's your chance to bring everything to life and light as you progress since your Ori and you could be the light anyway there are collectables to collect and abilities to get from each little willow tree that is lurking in some areas for the first ability as an example you absorb the light from the little tree and you gain an ability to help you progress through the game, don't worry not going to mention any spoilers for those who haven't got the game yet but this little part should get you started with the game you also get collectables.


The Collectables include getting more life cells and energy cells, The Life Cells give you more health so that Ori doesn't die quickly the little light you play as think you start off with I believe 3 life cells and the energy cells help you create soul links which helps you save the game which is important incase you die, I mean good luck completing this game with 1 life mode because I find it impossible but back to the point, saving the game is important because you don't have to start all the way back so keep creating soul links from the energy cells it uses 1 energy cell per use but if you upgrade the collectable parts of orange cells as you defeat enemies or find Big Orange Cells which are all over the Ori and The Blind Forest map which gives you points collect enough orange cells from enemies as the round guage in the below middle of the screen, fill that up you get points which accumulate towards the skill tree.


These points will help you get through the game, it will help you on Offense which includes getting powerful as you attack in the offense skill line, there's one for collecting which you recover cells more frequently or getting more life cells/health and such so it's not just the offense skill line but there's one for collecting and I believe one is for Defense so you don't take as much damage from enemies and thron spike plants yeah those plants are everywhere in Ori and the blind forest game as you can die easily.


Above all this Ori And The Blind Forest is a masterpiece and it's easily replayable if you have the time but these days there are a lot of Metroidvanias and rogue like games out there and still many more to come in the future but if you haven't played Ori and the blind forest yet I suggest you pick it up it's a special Metroidvania that Microsoft Game Studios who published this, it's even better to take it on the go on the Steam Deck but It obviously does work on the PC, remarkable game which can not be missed or sleep on, More Metroidvanias for steam the better as it give you the time to enjoy it from start to finish like this one, that's my review and it's highly recommended if you haven't got it yet, The End.",1667326129,1667326129,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Often it boils down to that you get lovely visuals but the story falls flat or comes off as amateur or it has a great story to tell but you have to like the choice of style in the decided art style which can look dated (intentionally or not). When it comes to Ori & The Blind Forest its a shockingly well executed game that has a fluid visuals, audio that defines it whether its effect or music, and a memorable (though simple) story to tell.

Visuals - You can keep it real simple when it comes to metroidvania games and as long as you can make it fun with some challenges to it I have to say this goes beyond that when they could of gone less. The lighting, layers and fluid movements of the world and characters is almost like a children's book come to life. How the trees sway in a violent storm or how the characters aside from Ori have a range of motions to show that the world is interactive and they're not just there to be there. It leaves an impression and a very positive one at that.

Gameplay - It is after all a metroidvania game and those that make them fun with their own version such as wall climbing, dashing or various attacks can make or break it. Controls are responsive in which I used an 8bitdo Pro 2 controller and though at times I felt inputs weren't always as on demand as I would prefer I would chock that up as my own lack of reaction speed or timing. The big difference is unlike most metrovania games this is more of a heavier puzzle solver and there are really no boss fights in a traditional sense. Upgrading your skills and getting new moves is fun and you find yourself using a lot of the kit as you progress and its used well in level design to make sure you don't slack on the mechanics you've learned so far.

Sound - The game recognizes its identity with its use of sound, music and unique dialogue. There is a charm to unknown languages being used to really bring you into the game's world. The ambience gives you immersion even when no music is present and when it does its a treat for the ears and is worth listening to outside of playing the game. Voice work feels right and though not much spoken dialogue is present it really makes the statement.

Story - The story isn't really anything new and has been seen before but the way it is done through the characters and world makes it a lovely spin that turns something old new again. Cast is limited however so don't expect a lot of interactions and anything in regards to feeling bonds between isn't much aside from your take on them. Most of the time you'll be getting snippets of story mostly opting for gameplay which most metroidvania titles focus on but when they give a longer cut of story it is well delivered and not wasted. It has heart and though sparse in plot and characters it still holds it all together and serves it purpose.

If I had any complaints I was honestly surprised that despite there being a villain there wasn't any battles to be done. As stated there are no tradition boss battles that have a life bar or use of damaging moves. There is also a section of the game that has its own gimmick mechanic that makes you have to play by its rules and your move set is very limited due to it which for the most part doesn't really make it enjoyable in most cases in games. I will not remember it fondly and it seems the developers took note to that since a friend told me that there isn't a similar level in Ori 2 and that there is a more traditional boss fight as well so what I had issues with in this game have supposedly been added or omitted in the sequel.

Ori & The Blind Forest is a fun game and can be challenging from time to time but I played it on normal difficult so the skill ceiling can be raised there. Lengthwise I got eleven hours out of it and did some backtracking so came is likely more nine hours but for completionist it might stretch to thirteen give or take since many sections were near completion when I was done with it. I am happy this game is in my collection and was well worth the price though purchased on a sale discount and didn't hold back on buying the sequel Will of the Wisp which was wishlisted and purchased on sale as well. I look forward to playing the next after completing a few different titles in between.",1667071975,1667071975,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

From the tip of the volcano to the depths of the forest Ori splits the earth and divides my opinion of it in two, and unfortunately, those parts are not of equal size. While Ori's fundamental mechanics are very pleasing, with a looong dash, double jump, slingshot, ground pound, wall climb, empowered jump, wall jump, and homing dash as a fine toolset, they are wasted on a poorly paced, exceedingly frustrating, and strangely contradictory gap in writing and gameplay that see Ori fall from potentially great heights to the cold, cold ground. Why, in any world, would a game like this have a leveled combat system, let alone enemies. At no point does combat feel meaningful or impactful except for getting right in your god-damned way through a hard section that you didn't bring... energy crystals for to establish a checkpoint? Resident-evil style ink ribbons, though in much greater supply, are an exciting new innovation in the realm of ""how to soft-lock yourself into difficult sections"" and, for no good reason, are also used for gateway breaking, and occasional xp drops. Visual clarity is thrown out the window at many locations and the ability to see what's coming is occasionally stripped away in the interest of excitement, though, I will give credit to a very, very well-crafted escape segment about halfway through. An effective map is locked behind ability upgrades, in a separate tree to movement upgrades (which in a platformer is an extremely boneheaded design choice already), pathing is unbelievably boring if you attempt to regard this as a metroidvania, and based on my 7 hour playtime and 1 month completion cycle I can comfortably say that there was really nothing making me come back to the game in the day to day... Which is mostly the story's fault. Cute, sure, but there's a strange disconnect between some surprisingly difficult sections of the gameplay and the easy-read children's book story, where the former assumes a player of capability and the latter assumes the player a gelatinuous mutant capable only of breathing, eating, and shidding. A rather crude ending to this review perhaps, but Ori and the Blind Forest is to this reviewer a competent game in its crudest form.",1666926996,1666926996,False,2,0,0.396834045648574829,0,True,False,False

-------------------
do take note that i am describing the first in series, not the second.

the first in series is a bad game. here is why:
controls are not only floaty, but sloggish as well. so many times the buttons just don't seem to activate. i am often double pressing buttons. mostly the R2 button. sometimes i'm gliding, sometimes i'm not.

down = dive. this is absolutely unforgivable. a terrible implementation to any platformer.
it would be so much better if it was down + jump. (or any combo really)
why dropping through a platform needs to have a combo button, but diving doesn't, truly is just bad design. i have examples of why it's even worse than i'm stating it, but i've been told this mechanic has completely dropped from the second in series. (huge saving grace to #2)

unfair lvl design. i am starting this on hard mode, but there's a shooting enemy at the end of nearly every platforming section. it's just tedious.
there are way too many blind jumps with multiple ""gotcha"" moments.

i can see why ppl call it a metroidvania, but i've never seen one designed in such a way.
your objective is always highlighted, you always basically know where to go. if you are getting lost it's because you didn't bother checking which direction you should be heading.
it's so damn linear. it's less a metroidvania, and more just a path with secret branches that aren't very much a secret.

the combat is not even combat. again, i'm doing this on hard, and everything is just a sponge, but that's not my gripe about combat. the issue is, it's just a 1-button spam, it's just not fun.

the comparison to super meat boy was pretty good. it's a lot more like an open world SMB or Celeste. however, i believe both SMB and Celeste are far superior when it comes to game-play. Celeste especially, has a flow to it. you die and respawn quickly, but everything lines up if you just start running and jumping immediately. Ori punishes you for such and forces you to slog through sections instead of speed-running it.

the big issue with this game, is that it's not really unique at all. it steals from a list a of games and mixes all them together. imo, every game it steals from, does those things better, as those things were the focus of the game. not an add-in.

the game looks good, and has a good music track. but that's about all i can give to it. i'd probably have rather watched this play instead of playing it. even the double jump sound effect is somewhat annoying.

the story is rather basic. it's not really a minus, but it's nothing special to really give it a plus either.

the save function is something i'm not fond of. 2 reasons.
1: i don't like how it's tied up with your skill points. this goes against my grain and makes me want to not save, just so i have points available to open doors or use a skill. however, since everything resets upon death, you are forced to save often.

2: bad saves. if you save in a rough spot with low health, you regret the decision almost immediately. there's nothing you can do but work your way out of it.

i know a lot of ppl are more attached to the visuals and music, which are things that were done well here. but as a ""game"", the game-play is just horrid.
i wouldn't even bother finishing this game if i didn't end up dedicated to this thread.

i'll stress again, that the floaty controls were tolerable. even the sloggish controls could be forgiven. the down = dive really is a game-breaker though. it's legit a sin to platforming.

as you can tell, i'm not happy with the first in series at all. if i wanted to play a combat based metroidvania, i'd play HK. if i wanted to play a tight platformer, i'd play Celeste.
both games do their respective genres very well. they were only after thoughts here just to check a bunch of boxes it seems. it truly feels the game-play was back-burner focus.

i do have reason to believe the second in series would be more enjoyable than the first, but i really have to say, the first in series is just a ""bad game"" with good visuals and music.

#2 is not something i would rush to play at this point. i'm more-so only interested in #2 for appeasement reasons. appeasement of myself, and others who genuinely seem interested in my thoughts. i almost feel i have to experience #2, i'm just afraid i won't like it at all either.

to my OP. if i was asking about the first Ori instead of the second Ori, i'd tell myself if i was to look at this as a ""metroidvania"" i'd be disappointed because it's the worst implementation of a metroidvania i've ever seen. again, props to the SMB comparison, at least for the first in series.

this game should never be compared to HK. ever. both games are nothing alike.
1 last time, this is all based on #1 in Ori series. not #2.

ok, i've beaten the ""game"" now.  i have even more complaints about the controls with the final stage, but i'm done.  should have been a short disney movie instead of a game.",1666711528,1666745660,False,10,0,0.603406190872192383,0,True,False,False

I played half of this game on Steam Deck, half on my big screen. I found the clarity issues to be even worse on a small screen. Otherwise it worked perfectly. On Windows I had to disable DPI scaling in order to be able to select 4k resolution, so it was actually less hassle to play on Steam Deck than on Windows...

The music is fabulous. It has a consistent theme throughout the game.

The story is OK. It's not earth shattering, and is told mostly through few short cutscenes and 1-2 sentence narration here and there. It didn't make me tear up or anything, but I think it tried.

The graphics... Well, you've seen the screenshots, and you've seen the trailers. You know it looks beautiful. While this might appear as a big strength, it is also a big weakness of this game. The lush and vibrant environments hide important gameplay elements, like spikes, enemies, and other deadly things. You can play on big 4k TV, and you still won't notice a tiny spike at the end of the platform you thought safe. You won't realize that this fire is close enough to kill you, on a platform you thought was perfectly safe.

It will also be hard to read the locations. You'll think this lava flowing down is just a background prop, and you'll instantly die when trying to run by. Later you'll find similar looking lava flowing down, and since you did previously you'll think you have to disable it. But no, it's not dangerous, this time. Or you'll see platforms floating in the lava that you have to jump on, then run trough long and dangerous falling platforms, only to find a safe platform to jump on... That is just a background. And you'll fall into the lava and die instantly.

This brings us to the gameplay. The game is full of cheap deaths. There are spikes everywhere, instant death traps, that you won't avoid until you know they are there. Trough the whole game you'll be on 2-3 hits before dying. But often even things that kill you in multiple hits will be death, because they are in a hole you cannot go out of.

You can create a save point when you're standing in a safe spot almost at will. It costs a currency that is very easy to obtain, and there's almost nothing else to use it for. This means the game becomes slog of short pieces of game, where you'll die, and die and die until you memorize the motions needed to beat that section. You'll die to things that are too fast for humans to react, just to replay the scene and this time win since you already know it's there. It's not a fun level design. It's infuriating.

There are few ""dungeons"" in this game, and each ends with... if you guessed ""boss battle"" you guessed wrong. A runaway sequence was the right answer. So now you cannot make save spot, and instead you have to do very long escape sequence perfectly, or near perfectly. Those are all littered with instant death traps. You'll be dying over, and over, and over again. Have fun.

The combat system of this game is also painful. You basically have the best way to deal with each monster, and that's the only way it's possible/worth doing so. Otherwise they just take too many hits. While it might sound interesting it becomes tedious very quickly. And there's one frustrating enemy that you defeat by shooting bullets back, but after 2 hits they are left at 1% HP. Why not make it go down in two hits? I have no idea.

You unlock multiple skills on the way. One of the most used is an ability to jump of the enemy bullets, while shooting the bullet back at the enemy. Doing that you might end up airborne for long, long time (and you'll have to do so in runaway sequences). This can often be irritating, if the enemies won't shoot at you when you want them to... and you end up falling into lava and instantly dying.

I also didn't like the controls of the game. Due to the way the bullet jump works you basically need to use the analog for controls. But if you press down during jump by accident, you perform stomp attack, and fall into lava. It's very easy to do with the analog stick. You can also jump off the walls, but due to how it works you might accidentally start walking up or down the wall.

There is a very simple upgrade system with 3 lines, in which you can invest. Most of the skills are useful and you might want them. There are also hidden rooms and items that you have to figure out how to take. There are 3 types of collectibles, each of them are different colored balls of light. Life, energy and skill points. Rather boring.

The maps are quite varied and have some very neat ideas. Too bad those are wasted on a such frustrating game. I liked the misty forest section. I had 350+ deaths in my first run (the game actually counts it for you, so you will know that it doesn't just feel like you're dying a lot). There won't be a second run. It just wasn't fun. It's not even that difficult, it's just infuriating. Also, once I've died many times in one section I started to try less, and dying more, and more. I also found that killing Ori was often the best way to heal myself up, after getting hit on a cheap way, just so I had more health later on...

The map is quite good, but it doesn't show the secret spots you've found, which would be a bit irritating if I wanted to get all the collectibles.

All in all, I can see some types of players enjoying this game. But I think most people will drop it without even finishing it.",1666135084,1666135290,False,1,0,0.462686538696289063,0,True,False,False

I'd say that a downside of the game is that it's not 100% clear on the map where you've to go next, so I found myself spending many minutes in some part of the map trying to pass it while I was not supposed to because I didn't have certain ability yet, but I thought it's just a hard part to pass.

I started playing about 2 or 3 years ago, and quickly stop; I didn't have a controller for my pc at the time, and playing on keyboard and mouse was attrocius.

I recently started a new game,from start, and finished the game in 5:00:25 in game time.
After 5 minutes, I wanted it to be over, and when the end finally came, I was like don't you put an end credit there, ain't no way is the ending this bad, it cannot be over, and I was laughing, especially when one of the character was clipping through the ground or moving weirdly during an end scene that, I think, was meant to be emotional, but I found it so bad it was comical.

Ori is an Amazing ambient Soundtrack with superb graphics but has the fault of having to be played. 

The good:

map/level design: great. It's intuitive, I didn't get lost a single time during my second playthrough, I believe, areas are varied, have differents gimmick, there is a sense of progression, and very importantly, backtracking is not terrible as the areas changes, meaning if you go through an area that you've already visited, you will not necessarily explore it the same way, that is great.

Soundtrack: I almost wish this was the only aspect of the game lol, it's REALLY good.

Graphics: INCREDIBLY GOOD LOOKING, for about 30 minutes. Then it gets old VERY old. The amount of bloom and other flashy thing is ridiculous and often would my screen look like a blurry flashy  mess, like a bullet hell type of game, even though there is very few projectile. Also, there is many levels of depth. That looks good for 2 minutes, before you think that the wall of lava is in the background and you run through it, or you try jumping onto a wall that is in the background, or something in the front  actually hide your character. like the dog assist trophy in super smash bros (yes I know weird comparison, but english ain't my first language, so it's sometime easier to make weird comparison to get people to understand my point).

The bad:

Punishing vs challenging: This game is not hard, it is punishing. So much of this game, due to the save mechanic or other system like to punish the player for his lack of skill or knowledge. Meanwhile, nothing actually feel rewarding, as it beeing not challenging, I actually don't feel proud when I overcome anything. It's bad when I lose and Meh when I win, instead of meh when you lose and GREAT when you win.  This made me quickly stop caring about much and I tried to explore as little of the world as I could, and still ended up finding a lot, as I simply didn't care, nothing felt rewarding enough for me to spend the time to get it and risk the chance of getting punished by losing.

SLOW: So much of this game is slow, this feels like a 3:30 or 4h game stretched to 5h, that feels like 10 hours. For example, every door that you open has an opening animation, that is slow, and sometime you can run through it, sometime not, (I think it depends on your side of the door related to the position of the two door parts). Other example,  A lot of time, you need to push some wooden bar down by acting as a hammer on it, well it doesn't take one hit to do it, but always multiple: WHY, the result is the same, it's not more challenging to do it thrice rather than once, it's just more time consumming. I know these sounds like nitpicks, because they are, but There are just so many nitpicks that can be done, they add  up to an entire game philosophy that this game has, SLOW THE PLAYER. I am not a fan of that.

Movement: LOVE THE BASH, genuinely one of the best mechanic I have seen in any plateformer ever. The dash, Idk, I unlocked it, very early on, but it never worked. I might have missed something. Every thing else feels either fine or clunky. And that is not a good thing when so much of this game require precise imput, and I am always unsure if my character will actually do what I am asking him to do,

Combat:  X to attack. You can also bash enemy projectile. INSANE!!! 

Story: It is definelty one of the story that have ever existed.

Overall what I thought of Ori and the blind forest was that it is a great thing that suffer from beeing a video game, as it actually ask of me to play it. I'd recommend just watching a playthrough of it on Youtube or just listening to the soundtrack. If you plan on actually playing it, I recommend playing it till after the first dungeon where you get the bash ability, as this thing is great, don't stop playing before that, I know I almost did. 

I recommend this game because I can see some people liking it, and I rarely not recommend game, This is my 41 review I believe, with only two thumbs down, and for a game to receive a thumbs down frome me, it either needs to be an experience that legitemetly hurt me, or a game that offer nothing that I can see of value: This game is neither. 

This game has some positive, negatives, evaluate both and know that we all have different opinion and has preferences are subjectives. no opinion is better than any other. I genuinely overall disliked my time with this game, but you might like it, 7 Canadian dollars isn't a lot.



Now as a small Tangent, imma rant for one small thing about story in general that applies to this game (SPOILLER SPOILLER): I fuking hate when they make past events irrelevant just to make sure that every one gets a happy ending. If somoene dies, let them be dead, otherwise, their death isn't meaningful in the first place, and now their life is meaningless as it should've ended. Let us have bad events happened so the character can evolve through their trauma and grow as individual. Rant Over.",1665882361,1665882361,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Ori and the world they inhabit resonate with a quiet innocence, starkly contrasted to the dangerous, predatory tension posed by the corrupted creatures that threaten them.

The story is told without many words, relying on body language and music to convey intense emotion, which is does effectively from the very start of the game to the very end. In between each step in the story, you are given a lush natural world to explore.

Controlling Ori is a delight, with movement being highly animated, quick and fluid as you dodge and weave through your environment. While each power adds to this, nothing changes the game as much as the Bash ability, which allows you to grab an enemy or projective in midair, and leapfrog away from them. This ability, which you get about halfway through the game, takes a great platformer and transforms it into something unique.

Speaking of unique, the way this game handles boss ‘battles’ is one of my favorite aspects of it. Instead of fights, the game features elaborate chase scenes, emphasizing the feeling that you are a small point of light in a world filled with big creatures of darkness. You have to use your speed and your wits to survive, rather than brute force.

Ori is a great game. If you’re a fan of metroidvanias, this is one of my top recommendations. It isn’t the longest or the most challenging, but that’s not what it is trying to be.

Navigating the map was nothing but a tedious burden, the jumping was irritating, the acquisition of abilities was uneventful, there was a stupidly unnecessary amount of spikes, there's no blocking or dodging; it's just moving and mashing attack, there's an overabundance of inaccessible areas from the get-go; I defer you to my aforementioned complaint of backtracking, there's virtually no guidance, and you must use up energy, a necessary and integral resource, just to save the game.

Pros:
- great animated visual, unmatched
- beautiful story, had tears in eyes in the beginning and in the end
- creative and sometimes VERY difficult platforming (both techincally and logically)
- cool metroidvania mechanics. The movement and combat are simple with all the items, yet challenging
- level design. Some levels, like the final Mount Horu, are so punishing that your every neuron will be focusing very hard to not slip up in many of the sections, where you dont have a break for at least a minute. The platforming here is like boss fights in soulslike games, you cant make almost any mistakes and when you do it at 20th time, you end up with a massive heartbeat

Cons:
- the game doesnt weigh on exploration as much as Hollow Knight, it has quest markers and although you have to find the path yourself, its not difficult
- pretty short
- some obstacle design is not clear, some barriers you can destroy by yourself, for some you have to stomp a nearby lever, for some something else and they all look similar

good story, told well, very effective at the heart string tugs. fluid responsive controls, and easy ""bite-sized"" play sessions if you want. only 1 or 2 frustrating points, but its always your skill, not the game.

With the talk around the water cooler being that the sequel is even better, I can't wait to pick it up.

As a platformer, this had everything I'd want. A simple beginning with logical progression of skills, and enough challenge to be difficult without being busted.

One of the best aspects of this game is that gaining new skills really makes you want to backtrack to earlier levels to pick up that extra health or ability boost.

The art, amazing. Given how much new games push hardware, having something like this, 2.5D, that runs like a dream but feels like a million bucks, is a rare gem in the 21st century gaming industry.

Having just come off a disappointing platformer/action game, I was a little wary of getting into Ori, but a slightly slow start more than made up for it with the just amazing amount of love and care the developers put into this game.

Here are my gripes with the game despite it being great:
1. Ori is too tiny and hard to keep track of sometimes
2. Every god damn enemy and bullet in the game is a glowing orb and it's incredibly hard to tell which glowing orb is which, the one floating beside ori the whole game, your glowing orb bullets, your glowing orb grenades, your glowing orb charge particles, the enemies glowing attack needles, the enemy itself, the enemy's counterable projectile, the enemy's uncounterable projectile, you get the picture. A little more variation and clarity would do the game a lot of good. They try to make it clearer by enemy bullets being a different color, but they all blend together on top of ori in the moment and it's impossible to tell which is which.
3. Needs some bosses. I felt the game could have used a couple of those to really flesh it out. Escape sequences are the ""boss battles"" of the game, and that's fine, but a couple of actual boss fights would have probably provided a bit of lasting appeal.
4. Enemy variety is pretty lacking. I was getting really tired of blobs designed to have just enough HP to not die before they hit you a couple of times by the end of the game.
5. Don't make speedrun, no damage, no-death, ""don't use any of the skills in the game"" achievements. Those should always remain self-imposed challenges because this game isn't worth playing for hundreds of hours to become good enough to do that for 99% of players.",1664593901,1664593901,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Visually, this game is incredible. Story-wise, it is incredible. In fact, I may have actually shed many tears had I actually enjoyed playing this game.

 The major reason: chase sequences. Granted, I am not very good at video games. I will fully admit that. I enjoy a challenge though and the first chase sequence was great for that. However, after the second chase sequence I was SO DONE with the chase sequences. By the final one I was so frustrated I was slamming my hands down on my keyboard. Maybe I'm just too used to playing Hollow Knight, but the controls for this game are not nearly tight enough to warrant FOUR chase sequences. 

While playing this game I often found myself comparing it to Hollow Knight. Hollow Knight is a difficult game, and there were many moments I found myself feeling frustrated at that game, but I always felt it was because of my own mistakes. In this game, many of my failures were because the game was screwing me over, like the spitter dudes not spitting fast enough or projectiles at the wrong angle during a chase sequence. 

After this I don't even know if I'll play the second one... but I guess I'll be scouring the reviews to see if the controls are a little better and there are very few chase sequences.

The first bad place is before you get double jumb and bash, when we have really annoying wall jumping with no room for error (you can tell on achievements 80-90% of players get this far, only 50% gets to the achievements from double jump and bash). The issue is partially with the controls, especially jump controls. The game only recognizes the 8 directions even with an controller, has no simulation of momentum, and treats ""jump up"" as a failed jump. So the way to jump most up is to be equally to the left of right as you are below the point and then jump a 45deg jump. This makes for very limited correct off points, and is super non-intuitive.

Second problem is the escape sequences, which can rot in hell. Too linear, too long endless parts that needs to be done perfectly. Again part of the problem is the design, it is designed so you can not get ahead, the sequence do not allow you extra time if you do an earlier part faster. So if you end up being caught the natural thing for most gamers is to try to move faster, which is WRONG, because it gives you nothing, the correct thing is to take it slow, and do EVERY SINGLE jump and manuever perfectly, because that is how the game rolls. This is unintuitive and stupid, but that is how the game is designed.",1663795168,1663847266,False,1,0,0.497287511825561523,0,True,False,False

If I had to give it a grade, 4.5/5
I'll start with the bad - combat is very mid. It boils down to spamming descending dar- ahem, stomp, on everything when you get it, managing i-frames from Bash and sometimes mashing X. Your movement abilities can be repurposed for killing mobs and experimenting with them is quite fun, but ultimately you don't **have** to do anything other than Bash and spam X.
You can also forget about mastering this game if you value your sanity. Both chase scenes and overworld include a large amount of instakill segments, and I dread to think how long it takes to get a deathless run.

Now for the good - everything else is amazing, really. Art direction is strong and well executed, background art can easily be taken out for wallpapers. Level design is great and segments are memorable, you can get around without a map easy after a few hours. Core gameplay loop - movement, is impeccable. Chase scenes, while somewhat easy to die in (falling rocks are a good mechanic😊), are still fun and not that hard.",1663806297,1663806297,True,2,0,0.519841313362121582,0,True,False,False

First of all, the grafic and the soundtrack are amazing, I would even say exactly like Hollow Knight: Nice, colorful and working on lower PCs too, i had no problem with lag.

But the jump and run parts, I really don´t get why people like it. It´s basicly an open world where you follow the story to gain abilitys to acselss new areas that you saw before but couldn´t reach. And in my opinion those aren´t really exiting. You move a rock there or you wall jump up there with one obstacle shooting at you. 
What was also really annoying: You have a meter, basicly mana that slowly recharges and guess what? It´s there to make respawn- and upgrade spots or to use your super ability that you need to breakt through that one wall and now you either look for the nearest way to refill it or you wait.

And one, nah 2 achievements are to finish the game without dying, basicly 2 times the same thing. And that would not be the end of the world, if it wasn´t for all the potential insta death spots. This one is really just me but i find it really not good desinged to do such a challenge with enemys and traps oneshotting you and spike pits that you take so fast damage in and that you can´t seem to escape because of no wall to get to... no thanks, there are better challenges out there.

This game, man. 

I like platforming games and this is all what you want.
It's like metroidvania and a little souls like, and platforming in one game with an excellent story as cherry on the pie .

I love the incredible visuals, the amazing sound design, and the soundtrack is beautiful.
The map design is perfectly crafted, the enemy placement is challenging and the puzzles are done well. This game gives you so much different styles of gameplay!
but careful, this game will beat the fu*k out of you and fun fact I actually did refund this game because of it's difficulty but I came back to it 2 days later and I'm glad I decided to buy it again.
but however I find it very cruel to let the player do something all the way from the beginning, there's clearly no fun in that. For example this owl chase is very hard and should let to be saved in at least some checkpoints.
but anyway I felt so intrigued with the story! I felt invested in everything

Ori's movement and platforming is pretty basic, but has a lot of comboing moves together to keep things fast and energetic. The part I find confusing is the Metroidvania part.

The controls/keybinds are absolutely HORRIBLE.  if you do play this game, DO NOT play with a mouse and keyboard.  This game isn't made for it.  

It does have a few ""static"" options for the keybinds but.....whoever came up with them, clearly doesn't play games.  i mean, for cryin out loud, ""M"" is the standard ""map"" button, but this game?  Nope.  it's Tab.  and the extra movement buttons are in awkward places and having to juggle the awkward keboard buttons with the mouse is just....frustrating.  And the keybinds aren't customize-able, which doesn't help things.

So, if you play, use a controller.

I really wanted this game to be ""fun to play"", but it's turned into ""oh, mama didn't raise a quitter!  i'm gonna finish this freakin nightmare...""

The character movement is mushier than Ori’s feelgood story, and the game itself is just prettier to look at than it is fun to play. What made me realize that I don’t like this game at all is how ambiguously vague the map is. I’ll summarize.

I began to retrace my explorations attempting to gain entry into previously inaccessible zones after accumulating better abilities. However, the map doesn’t have an indicator for some natural or fortified obstructions. The areas behind these obstructions are just grayed out, as if I didn’t bother to venture that way when I first discovered the area. There’s also no differentiation between some obstructions that require a specific skill or interaction. All I see on the map is a wall that can be broken. In either scenario, I find myself wasting massive amounts of time defeating the same enemies over and over as I navigate my way to something that isn’t even viable to my progression. There’s no way to quick travel either. I lost patience trying to reach something on the other side of the map, (and sometimes dying multiple times in my attempts) only to discover that I arrived there for nothing. So what do I do? I’ve played this out more times than I can stand to and still have fun, so I’m going to uninstall it.

I bought the sequel too, thinking this would be a fun story to play through. This game has killed my interest in that altogether.",1662841661,1662841661,False,0,0,0.473729550838470459,0,True,False,False

If this was one of the first action-adventure platformers I ever played, maybe I would have liked it more. 

The thing I dislike the most about it is probably the visuals. The extreme amount of brightness and bloom everywhere feels hurtful to look at the screen sometimes, while the fact that everything is extremely detailed made it rather hard to acknowledge which things would actually damage me - which felt a bit frustrating more than once.

The story is pretty cute though and the bash mechanic is amazing, slinging around with it was a lot of fun.

Hollow Knight offers a world to get lost in, and super clean combat. But it's also a bit more ""dry"".

This game is so good I actually GASPED multiple times while playing it, because of the unexpected attacks or the story. And that says a lot about how the game draws you in cause I am usually really quiet when I play, unless it's a competitive multiplayer game. This game really brings out your feelings. You're going to have gasps of surprise and cursing when you can't clear an area for the 30th time.

If you don't usually play platformers, I recommend you to go with the normal or even easy difficulty if you just want to enjoy the story and relax. Playing on normal, you can't really relax that much. You have to be aware of your surroundings.

The platforming formula is nothing new to the gaming industry, but Ori and the Blind Forest stands out from the crowd thanks to it's gorgeous visuals and atmospheric music.  Ori controls smoothly and intuitively, and as you gain new abilities and achieve objectives, more of the labyrinth-like forest becomes accessible to you.  Secrets abound, but not so much that it's tedious to uncover them all, and a healthy challenge on Normal difficulty.  The adventure is short and the story simple, yet it is told in a manner that doesn't impede gameplay nor require walls of dialogue.  

I absolutely love this game. I fell in love with it by the time the prologue concluded and found its story to be mesmerizing despite its relative simplicity.  There's enough of an enigma to be intriguing and has left me excited to set forth into the sequel.

If you have any interest in platformer adventure games, please give this one a try. Ori and the Blind Forest may be an older game, but it's a fantastic game and well worth the few hours it takes to play through it.",1661719686,1661719686,True,9,0,0.601226985454559326,0,True,False,False

I's meant to make you kill all the time. When I jump from one platform to another, Ori doesn't stop, but falls of the other side. When I jump up the wall and want to jump backward to reach another wall, most of the time I fall down.

This doesn't cause me joy, it makes me irritated insted. You should build some stickiness insto jumping. I don't care if you call it super easy or something similar, but even easy mode is extremely irritatingly hard this way.

Edit: after a couple of year I started again, and I am still as much frustrated by this game as in the beginning. Easy is not easy at all. I'm stuck at the Ginso tree and can't escape it. I've tried it a thousand times. On my Steam Deck, the game is unplayabla, bash is stuck and you can't aim it. On my PC with a controler it works, but I still can't beat it, the game is simply too fast for me and I can't even save halfway (I'm at the top).",1514895251,1661712013,False,3,1,0.415293782949447632,0,True,False,False

[h1]Presentation (10/10)[/h1]
I was slightly put off by animation at first. Main character looks weird in closeups. Few animations in cutscenes looked awkward, like they were paper figure (or flash game) animations. I only noticed it a couple of times, so I can't really say the entire thing was bad.

Gameplay flow (physics and animations) are feel very fluid and natural.

I rarely noticed music, which is exactly how music should be in similar games. It's an amazing background tune, which creates atmosphere without drawing attention onto itself.

[h1]Gameplay (8//10)[/h1]
The moment gameplay started I forgot about few bad animations. Mobility is very fluid and fun on it's own.
Gameplay ramps up. You start out with just movement and basic jump and early experience is not great, but once you get some mobility skills the game flow improves considerably.

While on that point, most of this game is focused on mobility and most of the skills you gain are mobility skills. It might sound like boring progression, but it's among most unique ones I've seen in similar games. Don't get me wrong, this game doesn't invent anything new, but it focuses on mobility and gives more options than most games. That makes tackling exploration puzzles more fun. Especially if you find a non-intended solution.

The game allows you to place your own checkpoints, which is a lovely feature considering the game isn't always easy.

I have 2 reasons to deduct a few points: 
[list]
[*] Slow start. 
[*] Few long platforming sections where you cannot stop, cannot place checkpoints and you only beat them by memorizing it. I wouldn't complain about it in another game, but when your entire game is slow, deliberate and has free checkpoints these few hectic sections that flip the game on its head. It felt out of place.
[/list]

[h1]Exploration(8/10)[/h1]
Exploration is great, but value of rewards diminishes over time.
Puzzles are fun and unique among themselves. This game's puzzles are environmental. You sometimes don't know you're in one, until you're half-done.

Exploration rewards diminish.
[list]
[*]Skill points are always rewarding, as they buy you more/different mobility and combat power (among some utility things).
[*] XP (fraction of a skillpoint) is too little to matter. You already need 3 skillpoints to buy 1 skill later in game. XP orbs tend to give you something like 10-30% of 1 level.
[*] Health upgrades are good when you start out, but feel unnecessary when you have enough to absorb to survive 2 hits. Also, if you play on hard difficulty, you need 4 of these to survive 1 hit, to so 3/4 health upgrades don't change anything.
[*] Energy capacity upgrades are VERY useful early on as energy is used for creating save points(healing) and using energy abilities. I think I was sitting comfortably at 6, while maximum is 15.

It really is the complete package of a great sidescrolling adventure, but for me the thing that makes it stand out, is that it is so very beautiful in every sense of the word. The visuals are dominated by rich colours and even though you get across darker areas and alot of things that want to harm you, you always have a somewhat cozy feeling. But not only the visuals are beautiful, the story is aswell. This game will break your heart within the first ten minutes and will continue to tell a story in a very simplistic, but very effective way, that has you engaged in it from start to finish. Last but not least I have to mention the incredible music. It matches the game perfectly and is also extremely beautiful, which is kind of the theme for this game. 

Pros:
+ incredibly beautiful visuals
+ fluent and fun gameplay
+ exceedingly beautiful music
+ engaging and beautiful story, that will pull at your heartstrings

Cons:
- none really (For me it was sometimes a bit frustrating, but that is because I am really bad at these kind of games.)

[b]Tl;dr:[/b] Like a wholesome picture book you read as a kid in game form. Great for casual play if you have a spare hour or two. Play with controller (not Steam one) and get some decent headphones for the music. Check system specs but if you have a decent GPU you should be good without question.

[h1]Art:[/h1]
Beautiful. The art team and developers took their time creating the atmoshere for all characters and the environment and it definitely shows. The varying biomes , all each uniquely different make the Blind Forest feel organic, yet inhabited. 

[h1]Gameplay/Perfomance:[/h1]
Most abilities and skills feel earned (i.e the more you play and explore the world outside of key story beat the easier the game will be). Played majority of the game on normal difficulty and it was a breeze. By end-game I had a stacked Lifeforce and Spirit Points I felt like I was cheesing the enemies half the time. If you are competent at muscle memory and the platforming genre you will barely struggle. The only things I had a frustrating time with were the scripted sequences at the end of 'purifying' an area. REALLY unforgiving making you start from beginning if you slip up once although I guess that's part of the challenge. The only other thing lacking I can think of was no major bosses to fight against? You have the Owl but that is solely evasion in the scripted segments. Enemy types only go so far when you have a few per area + reskins. If you tried hard enough you could likely sequence break some things requiring abilities later if you know the ins and outs of mechanics. 


No noticeable stutter issues or major game-breaking bugs. One thing I found is I couldn't get a resolution of 1080 x 1920p, (a definitive edition version?!) which was annoying but I dealt with it. Still could get aspect ratio to 16:9 but couldn't go further than some obscure resolution. I don't know if this was because my monitor was unsupported or what... And for the love of God if you are planning to play on a Steam controller please don't. The more PC titles I play on Steam, the more I realise the functional and technical limitations the thing has. Just don't.

[h1]Story:[/h1]
It's serviceable. A 10 year old could probably understand the core themes of the story but that doesn't mean it's all bad. The dialogue isn't spoken in any coherent language and there are text bubbles to coincide. Likely because the game is set in a world not shared by humans but it also gives international accessibility via translation. A short and linear experience which is nothing to complain about for a metroid-vania platformer. I guess there is one query I had with the Spirit Tree being that it is not clearly understood why its actions were carried out as it is implied it has sentience. Ori is an innocent child who spreads love across all of the characters they meet. The score and art make up for what the story doesn't say or quite deliver well enough.

From the iconic soundtrack to the stunning visuals, from the fluid movement to the heartwarming story, I'm utterly blown away every time I take this journey through the forest of Nibel. Where do I even start?

The soundtrack features plenty of memorable pieces that seamlessly blend together, giving the impression of a single song that builds to a climax with each objective you complete. The title theme, in particular, gets reused and remixed throughout the game to convey a variety of emotions, like sorrow, danger, or tranquility. And the visuals are just as impressive, with parallax environments and level designs that really bring the world to life. It's a feast for the eyes as well as the ears.

The movement controls are tight and fluid, which is critical, considering the game has its fair share of difficult platforming sections. Falling victim to the same spike pit a dozen times may not be fun, but what makes up for it is how each major dungeon caps off with an awesome and intense escape sequence that would make the [i]Metroid[/i] series proud. Not to mention using the bash technique to dance your way through a room of enemies and projectiles like a leaf on the wind.

But what really brings this game together is an inspiring story about embracing hope instead of despair, about love overcoming hate. Top it off with an ending that makes me sob every time, and you have a masterpiece.

The music and visuals are superb and I have nothing but praise for both.  Between traversing through the forest and backtracking to explore areas that I couldnt access before, I was hooked. In the end I 100% explored everything for fun so I could spend a little more time in this world.

 The control of Ori's movement and attacks felt exactly on point and if I was failing something, it was because I was doing it poorly. Also the theres an ability to save almost anywhere (but semi limited early on) which is an amazing way to make you not fear making a couple of mistakes on some platforming sections. 

There's only a few things I could critique in the entire game which is a testament to how well designed Ori and the Blind forest is. Notably I think would be the couple of times the difficulty spiked immensely to the point where deaths felt cheap. [spoiler]Specifically the water escape area after the first? boss. [/spoiler] However I am not always the best gamer so Im sure many people had no problems. You could also always lower the difficulty like I could on the fly for that one section. Make no mistake this is a hard game even on lower difficulties and you will die, but the repercussions for doing so are usually tiny. God speed if you try to do the achievement for a deathless run, youre a braver person than I am.

Also If I could suggest another change it would be to highlight the map a tiny bit better to see the sections that you hadnt explored. Some areas were pretty dark so it was difficult finding the last 2% or so of a section. It wasnt the end of the world though and there are many threads of people suggesting the most commonly missed areas. Maybe a hint system guiding you places to you missed? 

In the end I cant give high enough praise for this game and I look forward to the sequel when I have the itch for another platformer. 10/10 for me

The platforming, level design, enemy, combat, and all is really well design and will make the gear in your head turn. The soundtrack gonna give you goosebumps, I'm telling you. Now the control is not the best for me, since I'm using keyboard and mouse.

It is, without a doubt the most beautifully rendered game I've ever played. (maybe until I start Will of the Wisps when I'm done posting this review?)
For the actual game play: 
The controls were pretty smooth, though I did find some of the ability upgrades confusing as to what they did. in the ability tree it listed the prerequisite to learn it,(always just the previous node on the tree) but not the prerequisite to use it. So some abilities I'd learn and only realize later they were upgrades for skills I had not acquired yet. 
It was cute how they occasionally used achievements to help tell the story. When ""Run for Your Life"" popped up I was like ""huh, weird. what does that have to do with what I just..."" then I immediately understood that it was instructions.  
Overall it was challenging without feeling arbitrary. There were a few deaths that were a surprise, but when I died, I was always able to tell why even if sometimes I had to die a few times to fully understand how to avoid it. 
The story was simple while still being able to engage the player and evoke an emotional response. I'm not going to lie, the first time I got to the end, I had to fight back tears when the credits started rolling.

The pics and video they promote show a few select scenes with more dimension in the foreground/background, but a lot of the game isn't so well done as those parts.

The raving reviews for the story are seriously over promoted. The story is thin and lacking substance. It could be worse, but's no excuse for not making it better. Worse, a lot of it is nonsensical gibberish.

Perhaps the worst part of all is the difficulty. Sure, I understand. It's a jumping side-scroller, There wouldn't be much to it if there wasn't something to the difficulty. But when I chose the easiest difficulty so I can focus on the story, only to get so frustrated trying to make it through overly difficult jumping puzzles that I have to replay dozens of time to perfect so I can progress... well, it became all about the difficulty and none of the very thin story. I just quit, not finishing the game less than halfway through.

Overall, it's not a bad game. I cannot thumbs down it cuz those looking for what it advertises to be will get what they want. I guess I just expected something more. Ultimately I got bored and aggravated perfecting difficult jumping puzzles and forgetting where the 2 seconds of story was between the hours of jumping annoyance. And this, coming from someone who loves playing MMO's for mere exploration and jumping around to see if I can get somewhere I'm not supposed to be.

Story: 3.5/10
Graphics: 9/10
Music/sound: 9.5/10
Atmosphere: 8/10
Interest: 6/10

The platforming is phenomenal. after about the first hour or so you really grasp how Ori moves, and the game does an excellent job setting up sequences for you to learn your abilities once you get them. 

Combat is.... well... its platformer combat. you can click to attack, or use some abilities to deal damage, however even if you focus on the combat tree, its just not very enjoyable. fortunately the game seems to know this, and you can just avoid most combat, although you shouldn't leveling up is extremely important in this game. and the main way to get xp is combat.

Now, my main stink about the game. it is so fucking hard sometimes, my god. ESPECIALLY the last portion of the game, almost EVERYTHING in the last escape section is an instant kill, too slow? instakill, too fast? instakill, wrong place? killed, wrong time? killed, just right?..... well.... fuck you anyway, here's a meteor you couldn't predict :)

It killed my entire enjoyment of the final section, and kind of ruined the ending, since I was pissed and celebrating so much, I could hardly care about the end, which, is a real shame, because the end of this game hits just as hard as the intro, but I couldn't give a shit because of how hard the last section was.

I'm sure I'll try Will of the Wisps, but I've heard its even harder and less forgiving, so, it'll be a year or two

So why am I giving it the boo? Mostly for the platforming. The ideas are great, but with floaty controls, slippery footwork, the worst implementation of wall jumps I've ever seen, it's just so incredibly frustrating. If you're expecting responsive controls that do what you tell them to, you won't find that here.
Secondly, in the effort to make this game look like a piece of artwork it can be quite hard to see what is going on with all the overused particles and shaders. I was taking damage and having no idea what from, until I realized it was a tiny particle flying through the air.

I wish there was a neutral rating. I don't like ""not recommending"" this game, because quite frankly, it's more than earned its incredibly affordable price tag, but it's also hard recommending a game that made me want to rip my hair out and put my head through a wall because of floaty controls and dying to things I can't see,

Imagine buying a beautiful piece of artwork to hang on your wall, but someone defaced it by scribbling a moustache on the woman in the painting, so you couldn't enjoy it as much as you hoped. That's how Ori and the Blind Forest feels to me.
There's a real gem here, but it's sabotaged by unfair design choices.

So, here's the problem. The artwork and music score are flawless. This game is beautiful from one end to the other. Mind you, I'm colorblind and had a hell of a time making out some of the scenery to the point where I repeatedly found myself running face-first into lava; but that's a ""me"" problem.

To begin actually ripping this game apart, we first need to talk about narrative flow. That first 15 minutes is gut wrenching. Had my tear ducts not been sealed shut from years of misuse, I'd have shed a tear or two in the same manner I did during the opening for Up. The problem is that the somber feeling gets absolutely obliterated between the dodgy level design that places enemies in very obtuse places and instant death on every wall toward the end of the game. That coupled with the lackluster ending that cheapens the opening sequence leaves my palate dry with rage. When the stakes are thrown out the window to supplant a quick narrative finish, it feels rather meaningless.

Now, I want to not recommend this game for that, but for some reason I actually enjoyed the experience when I wasn't screaming at my computer screen like the amateur video game enthusiast I happen to be. For some reason, pretty set design and fantastic music are overriding my desire to chuck this game into my forbidden games folder next to the Borderlands series.

The controls feel...slow?  Not unresponsive, but it feels like it takes forever to change Ori's direction.  I find myself getting frustrated that Ori is not moving fast enough to dodge any projectiles.  You might be thinking that I just suck at this kind of game, but I have beaten Hollow Knight and I loved every minute of it.  Perhaps the responsiveness of Hollow Knight makes this game feel slow to me.

The game also uses lots of colors that I have a hard time seeing due to my protanopia (a type of colorblindness) and I have yet to find a colorblind mode.  Without, I am having an extremely hard time seeing certain enemy projectiles and often get hit before I even know where the projectile is.

On top of that, I am stuck in an early part of the game, and have not even the slighest of ideas as to what to do.  I have gone everywhere I am capable of going (at least I think so) but I can not seem to progress at all.  I'm not sure what everything on the map means because none of it was explained, and I am not even really sure which direction on the map I am supposed to be headed.  I am at a loss as to what I am supposed to be doing.  I'm probably going to play an hour or two more just to check everywhere, but if I don't find anything or anywhere to go, I doubt I will pick the game up again.

Again, I want to like this game, but I just have been getting frustrated with it at every turn.  Given my experience, I cannot recommend this game, which I think is unfortunate given the massive amount of positive reviews this game has gotten.  Am I just missing something?

[h1] ---{ Detailed Comment Notes }--- [/h1]

The soundtrack and even the graphics are great in this game my fav area has to be the Thornfelt Swamp its so peaceful that for an hour i just sat near the waterfall taking in the soundtrack and the lovely work the devs put into it so amazing game this game can be intensive but once you cleared an area of its story progress these dreadful area become calm lovely areas kinda makes me wanna go out and plant some tress and well get some wildlife going.

This game has some annoying checkpoints tho, this definitive edition did go about addressing the poor checkpoints from the original build but even tho they changed them for this version of the game, it still has quite few bad placements causing the game to be quite hard still even with the improvements added to the definitive edition. (mostly at the chase moments the most)

the combat is quite lacking all you mostly do is press (mash) the attack button and you'll be 86% fine most encounters. I even found out if i upgrade my range i really could just hang on to the edge and just mash the attack button so overall at points on the map you can have no conflict with enemies just hit them from the edge from a far, where is the fun in that totally poor combat.

Despite these few bad marks it really is still a game worth go. Just don't expect the combat to be the main focus cause everything else even the platforming is top notch in this game also one last thing play on easy for your first run if you beat the game and wanna make it harder then so it be and increase it but, trust me start on easy.

Movement feels really good and the game makes good use of its mechanics both with its platforming challenges and integration of movement into its combat. Navigation and exploration are generally good and their weaker aspects are compensated for by a beautiful aesthetic design.

Where the game stutters is in taking those excellent fundamentals and translating them into consistently engaging gameplay. Everything up to [spoiler]the Ginzo Tree[/spoiler] was excellent and the [spoiler]escape sequence[/spoiler] there is a masterpiece, but a lot of the content beyond that point was a lot more mixed in quality. Some sections were still great and managed to keep me engaged without issue. But these were overshadowed by the flaws. [spoiler]Sorrow Pass[/spoiler] was probably the worst offender here, relying on [spoiler]wind and gliding[/spoiler] mechanics that were neither interesting nor enjoyable to use. [spoiler]Kuro's Feather[/spoiler] is honestly a net-negative on the game as a whole as it not only works poorly but also makes other platforming sections difficult since it uses the same key bindings as grabbing and climbing which caused frequent issues during my playthrough. [spoiler]Forlorn Ruins[/spoiler] are slow to get through and the [spoiler]gravity[/spoiler] mechanic they introduce is both confusing to learn and never develops in an interesting way. [spoiler]Mount Horu[/spoiler] was generally good, but the [spoiler]escape sequence[/spoiler] at the end was a disappointing conclusion to the game, suffering from unclear visual indicators, unpredictable obstacles that required multiple deaths to learn the pattern for, and (while a lot more subjective) felt jarring to complete as it felt really abrupt for the game to end right after the sequence finished.

I think Ori has the fundamentals of a masterpiece, but its currently lacking in execution. I haven't played Will of Wisps yet so I'm very excited to see how it developed on the great foundation this game provided because there really is some amazing stuff here that just needed the right world and enemy design to help make it shine.

1) The difficulty-spiking chase scenes at the end of each dungeon are less thrilling than frustrating.

2) The backtracking to reuse your new abilities to loot the map doesn't feel as good as it should. The map spells things out for you too easily, and the world is a chore to navigate. When I unlocked the last ability, the map told me exactly where to go and I knew what to do, but it just wasn't worth my time.

pros: 
- the most visually stunning game i have ever played
- the music is hanz zimmer level genius. Gareth Coker you are a madman i love you
- gameplay is quick, fluid and rewarding
- map design is trucking incredible, each area feels unique in music and design and new gameplay opportunities
- doesn't feel awful to backtrack because ori is so quick and movement is so fun

meh: 
- attacks feel somewhat weak most of the game, even if you upgrade it

cons: 
- the game is so pretty it's kind of hard to tell where you are or what are attacks sometimes, i tried to jump on a few decorations pieces because everything is so gorgeous
- escape sequences are a tad frustrating because you get insta-killed and have to restart the whole thing, it kinda slaughtered the tension for me but i get the gameplay intention. takes a few tries to get down, which I imagine is the goal, so don't expect to get it on your first try, that was my mistake

I'd still say it's not a bad game though, it's relatively short so none of these issues become too much of an annoyance over time thankfully, however I feel like this would be the case if this game was a bit longer which isn't a plus.

I did not expect it to be a cake walk but this game has such infuriating design with how platform puzzles are presented. The whole time I thought ""once i get a double jump it will be fine"" but as I kept playing I noticed how floaty the controls were. So the double jump didnt help, in fact they presented new puzzles that were astoundingly frustrating. I just got done playing most of Hollow Knight and Blasphemous and *never* did I encounter this kind of frustration. 

Not to mention, combat is horrid. You just mash X until the enemy dies all the while dodging projectiles. Its just really boring. Theres no choreography with fights or anything, just mash X and win hopefully. Oh and don't even think about putting it on hard, you may as well not have a health bar. Spent most my hour and a half with one health. Even if i turned down the difficulty, I KNOW that the levels won't magically change.

The abilites you unlock are all really cool and get pretty good usage throughout the game as well...
That's the end of the good stuff unfortunately
The level design is often terrible
Very few memorable set pieces, instant death traps everywhere making it so you're always on edge and have to save every two seconds. It makes exploring the world less fun, plus the exploration itself is very limiting, the world is fairly big, but the linearity makes it feel so small. The game is hard but it only is that way because it has cheap tricks that make it hard, very few of my deaths felt fair. The only parts where this trial and error design worked were the escape sequences which are easily the best part of the game, although even those falter in quality a bit after the first one. The story wasn't anything special and honestly very dull. The combat is also incredibly lackluster, at the start it is literally just spam X, the bash move does help things a bit later down the line, but the very few enemy types makes it feel so repetitive and boring, and the complete lack of boss fights makes the combat feel even more worthless.
Overall
Ori is a beautiful looking game with so many cool ideas and abilities, but fails to execute those cool things in a good way leaving a game that greatly disappointed me. One of the most lackluster Metroidvania's I've ever played.
Its not terrible

2D is the new 3D after playing this beautiful Metroid-like platformer.  You play as some abstract animal going through a beautifully drawn world trying to save their home from a hostile force.  A somewhat generic plot yes, but its saved wonderfully by the hand drawn graphics, composed soundtrack, and lovable characters. As you advance through the game, you pick up additional abilities that help you get through more areas of the game (it's a somewhat open world in the sense that you can kind of go everywhere from the start of the game but you'll be held back severely without gaining some of those required abilities). The combination of the sound and music and environment evoke emotion which if you think about it, is what any game should do. With a sadness in my heart upon completion, I can only hope that I can relive such an emotional experience again in the sequel or future games.

You control a little spirit cat rabbit thing and it feels amazing. The controls are tight and anytime I missed a jump or messed up on a challenging platforming section I knew it was my fault not because of bad controls. The hidden areas holding power-ups and shmechles are not unrealistic to find especially if you're used to metrovanias. I played Hollow Knight before this and if you like this game you will like this game. If you want to know the negative here it is. The combat is nowhere near what hollow knight is. The combat is an afterthought and the enemies are nothing but annoying obsticals, not something I have fun running around killing for their shmechles. It looks like they addressed that in the sequel.

Review by Unam 

Unless you live under a rock, you've probably heard about this game, or its sequel (Ori and the Will of the Wisps), and as you've probably guessed, it's good. For anyone who enjoys Metoridvanias or combat then this is a no-brainer, but if you are on the fence, then keep reading.

Easily, the best aspect of the game is the visuals. There is no debate that this game is a masterpiece (visually) and it utilizes the 2D environments to create a unique and populated world. It is insane how polished this is. Another aspect I really enjoyed was the platforming / the abilities given to the player. These two go hand in hand since you are required to use the abilities that you get along your journey to traverse new areas or unlock secret areas. The boss fights or trials are a real highlight of the game, as they are incredibly entertaining, and offer an incredibly tough but fair challenge that will truly test your platforming skill in times of extreme pressure (from a game-play perspective, these are easily the best parts). The music is so majestic and atmosphere, it sucks you right in and combined with the visuals make the game feel alive. 
Ori is such an adorable protagonist and watching her grow as a character is very compelling. From the very beginning of the story, we see her as a very fragile being, this is especially seen in the first third of the game, where she has a very small HP and can't move as much. But as the player progresses through the game, Ori grows to become an adorable, and aware protagonist. It is impressive how they can create such a dynamic and round character with almost no dialogue. I commend the developers for the amount of work and time that they had to sacrifice to create such a majestic and rich world with an entertaining protagonist, Kudos to them.

However, there are some major flaws that hold it back from being a masterclass of Metroidvanias. Firstly, the combat is very (very) bad. The orb thing that hovers around you at all times and is your main attack method is very badly designed. You have to sit around spamming your attack button to kill everything, it gets tedious after 3 seconds. The enemy designs are also a huge letdown, compared to its sequel, these enemies feel one-note and very uninspired. 

But easily, the worst part of the game is the check point system.
[i] oh god the check point system [/i]

It is awful. There are no other ways to explain it. What seems like a neat idea (which is to let the player save whenever they want), quickly turns into the worst part of the game. Firstly. it takes some of your blue orb to save (which is usually used for your abilities) meaning that if you happen to stumble into a combat area and want to use your abilities, but you have saved seconds ago because you didn't know what you were getting yourself into, tough luck I guess. It also goes against everything that a Metroidvania stands for, as it removes every sense of intrigue that the player might have had when exploring a new area by allowing you to save at any point, basically annihilating the challenging and the intrigue the player might have had. 

Although it has some severe flaws (especially the checkpoint system) it is undeniable that Ori and the Blind Forest is a gorgeous Metroidvania that is driven by magnificent visuals & audio, a spirited protagonist, and tough-but-fair platforming & exploration. Should you buy this game full price? Ehh, wait for at least a 20% discount if you are on the fence.

I give Ori and the Blind Forest a...

The story follows Ori and her journey to restore the forest. The characters while they may not have any ""Dialog"", their character designs and animations really emote their personality which was really impressive. The story is simple for anyone to follow along and feel invested in, but its the gorgeous way that its told that will hold over players. 
The setting of Nibel is truly fantastic which each area correlating to a certain element or a colour pallet that add a whole lot of variety to the game and keep it from feeling stale.

Graphically, the game never had any bugs or issue and always had a consistent frame rate throughout, though this is a type of game where graphics really aren't the focal point. The art direction is genuinely some of the best that i have ever seen in a video game. Words can't even describe how gorgeous. You would honestly have to see for yourself.
Sound and Audio are on par with the visuals as these orchestral ballads really enrich the experience. The Audio for the likes of abilities, enemies and even just the world around you enhances the tone that this game is going for and its all really impressive. 
In terms of gameplay, it feels amazing to play as Ori. The movement is just so smooth and satisfying, with it coming into play with the multiple instances of platforming which i must say was a real challenge. The combat also feels great with enemies coming in all sorts of variety and bringing all kinds of attacks that make the experience that much more challenging. There are a good few collectables in terms of more heath etc. for the player to go and explore. The upgrade tree offers a lot for the player for them to overcome obstacles that they may face later in the game and it really feels like you truly benefit from unlocking it. The game can be tough but it does offer the player a lot of skills and chances to overcome a situation that it justifies its difficulty.
Overall, Ori and the Blind Forest is such a fantastic game and is another example of both a superb indie game and a perfecty designed Metroidvaina.",1657912562,1657912562,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I almost wish this game was longer because the advanced movement tools you get at the end make the game a lot more fun imo. The bedrock of this game is how good the platforming is and the wonderful art style and atmosphere, but the combat feels a little bit lacking. Thankfully one of the abilities you get makes your movement and combat significantly better in the midgame.

Rating - 9.3/10
I had some complains with original version but DE eliminates all
Now it has Fully backtracking support with teleportation system between every checkpoint
Difficulty Settings are added (Easy to One life - No more Dark Soul Logic)
So if you are a casual gamer just set it on easy and you are ready to experience this beautiful world.
Incredible soundtrack -  The musics are the reason why this game has life
Amazing visuals, Artstyle is just wow.

the aesthetic of this game is just absolutely stunning - environment design is beautiful throughout. once you get some movement potential the game becomes incredibly satisfying and the puzzles do sometimes have multiple solutions. being skilled with movement abilities feels incredibly rewarding when you find a solution to an area that really wasn't the intended path.

my only gripe is with the save system, which is weird considering how easy it is to save.

it's very very easy to forget to save as there are an INCREDIBLY limited number of auto-saves (maybe 3 or 4 the entire game?), the rest is up to you as a player to consume energy in order to make a save point. late game, this doesn't really matter, as you'll have so much energy it won't matter, but very very early on when energy is a limited resource, it can feel incredibly punishing to not be able to save, and often times you'll find yourself blasting away at easy sections carefree only to get killed by the environment in some fashion and lose your progress.

that being said, even with that gripe, the game itself is absolutely worth investing in and worth the playthrough. the story, while basic, is very heartwarming. the gameplay is really fun and rewarding, there's plenty of exploration to do, and the scenery is just outright stunningly beautiful.

The game is definitely a must get for most casual players. The scenes and music makes the game a masterpiece in its own accord. 

However, the platforming aspect was sometimes frustrating (skill issue lol) and that the controls can get a little awkward at times. Moreover the bland variety of mobs and the simple combat system in which you either use the spirit flame or ori's movements to combat the mobs shows a lack of deeper design in this aspect, not to mention the game save system which is frustrating too.

Although took away from my enjoyment of this game, it also highlighted some of its flaws that I wouldn’t have caught otherwise.

[b] Visuals [/b]
-as one can probably see from the screenshots the game looks absolutely stunning. The backgrounds and environments have some of the best art in a game I have ever seen, which greatly contributes to Ori and the Blind Forest’s amazing atmosphere
-unfortunately for my taste the game sacrifices too much visual clarity for its aesthetics. 
-your attack’s big and bright flashes, which have no reason for being this visible because you do not have to aim your attacks, overlap with enemy projectiles, making it hard to dodge. 
-sometimes objects/enemies having the same visuals do not mean they follow the same rules and pattern

[b] Music [/b]
-A+, very atmospheric

[b] Story [/b]
-the story was very emotional and impactful. Although it was told with the help of only a few cutscenes and the environments, I think it is the reason why many players absolutely fell in love this game
-a small point of critique is that the theme is pretty basic (light vs darkness, themes of corruption, etc.) but it was executed really well

[b] Gameplay [/b]
-the jumping felt sluggish (because of a long and slow air time) to me and it was often times difficult to control where Ori lands because of her small model, which is unusual for a platformer
-the small model also can make you lose track of her when a lot is happening on screen
-some enemy attacks are too quick to dodge, which encourages a passive (and boring) playstyle, like repeating attacking and running away, or hiding behind the safety wall to attack
-the fighting consists of senseless button mashing and keeping a safe distance
-in some aspects the game is really slow, like:
	-opening doors taking a long time
-a lot of level design is made through waiting for obstacles to be passable
-the game is made with the thought of tanking through hits, as you get a huge health bar throughout the game (which is not really possible on the high difficulty, because you get oneshot a lot), instead of actually learning how to defeat each enemy
-sometimes you get attacked from enemies that are not visible on the screen (especially at the top and bottom), or fall into enemies and their projectiles with no time to react )
-the platforming had a pretty good difficulty most of the time, but there were also a lot of times where you suddenly have to make perfect, unforgiving jumps, especially when it involved spikes as obstacles
-i think there was way too much fighting for it to be so monotone
-the ideas and the types of puzzles are great, but the finetuning of the platforming is lackluster
-the quality of level design is also inconsitent, the worst parts usually being a lot of enemies dumped after another

[b] Systems [/b]
-the skill tree being split into three lines, while having vastly different skills within those lines is frustrating and missing out on general utility because you want to level your fighting or being weak for half of the game because you want the utility first is not enjoyable
-your ability to create checkpoints shares the same resource with an ability to attack and an ability to open doors, so it can happen that you run out of said resource and have to either search around the map for nodes for said resource, or you’ll have to complete a difficult passage without any checkpoints. How this system made it into the game is honestly mind boggling to me
-when dying, the game does not remember what you picked up after the last time you saved, so you will have to retrace your steps every time and there is a good chance of missing a pickup because you forgot collecting it again
-I don’t understand the necessity of map stones (revealing a small portion of the map after finding a hidden pickup), there was no situation i found it useful
-pickups from defeated enemies despawn after a short time which can be annoying 
-enemy respawning happen to frequent for my taste
-why is there a cooldown on saving the game?

[b] Miscellaneous [/b]
-there are pop up tutorials for eeeeverything, for example you get a pop up for every major pickup you collect, even if you collected 5 of them already
-the font used doesn’t suit the game
-there is a lot of teasing the player with rewards they cannot get, because they haven’t gotten the ability yet, which doesn’t bother me and is a nice incentive, but it really happened A LOT
-unskippable cutscenes, which get really frustrating, because they play anew every time you die and get to that point again

In conclusion, this sounds like I wouldn’t recommend this, but it is the opposite. When I write reviews I tend to focus on the negatives. This game was frustrating for me a lot of the time, but I attribute that to my own stubbornness of not changing to an easier difficulty. Ori and the Blind Forest’s strongest points are definitely its story and its visuals. The platforming is good for the most part and while I did not enjoy the combat, it will be more tolerable on an easier difficulty.

But past that it ranged from mediocre to frustratingly bad. I have done several playthroughs and have considered whether or not to write a positive or negative review and I came to the conclusion that I simply can't recommend this. When it comes to indie metroidvanias there are simply too many other significantly better experiences out there. 

The combat in this game is absolutely atrocious, it is quite literally just button mashing while standing vaguely near the enemy. The further you progress the more options you get, but these options are severely underpowered and not really practical to use in most situations. It is not engaging at ALL.

The platforming is not all that enjoyable or precise in my personal opinion, which is really disappointing because this game very clearly wants to pride itself on its platforming but its just not that interesting. It is very floaty and that is just not my personal taste for this type of game.

The story is... hard to describe but it feels very... self righteous? It plays out like it thinks of itself as deeply important/meaningful but honestly its very predictable and it isn't fleshed out with enough meaningful detail to really make much of a lasting impact on me. 

The save function is garbage and it lends itself to placing you to having to repeat cutscenes pretty frequently which can be insanely frustrating especially on the harder difficulties where you get killed in 1-2 hits. 

The exploration is decent I suppose but despite being a metroidvania it is honestly super linear, very scripted and overall everything in this game aside from the art feels half baked. Like they had good ideas but didn't have enough of an idea on how to really wrap everything together into a consistently enjoyable experience.

I am hoping to enjoy the sequel more but I cannot personally recommend this game",1657113480,1657113480,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I cannot describe it better than this.
This game breathes art, together with a touching story.

PRO:
- If you are fan of the Metroidvania genre, you must have this game
- Outstanding artistic design and beautiful animations
- Fantastic audio, especially during the ""escape sequences""
- The Definitive Edition provides new areas, abilities and story details, that beautifully expands the original world, and fits perfectly with the game atmosphere
- Around 8 hours to finish it without pushing for secrets, but if you want 100%, you can count around 12 to 15, depending by your skill level
- I got it for 5 EUR on Steam

CONS:
- The ""escape sequences"" are awesome, but excessively based on trial-and-error and memorization rather than being skill-based
- Level design provides an unbalanced difficulty curve. Very easy sections alternate to extremely challenging segments
- Lacking of any real ""boss fight"" makes the game feeling incomplete

Ori and the Blind Forest is among the prettiest, most well flowing, and rewarding games I have ever played. 

Every part of the map is illustrated in a way that envelopes the player in it's atmosphere. Whereas many metroidvanias like Hollow Knight has its massive map being a mostly samey lost sprawl, Ori's journey is distinct, memorable, and unique from just how diverse its art portrays each part of the game.

Ori's combat isn't his strength, so each stage flow so naturally from area to area where you come to really appreciate the style and music the developers put into the world you inhabit. There was no part of the game that was soul-crushingly difficult, with every item or power-up being rewarding and compelling the player to explore. (Unlike HK)

Ori's Journey is comparatively short with me finishing the game in 15 hours, telling a sappy but neat story (which I had to stop myself shedding a tear or two from) which is only accentuated by its amazing soundtrack. So...

...if you love Platformers, you'll love this game. if you love Metroid, play this game. If you love beautiful visuals and music, play this game.

The game starts out okay, with a cool (albeit extremely long) cutscene and some typical platformer-tutorial stuff. The first few sections went well, until I got the Bash ability. The problem with this is that sometimes puzzles require you to launch yourself, and sometimes they require you to redirect projectiles in the opposite direction. This was confusing, but at least time stops for a few seconds while you aim.

The real problems began in Sorrow Peak. I genuinely liked some parts of it (for instance, the falling-rock section), but the flying controls are just too damn finicky.

However; it has some challenging parts that you'll find yourself trying over and over and over.

<<THE GOOD>>

Visually appealing with beautiful and diverse landscaping/level design.
Fantastic soundtrack!
Easy to learn controls (except ground pound... that was annoying).
Learn new skills, gain exp and level up via a skill tree. This adds a lot to the game.
Cute, likable characters with a great story.
Fun boss battles and unique chase scenes.

<<THE BAD>>

Very repetitive button mashing combat.

Not a lot of diverse enemies and reusing enemies with only slightly different attacks.

Annoying chase scenes that make you start completely over when you die.

Upgrade your health bar but this doesn't seem to matter. No matter how big your health is... the enemies scale and you still die in 2-3 hits. What's the point?

A LOT of instant deaths. You can have a full health bar... and there are countless ways to die immediately. This gets very tedious and annoying.

<<BAD or MAYBE GOOD?>>

Heavy metroidvania game. Tons of secrets that you must wait to uncover until you unlock that ability. I'm not a fan of this style of gamplay. A lot of backtracking, remembering where you need to go, etc. However; they did a good job to make it less confusing than others, and I never felt like I was wandering around for hours trying to figure out where to go next.",1656573047,1656617496,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The platforming never gets hellishly difficult, but there are sections that are challenging enough to be fun, particularly the white-knuckle setpieces that conclude each 'chapter' and that require you to tie together all the movement skills you've gained thus far, and that feel really satisfying to complete after dying a bunch of times. Ori's movement through the air has a very acrobatic and flowing, graceful feel to it, without sacrificing clean and responsive controls.

The other main strength of the game is the gorgeous visuals and music. They're great.

There are also a few minor puzzle elements, and there's combat but it's very simple (the combat is at its best when it's integrated with the platforming, e.g. in places where there is an enemy making it hard for you to jump somewhere, or where you have to decide whether to kill an enemy or use it to help you move around the environment).

The most fun and rewarding movement ability in the game is ""Bash"", which lets you grab onto an enemy, projectile, or falling rock, and shoot yourself off of it in one direction while also shooting it off in the other direction; this both gives you tons of options for creative things to do and also has the potential to mess up your plans in unexpected but fun ways (like when you have a great idea to blast an enemy's fireball back into its face, but you didn't anticipate that that would also make you blast yourself into some spikes... or when you want to use an enemy's fireballs to bounce yourself higher and higher, until you accidentally kill that same enemy with one of its own fireballs).",1656400384,1656400757,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Fought a lot to finish it but it took me since the Definitive Edition came out till now to beat it (17/06/22)

The moments where it shines best are definitely the moments with heavily emphasized platforming, as the combat is, in all honesty, pretty terrible. I think the devs know this though, because there's like 2 bosses, and most of the enemies can be defeated pretty easily. 

If you're coming from a game like Hollow Knight, know that this game has a much more nature focused atmosphere, and will not live up to your expectations unless you really like platformers like I do. This game is definitely a platformer first and a metroidvania second, with a fairly set out linear path with minimal backtracking and on-your-own exploration, though optional post-game content is much better in this regard. Not at all to say that that's a bad thing though, the game definitely delivers on the strengths of linearity, offering very well thought out and balanced challenges, and though it kind of felt as if the main story was a bit short, a good narrative.

The music is phenomenal, It really gets you in the mood, and compliments the style of the game very well. If I had to rate it, it's only slightly better than the music of Donkey Kong, and only marginally worse than Hollow Knight's music, which is a big praise since those are some of the best soundtracks!

Positives:
-Great ambience, visually pleasing mix of foreground and background.
-Player has the freedom to solve puzzles in more ways then one. Like there's the obvious way, but you can skip half of it if you use your movement abilities in creative ways.
-Music does a great job at triggering the right emotions at the right time throughout the journey.
-You quickly get abilities that make you feel fast and agile while playing.

Negatives:
-The combat is fairly basic. You get a homing orb that zaps nearby enemies, so you don't even need to aim.
--After upgrading your orb, it gets harder to see enemy projectiles due to the visual effects your orb does.
-There are ""runner"" sections where you gotta keep moving or die. My main issue is these sections can be pretty long and there are no checkpoints, there are also objects that can 1 shot you or stunlock you, making it feel like a cheap death as you don't have much time to react.

The game's reputation now is still very well set even with the sequel existing. From the moment you press new game and the swift transition taking you through the whole 10 minute intro was entrancing enough to tell me that this game  was going to be something precious.

The story itself isn't anything too impressive on paper but on your first playthrough you wouldn't even really notice that as the game does such a good job at expressing the important moments with the colorful visuals, amazing cinematography, and fluid animations.

Speaking of fluidity, when the act of just moving your character is fun then you know the whole gameplay is bound to be exciting. Paired with the game's iconic bash ability which allows Ori to use objects and enemies as catapults to launch her further into the air, the entire game will feel like you are just swimming through water.

The combat of Ori however has always felt like the least properly developed part of the whole package. It all comes down to spamming the attack button when the enemy is close and maneuvering away from incoming attacks. While Ori does have a ground pound and the bash move at her disposal it doesn't help that the combat overall is still pretty shallow.

The developers clearly knew that as instead of boss fights the game puts you up with intense chase sequences in place of them. To take in mind that the first chase sequence often gets complaints from players as being a major difficulty spike from what was presented beforehand. They may come off as very intimidating but once you memorize the sequence patterns and pay attention to your surroundings you will soon realize that they are all designed pretty fairly. It is just takes quite a while of getting used to.

Ori and the Blind Forest is still considered to be one of Xbox's best games they have put out in the last decade and persists pretty strong visually even in the next generation of consoles.

There's a lack of precision in both platforming and combat that just feels clumsy. Combat boils down to spamming x and jumping to avoid tiny fast-moving multidirectional, sometimes homing, sometimes exploding projectiles. Remember Primal Aspids from HK? Yeah, it's that sort of bullshittery only with most enemies. You unlock the ability to launch from projectiles but even timing that your best bet is button mashing.

Movement is floaty and at odds with how a demanding action platformer should control; I never felt completely in control of Ori, sometimes I even lost track of their tiny blue ass between the backdrop, the glorified reticle of matching colour/size, looking where I was going and dodging projectiles. Most of the game is poorly checkpointed trial and error with limited manual saves that your abilities use the same pool as (which just makes me avoid using abilities altogether so I can ration my saves). Gandhi forbid you forget to save.

I was ready to quit the game until I saw greyed out metroidvania tunnels on the map and giddily got into my Dora boots. But I soon discovered there's no sense of adventure in the exploration, no secret bosses/characters/quests/lore to find, you're just looking for keys, map fragments, XP and additional vitality/power.

The way acceleration, floating, and mid-air changes in direction work all seem really inconsistent and imprecise compared to the physics in other platformers.

So if you're feeling stuck and on the verge of rage quitting, remember that it's totally reasonable to feel that way.

My advice to those jumping into Ori's world for the first time would be to pick Easy difficulty. I made the mistake of choosing Normal difficulty and after getting real tired of listening to Ori's weak dying whimper, I was about to drop the game for good when I finally remembered that I could change difficulty. If I could turn back time, I'd pick Easy difficulty in a heartbeat. That way I could enjoy Ori's beautiful world without so much agony.

An amazing experience with 99% enjoyable gameplay and storytelling. Also perhaps the most beautiful game I've ever seen.

Music, art, sound design and general atmosphere are all top notch. The story reminds of a disney movie. The gameplay is great but could be better. The best parts are the platforming sections which feel great and are mostly challenging. The combat system however can feel like a slight nuisance sometimes. The game is quite difficult so only pick it up if you have confidence in either your skill or your perseverance.

Never been happier to see this achievement pop up. 
Let me start by saying that I appreciate a good platformer. This however, is not one of them. Putting aside the terrible hitboxes and obnoxious obstructions (thorns, spikes, lava), the story is just kind of lame. It's short and cute but that's all it has going for it. 
If you want a better story, more lore etc: Go with Hollow Knight
If you want a more challenging platformer: Go with Cuphead
If you want worse controls but in a roguelike: Go with Rogue Legacy
If you want better controls in a roguelike: Go with Dead Cells
If you want a horror metroidvainia: Go with Carrion

1. Beautiful, varied environments
2. Solid combat with significant upgrades throughout (by endgame you're a fully-torqued super saiyan).
3. Perfect change of pace from giant, open-world rpg's
4. Rewarding for both explorers and speed runners

Downers:
1. There are skills that can be purchased in the skill tree at any point, but can't be used until unlocked later on in the game. This is not explained at all and caused moderate frustration.
2. Some areas cannot be revisited (most can); completionists beware!
3. One instance when the game wouldn't allow me to progress past an area after after completing the requirements, This was solved with a simple restart.

The hype is real, yo.

Enjoy =)

There should be no debate that the game is beautiful on both an audio and visual level.  It also gets high marks from me for its clever puzzles.

The theme of the game gets neutral marks as it's fairly standard fantasy fare.  The concept of some nature sprite travelling to different element-themed dungeons to unlock the powers of air, water and fire for the 500 millionth time in gaming history is certainly not breaking any new ground.  Even if you're a child, you've probably played a game with this exact premise numerous times in your life by now.

Which brings me to the negatives: the game mechanics and the game design seem to completely clash.  The cute aesthetic puts a deceptively friendly face on a game that is ultimately driven by unforgiving precision platforming.  The game is thick with environmental hazards such as lava, poisoned water, spike pits and lasers which kill you instantly regardless of your available health pool.  Furthermore, the vast majority of the platforming is spontaneous and random rather than static, so dying is not simply an issue of tightening up the pace and timing of your jumps.  To reach most of the areas you have to platform off of enemies and their projectiles in a long-series of complex aerial maneuvers (this doesn't just apply to reaching secret areas, it's a core mechanic of story progression).  Miss just one step in any maneuver and you're more likely to be killed instantly from environmental hazards than you are to simply take damage from an errant projectile.

This means that the collection/upgrade aspect of the game (finding life cells to expand your health pool or collecting ability cells to upgrade your damage capabilities) doesn't truly make the hero less prone to dying.  There are only a few types of enemies and they're all fairly easy to defeat (even with the most basic of abilities).  In my experience, you're far more likely to be killed because you moved just out of aggro range and missed a potential ""platform"" necessary for an air jump than to be killed directly by an enemy.

However, with the ability to save at will almost anywhere on the map, the game will still take full advantage of getting some cheap kills on you by magically respawning projectile-firing enemies right next to your save point.  Given the developer's sadistic designs for some levels, the at-will save ability is the true redeeming factor of this game.  It's the only thing keeping this game from being a boring ""Souls-like"" series of endless backtracks through the same locations (due to split-second misses rather than sheer incompetence).

The fact that you are prohibited from using this feature during the ""escape"" gauntlet runs that follow each dungeon level makes the game much more frustrating than it needed to be.  They could have instead implemented periodic auto-saves after particularly challenging portions of each gauntlet run, and they consciously chose not to.  This doesn't appear to be because they felt it would ruin the quick pacing of the escape.  They are perfectly happy to throw you directly back into the frying pan at the beginning of the gauntlet and kill you off with the ""moving wall of death"" without giving you any recovery time.

As an example, I died 95 times (the game tracks your deaths) just trying to escape the very first dungeon of the game.  It's not because I'm terrible at these games, it's because these gauntlets are explicitly designed to be very difficult to pass in one attempt.  That approach to design is acceptable, but it seems rather vindictive to require over 50 perfect precision jumps without any breaks or auto-saves to track your progress.  I rage-quit three separate times and almost deleted the game before even beating the first dungeon (the only thing bringing me back were the endless reviews about how ""perfect"" this game is and I sense that I must be missing something).  I can't help but feel that this sense of frustration was explicitly by design because these portions contain very obvious scenic transitions that seem perfectly designed for ""checkpoints"" that are conspicuously missing.  It begs the question of what type of reaction the developers were going for when I've beaten games on ""Nightmare"" difficulty that were honestly easier and less frustrating than this game was on ""Normal"".

That's ultimately what makes this a mixed review for me.  Is it a beautifully designed game?  Yes.  Does it include some rather complex puzzles and unique platforming mechanics that make it a bit more interesting than the average platformer?  Yes.  Is it a game that is legitimately more ""fun"" and ""rewarding"" to play than it is frustrating?  Only about half the time and you'd never know you were in for a ""bang-your-head-against-the-wall"" type of experience from the way it is designed and marketed.

There is some redemption in that the sequel (Ori and the Will of the Wisps) seems to have addressed the negative aspects of the original.  It plays quite similar, yet it improves monster AI and adds boss fights while reducing the danger of environmental hazards.  Therefore, playing this game first prepares you for the sequel, which is the prime reason to recommend it.  However, if you're the type of person that doesn't get any enjoyment from developing callouses on your thumbs, I'd recommend that you just watch a video of someone else playing this game and then just skip ahead to the second one.",1653173928,1653173928,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you don't care about the story, like me, then what's left is a really janky platformer, which sucks, because I think it's extremely close to being really damn good. Movement feels just barely too limited, your methods of attack simply feel incorrect, save points are dependant on an energy bar, which also is relied on for other things, making it feel like you shouldn't save nearly enough as the game wants you to. It's... frustrating. I've just unlocked the ability to double jump, and the feeling of freedom I felt like I had was immediately tarnished by the feeling of not knowing why i died.

Before playing this game I already considered this game to be a classic and a masterpiece just judging off of what I had heard and seen, and after finishing the game that hasn't changed. I recommend this game off the art style, sound design, and music alone. This is one of the prettiest games I have ever played. Every single frame of this game looks like a painting that people are still hanging up in museums hundreds of years later, it is incredible to look at and the music just makes it even better.

The gameplay is solid the platforming is fun, the controls are precise. Overall I enjoyed the game enough to keep playing from the gameplay. However, there is this difficulty spike that I just was not expecting and I personally don't think should be there or at least should be able to be turned down. Don't get me wrong I finished the game however I saw this game as a ""kids game"" after playing the game I don't think that due to the sad and depressive nature of some parts of the story, but I thought due to the art style and the fact that this is more of a story game that it would be accessible to most people. I feel like due to the very sharp curve towards the mid point of the game I think some people may have quit because of the more demanding platforming required to progress. I did struggle a good bit and I'm not amazing at games by any means but I have played many different games spanning all types of genres and I like a challenge but I think that people who this may be there first game of this type or first game in general will really struggle and may not be able to complete this game at all due to this difficulty spike. I think it's worth it I do but I see this being a really big problem for others.

Overall I liked this game and as said I will be buying and playing the sequel at some point. The art style and music in this game is some of the best in the industry right now and I understand why this game got the praise it did. Yes the gameplay frustrated me at times but I pushed through. I think due to the type of game and overall very fun art style I think the difficulty is a little out of place but it's still a fun game.

The combat starts off slow and fights are tedious, but it does improve after acquiring skills as you progress and encountering more types of enemies. The fluid and elegant movement feels great.

On most occasions the platforming is very forgiving to make up for the airy and sluggish movement. Though I dismissed it as clunky at first, the movement (just like the combat) improves as you acquire more skills (the dash and bash skills in particular makes traversing more enjoyable). In general it just takes some time to get used to the movement until it becomes fun.

The level design feels varied enough to differentiate each area, but the lack of enemy types makes it so that the areas all blur together so each individual section isn’t as memorable, making backtracking slightly difficult.

Fast forward to 2022 with 4K 60 FPS visuals, and I can confirm that [i]Ori and the Blind Forest[/i] is a stunning game from front to back, and I don't think that'll change decades from now.

[i]Ori and the Blind Forest[/i] also introduced gamers to modern video game composer legend Gareth Coker.

The first escape sequence combined with Restoring the Light, Facing the Dark is one of the most unforgettable experiences I've ever had playing video games.

[i]Ori and the Blind Forest[/i] is a game to play with headphones on, the room darkened, and get lost in its wondrous world and bittersweet story. While I have some issues regarding the beginning of the game's combat getting tiring and occasional nitpicks, all of its strengths carry it through those minor problems.

I don't think I need to say anything more. [i]Ori and the Blind Forest[/i] currently $5, and it was more than worth it when I got it for $20. If you somehow don't own this gem of a game, buy it now.",1652812856,1652812885,True,6,0,0.576271176338195801,0,True,False,False

Gameplay-wise, Ori And The Blind Forest is an accessible yet challenging game. Never in my time playing this game I felt that the gameplay was unfair. Not only that, the game isn't bloated, it doesn't force you to backtrack to farm and upgrade abilities. Guess what, you can complete the game without upgrading abilities but, it will take more time. Upgrading abilities and finding health and energy upgrades help a lot and add to the experience. Gameplay 9/10

As I mentioned above, the game isn't bloated and the same goes for the story. It doesn't drag anything out. The narrative is not only focused but also beautiful. If I go any further, I'll just spoil it. But, it was a beautiful and emotional experience. Story 9/10

Graphically, Ori isn't a heavy game but the art direction is just amazing. Everything area you explore is unique and beautiful to look at. The use of colors for each of the game's region is beautiful done. It immerses you and make you feels like you are is a different region than before. Visuals 9/10

Overall, Ori and The Blind Forest is an incredible experience and I look forward to playing the sequel. Final Score 9/10",1652610063,1652610063,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is short and has a quite straightforward story. It's more or less a platforming puzzle dexterity game. You have to combine platforming with some problem solving, along with (sometimes) quick reactions to dodge and/or move around.

The environment looks nice and the music fits the mood.

The ending was kind of cheesy/childish though; I usually hate reading that, but it painfully felt that way to me. 

If the game was way too easy, I would have understood the ending, since it would mean it would be marketed towards young children. But even if it wasn't insanely difficult, it wasn't so easy either.

Overall, you can play it as long as you don't expect too much out of it. It's not bad, although I found Hollow Knight (which I played right before) to be much more mindblowing, even if it started out as a very simple game. Then again, it's not the same kind of game and the difficulty can be exponential.

Personally, I expected much more from this game. I wouldn't say that it's overrated, but it's very close to it. It's far from being a crappy game, but it's nothing more than an okay one that was done properly.",1648855443,1652549910,False,0,0,0.522293031215667725,0,True,False,False

I don't enjoy metroidvanias, and Ori and the Blind Forest was a brutal reminder of that.

The environments are gorgeous, and the music is immersive and perfect. The story is a good one too, and the creatures, especially Ori, are adorable. My biggest complaint with this game is that a lot of the environmental hazards that kill you are super hard to distinguish from the rest of the world. So many of my deaths were caused by spikes I couldn't see or lava I couldn't distinguish from the hot rocks right beside it. This made the experience all the more stressful, since it felt like I was being punished for having bad eyesight. Another gripe is that the base game and the Definitive Edition come bundled, and I can't get rid of one without the other, so I have a game in my library I'll never touch and can't get rid of. This version doesn't have trading cards either, so it makes me wonder if I should have played the other edition.

The combat is fine. It's a platforming focused game after all. The save system on the other hand is abysmal. You can't save your game unless you have energy, which isn't as common as I'd like in the early game. Later on this stops being an issue, since you (hopefully) have a lot more energy cells by then. For inexperienced players, this system forces you to go back like 10 minutes worth of progress because you forgot to save. Other than those issues, this game is great and definitely worth picking up.

To be honest, I met the game while listening a playlist in Spotify made out of games soundtracks, and I swear that when I listened to ""Light of Nibel"" for the first time, I needed to know where it was from (I know, maybe it's strange to met a game like this, many years later, and because of Spotify, but meh, that's not the point).

After a few years, I finally had the possibility of playing it, and guys, it worth every damn cent paid for it.

The art is beautiful, the soundtrack couldn't be more amazing, at such point that it evokes many fellings while you play (seriously, the game makes you cry in just the first 5 minutes), and last, but not least, the story is beautiful.

And if that's not enough, if you are obsessed with finishing every game at it's 100% (like me), you'll enjoy searching for every secret hidden in the map, unlocking every ability, etc (and this adds more replayability to the game, what is very possitive).

As Eleutherios (""the liberator""), his wine, music, and ecstatic dance free his followers from self-conscious fear and care, and subvert the oppressive restraints of the powerful. His thyrsus, a fennel-stem sceptre, sometimes wound with ivy and dripping with honey, is both a beneficent wand and a weapon used to destroy those who oppose his cult and the freedoms he represents.[5] Those who partake of his mysteries are believed to become possessed and empowered by the god himself.[6]

His origins are uncertain, and his cults took many forms; some are described by ancient sources as Thracian, others as Greek.[7][8][9] In Orphic religion, he was variously a son of Zeus and Persephone; a chthonic or underworld aspect of Zeus; or the twice-born son of Zeus and the mortal Semele. The Eleusinian Mysteries identify him with Iacchus, the son or husband of Demeter. Most accounts say he was born in Thrace, traveled abroad, and arrived in Greece as a foreigner. His attribute of ""foreignness"" as an arriving outsider-god may be inherent and essential to his cults, as he is a god of epiphany, sometimes called ""the god that comes"".[10]

Wine was a religious focus in the cult of Dionysus and was his earthly incarnation.[11] Wine could ease suffering, bring joy, and inspire divine madness.[12] Festivals of Dionysus included the performance of sacred dramas enacting his myths, the initial driving force behind the development of theatre in Western culture.[13] The cult of Dionysus is also a ""cult of the souls""; his maenads feed the dead through blood-offerings, and he acts as a divine communicant between the living and the dead.[14] He is sometimes categorised as a dying-and-rising god.[15]

Romans identified Bacchus with their own Liber Pater, the ""Free Father"" of the Liberalia festival, patron of viniculture, wine and male fertility, and guardian of the traditions, rituals and freedoms attached to coming of age and citizenship, but the Roman state treated independent, popular festivals of Bacchus (Bacchanalia) as subversive, partly because their free mixing of classes and genders transgressed traditional social and moral constraints. Celebration of the Bacchanalia was made a capital offence, except in the toned-down forms and greatly diminished congregations approved and supervised by the State. Festivals of Bacchus were merged with those of Liber and Dionysus.",1652031347,1652031347,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Great movement although the first hour or so before you get some abilities is a bit of pain imo(made me stop right before I started getting better movement abilities lmao). You can get around places super fast even in mid game, and it has the perfect amount of combat. Cute story and just fun to move around in general with a variety of areas to roam through. I would recommend if you like movement based games or metroidvanias, although you can 'skip' a decent chunk of backtracking with movement so it might feel more linear than say hollow knight. Oh the visuals and music is also incredible.
It isn't too long if you 'rush' for 100% map, which took around 9~10 hours for me. idk if I will do a second playthrough bc it feels amazing after finishing the game. This used to be 20$ but since it is 5$, I would 100% recommend this. 

TLDR: metroidvania focus a bit more on movement than combat, extremely fluid movement which is the biggest strength. The first hour or so can feel sluggish imo so just get some abilities and you're good to go.",1651580651,1651580651,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

i've play pretty much platform game but for this one, i think i kinda suck hahaha
i died soooo many times in normal and ended up changing it to easy. i can say it's more than 500 times? maybe i'm just suck LOL

but anywaaay, i love this game so much. i would definitely purchase the next episode (and i did) 
the game is pretty long (in a good way) i enjoyed every stage of this game because every stage has their own type of enemy not always the same, i love the teleporting concept, the ability choices that we can learn, the challanges. idk what's not to like tbh! <3 love love love!!

[b]Sights & Sounds[/b]
- As you've probably noticed from the screenshots, the game looks amazing. The different areas of the game all feel fairly distinct and nice to look at (especially Moon Grotto, Misty Woods, and Lost Grove areas)
- In order to get it to look amazing on your display, you're going to have to change the resolution, probably. It's bugged to be capped at 1920x1080. Track down the .exe, right click, go to Properties -> Compatability -> Change high DPI settings, then check the box next to ""Override high DPI scaling behavior."" Make sure the ""Scaling performed by"" box is set to ""Application."" After that, you should be able to change the resolution from the menu
- The music is great. It adds to the sense of mystery and offers a nice accompaniment to your exploration. I still have the main theme stuck in my head

[b]Story & Vibes[/b]
- Honestly, the story is a little thin. It's revealed little-by-little as you explore new areas, but there's very little exposition. One could argue that this game is much more about the gameplay, but I was still left with a lot of questions about the forest and Ori, Naru, and Gomu's world
- That said, the small snippets revealed about the characters are pretty cute
- The visuals, music, and narrative (sparse as it is) all contribute to the game's air of mystery. I feel like my experience was heightened by playing it at night with the windows open

[b]Playability & Replayability[/b]
- The basic gameplay loop involves being told to go somewhere on the map, exploring until you get there, picking up a new ability, then making your way to the next place on a path that heavily involves that new mechanic. I enjoyed how mastery of the various skills was necessary to complete the final area of the game
- Backtracking can be rewarding. You'll often pass inaccessible areas on your way to picking up a new skill, then realize that's what you needed in order to get the ability points, health upgrades, or spirit capacity hidden inside
- This game is very demanding of your reflexes, timing, and attention to detail. There are often times that you'll understand what the game wants you to do, but doubt your ability to do it. Keep trying! The game is fair, it's just hard. I'm not very good at games and was still able to finish this one. It was a rewarding game to conquer
- The controls are precise and responsive, but I found that my gameplay improved drastically after plugging in my controller instead of playing via bluetooth. That tiny reduction in input lag made a surprising difference
- It's not often that I'm happy that a game is short, but my roughtly 9-hour (with an additional 3 hours paused) experience was about all I wanted out of the game. Any more would have felt like filler

[b]Overall Impressions[/b]
- The game ran extremely well and looked amazing once I got the resolution set to 4K for my TV
- I didn't encounter any bugs other than display issue, and I didn't encounter any framiness or audio issues. Well-made and well-optimized. Just wish they'd patch the display problem for new players

[b]Final Verdict[/b]
- [b]8.5/10[/b]. Definitely pick this one up if you like challenging platformers. It may look cute, but don't be fooled. It's a great game and only costs like $5. I highly recommend it",1650974847,1650975121,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-Combat is a bit flat.
-While the original version of Blind Forest and Will of the Wisps are running silky smooth on my machine, the Definitive Edition stutters every few seconds and I couldn't find a workaround yet.
(-You can't revisit dungeon-type levels in the non Definitive Edition after completing them. [i]Seeing that I left Ginso Forest with only 99% completion while working my way through Mount Horu...[/i] Thankfully that was fixed in DE.)

I even bothered to get every single achievement and I had fun doing that. Yes, including the Unhinged achievement. Good to see that there are still somewhat recent games out there which have soul. On top of all of that it only costs 4,99€ which is a steal.

But the game is a precision platformer and imho that does not really work with the chosen graphic style. The foreground adds a lot of nice little details to the world but it also makes some enemies and projectiles difficult to see. So many times I've died to stuff I simply could not see. And this is a dealbreaker for a precision platformer.
The world with all its details and squiggles makes it sometimes also difficult to properly assess hitboxes and enviromental hazards.
I also find the combat system rather annoying as enemies often have way too much health for it to be fun. And one of the core mechanics of the game is that you can/must manually place your savepoints with a limited resource. While this SOUNDS interesting, the typical gamer mentality makes you want to save that resource, often having to repeat sections way too often because you were too ""resourceful"" to place another savepoint. Sure, that is your fault but the game mechanic encourages this behaviour actively leading to frustration. Games like ""They Bleed Pixels"" implement such a system better. Also you have to watch cutscenes or door opening animations over and over if your savepoint was shortly before the corresponding section. Not being able to skip cutscenes in a game where you are meant to die a lot is just bad game design.

Would also like to see a better save and fast travel system. Both are also tedious and so I rarely used them (much to my own detriment I'm sure lol)

Ori and the Blind Forest was a massively refreshing - not just platformer - but game in general. This takes the cake as best platformer that I have ever played, and also very high up in ranks with any genre.

This game took me straight back to childhood memories playing games like Spyro or Rayman. With mystical, whimsical magic, and tones of positivity with a clear 'villain'. The art was beautiful. The gameplay was addicting, as I beat this game in 3 days and played 17 hours.

I give one point less than it deserves, sadly. Partly for a technical bug of not being able to unlock some achievements that I clearly should have. (killing 3 enemies while not touching the ground, an easy task in this game...) -And partly because I believe Ori's character development compared to the other characters was lacking. As Ori is the main character, you would think that we'd have a little more substance than: born of the tree spirit, has a friend, and must save the forest because Ori is the offspring of the tree spirit. Surprisingly doesn't make much difference, so a 9/10 is still solid.

As with similar metroidvania style games, it can be mildly frustrating when you start off with no special abilities, but you quickly gain access to pretty fun movement options. 

The game isn't actually all that difficult (based off the default 'normal' difficulty), and there are no typical boss fights (except a few little rooms that have a couple enemies to kill.) Instead, there are a lot of fun chase scenes that play off moves you were unwittingly practicing in the areas just prior to them.

Aside from Hollow Knight a few months ago, platformers are new for me and this was a satisfyingly fun yet sometimes challenging game. The game starts off manageable and I felt my progression all the way through. 

Many moments of frustration against an environment or enemy that I'd eventually overcome and coming back hours later and now it's so much easier - showing how you have evolved and gotten better. Yet the game kept me humble because while you're better, you're still a squishy small creature that can't power through everything. You have to learn, adapt, and overcome, always facing new situations. Arguably my favorite screenshot will be me gliding down a lava chamber while two enemies fire lasers that will instakill me if they hit me, and then compare that to the quiet, cute start at the very beginning. 

Honestly shed a small tear at the very end and thought what a beautiful game. Very happy to have picked it up after waiting a few months to play it, and really looking forward to playing the sequel,

As a miscellaneous end note, for anyone that loves the soundtrack, spotify has it on there and likely other music apps too! And the ""theater"" mode is so, so cool to see just how different some of the development vs end product is. The final product has amazing visuals and it's so cool to recognize features that existed in development that lasted to the final game and also see all the stuff that did not make it.

The mechanics and gameplay is challenging but fun
The story is interesting but vague at times which fits the entire style of the game
The combat and chase scenes are very good despite enemies respawning very quickly. 

How does this game fall?
It's difficult to get into it at first. If your not a curious type of person or do not like slow paced beginnings then it might pose a challenge to get into it. However once you do it's great. 
It's difficult I found myself occasionally rage quitting at some chase scenes. Maybe just don't play on Hard difficulty stick to normal to reduce rage. 

Is it worth the money?
Yes

It it worth your time? 
Mostly

Is it worth the effort? 
Negotiable

Should you buy it?

The world itself is just so immersive and full or charm it's hard not to lose track of time and want to explore absolutely every corner and secret. I believe I am almost done so it is on the shorter side compared to Hollow but it doesn't feel like it is over staying it's welcome and is a very tight quality package.
