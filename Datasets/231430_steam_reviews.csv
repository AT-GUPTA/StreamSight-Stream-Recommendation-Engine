It has community made maps and stuff in the workshop, some maps are pretty cool. Sometimes I get some lag when epic battles are taking place in choke points and lots of artillery and fragmentation bombs are dropping everywhere. Sometimes there are moments when I just sit back and laugh because there is so much chaos unfolding before me.

The game itself is not bad at all, actually. It's a pretty good strategy game, that involves careful micro-managing of every SINGULAR one of your personal units within the game, however, this is also where it's main flaw lies, at least for me. For most strategy players out there (including myself) it's usually found to be EXTREMELY annoying, whenever you have to micro-manage EVERY LITTLE soldier on the battlefield, kind of like you do in this game, as sometimes it causes a lot of problems with in-game coordination and usually leads to you ending up in extremely nasty and unsavoury situations half of the time because of this, because it's just so easy to mess up if you aren't a master at micro-managing. Also, the fact that some rounds can drag out for over an hour or even more, especially if you are playing in the Annihilation game mode, can get VERY irritating, if the round itself lasts too long, because one player can't get an upper hand over their opponent. Also, not to mention the fact that you need to PAY to unlock the rest of the in-game's playable factions, I mean... need I say more about that?


However, it's not all grim and despair with this game, as I personally found enjoyment with the game's campaign, it's historical accuracy, as well as the fact that even when it seems like you have completely lost a round, you can still turn it around in your favour, no matter how desperate it may seem like your situation is in that specific round. However, I still won't recommend you getting this game, for one simple reason; if you aren't prepared for a HARDCORE in-depth strategy experience, where you have to:
- Micro-manage EVERY SINGLE LITTLE soldier on your team with LASER like precision, unless you wanna risk losing a whole round, just because you didn't bring over a single soldier to a very specific position
- Potentially play a whole hour or even longer during a SINGULAR round (especially if you are playing in Annihilation mode), because you or your opponent can't get the upper hand over each other
- Be willing to pay an extra 52 bucks (at least if you decide to buy the standard base game with the USSR and the Wehrmacht factions, that is), to access the 3 other playable in-game factions

I have now played 1,000.1 hours. At my first review, it was 275,7 hours. Here in 2024, CoH2 is still being played and I still think it's a FANTASTIC game! I've nearly completed all DLC missions on the highest difficulty and generally would recommend all DLC. 

I mostly just play against bots, with other people. I think that's much more fun than versus actual players, so this is an option for you too. CoH3 doesn't seem like it was a great success and I haven't bought it. Meanwhile, CoH2 can still be enjoyed with friends. The worst thing about it, is the occassional ""sync error"" which disconnects a game in progress. The other thing, is how slow it is earning enough gold to buy new commanders and the fact that there's no new commanders coming in. I also think the game suffers from Achievement Spam, since there's many I think are pointless, like building X amount of something to kill Y amount of something else, but then, some people like it. 

I recently discovered there's Art of Defence mods in the Workshop as well, so you can play with others against waves of enemies. It's cool. It's reminiscent of the C&C Zero Hour days, somewhat. Currently, CoH2 is still my preferred RTS game. The graphics are still lovely, the gameplay is fun and there's good map and faction variety to keep people playing.


2017 review underneath:
----------------

A fantastic game. 

- Excellent graphics.

- Very realistic units. So satisfying when you recognise them in movies!

- Great campaign. 

Just very very good allround, as an RTS. It really feels like watching a warzone every battle. Here's a review for the British Forces DLC because I can't post it over there: 

I can recommend this expansion, as indeed I can with every one of CoH2. If you like CoH2, you shouldn't miss out on the British forces. The drawback with these, is that there's no singleplayer campaign and so you do need to play multiplayer. However I find it fine just playing against the CPU in that regard, instead of real players. You can also create custom matches of course, if you just want to be alone against a CPU opponent, rather than being bothered by other players on your team.The units are very useful in terms of defence, which is how I play. Early on for example, you have access to an MG unit immediately, which is super useful for locking down areas, since enemy infantry then can't advance, but will get pinned down. There aren't a lot of British commanders as of writing sadly (August 2017). So in addition to the 3-4 Commanders you start with, there's an additional 3 you can earn or buy. These 3 are super useful, but that also means in my view, that the default ones are pretty garbage. The marketing text says there's different nationalities represented in the units and that may be so, but I certainly haven't noticed it, because it's not that distinct. Still, it's nice to hear British voices. British tanks are alright, although in my experience other tanks from other factions are all vastly better. The most interesting British ones can only be unlocked by using a Commander; such as the Crocodile or AVRE Churchil tanks. It's also a pretty annoying thing, that British units can't build tank traps or such like. However British infantry units are quite strong when in cover and when using Royal Engineers to build a Forward Base, you can heal your units and really dig in. If you add some Bofors emplacements 
(basically an Anti-Air gun which can destroy most units) and some AT guns, then you can really turtle like a boss. Likewise, British Royal Engineers can build static mortar placements. These have a pretty huge range and fire pretty quickly. However in general, artillery isn't the British strong suit, as a great artillery unit is generally lacking. British units instead make their base fire artillery and this means that an infantry unit for example, can be upgraded so that while fighting, you can call in artillery fire. This is in addition to any grenades or such that they have. I don't think it's so accurate though, until you buy an expensive defensive upgrade later on.",1504028886,1708167962,True,2,0,0.507884323596954346,0,True,False,False

My friends, I like war...

No, friends, I love war!

I love holocausts.

I love blitzkriegs.

I love defensive lines.

I love sieges, charges, I love mop-up operations, and retreats.

Wars across prairies, in streets, in trenches, in grasslands, in frozen tundras, through deserts, on the sea, in the air, I love every act of war that can occur upon this earth.

I love blasting the enemy to smithereens with artillery salvos that thunder across the lines of battle.

My heart leaps with joy whenever a soldier is tossed high into the air and cut to pieces by well placed sniper rounds. And there is nothing like a tank operator using a Tiger acht acht (88) to destroy enemy tanks. And the feeling that comes when a soldier runs screaming from his blazing tank, only to be mowed down by heavy machine gun fire, is such an exquisite feeling. Like when ranks of infantry brandish their bayonets rushing into the enemy line. It moves me deep within my heart to watch a fresh recruit stabbing over and over into the bloated chest of a long-dead enemy.

The sight of deserters being strung up from a street lamp is an irresistible pleasure. And there is nothing more arousing than the sounds made by prisoners of war dropping like flies, screaming in agony as they're mowed down by ear piercing schmeissers!

When a band of pitiful resistance fighters makes their final stand with nothing but small arms, only to have their city smashed to atoms block by block by 4.8 ton bombshells, (tone suddenly softens) I'm in ecstasy.

I love it when my forces are ravaged by a Russian armored division. It's so sad to see towns and villages that were supposed to be defended at all costs, being laid to waste, their women and children being raped and killed.

I love to be squashed under the heel of the British and American war machines. The humiliation as my men crawl around like vermin, ducking the jagdbombers flying overhead.

Gentlemen... All I ask for is war, war so grand as to make Hell itself tremble. Gentlemen, I ask you as fellow brothers in arms what is it that you really want? Do you wish for further war as I do? (Voice begins to raise) Do you wish for a merciless, bloody war? A war whose fury is built with iron and lightning and fire? (Dramatically raises voice) Do you ask for war to sweep in like a tempest, leaving not even ravens to scavenge from this Earth!?

(The soldiers begin shouting/chanting ""Krieg"" meaning ""War"")
...Very well. Then krieg is what you shall have. We are a clenched fist, ready to strike down all who oppose us with our might.

But... After enduring over half a century wallowing in the darkness, for us, a simple ""ordinary"" war will no longer be sufficient.

(Raises voice) We need a MASSIVE war! A war beyond any other that man's history has ever known!

We are but a single battalion... The remnants of a defeated army numbering less than a thousand strong. However, I believe that each of you old warriors is equal to a thousand of their sickly soft children! We represent a force that could easily defeat an army of a million and one men!

It is time for them to awake the ones who sent us screaming into oblivion, and who now lie sleeping. Let's drag them out of bed by the hair, and remind them of what we are! We will remind them of what it feels like to live in fear. We will remind them of the sound our jackboots make against their throats.

(Cuts to scene of Alexander Anderson looking up at Millenium's Zeppelin and the blood-red moon, before fading back to The Major)
We will remind them that there are more things between Heaven and Hell than are dreamt of in their philosophy.

(Cuts to soldiers shouting ""It's Europe! We see the lights of Europe!"" while looking out at scene below, and then meeting of Hellsing and Integra, before cutting back to The Major)
Our Kampfgruppe of one thousand vampires is going to burn this world down to ash.

(Cuts to window scene)
Yes, my friends! Soon, Europe's charred remains will illuminate the night sky!

(Cuts to window with Seras and Pip)
I have brought you all back just as I promised I would. Back to our favorite battlefield. Back to our beloved war!

(The Letzes Battalion hail the Major as their Battalion Commander.)
...At last, the sea lion has crossed the ocean and is heading up the hill. Attention, all soldiers of the Millennium Battalion! This is a message from your commander.

I give Company of Heroes 2 an 8.5, which is extremely high for my rating scale.

This game is a WW2 RTS game but it's greatness are not related to this. Every major part of this game flawless but there are soo many little details, carefully put together, it is like eating a great dish cultivated with perfect spices and eating an ice cream after it to completion.

THIS is how you make a game. Game is basic but not easy and replayable for 100s hours, campaign is fun but multiplayer is very exciting. 

Each match is a different story that could be made into a movie. You begin in a regular city, by the time match ends there is NOT-ONE-BUILDING intact.

It cheats more blatantly than any I have ever seen but to any human player with even the slightest grasp of the game it doesn't matter because of how stupid the AI is. It is given vast amounts of cheating even on normal but really hard and extreme are just not enjoyable to play in the least because of the amount of cheating that is on display here. When the enemy AI has seven panthers barely ten minutes in the game I think we have problems, its not a matter of real strategy then as it is a matter of exploiting the AI to defeat it and this stops feeling like a World War 2 strategy game and just becomes a lesson in tedium and frustration - two words you should not want attached to your game ever.  
Even with all the cheating the problem is the AI is 99% of the time too stupid to make it matter in the overall context of the game, I noticed for example they specifically are ENRAGED when ever you build some sort of structure like a forward base or resource cache, in fact they become so obsessed with it this can be used to exploit them for your own benefit. That's how the AI works with very dumb decisions like that, its just bad really really bad AI. Oh yeah and grenade spam, the AI loves to spam grenades so get ready for that - Company of Heroes 2 Microhell Edition whereas using grenades against the AI is virtually useless save on MG crew or in buildings since the exact nanosecond you click the grenade button the AI reacts to it, so they are already on the other side of the map by the time you have clicked the button and your union went through the process of throwing the grenade.
As for the allied AI its the complete opposite, it was clearly designed to do barely anything other than mostly support so its often the case that your ally Ai get pushed all the way back to their base within five minutes effectively meaning you are fight the opponent single-handedly, especially 'fun' on the 8 player map. This shows that this stupid, inconsistant, cheating AI was purposely designed like this - this is what Relic's AI designer wanted for reasons that will always baffle me. Oh and the AI can use their ability in the fog of war. Did you pull your tank back to repair? oh well the AI uses its aircraft anti-tank ability to wipe it out even though not a single unit was around and don't give me any excuses, I have watched countless hours of replays and study them all in extreme detail - the AI cheats, it cheats blatantly to make up for how piss poor the AI actually is.
It just comes down to the fact that Relic and specifically their AI designers are lazy and/or incompetent, and I'm tired of paying for such shoddy work which is why Company of Heroes 2 will probably be the last relic title I buy. I could go on for hours about the cheating and I have in fact spent a great amount of time studying the AI cheating in detail, but another major problem is the Relic fanbase itself is made up of some of the most stubborn fanatical people I've come across and they will argue until they are blue in the face the AI doesn't cheat which renders it a pointless battle to argue with so I prefer to just leave this negative review instead warning people buying this for single-player. Mindless devoted fanbases ruin a game more than anything when they don't want to face criticisms with their beloved game/developer and it hurts the company and games overall so its a self-defeating action. I'm sure this stupidity is being passed over to CoH3 which doesn't seem to have improved anything wrong with the series and in fact has made it worse.
Don't make the mistake though - the AI cheats beyond all reason but that doesn't mean you can't win, even on extreme you can pull off a victory if you think enough but its never an enjoyable victory rather just a frustrating and comedically inane waste of time. On the other hand if you are interested in multiplayer then I would recommend the game, the base game is fine its just Relics AI designer needs to be fired and replaced with someone who can actually do their job then maybe their games will be worth playing for everyone and not just the multiplayer crowd. If that's beyond Relics ability then they should just drop single-player altogether other than as very basic practice. 

Also the DLC is greedy, you can grind for the doctrines and skins but the former is next to impossible to get a drop on if at all so you really have to pay to get all the units and abilities in the game and above all Always Online to access doctrines,etc Just another warning.

Single-player : -9001/10
Multiplayer : 7/10

They lost a customer since the original Homeworld, done with them forever good job relic lets see how your bad coding and development choices will do you in the long run.

I am now just at about 300 hours in game and I can say with complete certainity that this game is pure garbage and that modern Relic is a terrible game developer. Let me say that the 98% of that time was not felt any sense of fun or enjoyment in what I was doing, I played with the bitter hope of this game coming out good but Relic just doesn't care they crap out another garbage sequel in an attempt to make money off DLC and the comp game scene and don't give TWO F*CKS about making an actually good game. This is a strategy game ergo the AI is the main focus outside of the multiplayer which is largely dead at this point, but since the AI is braindead what game do you even have at this point? The dull campaign with scripted scenarios? Yawn.

Company of Heroes 2 is certainly not for everyone, not least because of DLC that restricts factions in MP. Although there are decent Eastern Front and American DLC campaigns, most of my time has been spent in multiplayer, and I'd recommend it for several reasons. Certainly compared to some games in the RTS genre, the Company of Heroes series relies much more on strategy and tactics to carry the day rather than mindless RNG. Sure, you can lose an engagement because of RNG but I never felt like I lost a game over one. Some of my mates would disagree, of course, as I'm almost unbeatable on any map, with any faction, and sometimes, I don't even need to pick a commander against them. Perhaps they'd argue that the opening fight is much more critical. In my view, a fair strategy game revolves around predictable opening moves and tactics, leading to consistent outcomes. Company of Heroes is, therefore, more of an asymmetric version of Chess than anything else. I‚Äôve lost my fair share of MP games, but it‚Äôs hardly because I felt cheated, I usually felt outplayed.

Nevertheless, some games can be tighter than others, and I've had instances where lucky anti-tank shots and a few tricks have given me an edge to secure needed victory points or strategic resources. In this case, since there are no arbitrary resources (e.g. reinforcement points) that dictate the spawning of units, if the enemy is not capturing the territory points, then you're almost certainly better off than your opponent. This means that winning engagements has a tangible impact on the battle, rather than a simple: rock, papers, scissors match that occurs in games such as Men of War, War Game: Red Dragon, or Steel Division (not that those games are poorly designed, they‚Äôre different). Company of Heroes makes it so that if you're winning, it's a little easier to keep winning. I appreciate the resource system for this reason. Although it still allows for quick comebacks, in no sense are you penalised for playing aggressively because losing a unit doesn't mean that the enemy can make an unequivocal comeback; you'll have more resources! This is important as you need those resources to build armoured vehicles, tanks, and support equipment. This system is not perfect (or even particularly deep), but it enables more strategic differences, as the mid-game can change depending on the resource imbalance between players.

We sadly don't play Company of Heroes 2 anymore. Instead, we play Men of War, which is fun, don't get me wrong, but it always makes losing to RNG much more frequent. Cheeky anti-tank shots or several bounces of anti-tank grenades are never enjoyable when that‚Äôs what decides matches. We make jokes because: ‚ÄòOf course, the tank was angled,‚Äô or ‚ÄòAnti-tank grenades don‚Äôt immobilise it, they weren‚Äôt that strong,‚Äô to make fun at each other when we‚Äôre all cursing, but none of these problems ever existed in Company of Heroes. I wonder if others have noticed similar imbalances regarding games with reinforcement points. In those games, should I be penalised for capturing points closer to the enemy spawn?

Is it worth playing Company of Heroes 2 now - it's up to you. I luckily bought this game and all its DLC for $10, which was a fantastic deal. If you're interested, then you might want to grab it during a sale! For the reasons above, and as many have pointed out, it's difficult to get into the game when you're starting without tangible matchmaking, but you can always try.

- Enough (re)playability with friends (2v2, 3v3, 4v4)
- Active modding community. I'd recommend playing on modded maps any day!

The bad:
- More difficult AI is mostly of the ""just give 'em more resources"" variety. All AI will micro very heavily (think, grenades, multi-squad movements), while at the same time happily facetanking flamethrowers and grenades. In principle this would be fine without the AI bonuses, but instead it'll feel more like fighting an unending stream of mooks  with a gazillion HP, instead of a clever mechanical fight. Be prepared to bring your cheese against AI!
- There are clear ""better"" strategies. Because scouting is relatively hard (scouts are squishy and troops are expensive and slow), rush strategies are generally superior. Not true for very chokepoint-heavy maps, of course. Still, winrates within ~2% of 50/50, so not ugly. Check e.g. https://coh2stats.com/ and look for yourself!

The ugly:
- * If you like to play against AI with a few buddies like me, be prepared to be pushed in very specific strategies. E.g. playing choke-point maps and focusing on artillery only. This is slightly alleviated because of the many options to play with, but be prepared to be wildly underpowered playing certain commanders or armies. Unfortunately I could not find the numbers, but in principle the hard AI cheats with resource multiplier (I think you need to trade about 1 for 2 to be even, just by experience), and the expert even worse with mapcheats and all. See e.g. https://steamcommunity.com/app/231430/discussions/0/135512133550194680/ for a short discussion
- * Fire-based weaponry absolutely _melts_ any infantry line anywhere. For sure the fire-airstrike will mess your armies up because:
- Pathing! Pathing is _horrible_. Do not assume squads will actually move to where you send them, because they get stuck in bushes, on corners of buildings, behind (friendly) tanks, you name it! Be prepared that (again, infantry squads are the worst offenders here) you have to babysit every unit all the time. Tanks and mechanized infantry alleviate this problem a little bit, but they still get stuck in unending chase-circles with engineers, or in slightly-too-narrow streets, for sure if you have a OKW in the team.
- Commanders, for sure good ones, are locked behind either a paywall (regular discounts though, but come on! The game is 11 years old) or a very _very_ long grind. This is not so good for those of us that played before, or just want to jump in for a few games with friends. This is based on the list on https://www.coh2.org/guides/33767/commander-tiers
- Expensive DLC, at time of writing E75,- for all DLC and an old game is on the expensive side for me
- Campaign just simply doesn't work, crashes in loading. The interwebs told me that it might be my GPU, or CPU, possibly that the hardware is just too modern. Fine, it's an old game, but why does skirmish work? And why can't I test that before buying? And why is there still no official solution except ""we're working on it for the past 5 years""? I guess a lot of the devs moved to CoH3, but we all know how that went ;)

Again, the game performs very well in its niche, and it might just be _your_ cup of tea. I just don't think this one withstood the test of time.",1706216115,1706216115,False,2,0,0.496839672327041626,0,True,False,False

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand‚Äîthe hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed‚Äîthe hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happineass of other people. I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Being set in World War II (the European theater, at least) was also unexpected for an RTS game of the time. [i]CoH[/i] was a great game and an improvement on the game mechanics pioneered by its predecessor, [i]Warhammer 40K: Dawn of War[/i]--already a good game in its own right.

But of course, [i]CoH[/i] still had some limitations with the old engine that necessitated development of a sequel, and with that said:


[b][i][u]Company of Heroes 2 - The Good, Bad and Ugly[/u][/i][/b]

[b]The Good:[/b]
[list]
[*]Improved game engine, game mechanics and physics.
[*]Mainly set on the Eastern Front with the Soviets and Wehrmacht Ostheer, but expansions with the Western Front factions were added later.
[*]Intel Bulletins (mini-buffs for your units) can only be bought with Supply (in-game currency) after the War Spoils 2.0 patch. No ""pay-to-win"" BS on that front. On that note...
[*]Duplicate items can be converted to Supply post-War Spoils 2.0.
[*]A vibrant and creative modding community that improves the game's replayability.
[/list]

[b]The Bad:[/b]
[list]
[*]Overly simplified User Interface. Gone are the ping buttons for ""Defend Here"" and ""Capture Here"" from [i]CoH 1[/i], which would have been more useful for team games without voice chat apps like Discord. It would have been better to have 5 buttons: ""Attack Here"", ""Defend Here"", ""Capture Here"", ""Reinforce Here"" and ""Repair Here"". Even the [i]CoH 1[/i] AI would understand those simple commands, but see below...
[*]Standard and Easy ally AI can be...frustratingly stupid, especially when playing vanilla. Not helped with the multiple updates to commanders and gameplay mechanics, but not the skirmish ally AI using said commanders.
[*]Grinding for Supply can be tedious. Mods make it a little bearable, but are subject to a daily limit. Need more? You have to play three more vanilla games (see above).
[*]No visible indicator(s) whether you're connected to Relic's game servers or not. It's downright frustrating when you've won a long match only to see a ""You have been disconnected"" message on the result screen and no Loot Points are granted. (One of the dark sides of a ""live service"" game, besides direct server outages.)
[*]Modders (apparently) don't have access to the full suite of modding/developer tools that allow the creation of custom vehicle and infantry models. (So for now, no Jagdpanthers, Wirbelwinds, Hummels, AT half-tracks, Sherman Crocodiles, or even an Imperial Japanese Army/Afrika Korps faction with theater-specific units.)
[/list]

[b]The Ugly:[/b]
[list]
[*]In-game store. While most of the items are cosmetic (vehicle skins, faceplates), the Commanders that aren't available with the base package do have a tinge of ""pay-to-win"" to them.
[*]Fox Company Rangers (DLC for the [i]Ardennes Assault[/i] expansion), isn't displayed on the store page for the game and you have to manually search for it on Steam.
[/list]

[b][i]The Verdict:[/i][/b]
- [i]Company of Heroes 2[/i] - Still a decent RTS game despite leaning toward the ""live service"" model. It's still possible to get some in-game store items through daily grinding for Supply, though you'll really work for it especially if you're just doing comp-stomp matches solo*. Single-player campaign (both in the main game and [i]Ardennes Assault[/i]) is also pretty good with a decent enough story and worth a replay once you master the strengths and weaknesses of various units in skirmish. Definitely love the game's modding community as well, from mods that overhaul some of the base game's mechanics/limits, to amusing custom faceplates of military moe anime characters (though only in custom games).

However, this game could have been a damn lot better (and get a better score) if the devs made the CPU teammate AI more responsive, improved the variety of ping buttons in the UI, and gave modders the full set of developer tools to make even better mods. (Hell, Relic might even find the newest dev team member from those modders.)

Sadly, it's been seven years (and counting) since the game's release and all that may be left of the game's dev team are a skeleton crew who are more concerned with game balancing, expanding to the mobile game market and auto-censoring swear words in the in-game chat (despite in-game units openly swearing).

Update: [i]Company of Heroes 3[/i] has been released and yet some of the problems in [i]Company of Heroes 2[/i] still have yet to be fixed, especially the ""dumb as bricks"" ally AI in vanilla skirmish games and the ""minimum viable"" mod support (some of those mods being able to improve ally AI behavior even just a bit, if not make the game more fun). Oh, and add that update where you can no longer see a red silhouette of a defensive structure when placed over unsuitable terrain (in order to adjust the facing/orientation as needed).

Alas, it's a great WWII RTS. It's got a lot going for it:
[list]
    [*] good graphics, especially for it's age. 
    [*] It's got mod support (never did manage it personally) and a map builder (I've made a handful).
    [*] Low Requirements (It is from 2013!)
    [*] Not too buggy (I mean, it's got bugs, but they don't completely ruin it)
    [*] Can be hilarious, and can be downright horrifyingly difficult...
    [*] Plenty of vehicles, troops and commander-based bonus units and abilities.
    [*] Seen by many as better than CoH3. I've not played much of the third due to it's pricetag; subject to later update.
[/list]
It does have some downsides, but they're not that bad.
[list]
    [*] You have to buy most of the armies as DLCs.
    [*] There are definitely some bugs.
    [*] Personally I find the AI to be either stupidly easy or stupidly hard.
    [*] There's a troop cap.... smh. (It can be removed by modding) But it does make sense, due it's slightly more microfocused nature.

Also game tries to humanize Fascists and dehumanize Soviets, like wtf, no Soviet would have ever burned a civilian house filled with people, like what the hell?
This is something what Fascists would do to others who they condemn as ''inferior'',
Soviets were Communists not Fascists, I mean if house would have been full of Fascists hiding there then, case is other because those rats don't deserve mercy anyways, after what they did to other nations and sold their own nation and its people to bourgeoisie.

They don't either try to hide their bias towards Fascist Germany in this game and very rarely Soviet Union wins a match in multiplayer, so this game gives you two choices play as bias Fagscists or play underpowered Soviets
Call Fallsmij√§gers and they parachute, but when you call Soviet VDV they just walk from spawn to pointed location casually and get killed, and lets not even talk about IS-2, which was purely made to counter German's Tiger H1 and it also had 122mm gun and yet in game it barely does damage to Tiger or ever hits on it and Tiger is always precise and does alot of damage to IS-2 which had better armor then Tiger H1, like seriously what the actual f*ck, hows this even making any sense?
 
Yet they dare to call this game ''Historically authentic'' this is insulting towards people who likes history, their customers in general and Soviet people who liberated Europe from Fascist scumbags 
Developers of this game are as much as scumbags as Fascists themselves, truly disgusting.

The nearly 500 hours I have at the time of this review should make that clear. The game may not be extremely realistic with infantry being able to survive 5 shots without dying, or Panzer IVs being able to withstand a 7.6cm F-34 cannon from a T-34 with the front armour, but it does place you in the commander's seat fairly well. You need to either pick a doctrine early to catch your enemy off-guard, or wait for them to pick their doctrine allowing you to counter effectively. You need to manage resources of manpower, munitions and fuel to make sure you can replace losses and build up offensive breakthrough forces or defensive fortified forces. You need to know what your army is capable of and what your enemy can use from their army to counter; such as the Soviets being more infantry focused, while the British are more about ""capture and hold"" strategy. The Americans are versatile and the OKW are likewise. The Wehrmacht are arguably also versatile, but in my experience, they are more tank orientated. Doctrines are used to give you an edge in specific fields such as ambush tactics, elite infantry, heavy tanks and artillery. The doctrine you pick can either hyper-focus on what your army is already capable of (e.g. Soviets with elite Guards infantry), or it can be used to fill gaps in where your army lacks (e.g. Soviets with IS-2s and T-34/85s). The community has also made some great mods with my personally picks being the Wikinger mod and the Spearhead mod. These mods aim to make the game more immersive and realistic.

Overall, I like this somewhat old RTS. The CoH series is one of my favourite series ever, and this game may just be my favourite of the three current CoH games. Even with all of this said, do keep this in mind:

I would only fault this game for having certain factions/content locked behind a lot of DLC but compared to the garbage cash-grab that is CO3, its practically a blessing Relic only went that low. 

The style of the factions is demonstrated through a great variety of units whose hammy dialogue and diverse weapons define their role in combat. In the base game, you get the Wehrmacht and the Soviets, who play pretty much how you'd expect. While the Germans outclass the soviets in quality, a good player who keeps their veterans alive and knows how to flank can turn the tide and create a completely unstoppable juggernaut, a play style very reminiscent of the actual historical events. 

Overall the campaign is pretty good.  Apparently Russians got really salty when this game came out for depicting a Soviet protagonist who was morally disillusioned because he was... serving under a vicious totalitarian regime? Really my only issue with the campaign is that the Germans seem to be remarkably absent (aside from an offhand mention of Majdanek) from being depicted of doing the whole war crimes thing while the Soviets (accurately) commit plenty. I guess Relic didn't want to offend their German audience or something.

the vehicle AI is BY FAR the worst ive ever seen. always turning the long way, pointing the rear towards the enemy, missing more than a drunk russian playing WOT.

optimization and DLCs leave a lot to be desired regarding content and playtesting/debugging (especially ardennes assault which is buggy as hell)

I think it's ok to buy cosmetics as a way to support the developers (and oh boy, there ARE cosmetics), keep in mind however that camos are applied to a ""class"" of vehicles and not all of them, for example the ""heavy"" class which includes tanks and it leaves out the light class (scout vehicles and such) which is ok if you want to use a different set for those

Want to make money on the Chinese, but do not value the Chinese, Chinese MOD can not be installed, Chinese patches can not be used. I can read your foreign language, but I do it for the Chinese market!
In the Second World War, the Soviet Union sacrificed an entire generation to resist German fascism. Coming to You is an insult, ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•! It‚Äôs bad reviews for the men who died fighting for Souder!
In the Second World War, the cost of the Chinese battlefield was comparable to that of the Soviet-german battlefield. Otherwise, Japan and Germany could have successfully joined forces. Players do not ask you to join the Chinese Camp, then you do a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• Chinese? Between being a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and not wanting to do real work, what are you doing with your mother‚Äôs game? Or for us to give bad reviews!
I would advise all the surrounding players to change to bad reviews! It‚Äôs not because the game sucks, it‚Äôs because you guys suck!
By the way, let me add something. Your Country, Poland, is feuding with the Soviet Union, but your country, Poland, is in favor of the full scale invasion of China by the Japanese militarism and takes it for granted without reservation!
The capitalist country you are kneeling for did not enter France until 1944 to wage the so-called ‚ÄúJust war‚Äù, while the Soviets and the Chinese never took a step back! Death to life! ! ‚ÄúHero company‚Äùthis game, should sing the praises of those inspiring soldiers, and you turned it into a plate of smelly pork!

Not everything in WW II, if you are lovers of history, was Saving Private Ryan or Enemy at the Gates or Dunkirk. There were a huge variety and diversity of uniforms. In some occasions during the war, the infantry did not carry their bagpacks, sometimes they did. Tanks also used camouflage. Which they did not have in the game but still it was so nice.
                       Order 227 was there for Stalingrad and the scenery was realistic. Some of them did not even get weapons and millions of them died. But only a small part of them were shot during retreat by their commissars. The sniper mission was my favourite. So much better than Call of Duty 2. And the shooting of another people caused much controversy. 
    V The US, British and Soviet and German armies were equally strong. You need to have the right mix, right units, right strategy, right combat cover and right adaptation of environment. Germans had the best tanks such as Pz . III, IV, V, VI and Tigers I and II (Konigstiger) along with destroyers like Jagdpanther and Jagdtiger, but they were matched by the others. In late phase, the Pershing, advanced Shermans  and T-34s, Churchill, KV 1 and 2,  Comet, Cruiser and Matilda along with IS 2 bested the German ones. 
                The variety of infantry - Riflemen, Rangers, Volks, Obers, Conscripts, Engineers, Pioneers, Medics, Grens, Pgrens, Sturmpioneers, 88s were real units in WW 2. The Air Support, Medics, Ambulance, Heal, Camouflage, Different abilities along with maps are also a great work by the developer.Thanks to Relic for staying true to the core of WW 2 without much deviation.

slightly p2w as commanders and intel bulletins locked behind the worst currency ever(or you can just pay irl money)
overall wait for it to go on sale and buy everything  its not worth the money to buy all dlcs normally
ok ive played 100 hours more and its a good game with lots of replayabillity(much thanks to mods) but it really does kill your time
453 hours now: kind of want my time back. ai has become much easier and i basically only play against hard/experts(11/13/22)
1200+ hrs now send help im consistently spending 70hrs/2week on this stupid game
also i completely understand why relic gives this game away very often ive spent probably a hundred dollars on commanders and skins their main profit is the additional content not the game itself, currency grinding really doesnt suck after you have basically all the intel bulletins for a faction i get supply like 93% of the usf loot i get(6/13/23)

1400hrs now
no longer addicted(yay!), still a fun game. I think that its quite nice that I am still far from being good and theres much to improve on, after 1467.5hrs of playtime. Highly recommend this game if you have money and time to waste, but I would still recommend if you've just got time to waste. You can grind the commanders, it takes around a week, if you max out points every single day(easily done w cheatcommands mod, takes maybe 1hr of partial afk).

German armor gets spammed to a certain point where it's entirely impossible to break their defense. Certain German tanks such as the KonigsTiger which can really cost an allied victory. None of the Allied heavy tanks can really counter it pragmatically, because it's always supported with something else. German tanks in general are tough nuts to crack, because any of its counter parts on the opposite team just don't come to par Allied/Soviet. Especially the Soviets not really having anything to counter the German Tank spam. 

Most of the Soviet Commander abilities don't mean jack lickity squat. Because due to the flares on the ground, the German players see them, and they simply pull their tanks backwards. And once the Soviet air raid is over, they push them back into the same place. The Soviet Tank destroyers can't really punch a hole against the spam, because they're range, accuracy, damage isn't on par with the German and easily are taken out. So, it gets to the point where almost every game end in a German victory because of the tank spam. This is the main issue with the game, is that German players can exploit this in-game bias and win every match easily. The only time, Germans ever lose is if the players on the German side are simply not as good skillfully as the Allied/Soviet players. But once the German side are aware of the bias and tank spam exploit, they instantly win the game. Which can really taint the experience. 

The Story mode is great, and the Theater of War is fun. For an older game, it's still a lot of fun to play. I've sank over 200+ hours into it. Just be aware before you buy, that the game can get really frustrating really quickly, especially when the opposite side abuses tank spam exploit. Artillery spam exploit can be really difficult to counter too. The game is a great arcade strategy game, but like I said can be really frustrating so make sure to look up some Youtube Soviet/German Builds before going into the multiplayer.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

They do not understand how to play as a team; they dont understand when you try to flank for the other side is a desperate try to win because play with the one on your side simply cannt win; they all like brain washed by main stream medias that spread hates all cross the chat; they dont understand what MakoCelo is(an app that allows you to read all other players' rank before match starts), hence they do not understand that some matches are not meant to win from the start, 3 rank 8 vs 4 rank 15 you tell me; they do not understand cap points before fuel so that they connects with your base and you get resources, one point's outcome is approximately equals to a fuel/ammo point, so capping fuel and neglecting other points is stupid. And if any thing went south, their first reaction is complaining you being a noob rather than they being too aggressive and cost their units or they simply suck at their playing skills. The moment that you made most of these western players know that you are a Chinese/Asian, they begin to be racist.
All these problems can be of course avoid if you play with your friends, and that introduce us to another problem. Playing with verbal chats is far more effective then you typing in chats with strangers expecting them to understand and play with you. These group players do not get an equal match that brings their opponents being like them, because this game just dont have that large population to support that.

Side note: Whenever you open the game make sure to turn the graphics up because for some reason they start really low and look pretty bad. Once you turn them up a little bit it will look very good.",1698609208,1698609208,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Shame CoH3 is what it is. All they had to do was expand this version to do:
- Early WW2: eg OKW Britain France Poland. 2 Blitzkrieg campaigns Poland and France/Belgium/NL
- Pacific: US Japan China
- North Africa but not as a new game with unwelcome features and big price tag

Engine would work really well with WW1 too - territory capture/MGs etc - or even modern warfare - Ukraine trenches come to mind.

The main focus of the campaign(s) is on the Soviets during WW2 and their own history against the Germans but I find (as most do) that online/skirmish is where it's at. You have 5 playable nations/armies some of which have up to twenty two individual commanders so the amount of combination and replay-ability is vast. However some commanders are DLC that need to be purchased separately and the only way to do that is to type ""COH2"" into the Steam Search Bar to see all of the commanders as they do not appear as DLC in the store pages ""content for this game"" which is very odd. 

The main improvements over the first game are as follows:

Proper line of sight - If enemy units are on the other side of a wall/building/tree/bush you can't see them. The POV has to be clear from the perspective of the soliders. I think relic was calling this ""True Sight"" and as such ambushes are now easier to pull off and makes the game feel more realistic and fun overall. 

Population is no longer tied to how many capture points you control. This gives the player with less territory more of a chance to fight back. 

Soliders no longer have to actively ""take"" the control point as an action rather they just have to be standing within its territory giving you the ability to fight back. 

Snow/Blizzzards/Ice - Your vehicles can slow and stall, your tanks can fall through the ice, your soldiers can freeze to death, your line of sight is horrendous. All of this is fun, and all of this introduces many new elements of gameplay. You may have to pullback your soliders and wait out a blizzard or reroute your tank pathing on an ambush. And the great thing is you can turn this on/off at any time and it's highly welcomed. 

Graphically it looks very similar to the first other than the terrain being much improved as a whole this time around. 

Those are the biggest things off the top of my head. COH1 and 2 play mostly the same and as such I think both are phenomenal RTS titles that hold up well to this day.",1698004178,1698004406,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It hates you when you are:

A Russian: BECAUSE
1. the campaign displays them as moraly questionable (would be fine if american campaign would be the same but it isn't.)
2. And weak without general winter fighting for them.

B You are a new Player: BECAUSE
- People will constantly remind  you; play bad, you are a noob or easy game for them.

C: You want to play allied armies in multiplayer: BECAUSE 
- If you search for a game you will see 25 - 40 % players searching to play allies and 60 - 75 % of players searching to play Axis. And this at any given moment you try to play.
This tells you all about the balance in this game!

D:PAK43 placements can be placed behind buildings. They shoot through bildings without destroying it and can't be seen or shot directly. By the way PAK43 is the strongest AT Gun in the game. 

E: German tanks bounce shots 1-3 times before they die. They have a health bar of 0 and still manage to get away because of that. This is tested. The German tank has actually 0 health. You need to shoot it beyond 0 to kill it.

F:The discharge smoke ability on german tanks conceals the tank when it retreats but that smoke doesnt bother other german units. They can see right through it. Allies cant see anything and they dont even have the ability to discharge smoke grenades on their tanks 

G: By contrast, the russian t34 tanks can RAM-Attack a tank. The attacked tank suffers a movement penalty for 3-4 seconds and a little bit damage. The T34 can't move or fire after that attack. Its a sitting duck.

Good things:

+ nice grafics
+ nice sound
+ a view new features over COH 1 (infantry can vault over fences, blizzards in winter, some new units) 

VERDICT:
If you ever got married and you divorce your wife that truely loved you but wasn't perfect and you marry again a woman that looks perfect but hates you, then you know how it feels to play company of heroes one for years then moving on to this one. 

If you get the woman that hates you in the first place. I tell you a secret son.

See here, these things that I play with sometimes have it ingrained in themselves that the only way they can win is if they turtle up all the way, without building one single unit, without ever leaving their base until they unlock tiger tanks or whatever late game tech in the Annihilation game mode while the other dudes in the team soak up all the damage. These kinds of matches last for 2 hours and it's infuriating AF to be a part of.  It's disgusting. It's f***** gross. They killed the fun of this game themselves simply by playing like a disabled grandma in her retirement home. And lola would have been able to grasp the concept that the game gets a whole lot more fun when you're playing the capture points mode instead of being a gaddam gardener in base in annihilation mode camping bridges to prevent the enemy from crossing 2 hours into the game. It's insane I don't know how I put up with it. The worst part is that there is celebration when the match is over after the equivalent of preparing and eating an entire family meal with a cigarette and dessert after. It wasn't fun to play these kinds of matches. But this game is fun if you just stop playing like a lawnmower and actually get to capturing points and getting into the action. wtf. The worst part is that almost every RTS that we play together boils down to this kind of gameplay of waiting on government welfare to bail you out of your shoit teenage year decisions for the next 20 years and then showing up to the friends party where most people have forgotten about your existence, showing up with a bagfull of weed claiming that you ""made it"".  Matches should last below the 40 minute mark I honestly don't know why this happens with them. It is atrocious how these decisions come to a conclusion. The AI is fine, some of the best and fairest in any RTS. HAY.

That said, I'm looking to play COH2 again with anybody because it's a nicely balanced RTS set during WW2 that has community maps, that has multiple fantastic campaigns, that is more complete than COH3 currently and is nicely balanced between all the available factions and units available.

VERDICT:
This game is awesome if you like resource gathering, building units, making strategic choke points. Make sure to pick up the faction DLCs for an enjoyable experience. Tons of maps to enjoy this. It's delivers a solid RTS experience and has tons of replayability. I just wish this had Kangaroo Carrier as they had in COH 1.
Don't forget to check out the fantastic mods the community has made for this.

COH2 is really, really good. The gameplay is intense, refined, and immersive. The sound design is absolutely fantastic, artillery sounds like hellfire, panzerwerfers sound heroic(but less intense from coh1 blitzkrieg) and overall balance is alright. Each of the four factions are unique and have their own playstyle, and have unique quirks and gimmicks that can be used against your opponents. Though, the fact that pretty much all unique and cool commanders are locked and you have to fork over either 3$ per each, and then having to pay even more for the 3 non included factions is peak train simulator DLC bargaining. 

Ignoring the scummy DLC policy, the game itself is amazing. If you do wish to buy it, just wait for a major sale so you can obtain pretty much all the commanders for around 20$ rather than 100$ something extra.

Pay walled commanders and units. (Yes I know you EARN points to buy this stuff but its still scummy)
Theater of War missions are sh*t. Many bugs and unfair disadvantages. They feel like unfinished missions from the main campaign.

As someone who's fairly decent at this game, (in-game ELO is 13 with soviets)

It's really good, it has a few flaws, but it is THE squad based RTS. Every unit is distinct (looking at you total war), the game's built on extreme hard counters, blobs get punished by any decent player. Sound design and visual design is also top notch, not just from immersion perspective, but also so you always know what's going on. Every unit has a distinct icon, and voice actor for example. Micro is everything here, but it's not just a clickfest. In terms of problems, there's close to none, but the servers aren't great, the community is (mostly) a cesspool, and relic won't bother to fix the few bugs left. Other than that, it's really great. I have a few comments on faction design I could make, but I won't.

Add me if you want to play coh, I need more people, I must collect all the time-zones!

9.7/10, game gud, cheap on sale

old review:

OH GOD THE MUSIC IS SO GOOD

With that out of the way...

Visuals: 9/10

The game is almost a decade old at this point, but still looks great. I feel completely immersed, and the Graphics feel perfectly fine. Explosions, animations, etc, all beautiful. The UI is fairly intuitive, and gets the point across well. Units close up, look worse than any modern total war game, but they still look fine. The cutscenes, however show off how pixelated the uniforms are, and take me out of the immersion.

Campaign:

7/10

Story is barely stringed along with very short cutscenes, doesn't feel like anything special. It's decent when you're stuck without internet, but multiplayer is very much superior.

Multiplayer:

10/10

This game defines RTS for a reason. The factions are well balanced. The skill ceiling is high as hell, and it runs really well. Multiplayer is seamless, and the shining point of the game.

Controls:

10/10

Feels nice and comfortable. You'll grasp the controls after the first hour. Nothing feels janky, all smooth.

Music:

ALLTHEDAMNNUMBERS/10

So good, if you don't buy the game, just listen to it on youtube, so emotional and epic. So perfect for this game.

Microtransactions:

5/10

So much stuff you can buy, but so much grind to get them.
You get a drop every 6000k points
Lose = 1500 pts
Win = 2000 pts
You might get a unit perk, or a skin, or 500 supply
You can buy
Commanders, which will let you spawn special units, or use special abilities
Unit Perks
Unit Skins
And other misc stuff
Everything costs extreme amounts of supply, or small amounts of real cash. Prices are fairly reasonable, but microtransactions are still evil...
Even with just stock items, you can still dominate, and store-bought stuff isn't an improvement, just a slightly different playstyle.

Final score:

9/10

Great game. Goes dirt cheap when on sale, pick it up whenever.",1604102891,1694582586,True,1,0,0.520905971527099609,0,True,False,False

Company of Heroes 2 is a fantastic World War II real-time strategy game that has provided me with countless hours of fun, whether I'm battling friends or facing off against AI opponents. It captures the essence of WW2-era warfare remarkably well.

One of the minor drawbacks is the substantial amount of paid content, which can be a bit frustrating. However, in the world of gaming, it's not uncommon to encounter such practices.

Graphically, the game could be improved, but I can't complain too much. Most of the vehicles and units look pretty decent, and the overall visual experience gets the job done.

I was fortunate to grab it when it was free, as I wouldn't necessarily recommend paying the full price. My advice is to wait for a special offer and watch some videos to ensure it's the right game for you.

Overall, I'd rate Company of Heroes 2 a 6.5/10. It's a solid WW2 RTS experience that offers plenty of strategic thrills. And there's something oddly satisfying about surrounding the German army with tanks and watching them crumble, time and time again. :3",1574529000,1694358795,True,0,0,0,1,True,True,False

tho it has some glaring draw backs that make you think ""whats the point of this?""

examples : 
-commanders for DLC company's are not all unlocked. you have to either unlock them through ranks or paying more money. 
-WASD doesn't move the camera. that's for unit actions. (arrow keys are to move the map with out the use of a mouse)
-the little ""upgrades"" you can put on for each company are just not worth it. you dont really notice its benefits either. i.e ""2% increased armour pen with anti tank gun"". and the upgrades that have more than a 5% buff are for things you never use or care about.
-a.i doesnt know how to counter tank traps and barbed wire

A Strategic Gem:
Company of Heroes 2 excels in almost every aspect of a real-time strategy game. Its mechanics are finely tuned, and it provides a genuinely immersive World War II atmosphere. The gameplay is engaging and will satisfy even the most demanding strategy enthusiasts.

Room for Improvement:
Despite its many strengths, Company of Heroes 2 does have a few drawbacks. Additional maps and the introduction of new factions, such as Italy or France, would bring fresh diversity to the game. One noticeable issue is the perceived overpowered nature of Soviet Katyushas, which may require some balancing adjustments.

Overall Enjoyment:
Overall, Company of Heroes 2 offers an exceptional gaming experience that shouldn't be missed by fans of the genre. Its compelling mechanics and captivating historical context make it a must-play for strategy enthusiasts.

In conclusion, Company of Heroes 2 stands out as an outstanding real-time strategy game. While it has a couple of areas that could benefit from refinement, it remains a thrilling and challenging journey through the battlefields of World War II. Whether you're a history buff or a strategy aficionado, this game is well worth your time.

The issues this game does have is the way DLC is sold: Paradox Entertainment would be proud of how much integral content is behind a paywall. If you do not like having to pay the whole game's price again to get to play all factions then maybe wait for a sale.

But I didn't get bang for my buck here. I can't help but compare it to Men of War Assault Squad 2 which had a lot more content without reminding you 'Hey, we have an ingame store. Come buy tank skins'. 

Things I Like: 
+ Visual improvement over the last game. 
+ The same great gameplay as the previous, but with some improvements
+ There are some earnable unlockables but they're kinda shit. Stuff like nameplates and stat boosts and tank skins. 
+ The campaign mode is my favourite. Take territories, get bonuses for your company and keep people alive as to not wear your company to death. Some genuinely fun missions too
+ The workshop mods. New maps. New units. New ways to play. New...ugh tank skins. And achievements aren't disabled using them. 
I recommend Infantry Emphasis mods, the All Units mod (which allows you to get previously bugged achievements because the devs removed certain units ffs), General Utility Game Mode to remove the cheating AI and Zombies. 
 
Things I Dislike: 
- Uninstalling the game opens a tab in your browser for a fucking survey
- Only 2 factions without DLC. 
- I bought the USA DLC to play the campaign and it asked me to pick 3 commanders out of 4 choices. One of those choices was ANOTHER DLC. WTF. 
- That mode I said I like? Only playable as Russia and the USA DLC. They'd rather release microtransaction tank skins than increase the bang for your buck with Faction DLC. And also the first mission is the same everytime, it effects your company's health and it's unskippable. 
- Rank up / XP / Loot drops are throttled because you don't get XP based on units defeated or things built like Starcraft, you only get XP for match finished and wins. So if you're going for XP and unlocks, there's no incentive to play longer or harder games. 
- The AI cheats. You could take all the resource points on the map and they'd still churn two tanks out for no apparent reason. An attempt to make matches against AI more interesting done in the cheapest way possible. I don't want to play against Players. And now I don't want to play AI higher than Easy. 
- The grind for unlocks is a little too much for what you actually unlock imo. You need 3 wins to unlock a random lootbox. Easiest way is to play Easy AI on a custom map 3 times but even putting in that little effort is asking too much. 
- Even now the game still has it's glitches. Physics freaking out. Things not unlocking after a long campaign. 
- Only 40% of people have finished the first main campaign mission. They knew we didn't want to play as the Soviets. So they dropped that USA DLC for the extra $$$
- Can't change keybinds and it uses Arrow Keys instead of WASD like a very early 2000's FPS game lol. 
- Rewards for completing campaigns are abysmal. Guess what it is? TANK SKINS AGAIN",1645984766,1693536454,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have been a fan of the Company of Heroes series since its release in 2006, and I was excited to try out Company of Heroes 2. Unfortunately, COH2 never lived up to the acclaimed original. Despite this, the game still provides plenty of entertainment for strategy and history fans. The story is deep and engaging, and the tactical combat is still enjoyable. The modding community has also created a wealth of content for the game, which adds to the replayability. All in all, Company of Heroes 2 is still a great game, but it is starting to show its age. If you are a fan of the series, then you will still find plenty to enjoy in Company of Heroes 2.

Opening  the game for the first time really lets you internalize just how little the industry actually thinks of you. Its nothing but a commercial. It's like walking out of a Vegas casino for the first time. It's how poor people must feel after giving their only money to Joel Osteen to see him on his very own jet a month later with that giant plastic soulless smile.  Something kin to the sick awful feeling you got in your stomach the moment you realized what's inside Mike Pence is exactly what's on his face.

It has good reviews so maybe I'm just dead wrong? If so, I can take it. Or possibly, people really do need to endlessly be sold crap to momentarily satiate? I really couldn't tell you much about the game. I was too insulted by the almost AMWAY/Alex Jones nutritional supplement sales pitch feel to the scenario purchase options.

Set against the brutal backdrop of World War II, the game combines deep strategic gameplay, engaging storytelling, and impressive visuals to create a memorable experience.

The heart of Company of Heroes 2 lies in its tactical gameplay. Every decision, from unit positioning to resource management, plays a significant role in determining victory or defeat. The game encourages you to think strategically, to take advantage of the terrain, weather, and the unique abilities of your units. This tactical depth keeps the gameplay engaging and rewarding, providing a great challenge for strategy enthusiasts.

Company of Heroes 2 stands out for its realistic portrayal of the harsh conditions of World War II. The weather system, for instance, is not just a cosmetic feature. Severe cold can freeze your troops, blizzards can reduce visibility, and bodies of water can become deadly traps when the ice breaks, adding another layer to the game's strategic depth.

The game's campaign is noteworthy as well. Told from the perspective of the Soviet Red Army, it offers a gripping and sometimes harrowing narrative. The voice acting and cutscenes are of high quality, immersing you in the story and the bleak realities of the Eastern Front.

Visually, Company of Heroes 2 impresses with its detailed environments and unit models. The destructible environments add a dynamic element to battles, and watching a well-planned assault unfold is satisfying. The sound design, too, enhances the overall experience, with the sounds of gunfire, explosions, and soldier chatter contributing to the immersive wartime atmosphere.

However, the game does have a few shortcomings. The AI can sometimes feel unbalanced, with difficulty spikes that might frustrate some players. Furthermore, while the campaign's storytelling is engaging, its portrayal of certain historical events has been a topic of controversy.

The multiplayer mode is a strong point of the game, offering competitive and cooperative gameplay that can keep you engaged for hours. It's here, playing against or with friends, where the game's strategic depth truly shines.

In conclusion, Company of Heroes 2 is a robust and engaging real-time strategy game.

The reason why? I absolutely could not get through the very first few campaign missions without cringing to death.

Company of Heroes 1 told a fairly grounded story, very Saving Private Ryan at times and dramatic for sure but always grounded in actual World War 2 stories.

In 2 they seemed to have hired a writing staff who mysteriously immigrated from Europe to Argentina in the late 40's because boy is it bad. We open with the classic 'the Soviet army had no guns' myth as a soldier tells his superior officer that he has no rifle to use but is told to keep marching or be shot. This is framed by our narrator, a Soviet veteran looking back on his time in the war, grimly describing the famous 'no step back' order 227. Of course like most western descriptions of it, it ignores that this order mainly was focused on OFFICERS to prevent them from surrendering their entire company without approval and was not in fact the evil commissars eager to shoot any private who takes a step backwards.

We then are treated to a montage of literally endless Soviet troops charging machine guns, ordered forward by their evil officers who don't care for their lives at all and too dumb to do anything but mindlessly run into a hail of bullets. This backdrop literally lasts the entire mission, just an endless line of Soviet soldiers charging established machine gun nests as your squad is the only one who seems to know they can go around the static encampments.

Again we get our narrator, so remorseful about the horrors of Soviet war, grimly saying that they went too far, were too cruel, in this battle that ends with a lone, helpless, surrendering nazi soldier getting coldly exicuted by the same evil Soviet officers. The poor guy, really makes you wonder who the real victims in this war were.

Of course you may have a harder time wondering that when you know that the tutorial battle full of 'meaningless death' and Soviet cruelty to the poor innocent nazis was STALINGRAD and these were, you know, literal invading nazis. So to recap, a Soviet soldier laments how mean he and his men were to the INVADING NAZI FORCES AT STALINGRAD, and that's our introduction!

Then mission two had me use flamethrowers to burn Russian civilians inside their homes and fire bombs to set my own Soviet soldiers on fire just to deny the nazis...something? It's not really clear why the people who could just leave their homes or positions before the invading nazi army arrived had to be burned alive horrifically but the Soviet officer who orders it is sure to laugh like a cartoon villain as he orders it.

It was then I decided to refund this game, before I assume mission three would have a prolonged scene where the poor remorseful Soviet veteran looks at the camera and says 'and you know did the holocaust really even happen? Who's to say' or whatever other outright nazi propaganda Relic managed to get in here.",1689915803,1689915803,False,2,0,0.494085311889648438,0,True,False,False

2. The community is toxic. your team would go AFK or drop out if game doesn't go well or if they lose a certain unit. 
3. Unstable servers.
4. Over powered allies, the axis is very weak early and mid game. and most likely end game too. (most devs play as allies)
5. Broken achievements which can't be obtained due to shortsighted updates. 
6. Useless bulletins that doesn't apply to units after shortsighted  updates.

It did away with the base building that I loved so much from the first one. It feels like it took away a lot of my freedom.

Like I said, it found it in my hidden game folder in steam. I only played it for a few hours, but I just couldn't keep playing. Another thing that really annoys me, is that there's only a single campaign for the russians.

The game is terrible.  Anyone who thinks this is anywhere close to an accurate or even reasonable representation of combat in World War II has zero understanding of military history or strategy.  This plays more like a bad Starcraft clone with a WWII skin than an actual war game set in the second world war.  For example, you can often just run a squad past an enemy in cover with few or zero losses, flank them and kill them so everything just descends into ridiculous unrealistic running battles.

The models don't really reflect the appearance of troops or equipment from the period either, looking chunky and far too colourful and frankly there are much older WWII strategy games that more accurately capture the feel and aesthetics of the period.

Multiplayer is also terrible, not a good community and ultimately not very enjoyable.  Poorly thought out game mechanics that manage to be unoriginal and yet also somehow poorly implemented make for a dull experience that does not capture the essence of combat or strategy in World War II anymore than the single player experience does.

Dull, Uninspired and profoundly unrealistic to a ridiculous degree.  The creators of this clearly have zero understanding of the period in which it is set.",1530222999,1689296659,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For the people who are new on RTS or coh franchise and want to start now by coh2, I need to warn that this game is very complicate and has annoying features like an aggressive supply system, stability problem and crash, so, you will need to have a lot of patient and love this game to not give up, also you are late for the party so you will suffer a little with the experienced players.

About the supply drop system, to be short you will need to pass over a lot of useless things like skins and bulletins until you start to get coins often and you will have to accumulate a lot of coins to buy commanders that it‚Äôs the only thing interesting and make some difference in gameplay.

About the stability problem, the game might get unstable after one or a few matches and that increases the probability of crashing, to avoid it you can reset the game after every match and I highly recommend that if you are playing on a laptop. Speaking of laptops the game is not more so light for this devices after the 64 bits update, I have an average laptop and during the 32 bits I played 4v4 without problems, but after that update my laptop suffer in 3v3 on late game and 4v4 run in low frames and in the late game tend to crash.

To finish and be fair this game has well-make features like the combat of the units where the weapon, type of cover, angle of each soldier in the squad make difference, the sounds, the voices and lines of the characters, the environment destruction, the high detail in every infantry and vehicle and every battle is unique making the replayable infinite.",1689101642,1689101642,True,6,0,0.600098490715026855,0,True,False,False

there is a bit of a learning curve to it, since im not used to rts on pc, but the combat and how you have to think, manage units and even react quickly in battle, the game runs smoothly with the exception of the first Russian level, BUT thats due to the HUGE amounts of things happening on screen on it, but allways runs around 60fps on normal matches or most games, the graphics looks appealing, but more colourful then expected

base building is devent as well! albiet bare bones, since its designed to get the bases of COMBAT done

AND THE COMBAT my god is pretty interesting, every unit seems to have something unique to there ai despite being in group, its not like total war or command and conquer, and the interactivity in battles, like picking up mgs, repairing enemy artillery guns, repairing and using there pillboxes. adds a more centralised tactic for combat, so i like the combat alot.",1688752014,1688752014,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

I now have over 1017 hours in game, both solo experimentation across the range of teams and strategies but also co-op and vs. with my brother overseas. Accordingly I am reviewing my review...

I've played solo vs. AI, Online vs. Person (my brother in Australia) He and I have played Team vs. AI single team and Team vs. AI Dual team. I've hit the Campaign trail in the Russian Campaign as the Russians. I have played all nations and both German service branches utilising, throughout it all, different Generals with different tactical specialisations and I have played across a wide range of maps both urban, rural and in between.

The first comment I would make about this game is that if you have ever played any of the Command and Conquer games ( I first played that at the beginning of '96 and my favourite was '99's ""Tiberian Sun"") then you've played this game... and, to be fair, a great many others like this.

Strategically the premise is basic and rather formulaic, no real surprise, you have to survive an initial onslaught ( don't know where they get their stuff so fast) Consolidate your middle game ( just like playing chess) then counter-offensive during the endgame. I have only lost 3 or 4 solo games to the A.I. since figuring that one out and that had as much to do with choice of side as with anything I did, or didn't do during the game.

Game mechanics - 7/10 - The actual ""mechanics"" of the game can't really be faulted though they do seem to be a little stilted in the early game when your A.I. ""opponent"" seems to be able to ""tech up"" and produce the hardware three times faster than you.

Game visuals - 8/10 - This is a very detailed and highly visual game. I read one industry review that described it as being ""visceral"", that is ""Based on deep feeling and emotional reaction rather than reason or thought:"" (Cambridge English dictionary) Ummmm... I think someone just wanted to play with big words, I certainly wouldn't call it that. Beautifully rendered, well presented and highly detailed yes, not er.... visceral.

Game Tech levels - 4/10 - This is my big beef and main criticism I would lay out. The ""Tech Up"" process seems rather clumsy and, in some respects, unnecessary. As with many games of this type the enjoyment factor, overall, is detracted from by having to micromanage funds and resources. Let's face it, field commanders during WW2 didn't have to worry about money, fuel and munitions, that was for the High Command and Supply Corps to worry about (I know all about supply chain, I was in the Army for a while and the key phrase was always ""Hurry up and wait"") I am definitely NOT a fan of ""financial micromanagement"" in wargames.

The other criticism, and the main one that I have for the game, is the ridiculously low ""Population Cap"" that keeps you operating with minimalistic resources throughout the game. This actually frustrates the player more than anything in my opinion. I cut my teeth playing the old SPI tabletop games (pre-computer) and the Camo Workshop/Shrapnel Games ""Steel Panthers"" series from 1995 ( originally on MS-DOS based systems) and the unit availability/reinforcement was determined pre-game start... you went into the game with your pre-selected army group and that is, repair and re-supply options notwithstanding, what you fought out the game with. in short, much more realistic. My advice now is to go to the modding hub and subscribe to a mod that gives you all units. This gives you the ability to up your pop cap anywhere between 125 and ( from memory) 500. There is also a mod that allows for Infantry only with light battlefield support vehicles and artillery. That gets very interesting if you like the whole idea of village street and urban combat scenarios.

Replayability - 6/10 - Once you've played around 60 hours or so the only thing that changes is the scenery, depending on which map you choose. The saving grace here, and I've given it another point, is the availability of game influencing mods through the modding hub.

Overall impression, if you like a beautifully rendered game, highly detailed with big beautiful explosions and injured men crawling away from a battle rather than the reality of what were very often protracted ground combat actions with both air and artillery support then you'll like this game.

My reaction, after more than one thousand seven hgundred hours, and losing count of the battles (although I do have one game going between the OKW and the British forces that's sitting at 7 hours and 29 minutes duration over several days - yes, you can stall the game...!) is that ""It ain't the all, that's all""

Overall average score 7/10

After giving it more of a chance...my opinion, be it ever so humble as always.
Cheers,

Don't waste your money on the third one, just buy this, because it is better than the first, FAAAAR better than the third.

[b]When I played the original Company of Heroes, I had a hard time thinking how a WWII RTS game could look or play so much better than it does. Apparently, so has its developer, Relic, because seven years later, Company of Heroes 2 is strikingly similar. There are, of course, subtle visual improvements and numerous unpredictable gameplay tweaks as the series transitions from the western to the eastern front, but this is very much a new spin on the same game.[/b]

[b]Of course, the original CoH has held up remarkably well (if you haven't played it, you should), so I welcome something that looks and plays like it with open arms, even if it's not necessarily a better version.[/b]

[b]Because it's so similar to the original, Company of Heroes 2 is great for the same reasons. More than most RTS games, CoH is all about using clever tactical positioning to take advantage of cover and exploit weak tank armor. And because armies rarely have more than a dozen units at a time, it's relatively slower-paced and more methodical than a traditional RTS, though there's almost always something going on.[/b]

[b]Its territory-based resource system, now revised to allow you to influence which of the three resources generates a sustained point, allows for a playstyle that is almost entirely focused on tactics. I especially appreciate the ability to win a battle by attacking an enemy where they are not, instead of facing them head on.[/b]",1673065310,1686532269,True,11,0,0.625375092029571533,0,True,False,False

+/- Commanders to choose fun are lacking and not that great
+/- Winter game play is a real pain in the a.ss. The game maps that have this really shows how fast you can die in this very cold heavy weather. If your engineer squad bites the bullet. The rest of the squads are SOL. This game style is hard no matter the difficulty. Not a fan at all. Just go slow and build as close to the last firepit as you can. Not sure why the engineer squad doesn't have heavier clothing. They are doing most of the heavy lifting outside of combat.
^*^
-Ania behind enemy lines mission. What a pain in the a.ss mission. Mostly because you can't call in more back up once some of the squads gets killed.
-Not enough main game missions. Not enough Ardennes Offensive sp missions.
-Not enough zoom out 
-In memory of CoH3
-Control points countdown
-Countdown control points
-That commander you still have to purchase even though you bought Ardennes Offensive. Still a bit sore about this.
-Really not a fan of the in-game shop with it's overpriced items. Oh look all the items in the shop are on sale. Cool, let's check it. Oh my hell. The price is only $180 usd.

Some how Russia has the best armor and infantry selection in the game when they were known for high volume low quality. The game should have been balanced with casualty statistics in mind. T-34 was robust tank for sure, but when you look at their k/d they were rarely greater than 1. Also with a few hundred encounters documented between the T-34 vs the Sherman, the Sherman would win by a wide margin having about 2.5 k/d. Yet T-34 swarms all, accompanied by unstoppable conscripts and elite plebs.

AANNNNDD other times your just getting shit on no matter what you do. I prefer to play the multiplayer because i feel the maps are too large for a one on one's. during my time playing multiplayer getting a good team is kind of like finding a unicorn in the middle of a tornado while balancing a ball on your nose. servers need to be dedicated too continents, too many players mixing together that dont even speak the language is very frustrating. (mostly talking about Japanese players) and when you do get ally's that can communicate most the time they dont know what they are doing. not too say thats their fault due to the lack of a meaningful tutorial and skill based matchmaking in the game. but all that could be overlooked if certain game mechanics were fixed. the biggest one of all being that the Germans are just stacked no matter how you look at. Im not a guy that likes to blame games saying certain things are over powered just so i can justify losing buuuuutttttttttt, the Germans have way to many units that are just way to effective or hard to kill or some of their abilities are straight up too powerful. Like the fragmentation barrage just lasts way to long while also dealing a lot of damage and suppressing infantry, and if you just leave your tanks in the middle it can still do a considerable amount of damage to them. and thats just one ability i dindt even mention the king tiger. iv seen matches where as soon as the Germans got a king tiger there was nothing the allies could do to even keep one point defended. iv seen a king tiger take on 3 american tanks 4 British tanks and a total 3 AT guns and still come out on top. to make a short story both german teams need some reworking in some of their ability and units, not say that playing as german can have its draw backs but most of the time if playing a German team your going to win. other things about the game can make your experience frustrating like constantly waiting for resources to build units or reinforce danged squads just for them to fight for 5 seconds before getting wrecked again even though the have upgraded weaponry and support from mortars and machine guns. which brings in another problem. MORTARS ARE TOO DAMN SLOW!!!!. before a mortar team can even become remotely useful is if they veteran 3 and by that time tanks and and whole hoards of infantry are storming the mortar position because the range on mortars are so close that by the time mortars get rounds down range the target is already on top of them. a complete overhaul of the mortar system is required. in conclusion if you are a hard core RTG player this game is probably for you but it may not but you are new to strategy games to do not play you will be raped.",1656351858,1685587819,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The fact we can make maps and mod maps brings a new realm for the game to experience yet it is kind of weak. The gaming experience is loads different from COH 1 yet the developers are trying to keep this game THEIR game but keeping the community for creating mods and giving players a chance to explore more aspects of the game. I'm on the edge of recommending this game because the NEW War Spoils system limits your game play experience if you are one of those people who don't have hours on top of hours to play this game... Rewards are based on hours committed to playing this game, if you don't have the time to play then don't expect to get anything cool or special... Sooo yes, recommended because of the games potential, and No for those who can't devote their lives to Sega and Relic...


Edit  01/15/2023

This game has it's ups and downs. Without the mod support and community, this game would've died a long time ago.

Nothing really beats COH 1

COH 2 is so-so (okay)

The release of COH 3 I feel is going to be the death of the COH series. I don't think the developers or writers have a clue on how to stick to their roots and instead choose to monetize on vanity items and dlc's for game play.

I don't plan on wasting any money on COH 3 mainly because COH 2 was some what of a let down... I'm certain COH 3 will be a total flop...

I still recommend COH 1 and 2

EDIT 05/31/2023

762 hours later and I'm laughing at the COH 3 Store reviews... To be honest I uninstalled COH 2... Still play COH 1 but thats about it...

 First the game needs your money .Three of Five functions are locked and almost all of the good commanders are behind a pay wall or if you collect the coins . To collect your coins for the cheapest commander you may play over 150 hours .

There is a great imbalance on function power when Axis has 60 % win rate for all the life spam of the  game . The game may be more balanced if you play 1vs1 or 2vs2.

There are many tactics who are no skill ,no fun . Some are blobs of elite units,mass artillery, mortar spam who they hit you every time,mg spam(not that strong but no fun early game) to name a few. Those are more known on 4vs4 matches .

Some of the functions lacks utility and you must buy commanders that can solve the issues that should never  be existed to begin with .

But all that i can forgive . What i cant forgive is that there is no punishment for the droppers ,but may it is impossible to punish someone when the server just drops you so many times and its much more horrible that you cant reconnect (maybe they dont know how to do this or because of the AI bots). There is a AI backup if a dropper exists ,but the AI is useless and gets many bonuses so it may not be 100% garbage.(may the bonuses are the causes of the no reconnect issue dunno). A bot is no match for a average to bad player .  SO if a player drops or he lost connection or the server kicked him or something like that the game is over . I have rank 14 on many functions (20 are the highest) and 1187 hours total . I may have seen 10 wins with bots vs players (you may see more on super low elo) , i mean its only possible if the players dont have a clue of what they are doing .

Anyway . In conclusion the game it can be fun in the right scenario  ,if you play with friends ,if you play 1vs1 and the enemy may not take a overpowered commander (you can still win but the 60% - 40% says a lot) or maybe a 4vs4 that everyone is on your lvl and they dont drop for some reason.

If you thinking to buy it . Dont . coh3 will come and then we will see if its a burning garbage can or a fair game.

I played CoH1 in my childhood and wanted to try the sequel. I primarily play the campaign, and sad to say, I wanted to experience more. You can buy the DLC, but as a person who has little money, its ridiculous how much you need to pay. Commanders are needed to access special units and abilities; there is a lot, and you can buy them individually. the game lets you try different commanders each mission. If you are wondering why the available units change, that's why. It kinda sucks  not being able to use bigger tanks in the next mission, I like things go BOOM!

The base game only contains the Soviet faction for multiplayer, and a soviet campaign.
This would all be fine if they would then create a full campaign and new faction and sell those as DLC. 
Rather, that is not how it works. I bought the Ardennes offensive expansion DLC. This does contain some single player campaign but is a rather a sad cook-off of a single player campaign where they stick a story on multiplayer game modes fought against the AI. And the faction (USA) is not available for multiplayer afterwards. 
The factions for multiplayer are basically sold stand alone as DLC.

You would expect the base game to come at least with 2 or 3 factions.
Now we have to pay a full price for 1/2 to 1/3d of a game and then they will charge us another full for every part we add to this.

Fun gameplay
One of the best soundracks i have ever heard
Great graphics considering this game is from 2013 

the downsides are: If you're playing the online multiplayer expect insults, people leaving the match before it even starts or in the middle of a fight etc...
Also the servers come down every now and then, that might annoy you sometimes

The AI is hard, but hard enough, and again, can be tuned with mods.  I don't really play against or with other players, so, this is just a singleplayer perspective.

-Coop multiplayer 
-2 Army Soviet and German 

It has an standalone base game Soviet and German Army multiplayer and one Soviet campaign single player it is good if you want just two army, great cover always win, and plan your move before attempting to attack 

(My review to Master Collection Bundle) 

-I just find a game like Command and Conquer General zero hour luckily I got it on sale 89%OFF Master Collection Bundle 

Factions
-Soviet faction over power by manpower midgame, Oberkommando West faction always lategame power, Combined bros unit U. S. Force faction earlygame I think its possible to strike down and take a win, Wehrmacht Ostheer faction at the start slowly but surely earlymid this army was lack of man power so learn to think before you move and British Forces faction mid and endgame make an defensive army.

(Missions)
-You can pick any difficulty to Easy Normal and Brutal, always relay in your natural surroundings to make a cover, and the more unit survive in your unit the better.

Pros: 
+ Fun and really challenging to play.
+ Soldier units now CAN jump across barricades and have a better cover system. 
+ Great soundtracks (in overall).
+ Well arranging maps and environments.
+ Several custom maps and other mods in the workshop. 

Cons:
- Only 2 main campaigns, they are quite fewer than the game should have.
- Not quite smart and unreliable AIs. (Still, I think it slightly better than AIs in the first COH)
- This is a personal opinion: Some campaign's missions are way beyond ridiculously hard, even when you play it on a normal difficulty. (Notably the Moscow suburban, Mtsensk and Halbe missions)
- Definitely the worst of all, historical inaccuracies of this game are totally unacceptable.

Here are the lists:

1. There are so many anachronistic uniforms and weapons on both Soviet and Axis faction:
1) Only M43 tunic and M43 wool-padded jacket (Gymnasterka and Telogreika, used since 1943) applied for the most of Red army soldiers. As for the 1941 - Pre 43 missions, they MUST be the M35 tunic and M41 Telogreika.
2) As a writer, Lev Isakovich himself still wearing M35 styled tunic during the last years of war, including Sgt. Pozharsky.
3) All German engineer, machinegunner and mortar units wear the M36 styled tunic since 1941 missions until the end of the game.
4) Panzergrenadier unit with Waffen SS lookalike camo pattern (1944) and sniper with M43 field cap can be seen since 1942's Stalingrad missions.
5) MG42 in 1941 missions (should be MG34). And Gewehr 43 with scope, STG-44, Panzerfaust, Panzerschreck in 1942 - Pre 1943 missions. 

2. Anachronistic and out of the place vehicles, such as: 
1) StuG III Ausf.E, StuG III Ausf.G, T-70, T-34-76 with 1942 model in 1941. (StuG III Ausf.E can be used for Stalingrad missions and further on)
2) StuG III Ausf.G and the long-barreled Panzer IV (possibly Ausf.G) in January 1942.
3) StuG III Ausf.G in Stalingrad during Sep-Oct 1942. (It should be allowed during 1943-45 missions)
4) Tiger I in the Stalingrad Aftermatch mission's cutscene.
5) Sd.Kfz. 251/16 Flammpanzerwagen in 1942 missions.
6) From all above, here are vehicles for 1941-42 missions that should be added or replaced the anachronistic ones: Either T-26 or BT-7, T-26 flame tank (optional), KV-1 (from Halbe), Panzer III Ausf.G, StuG III Ausf.B, Panzer IV Ausf.F (short-barrel).

3. Population cap are way beyond ridiculously FEW for the Red army, especially in 1944-1945 missions. It caused too much trouble and really unrealistic yet anti climatic for Halbe and Berlin missions.

4. Lack of variations and wrong appearances among Soviet and Axis soldiers units, notably the Axis units.
1) Every grenadiers (regular soldiers, should be called as infanteries during 1941 - Pre 42 missions) are wearing full Wehrmacht camo uniforms. They should just wear a normal tunic: mainly M40 styles, and optionally M43 for 1944-45 missions.  
They also worn a strange uniform during the winter missions (should be proper greatcoats, same for machinegunner and pioneer).
2) Some of Red army soldiers should worn a greatcoat (could be M41 Shinel), it can be used on some of non-winter missions like the Stalingrad and Halbe-Berlin also.
3) Lack of variations on both uniforms and helmets for the Red army and Axis soldier units, including winter uniforms.
4) Osttruppen troop uniform looks too good, especially during the winter missions. (They should have worn a greatcoat)
5) Here are some of examples of additional troops for German/Axis side: 
5.1) Wehrmacht Panzergrenadier and Stormtrooper dressed with proper Wehrmacht splinter, tan and water patterns for their smocks and helmet covers. Recommend for 1944-45 missions. While in 1942 missions, only helmet covers with camo + regular tunics could be applied.
5.2) Waffen SS units: Grenadier, Machinegunner, Pak 40 crews, Officer, Panzergrenadier and Stormtrooper. All with Dot 44 tunic/trouser variants (full and half-body). Also Oak leaf or Plane tree smock. Better equipment and more dangerous than Wehrmacht units. Highly recommend for Behind Enemy Lines, Halbe, and Berlin.
5.3) Volksstrum unit - could be dressed with great coat and civilian uniform + arm band, recommend for 1945 missions.
5.4) (optional) Fallschirmjager - Appear in a few number in the Battle of Berlin mission.
5.5) (optional) Kriegsmarine (navy) - Appear in a few number in the Konigsplatz and Reichstag section.
5.6) (optional) Hitlerjugend - Teenage Panzerfausters for Halbe and Berlin.  

5. TOO MANY Osttruppen in the campaign, especially the intro mission (Stalingrad, regular German units should be spearhead troops for the attack) and the Berlin mission.

6. The Shock troopers should have the ability to use DP-27 and PPS-43 (the latter one is for 1944-45 based missions).

7. Only American lend-lease vehicles available as a scout car (M3A1) and anti aircraft vehicle (M5/M17). Here is some soviet vehicles I could recommended to fill the gap:
1) BA-20, a light armored vehicle for 1941-42 missions.
2) BA-64, a light armored/scout car since 1944 missions until the end of war.
3) T-27 (optional), a tankette for 1941-42 missions.   
4) ZiS-42 motorized 25 mm (optional), an anti-aircraft gun for 1942-43 missions.

8. Although they put some of the lend-lease vehicles in the game, but for some reason, there is no M4A2 Sherman available in the game at all (1944-45 missions, could be equipped with 76mm gun). 

9. Winter storm resistance of the Red army should be better than the Axis.

10. No other 88mm flak for Axis faction apart from Pak 43, the recommend one is Flak 36/37. 

11. KV-1 appeared only in Halbe mission. It should appear in other missions also (1941-42).

12. Ostwind Flakpanzer is actually a RARE vehicle (41-45 of them ever produced).

13. In the Berlin mission, the Kroll opera house will become a next target after the Ministry of Interior building. But in reality, it was attacked after 150th rifle division rush into the Konigsplatz first, but then got counter-attacked by defenders from both Reichstag and Kroll opera building. Also, judge from real photos and plans, the building is totally unrealistic.

14. From above, a date should be changed from April 29th into 30th after the Red army took the Ministry of Interior building, Pak 43 positions in Konigsplatz should be replaced by 88mm Flak 37 guns, Katyusha need to be usable, and at least 1 or both Tiger I tanks should be replaced by King Tiger.

15. Although the Berlin scenario and environment are great in overall. Still, they missed the BRANDENBURG GATE. It should be located in the far background, South-Eastern side from the Reichstag building. 

16. By all of his actions throughout the war, Sgt. Pozharsky should gained the ranks as Lt. or Capt. in the Behind Enemy Lines mission. And soldiers who guard him should be the NKVD troops (change uniforms).

17. In the latter-half of Stalingrad Aftermath cutscenes, besides from Yuri, there should be other soldiers and engineers appear in the scenes also.

18. Although the Red army are so well known for its (plenty of) ""bad reputations"", especially in term of cruelty among their own troops, POW, and those who didn't share the same ideology with them. But still, some points in the storyline are inaccurated, over-exaggerated, and seems to be too HOLLYWOOD. For example; Most part of the intro mission (Stalingrad) and how that fanatic Major threats your soldiers in the Stalingrad Aftermath mission.

In conclusion: 6/10 
It might be a fun RTS to play. But if you're here to play something that really resembles to WW2, I'd recommend you guys to play just Multiplayer with mods and Ardennes campaign (more acceptable).

This game is an excellent RTS, specially in the sense that it removes most macro-level management, which I greatly dislike from other RTSs. In CoH there's no grand economy to balance, a dozen different buildings to make, nor workers to send get minerals. You win resources and the game by holding ground, ""capture points"", pushing all the focus into the firefights, which are amazing in both gameplay and feel.

On top of that, the visuals and audio of the game is incredible, both in the music as well as the SFXs. I didn't really appreciate how [b]good[/b] everything looks and sounds until I played the recently released CoH3, which greatly fails on those departments. Explosions and hits have punch, and that makes them both spectacular and easily noticeable, which is great to be accurately informed of the state of the battlefield in the middle of all that chaos. It is not ""realistic"", it's better than that.

The campaign doesn't fall short either, with varied missions involving the Red Army and a story that is not breathtaking, but not forgettable either.

All in all, the game has been steadily improving for a decade, and is now in a very commendable state, albeit with some problems, it's not perfect. CoH3 shows promise, but until it gets the level of polish it deserves, I'll enjoy this game for as long as I can.",1553888363,1681065122,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

you can pick it up for really cheap on sale, and it remains a top tier rts. 

the graphics, environment, balancing, different units and teams, and the fluidity and variety of the doctrinal system makes for a really great experience. the teams are similar enough to be roughly balanced but different enough to feel like unique experiences, especially with different commanders assigned.

the audio in this game is stellar too, whether it be the orchestral music in the background or the ambient conversations between the grunts on the ground. gunfire and explosions and tank engines are all awesomely loud and immersive as they should be.

game is also very responsive, sadly unlike dawn of war 2. tanks still turn like tanks, but for the most part everything responds and controls well, and the ui is smooth.

Update: Upon returning to the game after many years, and after replaying the original campaign as well as the expansion pack, Steam offered me to revise my review. 

My opinion has not changed.

There are over 80 DLC options available for this game now. Granted you can eventually purchase some of these things, like the commanders and skins, with in-game currency upon completing online battles, but the fact remains that they have opted to monetize this game to a ridiculous extent.

Furthermore, I acquired the Ardennes Assault expansion pack, but I was greeted with the commander selection screen where it asked me to choose three of the four commanders to bring into the campaign. I was astonished to find that one of the commanders (Fox company Rangers) is locked behind a paywall which you can purchase separately for $5.00. When you purchase the expansion pack, it does NOT come with the US army or the Oberkommando army to play in online multiplayer mode or in offline skirmish mode (unlike the Opposing Fronts expansion pack from the first CoH, which came with TWO stand-alone campaigns and two additional armies for the price of $30). You have to purchase those two armies separately.

Even the DLC has DLC.

This game is not bad by any means. There is plenty of constructive criticism regarding balancing, game mechanics and design choices that can be openly debated, but I did actually enjoy playing through the game again. The micro-transactions and DLC in this game is insane and I can't wait to see how it's going to look like inCompany of Heroes 3, especially since they just released the official store for it in the last update...

Of these, Coh2 can be most readily compared to the latter, apart from Coh1 of course, with territories on the map (points) needing to be captured to bring in resources, victory points or in some cases simply to link-up territories to allow hard-won resources to flow back. Cover and line-of-sight mechanics will rule your engagements and, as your army grows, keeping on top of multiple engagements will test even the most hardened veteran. With a limited population cap, what to build when and how much of it to build becomes a very delicate balance. Adding to this dilemma is one's choice of a commander doctrine which will give the player access to various unique abilities or units, all of which vary in usefulness, cost and stage at which it will unlock (represented by command points which increase during the course of the game). 
Almost ten years after release the graphics still hold up wonderfully well with a real level of detail going into the units and animation in particular. It is important to remember however that no matter how cool your units and tanks look they need to be positioned and controlled properly to be genuinely effective, having the biggest tank is not necessarily going to win you the game by itself.
The maps are also nicely varied from sun-soaked pastures to bleak snowy grey bombed-out cities and fairly dynamic in terms of being altered during the course of the conflict as tanks and shells start to become more prevalent.    
I must note that while I did play through the entire single-player campaign I can't really recommend it apart from learning the absolute basic mechanics of the game. While the online/skirmish, which I unreservedly recommend, side of things has seen regular updates and balancing between the factions has been fine-tuned, the original campaign has been left in 2014 where the obsession with cold weather (albeit understandable) makes the experience more than a little frustrating.
I really felt I owed this game a review after it has given me so much joy and consumed so much of my time.
Not sure if this is allowed but also to thank the community - particularly AECOH who organises events like Master League and all who showcase their skills

I was a young teenager when this game came out and I loved it. I thought the campaign was meh but the multiplayer was great and definitely worth the 60$. I recommend playing this game with friends as you will enjoy the game more that way. I found every unit to be unique in its abilities and strategies. When the announcement came that they were going to add the US faction and the Oberkommando West faction I was hyped. When i got the two new factions I was not disappointed by them as their units were just as unique as the beginning factions' units. The same story goes with the British faction. 

My issues with the game began when I noticed the price tags on everything. At first there was a ranking system that would reward you with a commander or bulletine when you reached a certain rank. But after a while everything was put into either a dlc or an RNG ""war spoils"" system. I was annoyed by this as I didn't want to pay money into a game I already paid 60$ for, but I did to get some good commanders that I still use today. I was fine with paying for the new factions because they were expansions on the original game, but I could't say the same for the commanders as some of those commanders recycled old abilities from several commanders into one commander and maybe added one or two new abilitiesand then placed a price tag on it (This is more for the USSR and the Wehr than the USA and the OKW). Despite all this I still loved the game as I really enjoyed that the developers tried to balance their game based off of some advice from the community as it showed they really cared about the game. But what I began to notice was that with some of these balances ruined some commanders. A big example of this was the Rifle Company from the US faction, I loved the Rifle Company as you can  risk spending more money and waiting longer to get veteran riflemen, and you can equip those riflemen with a flamethrower, and you could save your fuel to get the Sherman Easy Eight without going for the Major. But after a balance update over a year ago, they took away the veteran riflemen ability, they allowed the flame thrower for the weaker Rear Echelon (I hope I spelled that correctly) troops instead of the Riflemen, and they made the Sherman only accessible by unlocking the Major. This ruined the company for me and this is just one example of this. 

Another issue I had with this game was allowing community made mods within the game. At first I was fine with it, I tend to not use community made mods but I know that others do so I was fine with them. But after a while when you tried to make a game it was much harder as there are many cases of being unable to start a custom made match because, ""The game cannot start because <insert name here> within the match has one or two mods that one or more people have not downloaded"" (this is not the exact wording but I understand the message as this). With the addition of the community mods I enjoyed some well made maps and unique mods, i.e. infantry only or tank only battles ect. But I also found a lot of animated girls for skins and backgrounds and I found these to break the immersion of a World War II game when there are animated girls with big boobs thrown into the game. Before you say it, yes I understand that this is just my opinion but this is a reason why I prefer Company of Heroes over Company of Heroes 2. This may or may not be relevant but now it takes a long time to make a custom game so it is faster to find an automatch game, I enjoy automatch but I really like the annihilation victory condition and I enjoy a change in gameplay from time to time.

A final issue, as this review is getting long, is that in the developers trying to balance the game, they have constantly changed the abilities of several units and commanders in the process. I have already discussed the change and commanders so I will describe an example of a unit. I want to talk about the OKW's VolksGenedier unit (probably spelled it wrong), when they were first added to the game they were equipped with Kar98s and their abilities were salvage wrecks and to throw a grenade for a certain cost in munitions, they were able to be upgraded with Panzershrecks and cold gear for the winter maps. After a while I noticed that they switched the grenade to an incendiary grenade, added a panzerfaust, and they replaced the Panzershreck with MP44s. I guess they did this because there were complaints of Volks spam with Shrecks and they wanted to fix that, but they gave the Panzershrecks to the Strumpioneers and now I have seen Strumpioneer spamming. So I do not know what that solved. I also didn't like the MP44 upgrade for the Volks as I viewed that they excel at long range. I would often pair them with Sturmpioneers in a combination tactic but with the new upgrade that is not required as the Sturmpioneers are now designed as tank destroyers instead of shock troops while the Volks are now an anti-infantry only squad with a panzerfaust to fight tanks. After this I noticed that the incendiary grenade for the Volks is timed before detonation instead of instant detonation which makes it useless for killing infantry as they can move out of the way before detonation. To compare this to another unit the Conscript squad of the USSR has never had its abilities changed and the upgrades had stayed consistent to today.

Summary: I really love this game and I want to play it but due to what I wrote about and other reasons I cannot say I would recommend it. I thank you for reading this review and I hope it has helped you decide whether to get this game or not. If you buy this game, I wish you luck and I hope you enjoy it as much as I have because it is a great game. 

Edit: I removed my disclaimer as they are doing more and more of what I have talked about. It is no longer my opinion when they change things for the sake of balance, and ruin strategies and units in the process.

March 28th, 2023. For those unaware, Steam has had a glitch occur where it states I made my review with 3K hours and added 2K more hours afterwards. If you read the comments, you will find this is not the case. 

Now that that housekeeping is out of the way. I intend to change my THUMBS DOWN to a THUMBS UP as COH3 is a disaster and the recent update is a store system that is worse than this game had before with the in game credit system. My complaints are still prevalent and the population of this game is down since my review. However, this is a greater (and cheaper) version of COH3 so I would recommend getting this game instead of COH3. I wish there was a choice of a mixed thumbs sideways, but alas there is not.

In conclusion, this game has been fleshed out with 5 factions with all cosmetics, commanders, intelligence bulletins, victory strikes, decals, etc for free with an in game credit system that rewards you for playing. If you have the time, you can get it without spending extra money (except the three add-on factions USA, OKW, and UKF however). I would recommend this game over COH3 any day.

*Apparently I cannot change the recommendation of this game without resetting the community response, so I will have to leave it as a NO, but I want a YES!!!",1530127969,1680060080,False,147,16,0.77226334810256958,16,True,False,False

However, as the COH3 came and many players migrated there, the remaining people on the game are hardcore players. So consider this when playing multiplayer and don't get shocked by how are the game is. It is not hard, they spent thousands of hours getting gud. 
Also, the backbone of the game is its multiplayer and the single player campaign due to many patches to multiplayer is now bugged. However, It is less severe for the Soviet campaign.

Unique mechanics, very diverse rosters of units that give you tons of room for different playstyles. The singleplayer experience is prime. The campaign is solid and engaging, if not a bit short. If you played COH 1 its not as good, but still good. The Ardennes Assault campaign DLC is worth it if you're getting the bundle on sale, but otherwise you can skip it (not amazing, but worth a playthrough). 

AI in the game is good enough, but what really pushed the SP skirmish experience to its peak is the mods. There are mods that tweak AI and add/modify tons of units. There are a plethora of community made maps that are amazing. The replayability is prime.

The multiplayer at this point is probably not worth your time. Its ok, but the MM isnt great, theres no rejoin feature if someone crashes, and the metas are pretty stale. It is still active though, and I have no problem finding matches in NA region.

Company of Heroes is a pretty damn successful and influential RTS series, introducing revolutionary new squad and cover systems, and a really cool balance between fun abstractness and that explosive intense realism. CoH1 while rather outdated on technical side, being a 2007 game, still shined with cool campaigns, a still existing modding scene, and feeling dignified. It's successor, Company of Heroes 2, in the meantime, has some issues.

Big focus on monetization in the version the game currently is. Apart from cosmetics (could be nice but limited in historic-ish game), some minor bonuses, there's some allegedly underwhelming mission packs that don't grip in either description nor footage, and a lot of content can be grinded trough some opaque random drops. It's demeaning, though I guess it's impressive how devs managed to pivot trough MULTIPLE monetization schemes with this one. One sad bit of monetization is that commanders, the selected special ability and improvement giving choices here are aplenty but majority are paywalled. Even factions are sold individually, this ain't the expansions of CoH1, everything comes piece by piece.

Another bit? It's somewhat low-energy. It's fun with friends, like three vs three or four vs four, getting intense then, but 1vs1 or in singlepalyer the slower comparing to original pace, and it used to be even moreso with stuff like cold mechanics making your troops sit out storms and cling to safe spots, which can only be spoted in campaign or turned on optionally now. The stories too lack the energy of CoH1, even at the time of writing hated on CoH3 has, from playtest I tried, a more enticing pace, all while maintaining depth.

I can't even name that many mechanics in this one I would a definitive improvement on original formula. A lot of new units and faction-based systems are neat and fun but not that distinct. Not to mention the mechanics and some units got tossed around and discarded, like the Soviet conscript upgrade system, showing this design conservatism where devs would rather retread on old ground than try to maintain a level of novelty. Even features I liked, like the commander selection, are somehow flawed like tied to monetization too hard. There are mods, but you can't add much new content beyond images like icons for units and abilities, so while you can tweak factions and units, they'll still look the same.

I can play and enjoy this with friends, at least a few, but playing by myself I feel bored and disinterested soon enough. It's an ""ok"" sequel that doesn't ruin series but it doesn't muster excitement either.",1678921044,1678921044,False,3,0,0.534104287624359131,0,True,False,False

The game is a tactical RTS game based in WW2, there are two playable base factions. The Wehrmact (Germans) and the Soviets (Russians). These two factions have many units, all with tons of unique voice lines and cool mechanics.
The game despite it's age look remarkably well on the medium and higher graphics, as well as running quite nicely. The visuals of the game really immerse you into the setting, it makes you feel like a general commanding soldiers on a battlefield.
I mostly play multiplayer with friends but there is a pretty good single-player Soviet campaign which comes with the game. I have not finished the campaign, nor even got half-way through, but from what I have seen and played it is a fun campaign with a decent story and well animated cut-scenes.
Not everything about this game is perfect though, the monitization is a crime.

Pros - 

Friends, Stupid but fun Mods. Like an Orbital Drop Shock Panther.

What? You expected something here?

*Cricket sounds*

Cons - 

The community that was dedicated is no more,Every single fucking person you come across is either some cancerous bonafide asshole that yells at you for every single thing you do at every minute meanwhile being unable to hold their own side of the map.

Every single fucking unit is either incredibly over fucking powered or hilariously fucking underpowered because when you have a unit that has the ability to use anti-tank grenades or something that can take out an armored unit, it reverses faster then it goes FORWARD.

And because of the community that constantly complained that this is overpowered or this is underpowered they have essentially ruined what was left of the balance and basically all you need to do is spam one single fucking unit and you will win meanwhile actual tactics dont fucking apply anymore to this game.

Sure, the graphics may not be as cutting-edge as some of the newer games on the market, but they still hold up remarkably well. And the gameplay is just as engaging and challenging as it was a decade ago. The attention to detail in the sound design and historical accuracy of the game's story is still impressive, even by today's standards.

In some ways, the fact that Company of Heroes 2 is ten years old actually adds to its appeal. For fans of classic real-time strategy games, this is a must-play title that stands the test of time. And for younger players who may have missed out on the game's initial release, it's an opportunity to experience a classic game that helped shape the genre.

Overall, if you're a fan of real-time strategy games or World War II history, you owe it to yourself to check out Company of Heroes 2, even if it is already ten years old.

First of all, the best WW2 RTS I have ever played, maybe even best RTS in general ( this or SC2 imo ). Company of Heroes was one of the reasons why I started to get really into WW2 history as well as have a knack for tanks. Everything about this game, even the bad, make it a near perfect game. I'd recommend this to anyone who has played a RTS or even wants to get into the genre. Every faction is made uniquely to perfection and having such a large modding community makes the game even better. Albeit, you can't really get the full experience from just the base game, modding and owning all factions is a must but they usually go on a cheap sale. The Soviets show strength in numbers yet lack longevity in units, the Wehrmact have a slow yet steady pacing in their defensive army but can pack a punch mid-late game, the US excel in generalized tanks and infantry with a decent early game, the UK ( can ) have the strongest defensive army out of all 5 factions and the Oberkommando West are the best defense with an incredibly scary German offence. This is at least how I have seen and played each faction, all of which have their own play style and with each game sometimes I learn something new while playing. I hope that in CoH3 they really learn where they went well and where they need improvement as many things from this game I felt ""this is good but if they had this it'd be perfect."" All in all, fantastic game and even as it's definitely aged well ( still has bugs and isn't optimized for multi-core performance ) I will still most likely come back to it every now and then.",1677752681,1677752681,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Want to make money on the Chinese, but do not value the Chinese, Chinese MOD can not be installed, Chinese patches can not be used. I can read your foreign language, but I do it for the Chinese market!
In the Second World War, the Soviet Union sacrificed an entire generation to resist German fascism. Coming to You is an insult, ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•! It‚Äôs bad reviews for the men who died fighting for Souder!
In the Second World War, the cost of the Chinese battlefield was comparable to that of the Soviet-german battlefield. Otherwise, Japan and Germany could have successfully joined forces. Players do not ask you to join the Chinese Camp, then you do a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• Chinese? Between being a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and not wanting to do real work, what are you doing with your mother‚Äôs game? Or for us to give bad reviews!
I would advise all the surrounding players to change to bad reviews! It‚Äôs not because the game sucks, it‚Äôs because you guys suck!
By the way, let me add something. Your Country, Poland, is feuding with the Soviet Union, but your country, Poland, is in favor of the full scale invasion of China by the Japanese militarism and takes it for granted without reservation!
The capitalist country you are kneeling for did not enter France until 1944 to wage the so-called ‚ÄúJust war‚Äù, while the Soviets and the Chinese never took a step back! Death to life! ! ‚ÄúHero company‚Äùthis game, should sing the praises of those inspiring soldiers, and you turned it into a plate of smelly pork!

But the way this game create frustration is... kind of cheating:  it made the control of units either lagging or simply not responsive.   Machine gun unit doesn't really attack even when you use ""attack move,""  anti-tank gun doesn't fire even though it's facing the tank,  and worse of all,  armor units, instead of attack, often just moving toward the unit you are targeting instead of firing upon it.

This lack of responsiveness is kind of random and it's often per game basis:  in some game, the unit's response is fine, in some other game, it's extremely lagging to a point that it is infuriating.   

This problem has been around since the inception of the game,  and the fact that developers made no attempt to fix the responsiveness of controls made me concluded that it is a deliberate design.

So, yes, the game is kind of ""fun"" because it is frustrating.  But the way it creates frustration is kind of cheating and should not be encouraged.

I've heard a great deal of many terrible things about this game, but as I and my friend found, together for the most part, Sega and the like have gone to some extent to ensure that the game receives it's just deserve. Combat was better balanced, vehicles removed and added, and new factions available for... 'reasonable' fees. I find myself liking the game more and more now, and I am often hard pressed to ignore an invitation to play it, as its fantastic replay value and near constant rewards have enthralled me in a way that I haven't felt since I played the first one. There is a bit of a learning curve, and exceptional player like to develop complicated and advanced tactics, but there's nothing like steamrolling through the enemy lines with a Kingtiger and Jagdtiger spearheading your assault.

Horrible in my opinion compared to number 1. No base building? What the heck? I bought this game and I regreted the moment I decided to do so. Company of Heroes 1 is legendary, this is more like a naked version of 1. Took away some of the best things.

If you think this is like number 1 and thinking of buying it don't! I did that mistake and it sucks.

If you're familiar to any other RTS game, Company of Heroes 2 isn't that different from the Mainstream titles like Starcraft and etc although the Company of Heroes franchise is always one of my favorite Real Time Strategy franchise out there. The Bloody and Gritty atmosphere mixed with a great gameplay and an Awesome Campaign, Unarguably make them my favorite RTS franchise. 

[h1] Gameplay [/h1] 
The game's overall gameplay feels similar to Company of Heroes 1 with the addition of a bunch of new features. I usually get bored pretty fast in an RTS game because they are fun but very frustating as well. Company of Heroes 2 by far is the most unique of them. I personally loved the World War 2 theme in the game and while the game is pretty similar to other RTS games, the game has it's own several unique features that no other game has. And also one of the the things that I like from this game is the fact that it has base building. Not many World War II RTS Games out there has base building because most of them just focuses on Strategy and Combat and not Base Building. While some people prefers to play an RTS game with no base building whatsoever, Base Building is one of my favorite elements to see in an RTS game.

[h1] Atmosphere [/h1] 
The game has a pretty bloody and gritty atmosphere mainly in the Eastern Front. It actually does kind of reminds me of Red Orchestra 2 which was by far the best World War 2 first person shooter in terms of Atmospheric gameplay. This game actually kind of manages a pretty similar bloody and gritty atmosphere from the game which is why I absolutely love it.

[h1] Singleplayer and Multiplayer. [/h1] 
The game is still pretty populated for an almost 11 year old game. The game has bots like most Real Time Strategy games out there and it isn't a surprise. What's a selling point of this game is the awesome campaign that I absolutely love. While there's a bunch of RTS games out there, not many of them has a great story. Company of Heroes 2 is one of the few RTS game that actually have a pretty decent story. The game also has Co-op mode which is a plus if you're into that.

[h1] Graphics [/h1] 
The graphics is pretty decent for an RTS game made a decade ago and it still holds up pretty well. If you have an old computer from a few years ago that is not pretty decent I am pretty sure that you can still run this game at the lowest graphical settings with the lowest graphical resolution possible

[h1] Suggestion [/h1] 
If you're looking for a decent World War II Real time strategy game to try on then this would actually be a decent choice for you. And on steam sales, most of the time the game's price goes pretty cheap as well. Overall I do highly recommend this game.",1671010970,1676655600,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

(even tho the germans get infared guns when theyre known for using the Kar98k and had terrible recon but okay)

the campain isnt really anything to write about, it shows you one faction and lets you commit warcrimes so im not too fussed about it anyway! its good fun so need i say more. 

the game does also have DLC and if you get the game i wouldnt recommend getting them unless you like the game or your playstyle cant be done unless you buy them to begin with! inculding a whole campain as the US, which is quite fun but im not that good at, might give it another go sometime but i dont think i'll get far.

The road they chose to go down as far as your option of commanders and small buffs to specific units is questionable at least and predatory at best. First game had 3 commanders for each of the released Army groups. This one has way more and to their credit they are well done and can give you stylistic gameplay. The catch is that outside the starters the commanders are all $4 each, offering 1 unique unit and 2-3 unique mechanics. Small price yes, but done through individual sales and not packs is meant to maximize profits and is anti-consumer. Years later they made several Soviet and Wehrmacht commanders available to all.

Usually end up playing the Spearhead overhaul with close friends, makes for a good party game with a more arcade-y feel compared to something like Assault Squad (not a bad thing, depending on mood or preference), but this is a micro-transaction hell in its own right.  Paywalling the USA of all things (OKW a bit more understandable in my eyes), a free faction in the previous game, seems so incredibly bizarre to me, and is more or less just gouging extra for your bog-standard western front experience.
The factions all play well IMO, but I'm upset with having to pay for the game again twice over to get all of the options that should be available for me.  Suppose it's not out of the ordinary with Relic, considering the monetization of Dawn of War and its expansions, but still not ideal in my personal view.  I suppose at the very least they didn't go the Airborne route and make skirmish AI a paid feature.
Nevertheless, about all the investment I want or need from this franchise, highly doubt CoH3 will be very enticing to me, even if the Italians or the Japanese make a surprise appearance.

Qualms aside, I enjoy this game and what it has to offer me, just not happy with it popping a hole in my wallet to get the most out of it.  Paradox games do the same thing to it more than enough for more grand-strategy experiences, so I recommend buying this and any extra content on sale just as I would apply to the other studio's franchises.",1676017245,1676017245,False,1,0,0.485323458909988403,0,True,False,False

If you observe expert players on you tube you note how the game is more finessed once you reach micro dexterity. It is almost graceful at this level. 

There are a number of single player options that take in typical Campaign modes and DLC available to expand this play. Note: no cross platform Multiplayer play possible between MAC/Linux and PC and very few MAC players online. It really is a PC game for Multiplayer. COH 2 is the child of COH and I understand in reading the forums on Steam and COH2.org there are still COH players but the trend for awhile has been to COH2. In saying this I expect the new version COH 3 will in time displace COH 2 and it is due out in Feb 23 2023. So you might want to dive in with COH 3 and get in on the ground floor so to speak.

There is quite a virulent element in the community as you often find with this sort of thing. The typical fanatic with a 1000 hours of play who stomps around on discussion forums and the rage quitters on team play. Expect to experience troll like behavior in discussions, but that's life.

Almost 400 hours over the years (and many more than that in CoH1 before Steam existed), Company of Heroes 2 has come a very long way and shaped into my undisputed daily driver for competitive RTS. The action and mechanics are next to none, except, perhaps, it's predecessor. Relic does this kind of RTS like no other studio, and your money will be well spent here if you're looking for the best skirmish and multiplayer experience ‚Äî just be aware, you will need to buy DLC for all the factions.

If you are excited about WW2 RTS campaigns, and are new to the franchise and can't wait for CoH3's release, then I recommend CoH1. I would say CoH1's campaign is far superior. While Company of Heroes 2's campaign is not bad, it is just not the *chef's kiss that is the original.

Company of Heroes 2, through many years of patches, fixes, community input and support, is the mechanically superior game. Atmospherically, the vibe, the feel... I think many will say it did not achieve what the original did. But it came damn close and Relic fixed it up into a pretty spectacular RTS.

I love Company of Heroes as a franchise. I started in 2006 when my buddy lent me the disk for CoH1. I will no doubt sink ungodly hours into CoH3. I have participated in every alpha and beta Relic has had for it. I strongly recommend both games, and yet also recommend newcomers either wait for CoH3 or pick the one that has what seeking:

If you want an RTS campaign in anticipation of CoH3:
-I recommend CoH1

If you want to dive into CoH3 skirmish and multiplayer:
-I recommend CoH2

If you are interested in the CoH Franchise but are not sure where to start:
-Waiting for CoH3 might be the best for you; **OR**
-If you can stomach the wallet hit, start from the beginning and enjoy all the excellent campaigns Relic has made. They hold up 100%.",1414173173,1675185319,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Unfortunately, after multiple campaigns, there are still major glitches such as disabled troops, inability to regenerate troops, inability to order more troops, cover incentives, and weapon glitches. 
While this RTS is fun and entertaining, the graphics are surprising bad. The voice overs become irritating and repetitive, and the main campaign that comes with the game is not good enough for multiple play throughs. Overall, i have played this game extensively and would agree its better than most however, the developer has let me down with this craftsmanship of a game.

While i know there will be initial glitches and issues, the developer needs to really step up and continually fix these issues instead of focusing on the additional revenue from all the pointless DLC.",1674672086,1674672086,False,0,0,0.47999998927116394,0,True,False,False

8.5/10 

My #1 issue with Company of Heroes 2 compared to Company of Heroes 1 is the inability for modders to create custom models. While the steam workshop allows for mods, it doesn't let modders add in tanks that are not already in the game, but they can change the tank's damage, armor, range, abilities, ect ect.  

So lets say you wanted to play as Japan using the Advanced Powers mod 
sorry, german tanks only ;)

Want to try that zombie mod on the workshop?
sorry, gotta use unarmed osttruppen

From penetrative shots making the Pen sound and not actually doing damage, to rockets from AT planes simply disappearing when hitting tanks. If you are buying this game and have any desire to play online, be aware the underlying systems are barely functional. Its ironic as COH 1 didn't really have any of these issues, and still ,mostly functions as intended to this day. 

Buying this game at this stage will require ~$100 of money spent just to get competitive commanders for all factions as the game remains as it was on launch, an exploitative money grab. At least they changed the system to allow you to slowly buy commanders with in game currency after 5 years of milking the player base dry. 

I'm not going to comment on campaign as I didn't bother to play past the 4th mission as it was pretty awful and historically inaccurate. If you want the campaign experience just watch Enemy At the Gates and save yourself the 8 hours of frustration. 

If I was a relic employee former or current who worked on this game, I would be contacting SEGA begging for my name to be taken out of the credits as this game is an awful product and an embarrassment of a follow up to COH 1. Hopefully we all remember the state this game launched in and is currently in when we consider buying COH 3 and giving Relic and SEGA more of our money so they can continue to profit off of and smear the reputation COH 1 built.",1674339762,1674339834,False,8,2,0.544667363166809082,0,True,False,False

I quoted how I hated that my squads missed targets and enemies would hide behind the same cover that my own units were using. I called this game ""arcady"". Compared titles like ""Men Of War AS2"" and ""Call To arms"" to this one. 
Then I spend a few thousand hours playing Starcraft 2. Then I Spent a few hundred more playing Call to Arms until they released ""Domination mode"" that turned the game into arty spamming turtling noobs that I honestly.. Got tired of killing. I got so good at that game its stupid. I have a whole youtube on it.
This game however.. pulls the best of both of those worlds.. Its not COH1.. COH1 was a classic and did it right. This game strayed from its roots. Falls short on many things. But it has the punishing cruelty of ""learn how to do pvp or get the F out"" from SC2 and Warcraft.. and the ""complexity"" of Men of war. I recently got to try to Multiplayer Tech Test for COH3 and found that the developers have listened to their fans. They are returning to all the mechanics that we loved about COH1. And I apprichiate that.
but for this game (which will soon be dead like COH1 when COH3 comes out). Its good. It's punishingly difficulty to understand how the mechanics work. But once you do, the fights feel real, fast, and actually do make sense. 
Cons- Its extremely hard to make a comback. Just like in starcraft2/warcraft3. If you mess up the first 5 minutes of a match just GG and Re because this games competative and good luck catching up.
Pros- If you take the time to learn the very bare bones of basic PVP, you will find a game that is so intricate and complex that matches can go from a fast 15 minute rush, to 2 HOURS of total war.
Company of heros 3 is sick. I cant wait to get out there and give it a go. I can finnally punish people for not putting their inf in cover! Either way! This games great. Love it or hate it.

CAMPAIGNS

- Soviet Campaign is historically inaccurate on a lot of parts. Mission designs are decent but not good and fun enough for keeping you playing it until the end. Pre and post cinematics are well made. I would give it 6/10. 

- Ardennes Assault is just 10/10. Don't need more words.

MULTIPLAYER

Balancing

Axis forces getting smashed every single game and match phases by Allied artillery. You would think Germans would save the day by bringing in the big guns like Tiger I or King Tiger. But guess what, those would get countered easily by TDs (tank destroyers) worth 1/3 of their costs. Guess Axis loses tank matchup as historically accurate.. How about the infantry matchup? Good luck on that as well since Axis squads get wiped constantly by Allied artillery whereas Allied squads usually have room to breathe to gain veterancy without the doubts of getting wiped by Axis artillery since they are nowhere near as good as Allied ones. So in short, you are bound to suffer as Axis in every part of game in the field of infantry, tank, air support or artillery.  In the current meta of the game, I would give it 5/10 to the balance scale.

PS: Keep in mind that this balancing issue pointed on usually applies to 3v3, 4v4 and on some 2v2 maps, around middle ELOs. In high level play, it is usually(!) balanced.

Community

There are really toxic people playing sometimes but other than that it is a pretty friendly and active community I would say. Play mostly with friends in order to avoid those toxic people being in your team, and be sure to block them on steam post-match since some of them are pscyho enough to harass you on steam. Would give 7/10 to the community.

Mod Support

Since I m not much fond of mods, prefering vanilla most of the time, I don't have much experience on the mod support. But I know mod workshop for CoH2 is pretty active and there are some really good modding stuff like maps and new faction units, adding new colors to the game.

Overall conclusion according to my ranking of the features:

My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

I was a fan of Avalon Hill's Panzer Leader and Squad Leader, so I reveled in the we-go Combat Mission series - I'm dating myself. CoH & CoH2 are a massive step forward akin to playing the would-be armchair George Mead in Sid Meier's Gettysburg versus Avalon Hill's original. But there are some unrealistic gamey issues of course that make it more like playing Civilization than Combat Mission, which was a fairly realistic game in terms of unit-performance and physics. Examples: Snipers out-of-the-box seemingly able to perform like Simo H√§yh√§. Your AI partner in a Co-op sending its troops out in a forced march thru a blizzard or storming a position deep in enemy territory with a single tank. A 75mm Pak unable to bring down a T-70 with one flanking shot or even two or three in a duel. To be fair, SM's Gettysburg had similar issues but it was still fun - once you got the hang of the quirks. So those are all very tolerable for CoH & CoH2 in terms of contributing to the overall play balance. I can't wait for CoH3! Now for the challenge to both (MoW and CoH) of these platforms: I'd love to see future campaign modes where we can use some better strategic maneuvering on a divisional-level map and then drilling down to the tactical combat. CoH2 introduced that, but it felt too simplistic and more like playing a really weak version of Axis and Allies than a good old AH or Strategy and Tactics game.",1671213373,1673815410,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game lacks any ability to save during a solo campaign mission, or restart a mission. So, for adults who may have responsibilities that pop up while playing, your options are to surrender, or do a hack mission restart by quitting via alt-F4. So you can restart a mission, it just wastes a bunch or time for the game to fully quit, relaunch it, go through intro screens, choose the campaign, choose the last check point and wait for it to reload. 

Some might argue that it gives a more challenging....the designer's intended play experience...blah blah blah. The bottom line is it takes away player choice and wastes time. I have the most play time on Total War titles. For those who want a hard core challenge there's ""Ironman mode"", no saves at all. For anyone else you can save as much or little as you want. It is the player's choice, and every player can have the experience they prefer.

Having a game provider decree how I play a game is ridiculous. Imagine if a baker told you what sandwich you could make with your bread. Their ""dining experience"" is that you can make ham sandwiches, but not cheese. You can only eat it in one sitting, or throw a half eaten sandwich away. You're not allowed to bag it, put it in the fridge  and finish it later...because that's not the dining ""experience"" THEY intended. 

I want to love this game. The genre, era and actual play can be great. I have owned it for years and reinstall it now and then and play it a while. Then the inconvenience and frustration builds until I move on to something else and free up the drive space. I have 1000 hours combined on various Total War titles and yet have never finished Ardennes Assault. This not a difficulty issue, but a lack of quality of life features that are often standard in similar games. It is a lack of player choice and could easily be solved by saves and an Ironman mode, or mods that provide them. Of course this only applies to solo play, not multiplayer.

I probably won't buy CoH3 until I try it for free, and then only when it's been out a while and and on sale. Too many good games out there to sink time into a game that can sometimes lead to more frustration than fun.",1673700150,1673700471,False,13,2,0.549971461296081543,0,True,False,False

I don't have an absolute ton of hours logged but I wanted to weigh in on my feelings about COH 2. Right out the gate, I will say that the game is fun. It is VERY fun once you get a hang of micro and hotkeys. Destructible environments, customization of units, awesome maps (both official and community made), and a great attention to balance make this RTS really fun to play. I greatly admire how diverse each faction is and the design choices. Whether your playing faction A or decide  to play faction B, or C, etc. it really feels different. You almost have to make a dedicated choice as to which faction you want to learn so you can dedicate all of your practice towards that faction. It's amazing how much customization there is - unit to unit.  A unit can receive upgrades that then lock out another set of upgrades making you decide what choices best fit your situation. The doctrines also add a layer of customization that was lacking in COH1. These doctrines allow you to form parts of your strategy, knowing that you will have additional and unique forms of support as the match goes on.

TLDR: If you like RTS games, COH2 is great.",1496673293,1672686256,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

One of the things that sets Company of Heroes 2 apart from other RTS games is its focus on realistic unit behavior and terrain. The game's ""TrueSight"" system realistically simulates line of sight for units, and the game's destructible environments allow players to shape the battlefield to their advantage. These mechanics add an extra layer of strategy to the game and make it feel more realistic.

The game also boasts a robust multiplayer component, with various modes and maps available for players to enjoy. The game's matchmaking system does a good job of finding players of similar skill levels, which helps to make multiplayer matches more competitive and enjoyable. [spoiler] multiplayer is dead [/spoiler]

In terms of visuals, Company of Heroes 2 is impressive. The environments are detailed and the unit models are well-animated. The game also runs smoothly, even on lower-end systems.

Overall, Company of Heroes 2 is a fantastic RTS game that offers a realistic and engaging experience. Its focus on realistic unit behavior and terrain, as well as its robust multiplayer component, make it a must-play for fans of the genre and previous titles.

It is an empty shell of a game, merely a decent foundation. In order to start enjoying the game, various DLC has to be bought and in this case I couldn't get myself to do it.

I enjoyed CoH 1 a little over 2000 hours where each faction has 3 fully unlockable commander paths right off the start.

It was more playable because of the mods and the range of units you can command in game. Factions such as, the Soviets, the Us,  the British, the Wehrmacht, and the Oberkommando has their difference in power drive when claiming territories which was more challenging when battling other factions. 

I personally like US because of its ability (when using pathfinders and Airborne) to capture many strategic points faster than any faction. While Wehrmacht is slow on capturing points but It can hit an incredible punch against enemy points because of it's weapons and armor supremacy and it has great defenses as well that can hold decent amount of enemy forces.

Hopefully, Company of Heroes 3 carries on the game's legacy since I‚Äôve loved this franchise ever since the original game. The graphics, gameplay, units, tanks, and fights are all very well done. The music is intense and it truly gives you that WWII experience.

Since this game is pretty old, the multiplayer is still going on and is decent but will take some time to get into matches against humans. It‚Äôs also a lot of fun playing with friends against AI as I‚Äôm sure when CoH3 comes out, everyone will likely move onto that one for multiplayer so be ready. Once that happens, it‚Äôll likely be extremely hard to find any gamers playing this but at least the AI option is there.

When it comes to the campaign, it‚Äôs also pretty good and immersive as I‚Äôd consider this franchise as a whole to be one of the best RTS games out there you can play. Especially if you also love military-inspired games as much as I do.

The only thing I can critique about Company of Heroes 2 is all the crazy amounts of DLC that when added up, is very pricey. It‚Äôs not an issue if all you play is CoH2 or love RTS games in general but unless they all go on sale, it‚Äôs definitely overpriced.

I sure hope CoH3 remedies this by perhaps going the route of a battlepass or something to keep this kind of content flowing where you don‚Äôt have so many individual options or packs of DLC to buy. Either way, I do hope CoH3 delivers since it could be one of the best new RTS games of 2023 but we shall see. I‚Äôm definitely going to play CoH3 once it comes out because I love this franchise and have since 2006. They did push the release date so at least that shows they know how important of a launch this is in such an iconic RTS series.

Overall, I give Company of Heroes 2 a 4/5 and would recommend this to anyone that loves RTS games as I feel it‚Äôs a must-play title in the genre. I think just like the original, this will be an RTS game that stands the test of time and will still be played for many years after it‚Äôs done being supported. Especially since there are a ton of mods to enhance everything and provide endless hours of awesome gaming. The only knock I have on CoH2 is the overpriced DLC as there is a ton of it here and it‚Äôs too expensive in the grand scheme of things.",1672265205,1672265205,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1. It is hard and not enjoyable to play. It is hard to play in a sense that you only have 2 hands it there are so many units that you need to control, and sometimes not in 1 way but across the map. In addition to this, you have no key binding or short cut to move the camera so you have to move across the map to find where your units are with your mouse. 

2. The AI are dumb. I have lost count of the number of times when I tried to pull off a tactical movement and flank the enemies but my unit simply runs right into them, or from another perspective, the enemies simply run right into my units, and then everybody just stand right where they are and shoot each other without any cover. If you happen to bring a mortar team or artillery, you will also see the mix of yours and enemies' unit getting vigorously shot at by those mortar or artillery. And the bugs that does not allow you to use ability is just annoying given how strategically important they are.

3. The building and resources system is just ridiculous. I am expecting to control a company, not the whole damn army, which shouldn't have any resources creation involved, and the way they are acquired are utterly inconsistent with unnecessary and unhelpful in making the game more fun. More importantly, the population is just dumb given how it limits the play style and how you can utilize the weapons. 2 sniper cost 6 population while 6 mortar crew also cost 6, it just don't make sense. Plus it limits how much infantry and armored units you can create, and the enemy then throws 3-4 times more of that at you. It just unnecessarily kills the fun.",1671966184,1671966184,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For starters, it's got a great campaign that introduce you to the games mechanics, and general functions of an RTS. But what stands out to me most, compared to any other RTS I've tried, is the cover-to-cover combat. Other RTS's feel like the combat consists of kiting, or just sending units in to duke it out. Here in CoH, you really navigate the crevices of the map, using the various structures for your advantage. It's my own opinion, that compared to other RTS games, the micro-management isn't too heavy. The learning curve is semi-steep, but the fact that the entire genre of the game is rooted in historical realism, makes it a lot easier to navigate in some ways. Fuel is simply fuel, and munitions are used for abilities/grenades, etc. There's no real guess work about what the vehicles do. Tanks are tanks, transports are transports. Same for many of the units. Engineers are engineers, machine gunners do what you'd expect machine gunners to do. Mortars do what you expect mortars to do. It's not like StarCrafts Protos, or Zerg races, which are a lot more complex in their design and functions. There's no pylons, or little structures you build to raise your population cap. You just let the manpower generate, and build. Very straight forward, easier-to-understand combat, very strategic uses of cover. It's my absolute favorite RTS, and the only one that I've put real game time into. I always recommend it for anyone that loves RTS games.",1671523515,1671523515,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The AI has become impeccable (credit being given to player feedback, devs fostering a welcoming platform for feedback etc.) , and the multiplayer ever more gratifying. I've been playing video games of all genres for over 25-years and this one has had me hooked. What really attracted me to this game was the realness and genuine aspects to our different military's across the globe and the investment made to allow the player to not only be educated on actual history but how each country's military was different. I have recently used this game as a great way to teach my son about history and show him a fun game that has real substance and not just another ""hack n slash"" or ""Fortnite type game"" that shows violence in a romanticized way. I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun RTS type game that has real substance, especially some dads out there looking for a good game to play with their son that actually has context/history.

The original felt like you were playing out a history channel documentary of the war in order freeing you up for different battles with more general tasks but this games narrative ties a string to the missions, mostly. It doesn't help that some of the more memorable battles on the eastern front aren't in my opinion covered very well in this campaign like the iconic Stalingrad river crossing being a tutorial. But again over all it is still worth a play through tho preferable when on sale.

The game is not to well optimized, you can have a super computer, you will still see stutters, frame drops and even crashes.

It looks ok, most units look a certian way to be connected to COH2 and not history. 

Balancing is very often broke, the most elite and expensive unit in the game is useless and a history of units/buldings/abilites breaking aspects of the game either making you want to break your computer or fall asleep at how easy your are rolling over players.

Theaters of War kinda add most solo and co-op content, like a Skirmish with special rules like limiting weapons to the time from 1941. Kinda adds a German campaign but with no cutsences or story structure, just random missions.

DLC, they want you to buy the commanders, rather than play different styles and expland on content which this game by it self is lacking. 

Controls are ok, you can't rebind keys, and for a player who plays RTS mostly that will bother them.

What this game needs is full modding support and Relic refuses to do so becuase ""Players wont be able to see your units"". Which is a lie, theres a giant logo over your units and as a player it should be your choise for what looks like what in your game. 

AI is terrible, who ever at Relic made the AI should be fired and replaced as soon as possible. Giving the AI Map hacks, higher resources and better rolls on the RNG isn't how you make AI harder and its a lazy excuse of AI. 

Just buy COH1, then get the Eastern Front mod.",1405227169,1670549484,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

CoH 2 base game is quite good. Skirmish mode is quite fun but they cold have modified it to be a map where you choose the territories you want to invade or defend.
Bring on Ardennes Assault. They did it, they brought in territories. Then completely screwed it up. You have 3 armies you move around. There is allied and enemy territory which you can move onto. Instead of moving one territory at a time you can move as many as you'd like in allied and enemy territory but you lose 5% strength every time you move in enemy territory even though there are no enemies there. Moving onto an enemy territory doesn't capture it though. You have to move through enemy territories until you get to an occupied territory. So why did you take casualties in an unoccupied territory? Because the Devs broke the game. When engaging in battle you Win or Lose. Regardless of the outcome you take casualties of a certain amount. Upon winning you gain some points to spend on either skills or reinforcements. The reinforcements will not be enough to replenish your forces so you will bleed continually until you are too weak to fight. Also, when you beat the enemy they don't die. They move into other territories and reinforce the armies there. So you end up getting weaker and weaker and the enemy gets stronger and stronger. As you are invading, every map starts you with nothing and the enemy are entrenched. The enemy never attacks your territory so they never weaken and you never get the opportunity to weaken them. Your armies heal every time you use a different army to attack but not enough to make a difference. You will bleed to the point your armies are nearly dead. AA doesn't have the ability to Save and Load when you screw up. If you save you also quit. Every decision counts, no going back. I tried the campaign on normal and got to 67% captured and found i was as 25% strength fighting 5 star armies, not fun. I started again on easy and though a bit easier, it wasn't significantly easier and at 60% in i'm finding my armies down to 60 to 70% and the enemies at 4 stars. 
I can't recommend the expansion. It's frustrating as hell though it could have been excellent.

The good:
basically all of the game for its age, enjoyable campaign, modding support and competitive online play. 

The bad:

the player base / no disable chat function: 

toxic arseholes, most can't be fucked to complete a full game so they drop out before its finished just cause they lost 1 troop. Blame every single mistake they make on other people and generally ruin a great gaming experience. Think about the most toxic sad 13 year old and then crank it up to 11, basically man-babies who can't take criticism. Would turn off the chat but that isn't an option in the settings.

no anti dropping system: players are not penalised if they ditch a multiplayer competitive game while its still happening so they get replaced with a trash AI and you loose a lot to this.

the price: DLC is a little pricey considering I just payed like ¬£30 (back when I bought it) and your selling commanders for ¬£5 - ¬£10 ???

The big drawback of the game are the enormous amount of micro-transactions for every single type of items starting from aesthetics to all important commanders with valuable units/abilities locked behind paywall. In case you are unwilling to splash the cash, there is a prolonged grinding mechanism in place which allows you to buy in-game stuffs using 'supply points' earned by grinding games. 
There are multiple DLCs with one with campaign, a few for theater of war missions and most importantly the factions (US Forces, OKW and the British forces). The faction DLCs imo are worth picking up during sale as all 5 factions (2 from base game) have radically different playstyles which can be pretty entertaining and interesting for different types of players.

It's a great time if you play just between friends or online with competent friends. Otherwise the experience is all over the place. I'm no RTS master but I did do pretty good in Starcraft 2 (almost platinum) and I've been playing RTS itself since 2002. So I have some knowledge about this stuff. And with COH 2, there are unfortunately some major barriers or pitfalls in this game that might absolutely piss you off:

Player pool - Eventually, the playerbase shrinks to a degree where you're going to have a tough time finding other players of equal skill levels. The problem with COH 2 is that my games are about 49 percent insanely good players who walk over me or 49 percent that suck. Seriously, I have disabilities, I can't process tons of information at once without getting overwhelmed easily, and I still absolutely ruin some of these people because they just play so terribly. There's a difference between understanding COH 2, understanding RTS, and understanding how to use a mouse and keyboard and I feel like the other 49 percent of players are barely scraping past understanding how to use a mouse and keyboard. When you get a good game where the opponent is at your skill ceiling and ""gets"" coh 2, it's really fun, win or lose. But that is rarely the case because....

Guides online are outdated - there is no proper meta-wiki for this game despite being out for almost a decade. So many guides are totally outdated yet they're the first results that show up on google. Talk shit all you want about how people obsessing over meta kills certain games but the reality is that if a strategy is optimal it will be used. It's fun to try out different builds against different factions though, it's fun figuring out mechanics. What isn't fun is having to spend 30 hours figuring out what build order or tier units work best for your faction for the most basic counter players. There is no one making comprehensive guides on what units to avoid in certain matchups or solo/team compositions. Rocket trucks as OKW are crazy good in teams, they suck in 1v1 unless your opponent is cheesing. Having guides helps players understand what units counter what. Do you have any idea how frustrating it is to fight a faction where they spam the same unit or building and despite you playing your A game and they're obviously barely competent with a keyboard, yet they still somehow win? Now you're searching for the one in-date guide to figure it out after dying to the same cheesing composition 5 games in a row. It's annoying. Not that I expect the community to come up with guides because...

The community sucks - I don't b*tch about toxic communities in games because it's a meme. Trash talking is fun as shit because it comes from the dumbest players whom I just stomp into the ground and it's fun as hell to do that. Unfortunately, what's not fun is them leaving early and not giving me any points for the game, what's not fun is dealing with them on your team in 2s, 3s, and 4s, where they will leave at the slightest problem or complain and ping incessantly the entire game. What's not fun is the enemy player, despite 0 chance of winning, still stalling the game out because he doesn't value his time at all. 1v1s are the only time you can get close to a fun time because its just you and your own skill but even then the other player finds ways to be a bitch by dragging out games. They always GLHF with me at the start but they never GG me when I win. That sums up the entirety of the community right there. ""it's fun until I lose"". I'm sorry but if that's the case then your game just sucks and so do you. Speaking of which...

The Campaign & offline experience - It's boring, I peace'd out halfway through the first few missions in COH 2 and apparently from what I read, the narrative sucks too. Generic soviet hollywood war movie retelling of their conflict. COH 1 had amazing campaigns even though that game's engine was like a jetski running on sand. They added two campaigns since via dlc but they're not what you'd expect. The expert AI for skirmish is fucking broken. Basically gets like double your resource pool and makes cheesing for certain factions a requirement. You wanna get good at this game? Don't play against the AI. You will have to come up with sub-optimal strategy that just involves exploiting them rather than actually playing well. The campaign is chock full of bad mechanics. The cold weather mechanic was an awful idea and has been pretty much omitted from multiplayer, and that's due to one of the biggest problems with the game...

The technical systems behind everything suck a$$ - The physics, the bugs, the glitches, the damage calculations. This game is shockingly bad when you approach it from a competitive standpoint. I will see shells hit the sides of medium tanks and somehow no damage will occur, I've seen units glitch out and not move or attack despite not being pinned or anything. I've seen units become one with the tank they're repairing... No not physically, I mean they will attach themselves to the tank mechanically so they move when the tank does but have zero abilities and can't retreat. It's insane. The engine is superior to COH 1, but everything is still held together with duct tape. I will often surrender or win matches yet the server still doesn't give me any credits due to an error. The entirety of the vehicle system whereby front/sides/rear have different armor values in addition to some special pathfinding and terrain and how vehicles have weight to them, all that sounds fine on paper but in practice, it's a nightmare. I've even seen really good players struggle at times with how all the calculations are working behind the scene regarding tanks I will get hit by shells and yet there's zero damage, or the shot won't line up despite the guns being stationary, or how the tank will just have a spastic moment of ADHD and look at a squad of infantry to do .000001 damage to it with a shell while the enemy tank is entering the fog of war so the gun has to re-align and the enemies tank suddenly goes from on the run and about to die to getting another shot first or getting away clean. Shit will just not work when it's supposed to at best and it's a nightmare to deal with as a new player at worst. COH 3 is having vehicles turn on the dime by comparison so maybe they'll improve the system. At least everything works a lot better than COH 1 although that game at least had several good campaigns. But I doubt they'll fix the mountain of new bugs in a timely matter and make a campaign worth a damn. There's a reason one of the best compositions online is to mass infantry with AT, Tanks suck.

I'll still recommend the game if you can get it off a third party key site complete with all the DLC for 10 bucks and got an RTS itch or friends to play with but if you're not super into RTS this game can and will absolutely piss you off or put you off of it entirely. I still like doing ladder and a game night with the boys, even online but there are so many massive problems with this title that I can't see myself recommending this one to many casuals or even hardcore players.

Update: I beat all the cheesing players and now I'm at the point where I play great in 1v1 because I understand the mechanics. Jesus that took awhile but I'm running out of players at my skill level, but now I'm bored since there are limited comps to play with (if there's more than 1) for each faction. So I switch it up and do Teams online by myself. Holy god this is the most miserable experience ever. It's almost as bad as a Moba. Braindead players everywhere. Do yourself a favor and save about 5 years off your lifespan, don't play teams online alone. Even when you're winning its not fun. 1/10 games is balanced and fun the rest is a one-sided stomp.",1661623066,1668620073,True,3,0,0.538689255714416504,0,True,True,False

  The battle feels just right, your troops talk like human beings and you feel their presence, you feel like commanding real troops. 
  The singleplayer has a lot of content to go through you can never get bored. 
  The A.I. is good, it's not braindead and can make you sweat on hard difficulties. 
  You can customize your troops and vehicles with skins. 
  You can build your strategy with lots of commanders (they give you special kind of abilities/vehicles/weapons) 
  You can use the enviroment around you, for example you can position your troops in buildings or on top of hills to give them bonuses. Troops on roads and lower grounds have a disadvantage when defending/attacking. This makes the game more fun. 
Things i hate about this game: 
  There're lots of commanders that can change the way you play and can benefit you, and buying them with game currency is almost impossible, they give you so little cash that you can't buy anything really, it's just an illusion. I bought every commander DLC on the steam store. EVERY ONE OF THEM, and when i opened the in-game store, i saw that they have more commanders that i have to buy to experience the game fully. This was frustrating. 
  The A.I. is cheating on expert difficulty. Just knowing this lowers the fun.

Average Score is: 3.66 / 5[/h3]

Although there is a singleplayer campaign, it is the multiplayer where this game shines a lot. The campaign isn't memorable whatsoever and it doesn't prepare you for multiplayer, but at least it exists. On the other hand almost everything else is amazing. Great graphics, fun multiplayer with lots of units, strategies and possibilities. Superb game!

The tactics involved in laying out your defense, or planning your advances is signficant.  Coming from StarCraft (which I also loved), their is a bit more involved here in mixed weapons and how they are deployed.  SC was more about building a large force and charging forward with it (well, not quite that simplistic), while if you do that blindly in COH you will get eaten alive.  

One thing I HATE about COH though, is the randomness involved.  Sometimes a grenade may slightly damage a squad, others it kills 90% of it.  Some call that fun, 'part of the experience', I call it annoying.  If I want the suspense of randomness, I'll watch a movie.  When I am competing against another, I prefer no randomness.  SC did not suffer from this, and from that aspect is a bit more of a competitive game.  All in all though, I really enjoy playing COH.

Instead of simply overwhelming your opponent when you are ahead. Best RTS of all time even better than the original.

Companies malfunctioning especially in the Ardennes Assault missions where the weapon rack upgrade ruins the mission progress causing it to be stuck in a mission forever, Rank Specialization (Lieutenant, Captain, Major) doesn't work anymore even if you achieve it, units going opposite directions whenever you're pointing them somewhere specific, and many more. We tried all the fixes that we could find online, but nothing's working. I could still change my review if the issues get solved soon. Yes, I got this game for free and bought the DLCs, and played it for long hours, but that doesn't mean I enjoyed the game to the utmost extent, probably because of being unable to maximize the use of the game's functions that are affected by critical bugs. That's all. It's a good game. Just infested by so many bugs.

Update: Game always crashing when loading saved games now. It went from average stupid to advanced stupid. Several commanders and units are now malfunctioning (maybe because of updates?), and Ardennes Assault DLC always loses saved progress when logging in to a different computer. This game's hopeless.

You can buy all the DLC it has to offer... But you will still be missing at least 26 commanders, Each which cost 4 ENTIRE DOLLARS. But you can buy each of them for 15000 supply. How do you get supply? At the end of each match, you get 2000 points if you win, I think 1000 points if you lose. You need to get 6000 points to level up, which leveling gets you a crate that can have either an item, or 500 supply points... You would think the game would give you like, 1000-2000 supply points per match, but no. You get a crate after 3 wins or more losses with a chance, of having 500 supply points. Or it could have a random skin or bulletin.

Meaning that in order unlock what should be free gameplay features to those who already bought the game and all the DLC, you need to do a combination of grinding and paying out the ass, OR pure grinding. Why, on earth, would any game that charges 20 bucks upfront... Require intensive grinding/ purchasing of bundles to get in-game advantages. It'd be one thing if supply was a resource you got from battles and was only used to purchase skins and cosmetics. But it is literally a grind/p2w game. I cannot possibly recommend it, it's better with mods that remove this garbage.

I feel like the tutorial and opening missions are much more forgiving than it's predecessor and even though the intro to the campaign is essentially a losing simulator it's kind of a smart idea to prepare the player for defeat and emphasize strategy.

The graphics are nicer than I thought they'd be, and even though I went and watched a tutorial or two, the majority of the mechanics and menus in the game were pretty easy to navigate. 

I definitely think I'll pick up the DLC once another sale hits, I avoid multiplayer in RTS games so I can't speak on that although it's pretty toxic from what I've read. Plenty of achievements to go hunting for which is nice, and I haven't touched on the story because it's pretty average and I didn't really retain much of what I've already seen so I can't really judge.

- Fairly steep learning curve to mastery. Multiplayer is brutal on newbies.
- Toxic online community (way better with real-life friends)
- Updates are infrequent and sometimes controversial
- Single player offers average entertainment value
----


== Here's what's great about it ==

- At the time of writing, you won't find a better WWII RTS with this level of immersion, versatility and polish. The Essence engine is a marvel: the graphics look beautiful at their maximum setting, and there is nice detail to see when you zoom in close. Think of vehicle engine sounds, splattering terrain, pockmarked battlefields, smoke and foliage beautifully drawn and highly dynamic to grenades, fire and artillery shells.

- Replay value is high because of the sheer variety of modes: victory point, annihilation, theatre of war, campaign or a fully modded experience. 

- Hardware specs are reasonable (your potato can run it). Recently it has been cross-ported to Linux, Mac and even Proton for your Steam Deck.

- You'll be learning your WWII history through animated models (e.g. that T34/85 took out my Sd.Kfz 142 StuG III)

- Voice acting is pretty good, with larger-than-life personalities balanced with dynamic feedback, e.g. I‚Äôm under attack!‚Äô, and occasionally quite funny if you listen closely.

- Campaign/Theatre of War and the Tutorial are well thought-out and engaging, though repetitive and lonely if you don‚Äôt find a buddy.

- There are 3 allied and 2 axis factions to choose from, each with options to suit your play style (see caveats).

- Theatrical music is pretty good and varied across factions... though the menu music can drive you crazy when waiting.

- Online play is free (no subscription) and very good for latency for up to eight players in a single match.

- You‚Äôll experience a rush of adrenaline like no other RTS game, thanks to the quick paced combat and strategic thinking necessary to pull off a win. Victory point games leave you on the edge of your seat. Annihilation matches can be a marathon.

== Here's what's crap about it ==

- The dreaded 'bugsplat' (crash to desktop with an error submission prompt) is an inevitability for most gamers, and can happen at any time during your gameplay. Who knows the cause? Everyone has a theory. My friends and I usually cycle the game open-closed and pray to the random number generator gods that it doesn't happen in our match. All we know is you're in the middle of a multiplayer online match and suddenly, you're staring at your desktop wallpaper.

- Community opinion (mostly forums) has an overwhelming influence on game balance changes. There used to be lovely surveys you could fill out, but they just went into a void somewhere. 

Now you'll log in to Steam one day and find a newly released patch has run a rough-toothed hairbrush over the UI like: rushed descriptor tiles with spelling errors and broken hotkeys, unit abilities nerfed, commander skill trees rearranged, and building resource prerequisites changed.
 
- Custom (non-historical) skins and/or victory strikes cause issues in the multiplayer lobby. You'll usually be asked to disable them before a game commences; for whatever reason, this just wasn't implemented properly.

- There are too many commanders. These were a selling point for the game back in the early days. I've played a great number of them. They're mostly repetitions of the same theme:  underpowered or poorly balanced.

- Community management is a joke. Certain swear words are auto-sanitised (the F word becomes garden), and that's just the beginning.

Toxic players are rife. You‚Äôll be hard-pressed to find good natured people who want to play collaboratively, which is a must to victory in this game. Lone wolves are ostracised quickly and viciously.

Tall poppy syndrome is also real. Don‚Äôt let your shine come out too strong.

Newbies in automatch games are witness to the community at its especially mean, vitriolic and rank/status obsessed worst. Team-stacking is common (they suck, we're pro) and divisive. 

There used to be a ranking system, but it never worked at the best of times.

- High munition call-ins (200+) delivered by plane are often shot down pathetically easily. What was the point of all that sacrifice if they can't even deliver a payload?

- Halftracks typically have paper armour. They don‚Äôt last long against small arms fire. Meanwhile, the Kubelwagen 'sedan' is comparatively a damage sponge, which makes no sense.

- Mortar fire is too fast, accurate and furious to make for enjoyable tactical play with your infantry. The Soviet heavy mortar is particularly ridiculous. Forget about long engagements behind cover, the heat-seeking projectile of mortar will demolish you.

- Grenades are hard to use. They require excellent timing, precise aim and a good interpretation of cover, terrain & enemy squad model positioning.

- Small arms close-range units, like the Thompson, have really wild RNG, even at obscenely close range. Sometimes you unfairly ruin an enemy squad with ridiculous high damage. Other times, you might as well be throwing potatoes.

Many maps are wide open, dirt-ditched with flowing roads and fences; choose an assault commander and it'll will ruin somebody's day: yours.

- So. Many. DLC components. I mean seriously, the start menu is literally a carousel with ads for its upgrades. 

- Laying mines, making caches and using resource trucks is weirdly divisive in online games. Don‚Äôt be an altruist, nobody will thank you for it.

- Like real war, the CoH2 battlefield is full of yelling, death throes, explosions and radio static. The cacophony of these sounds mixed together is too much sometimes. If you turn it off, you lose valuable battlefield info.

- Online games have no pause function. It can be incredibly stressful if something happens in real life that sees you AFK, like the doorbell ringing. You‚Äôll come back to all your stuff dead, your fellow players raging and your enemy gloating. 

- Some vehicles, particularly the medium-heavy tanks, have laughably bad pathing. A key point of the game is about hitting weaker side and rear armor; good luck striking that Panzer IV on the arse when your Cromwell tank is doing burnouts.

- Blobbing ruins this game. I don't care about your faction. 5-6 squads of infantry are just an abuse of the population cap and defeat the spirit of the game. 

The only counter to masses of infantry is to throw missiles/projectiles, or blow up with a charge, rinse and repeat.

This is meant to be a game of flank cat-and-mouse. What good is that if you can just overwhelm anything with bodies.

- Because of the variable player base, it can take HOURS to play a satisfactory online game. Expect to be sitting in the lobby twiddling your thumbs. Or, expect someone to rage quit in the first five minutes and ruin the game.

- Expert CPU is a belligerent, bona fide cheater. Nobody wants to play against CPU in multiplayer matches online for this very reason. It sees through fog of war, has ridiculous resource bonuses, and never gets tired like a human.

- Mac, Linux and PC clients can't play together online. This is more of a Feral Interactive decision, perhaps because of the code base. This means you have disparate communities for what otherwise amounts to a great and still lively fanbase.

- There will never be perfect fairness parity between factions. This is an extremely divisive point, whether allies or axis are ultimately more powerful.

Let‚Äôs talk tanks for example. German armour has high HP and deflects a lot of hits. US armour has low HP only the Jackson penetrates reliably, Soviet armour is more diverse but hardly deflects hits, British armour is expensive and sluggish. Call it historical accuracy if you will, but these are my findings.

- Games are won and lost on the fuel point.

== Here's what I recommend ==

Seriously bro , I really love this game  , I respect the studio of this game . BUT I don't want to see the FALSE HISTORY !!!! I know , In the COLD WAR period , Western Europe and the United Stats (the NATO) are the enemies of the Soviet Union , but that doesn't mean you can calumniate it ALL THE TIME ! For we are alliance to fight against NAZI in World War II ! The Soviet Union maybe not that good , but it's not that bad too ! If you guys just work for your STUPID politics instead of facing the true history , I don't think you can live longer .
The commissars can never hide behind soldiers , or kill them if they retreat , The are the leaders if soldiers are  charging . The Soviet Union had the strongest heavy industries , So the vehicles , rifles and other weapons were never lacking . They could never act with utter disregard for civilians and soldiers' lives ! We Chinese and the Soviet Union made the GREATEST SACRIFICE to the World War II ! And you just tell this as the incapacity of leadership , and deny our devotion ?! Don't you think it's ridiculous ?
There's no true enemies on this world , only true benefits . If you cannot recognize the history correctly , your 
ONLY end is  FAILURE . For the truth is always unbeatable and visible ! NO matter how hard you want to hide it !
ALL HAIL THE TRUTH OF HISTORY !
ALL HAIL THE SOVIET UNION !
ALL HAIL THE SOCIALISM !
ALL HAIL THE COMMUNISM !",1665401073,1665401950,False,6,2,0.477591842412948608,1,True,False,False

Your infantry is less vulnerable and tanks are not the death machines they used to be. The game has changed a lot since its release, but has finally become a fairly balanced game. Oberkommando West is a bit overpowered in my opinion, but I feel the same way about the original CoH's Panzer Elite faction.

I also feel some commanders are significantly better than others. In particular, I feel that commanders involving air support are some of the weakest in the game. Your air force is great for dropping paratroopers, team weapons, and supplies, but is not very effective at attacking the enemy from their planes. Why make commanders (and sell them to players) that are not very fun or competitive? Still, all five factions are fun to play. The original campaign is fun and the Ardennes Assault campaign is even better, adding an element of grand strategy to an RTS game.

I strongly object to the way the DLC is handled. Access to all of the game's units and abilities requires owning all commanders. Buying all of the commanders can be expensive and certain commanders are only available in the Relic in-game store. I have no problem with publishers making money on overpriced cosmetic DLC, but when the DLC is integral to the experience of the game, I don't think it should be treated as a cash cow.",1665146510,1665146786,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But personally i prefer this one because i find maintaining your units to be easy in this one rather then 1. Although  1 had better infantry  combat and a bit of a pain in the butt to get all your men in cover it was still fun. I do miss how  medics wont bring back wounded yeah.  

Yeah the armor is not super realistic and a light tank can destroy a tiger, honestly it pains me to say this i am actually ok with that in a sence. Sure it brake historical armor accuracy but it adds balance to a degree. And if you want realistic battle search the super active Workshop with tones of gamemodes and maps along with tuneing packs. And the most fun and intence part i get with the game is the ""all units 150 mod & cheat commands"" i use cheats to give both me and ai infinite resources so they spawn a good amount of weapons and tanks. Play it on victory points and you will fight for your life. But the way i play with infinite resources is, i use a bit what the enemy uses and try to counter then but try not to spam. And i even added tiger 1 with OKW. Now i understand the pain of DLC microtransaction but Ardennes assault is super fun and it has a replay value to it. And the 3 armies are tricky but as soon as you understand how they work they are worth it. But other then that i would say COH2 and 1 are both equal in there own gameplay style but i slightly prefer 2 over 1.

And again with the DLC i understand people hate DLC and hate needing to pay money for other commanders/Skins. Well your wrong the skins and Commanders can take a long time to obtain via loot but when you do get a Commander or enough Gold to buy one for your army you feel so rewarded as if you just obtained a gold Medal in a sport.

This game has none of the soul of the original; after 30 minutes I requested a refund. It generally feels like a beta version of the original. The GUI is amateur, the animations are basic and unimmersive. Examples include the fact that all soldiers in a squad are often in the exact same animation at the same time, sometimes soldiers occupy the same space. They also just walk up to enemies and don't react to incoming fire or use cover as naturally as in the original. It all just spoils the immersion and makes it feel very mechanical. Never noticed any of this in the old game.

My advice is just to replay the original game, which has plenty of depth and walks a very precise line between realistic immersion and great gameplay.",1664315895,1664315895,False,2,0,0.50844275951385498,0,True,False,False

If you think this is a strategy game that actually requires tactics, maybe at the top tier of the game, but most players just send out blobs of infantry in mindless waves or what I have dubbed turtle waves (spamming support units) and then if you're facing any faction + commander that can build fortifications they just spam those. 

I'm sure all the ""haters"" will come flowing out and start saying ""Get better, get good, you're dumb or whatever"". I've utilized all sorts of counters to those strats and enter the imbalance.

Massed infantry = broken if you're allies. You think your MG is going to suppress them in time? Wrong. You think two will supress? Maybe but oh wait there is their teammate with their blob. You think the few squads and a mortar will stop them? Nope, wrong again. If you're playing anything but allied factions, you're going to have a rough time. Apparently, all Axis infantry were made of torn in half paper wads and bubblegum because the wind blows the wrong direction and half of your squad is blown away.

But, wait....why don't you just play the Allied factions...well mixed bag. I have played all the factions and I would like to play all of them, but I'm not one that likes to dig in and wait for a countdown constantly. This is WW2 setting not WW1 where offensive actions were planned months in advance for just a few inches of earth. Which unless you're facing some crazy overwhelming axis players, its usually an easy win if you do this. Unless your allied teammates are failboxes.

Overall, I like the setting. I used to like the gameplay, but its a mixed bag of luck + if you learn from your own mistakes then you have to deal with poor teammates ~60% of the time until you can get to the higher tiers of players.

Multiplayer's had updates even recently, though I only played a few matches when it really mattered to me (and when I had rather shit local internet, I might add). Might try again, but no guarantees; prefer playing games with the same people over a mic, or not at all online but with a great enough narrative in single-player.

Soviet/base game campaign has a great background narrative about it (with inconsistencies to IRL for those in the niche). The Soviet war machine is presented in both a good and bad light, so as to allow the viewer to decide whether all warfare is based (or not). Your humble beginnings in the footsteps of Lev Abramovich Isakovich will bring you from the front lines a mere footsteps away from Moskow, to fighting Germans during the harshest of Winters, to pushing the Wehrmacht lines back, all under the careful guidance of your local Commissar. Eventually you will reach the famed moment of rushing down Berlin and the Reichstag itself. Much history, wewo.

Only recommend the Ardennes Assault for the truly sadomasochistic. The Multiplayer updates entered conflict with the way the Campaign files were designed, and the Devs still weren't given permission to edit Campaign files due to some bullshit technicalities. Shame on them, honestly; the Airborne company are practically crippled from having snipers, requiring you to purchase an additional DLC for the Fox company and their ""le epig"" rangers, so as to replace them. The Ardennes Campaign dynamics are only somewhat predictable, and even on normal difficulty it's not uncommon to suddenly encounter a Konigtiger or a well placed Panther. With guns that big cover won't really matter. There are people that counter these, glitch through them or refresh the mission through editing or alt+f4 (=rq).

Trial and error can produce results.

Mathcmaking will repeatedly put the *literal best players in the entire game* against you and a team of people who barely know how to play an RTS. Reporting people is a colossal hassle, requires nebulous 'proof' that basically means ""do literally everything for us and then half the time we'll tell you the screenshots you barely had time to take and the steamid and other info you found juuust aren't quite  enough for us"". If YOU get banned, you get a nebulous ""chat violation"" with no idea whether it's certain words that are automatically filtered out by the game anyway or what.

Games balance has slightly improved outside some serious issues being patched out, but the matchmaking has gotten far, far worse. They put a rank 1000 up against literally rank 1 in 4v4 automatch. Being rank 300 means you might have a chance if you play hard, but doing 4 randoms vs. the top player who's in a premade team has no excuse.
The community is as toxic as ever, with people either going afk, belligerence, and reporting players has become *even harder* than in the past.

And in 2022 you have more maphacks than ever, RNG that is completely broken and makes no sense (Your squad has 2 models left at full health? Watch them both die on retreat at max range. Enemy squad has 1 model with no hp left? Watch them walk away POINT BLANK from 3 squads and never die). Rockets vanishing into thin air instead of missing or hitting anything, just vanishing NEXT to the target they were shot at. Rampant toxicity, and a balance team that does anything but.

Finally installed CELO to see what the actual ranks of people in matchmaking were. Turns out THAT feature is COMPLETELY broken. 4v4? You can tell who wins before the match even starts, since one team will get a literal top 10 player and 6 other people in the match will be mediocre and the remaining player will probably be opposite the top 10 guy and fail so hard they couldn't beat the tutorial.

Any positive reviews are lieing to you. The campaign is broken because the devs used the same units for multiplayer rather than keeping them separate, so that balance is 100% screwed. DLC? Game will tell you ""you already own this"" on Steam, but says ""You don't own this"" in game.

Never buying another RELIC product again. First DoW3, then finally realizing this game is specifically designed to both ""be realistic war with randomness thrown in!"" but also ""totally legit competitive game with balance, yo!"". Handed off to community balance team years ago, who focus solely on 1v1, ignoring the MOST played mode of 4v4. The FUNDAMENTAL DESIGN of this game having so much RNG prevents it from EVER being a competitive E-Sports game, yet that is precisely what the devs have pushed for for years- despite nobody wanting that.",1443941433,1662019167,False,1,0,0.496732026338577271,0,True,False,False

Basic quality of life feature are missing, like rebinding the hotkey (yes, you read it correct, you cannot rebind a hotkeys in this supposed strategy game, if the default key does not suit your hand then sucks to be you), there is no player count during matchmaking and no rejoin during the match.

In game monetization are a grind, these are not one of those cosmetic-only items that you purchases, these things include abilities and commanders that affect the gameplay, so if what the game provided at the start does not suit you then good luck grind it for weeks until you can buy ONE new commanders.

Let's talk about grinds, when you finish a multiplayer matches the game give you 1500 score points plus 500 if you win, now for these score points when it reach 5000 it will convert into a ""lootbox"" that will automatically open for you. In this ""lootbox"" can contain new abilities or new commanders that can be useful in improving your gameplay, however most of the time you will get a random skins for your tanks (which are almost useless) or a WHOPPING 500 coins. And how much a new commander costs? 15000 coins, or you could pay up with your real money. Assuming your average match take around 30 minutes (which depends) and also assuming you win every match, you will get 1000 coins for every 3 hours, to buy a new commander you will have to play for a total of 45 hours plus whatever additional time spends in matchmaking, and this assuming you win every match (not possible for me but maybe you could), not prematurely disconnected because Relic server does not like you (which can happen often depend on the day), not crashing mid-match and most importantly the ""lootboxes"" consistently give you 500 coins and not some random useless tank skins that are painfully plentiful.

THE AI UNIT NAVIGATION IS LITERAL GARBAGE. I've extensively played other RTS games like SC2, C&C, etc, that are older by 10+ years and they ALL have considerably better unit navigation. It really feels like they spent 95% of the game's development in graphics and game mechanics, and 5% in everything else. Don't get me wrong. The game is pretty good for being over 9 years old. But It's really a game breaker for me when I tell a unit to do something and it decides to take literally the longest damn route to get to that location, or CONSTANTLY does it in a way where it is showing its arse towards the enemy for the majority of it's movement. While there is a feature of doing a ""reverse"" maneuver, it literally never works as you want it to. This is on official maps btw. I can understand some unit nav being wonky on custom maps.

In comparison with the first game, the unit roster is a bit more streamlined.  And the focus shifts from overwhelming the enemy with a tank rush to coordinating your strikes alongside fellow players and/or with mixed arms tactics.  The game engine itself (again 9-years old) has held up remarkably well.  Well enough to keep me playing almost a decade into the game's life cycle.

The beloved V-1 rocket may have been removed, but never fret. Allocate a SturmTiger and deafen everyone with the force of a Depth Charge.
Want to rain death on the battlefield? Sure, the Nebelwerfer's gone, but in place stands any form of Rocket Arty you wish - Panzerwerfer, Stuka zu Fus, Sherman Calliope, Katyusha, and Land Mattress -because the naval fun doesn't end at the sea.

Fun doesn't stop there. Get inventive. ""Clown Car"" with flamethrower engineers aboard. Mortars with flame rounds. U.S. Pack Howitzers with White Phosphor rounds, U.K. Land Mattress with White Phosphor rounds. You want flames? We got flames.
You ever wanted to just go onto forums and bathe in sodium? Fear not comrade. You no longer have to delve into the pits of League of Legends. Two minutes on our fine forums will be enough salt to turn a lake into an ocean, then enough toxicity to turn the ocean into a biohazard. Or is that not your cup of tea?

You can't play this game alone (sure, you've 1 v 1, but that mode more competitive than fun) and coordinating with strangers is difficult.
The game is very unstable. This is the real reason I'm writing this angry review. Even if you have a decent setup like I do, the game crashes 6 out of 10 times you get into a match. You wait 5 minutes to get into a match, play hard (as Allies; the game ridiculously easy as Axis by comparison, especially against the AI) for some 20 minutes and.... surprise! The screen freezes and you drop from the game. Dropping this way doesn't give you any rewards either, so you lost half an hour of your time for nothing. I can't tolerate this nonsense anymore and I'm abandoning this game for now. Let's be real, there are plenty of other games that I own and I don't want to waste my time with a game that crashes all the time: you might want to do the same.
The base game's campaign is a pathetic. The story vilifies you-know-who. I played most chapters on all three difficulties just for the achievements. It has incorporated every conceivable stereotype there is about the war in the Eastern Front. It's depiction of the brutality of the war is fake. 
Besides the community can be dreadfully toxic at times. Plus your typical Axis player spams ""izi, good game"" when they are winning and quit the moment they lose a few vehicles. I recommend practicing against the hard AI (DO NOT try to play against expert AI); and since it's AI, there is very little room for toxicity. 
The Allied armies are not strong enough and playing them will probably remain difficult for new players. The game is unbalanced since it's said that the developers care only about feedback from a small minority of competitive players (Don't believe me? Play as Allies and watch a panther, like a fat cow rushing at mach 4,  annihilate half your army with just a dive or two; your AT guns will either miss their shots or the tank will bounce the shots). Big team modes like 3v3 and 4v4 are frustrating for new Allied players...

Recommended w/ reservations. If you like these Relic games, then ... you're not even reading this.

Coming from a more C&C & even a bit of AoE background -- i.e. more of a unit spammer -- this RTS style is not my default. (I did play a decent amount of World In Conflict. Similar econ model.) But I am growing to appreciate it.

Anyway, it was free and I bought the DLC for $5 too so gga. If you missed that then uh .. yeah ""highly recommended .. (let's get more ppl playing this free game i got *snicker*)""

I'm not into the frothy MP scene (and if you are: again, you're not reading this) so comp stomps and an occasional pvp game are all i get out of them. And since i usually get to them late in their lifecycles, such games usually take an unfortunate while to matchmake. Campaign .. yeah I played a bit but I rarely feel like doing the whole ""cutscenes"" thing etc. Lots of games to play and that's just kinda ... i'd rather be playing. The best games drop story on you without interrupting you or postponing your interaction in general. (The best software avoids postponing interaction, in general. Imagine that!)

This makes it devolve into a tank rush grind. I guess they wanted us to really feel like we were sending wave after wave of expendable conscripts into the meat grinder. Well, mission accomplished, I guess. And, the challenge levels are really lacking in personality and narrative. You might say that's not required. But, you could say the same thing about the main campaign. It was still nice to see cinematics, and flavor dialogue in them.

What isn't a valid criticism is the complaints a lot of Russian fans had about the unflattering portrayal of the Soviets. I guess they wanted a game titled ""Company of Heroes"" to emphasize the heroism of the Soviet soldiers. And yes, while it did have some of that, it could have done it more. But, I don't think showing the faults of Communist Russia was a mistake.

(Oh and as a quick aside, on the subject of current events with the Ukraine, [spoiler]I'm more sympathetic of Russia than most of my fellow Americans. Then again, military aggression is military aggression; and Putin just didn't have casus belli to do what he did. Saying there were Nazis, or at least people who self-identified as such, on the Ukrainian side doesn't change that.[/spoiler])

The game showed the Russian Army (1)burning fields with their own soldiers in it, (2)blowing a bridge with their troops still on the other side, (3)shooting retreating soldiers, (4)abandoning the Warsaw Uprising to the Nazis, (5)killing Poles. (6)It was strongly implied that they were committing war crimes against German civilians. And, (7)they put dissidents into the gulag. Or, as one Russian put it about this game, ""They would have us believe that each one Russian was in the gulag; and each other Russian was guarding them."" I'm sorry though, what CoH 2 showed was a lot closer to truth than to slander.

Sure, I imagine that if the NKVD set fields alight with their own soldiers in them it was with the belief they would be able to escape the flames. The Russian Pole murder we know about was the Katyn massacre, not during the Warsaw Uprising. And, the shooting retreating soldiers things is debatable. Mind you there were blocking units, and their guns were not for show. Then again every army in the world has military police that may have the same duty in a desperate war. I mean, why do you think U.S. M.P.s have Ma Deuces?

Which brings us to the bridge thing. I'm certain that happened. Why? Because, just as every army in the world has a doctrine for blocking units, every army in the world has clear doctrine for what you do with a bridge rigged to blow, your own soldiers still on the other side, and the enemy in sight. That's S.O.P. You blow the bridge. Every time. Mind you, the thinking is your soldiers should be able to, abandon their vehicles, and swim across, with your forces providing covering fire.

As for the abandoning the Warsaw Uprising, that's another debatable one. The Russians claimed a German counter-offensive prevented them from relieving the city. Though German accounts are a bit lacking in their successfully driving off the Soviet advance.

The war crimes against German civilians, especially the rape of 10s, if not 100s, of thousands of German women, and girls, is well documented. The Soviet Army leadership didn't even deny this. They sort of took the attitude of ""boys will be boys"". (Yeah put that in your toxic masculinity ad' Gillette.}

As for the gulags, look the Soviet economy sucked. And there was a drive to ideologically purify the Russian people. They needed slave labor; and they needed to do something with the millions of citizens who needed to be reeducated into being better Communists. The gulags were seen as a way to solve both problems at once.",1659854979,1659854979,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

+ If you are not playing the mods ""Wikinger"" or ""SPEARHEAD"", you are wasting your time.
+ Great Workshop content with many costume made maps.
+ The other armies worth buying, but the Single Player missions are boring.

Cons:
- Campaigns are aweful and boring (including DLC).
- The Vanilla game damage system is dumb. 
- This game is going to rip you off with all the payable generals (hence: tons of micro-transactions).
- Too bad you can't involve the mods outside skirmish (playing campaign with ""Wikinger"" could be dope experience).
- Workshop sometimes respond slowly or not responding at all.
- Toxic community, I got random teammate attack my HQ because I was ""too defensive"".

Going on nearly ten years old, you'd be hard pressed to find any RTS games within that time frame that remotely hold up against CoH2. While not perfect, I do love this game. 

The factions all feel very unique from one another, which is no easy feat since there are no genetic differences. A lot of RTS games rely on fictional races to differentiate between factions, which is not bad by any means. The combat is addicting and challenging. It has very competitive levels while also chill levels in co-op and big 4v4 games where stress is taken off of you as an individual player. The community is also really solid, and you'll find great videos on YouTube and streams on Twitch.

The campaigns are also really engaging and tell good stories. While I imagine some of the Soviet story has some exaggerations, it tells a dark tale of a Lieutenant becoming a reporter after being wounded in battle. Truly a well told story for an RTS. The Ardennes campaign - DLC - is also great by engaging the player with three companies of American troops for the Ardennes campaign during WW2. Ranger company is DLC. 

To be honest, the only negative thing I have to say about the game is SEGA's handling of monetization. They do the same thing with Total War as well. They nickel and dime you for commanders, factions, etc. Thankfully I got everything on sale. The game is old, so it's easy to get the stuff pretty cheap. 

The game has a steep learning curve, but don't get frustrated. Just keep at it, and you'll enjoy it like me. Can't wait for CoH3!",1659031861,1659031861,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Whether that be a workshop ruleset, Victory Points, or simple Annihilation, CoH 2 has all the right pieces to feel like the commander of an army. Has both single player and multiplayer. The former more story driven unique setpieces and the latter a deep pool of gameplay, especially with the ability to utilize the Steam Workshop for mod content.
The game is challenging, and in scenarios where pause is disabled, the pressure can really ramp up.
When you are neck and neck with your opponent and multiple fights are breaking out across the map, you may struggle to keep up with the pace of everything. Learning keybindings, squad grouping, and cover advantages will be key to tipping battles in your favor.
CoH 3 is on the horizon, and longtime players are looking to move to the latest and greatest, but that doesn't mean there isn't game to play here. I spend a significant portion of my time against custom AI arrangements and still manage to have a challenging good time. I personally recommend picking up the camera zoom playmodes, as the standard camera range is uncomfortably restricted. There is some graphical and gameplay fidelity but it is worth it in my opinion for the better battlefield visibility.
DLC content isn't mandatory, but certainly expands the available scenarios and playstyles. If you are hesitant about starting out, pick it up on sale without any DLC and try it out. Most people will quickly pick up if this is their game or not.",1658796970,1658796970,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you like playing Campaign mission, get the CoH 2 Base Game and Ardennes Assault.
If you like playing on Multiplayer Skirmishes, get the Base Game, Western Front Armies Pack (USF and OKW) and the British Forces DLC.

Multiplayer was dominated by a lot of shady commanders strongly resembling P2W and questionable map balance in the early years, followed by times of mixed developments. The start of dedicated community involvement in terms of faction balancing and map design has sparked an age of massive improvements for this game. This was quite obvious the case in the last years. Faction and map balance might not be as polished as in other RTS games, but are in a great spot currently, despite the perceived lack of a long-term strategic vision from the developer and/or publisher.

While Company of Heroes 2 has introduced criticizable changes and innovations, such as a simplified resource point system and the blizzard mechanic, it stays true to the spirit of its legendary predecessor. In order to succeed in the game's unique style of tactical skirmishes, adaptive and smart decision making, such as proper unit positioning, is demanded rather than pure APM-based micromanagement of units. Yes, you will need a certain amount of APM to succeed in the game's automatch games, however, the threshold is far lower than in other RTS games.

With the help of community activity and involvement Company of Heroes 2 has become one of the pillars of the RTS genre. In fact, this game has eclipsed a lot of newly released RTS competitor games, such as Grey Goo, Dawn of War 3 and Iron Harvest, and its playerbase is still quite healthy today. When analyzing the recent ""30-Day Avg."" statistic in Steam Charts (27th June 2022), Company of Heroes 2 even outperformed Age of Empires IV by a small margin, reinforcing the fact how dedicated the community is.

This is not a great game as you've been thinking. Despite the historically innacurate soviet campaign (Im not from Russia, and its still bad) the game is full of bugs and the AI is incredible bad coded, compared to the first games of the series. Also the multiplayer is very unbalanced, the tank battles sucks, if you think your Tiger will be a great deal... better think it again.

Also theres some videos on youtube with very useful reviews, talking about Relic...always see the reviews before buying their games and for this one...I dont recommend it, you be frustrated as hell...

Also there are only 2 proper campaigns, both allied :/ The only German ones aren't really proper campaigns just a series of missions, they are set early in the war (1941) but the proper equipment isn't supplied ie no Russian T26's BT tanks etc, plus no German Panzer III, which was the main Battle tank of that period!

So lets talk about the story part of them game. Yes it does show soviets as blood hungry monsters that make you sometimes sympathise with the germans but that has been the theme in every game of this period. USA story brings you to the ardennes forrest and its a great bit of fun. I do recommend them both.

Now on the multiplayer. My god the cinematic competitve gameplay is something that will have your mind blown. The screaming amazing voicelines of the infrantry, the roaring of the engines from tanks and light vehicles. I never had a copmetitive style game immerse so hard into its self that i feel like a genuine general during a war.
The community in my almost 1,7k hours has been pretty helpful and kind. Ofcourse there are toxic people but many others over exaggerate the amount of it (Dont worry this is not League of Legend or CSGO). It takes sometime to pick up the games mechanics but nothing too crazy.

Now onto the DLC. Honestly pick up the platinum edition from Instant gaming or where ever if you dont want to spend the full price but i did buy my the legit way to support Relic.

All in all to end it here i will say you will not make a mistake by buying this game, it is one of the best RTS games out there and its great bit of fun with the 3rd instalment on the horizon.

Hope to see new faces on the battlefield :D

Unlike its rival MEN OF WAR ASSAULT SQUAD 2 where a tank has ballistic penetration points, has weaknesses in specific points and can even ricochet small and large caliber weapons where the projectile can hurt allied or even enemy troops. , the tank crew can not only be disembarked but everyone has personal inventory as well as the vehicle too!

Ammo expenditure, fuel and many other factors were thought of in MEN OF WAR, which is different in COMPANY OF HEROES, in this the focus is on tactical fun without being tied to many individual details, troops and some vehicles have special powers conferred that faction, yet both super fun games for lovers of a good RTS.

====================

Para quem j√° jogou m√∫ltiplos jogos e sabe a diferen√ßa de um shooter para se divertir e um t√°tico, o Company of Heroes √© como se fosse jogos como Battlefield ou mesmo um Counter Strike...√© um jogo para se divertir mas onde as mec√¢nicas dos elementos de jogo s√£o bem simplificadas, assim como a bal√≠stica!

Diferente de seu rival o MEN OF WAR ASSAULT SQUAD 2 onde um tanque de guerra tem pontos de penetra√ß√£o bal√≠stico, tem fraquezas em pontos esp√©cificos e at√© mesmo pode ricochetear disparos de armas pequenas e de grande calibre onde o proj√©til pode ferir tropas aliadas ou mesmo inimigas, a tripula√ß√£o do tanque n√£o s√≥ pode ser dembarcada como todos tem invent√°rio pessoal assim como o ve√≠culo tamb√©m!

Gasto de muni√ß√£o, comb√∫stivel e muitos outros fatores foram pensados no MEN OF WAR, o que √© diferente no COMPANY OF HEROES, neste o foco esta em uma divers√£o t√°tica sem se prender a muitos detalhes individuais, as tropas e alguns ve√≠culos possuem poderes especiais conferidos aquela fac√ß√£o, contudo ambos os jogos super divertidos para os amantes de um bom RTS.

More than anything else, CoH2 increases the monetization capacity without all too new mechanics or units. CoH2 is not much more than a DLC with extra DLC on top of it , when compared to CoH1 and i don't think the ""upgrade"" is worth the money. I feel like there are 2 situations where i find this game a somewhat recommendable purchase: 1. You don't have CoH1, 2. You are new to strategy games overall.

I find this game to fail at delivering an authentic experience. Units unable to fire more than 50 meters, unprotected soldiers surviving a million shots, Tanks having a really unrealistic damage calculation, leaving you with extreme RNG and sometimes weapons are just so underwhelming compared to their visuals. A direct hit of a 75mm Shell, causing a big explosion and a 10 m dustcloud, on a single soldier? Nothing, The soldier will take 5 more of those. The same shot hitting a Tank? Blasted into oblivion. I get that that is by design to keep the competetive integrity, but it just feels so underwhelming. 

The AI, both for AI-Opponents as well as for your units is aged at best, or bad at worst. Giving orders will function quickly, but units executing the order just does not. A movement order will see your infantry collecting at the center of their formation before running to where you commanded them to go every now and then, making explosives extremely powerful everytime this happens. 

In my honest opinion games like Men of War or Steel Division are way more enjoayble experiences, since what happens on screen makes sense, with CoH there is almost no logical link between what happens visually and what happens statistically. That combined with the fact that the main step made by CoH2 is reused DLC's and assets from CoH1, combined with an ingame shop for gameplay affecting items that are extremely slow to obtain by playing just doesn't do enough for me to give it a positive. I don't hate the game, but i find it to be a below average product.",1652186847,1652186847,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As British you can struggle to counter just one tank, swing and miss with several AT, Bofors, tanks, whatever, while the opponent can just drive around being fucking care with one tank. You are lucky enough to have a tank? Better keep an eye on it, because it can get wasted in a second by just a bunch of troops with AT (who rarely miss, like yours). Or better, you finally got one tank, havent even used Fuel on Bofors, but hey, the enemy have 5 OP tanks ready to destroy you, along with their OP infantry, even thou they lost all the resource points. Hella fun!

You know the tank spam are coming, but even with several AT ready, you need so many hits to take out just one tank, and mostly they just drive away before that and come back with even more tanks. Only way to win is if the enemy makes a blunder and that rarely happens on higher levels. Even if you build a freakin TANK DESTROYER, the shot just does nothing on higher lvl AXIS tanks, I mean WTF.

But sure, let me try to micro like a MF and struggle to see if I can get lucky and wheel my AT in position without losing them aswell. Then pray that the enemy dosent notice the 10 hits i need to take down one tank before he moves it, or just run me over with 4 units of mid ranged SMG¬¥s and whipe me in a second. 

Luckily I got the Bofors and AT cannon. Two static positions that can just be bombarded as soon as discovered by the enemy. Or just smoked off and spammed with the AT troops. Great way to waste resources.

But no worries, really, really late, you can make one decent tank on the same level as your enemy. Only problem is all that time you have been harrased by better tanks and the enemy now have 5 of them. GL Chump!",1651593547,1651593547,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

In the CoH series, we can see supply points, such as:

- Manpower
- Ammo
- Fuel

In several moments through a match, you can take advantage (or depend of) one of those resources. Each supply point will be fought fiercely and sometimes, only one extra point can give a tactic advantage leading you to the victory!

Playing 1x1 , 2x2, 3x3 or 4x4, you combine several types of tactics using Commanders or Intel Bulletins. Some will match with your own strategies or can be decisive to support your allies in a push for victory!

I've playing CoH 2 for years and it's a grateful surprise see this game is still being updated (We got a more stable 64-bit version of the game a couple of years ago!). The community creates their own ladders and Championships, keeping the flame lit, of this great WWII RTS game!

It's quite a bit different from usual RTS games as it heavily rewards keeping your units alive which is frankly a bit of fresh air from many others where swaths of units are laid waste only to be instantly replaced. The controls are a bit difficult to pick up, but once you've got it down it's very satisfying the amount of control you have over the battlefield and your units. This game really rewards both strategy at micro and macro levels. If you are interested in the subject matter and like RTS, this game is definitely worth a look.

A word of warning is that it has a fairly steep learning curve, even more so if you are a veteran of RTS. It plays quite a bit differently and takes some getting used to. Additionally, the community surrounding this game and its multiplayer can be very toxic. I would highly recommend playing with friends or finding people to play with through discords/reddits etc. The random matchmaking can be really hit or miss, both for matching proper skill level and for wild fluctuations in toxicity.

Overall, its a great game that WW2 enthusiasts will likely love.",1650326186,1650326186,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The Campaign follows the Russian offensives against the German advances during World War 2. You can also play other Campaigns through DLC. From the famous ""Battle of Stalingrad"" to the historical ""Capturing of the Reichstag"" you will put yourself in the position of how the Soviets overcame the unstoppable German blitzkrieg. 

The game is quite simply an amazing real time strategy. With improved graphics, terrain, explosions, sounds and of course the addition of units (some that dont come into play until the later years of the war). The game must be played precise and approached in a strategic manner, world war 1 tactics will not work here. There are times when units vs units collide, one will always have the advantage over the other. You have to include support, abilities that can be attained to aid in your advances, you must protect your economy (i.e munitions and fuel). At times you must be cautious of ambush, or at times you will be pressured to take an aggressive position more than a defensive one in terms of being bombarded by say a German Haftrack with multiple rocket launchers.

I believe the best action in this game is the might of the tanks of the factions. From the German heavy tanks such as the famed ""King Tiger"" and the monstrous ""Elefant"". To Russia's answer of the IS- 152 named after Stalin himself and other notables such as the T34 and the KV series. The precision and attention to detail is highlighted and weaknesses are shown depending on your position and angle or approach of the attacking. It really does show that when a minor tank such as German Stug tries firing on a IS-152, the shells just bounce off. However watching the IS-152 returning fire, I did enjoy the full force of a heavy shell hitting it and rocking the chassis like a chair. Tanks are also prone to being ambushed by anti tank guns such as the notorious PAK43 88mm and the Panzerschreck.

In closing, a quite incredible and fun game to play. A must play if you are interested in realistic War based RTS. I do look forward to the next installment of Company of Heroes 3!",1649655243,1649655340,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Many things are unbalanced up until now and problems won't be easily fixed because most of the team left this game to develop CoH3.

Modders and Workshop Content are what making the game more enjoyable, it's fun when you play online but it's better to subscribe to mods rather playing if vanilla, those people on the workshop are keeping this game alive not devs. I'm really into a game where you can mod almost everything but CoH2 didn't support many of the features like Custom Models which will really improve the immersion from the mods!

Though the core game is fun, and I respect several aspects of this game. The direction on which this game has taken since the original developers dumped it have taken a horrible turn. 

Firstly with respect to campaign and theater of war. 
Several of the DLC Ardennse missions are bugged and with the original game code locked away, there is no hope of fixing them. (tank grab missions don't allow German controlled vehicles to actually be destroyed, or recaptured, especially on the harder difficulties)
Several Theater of war missions are drastically impossible and cannot be completed on all difficulties because of the impossible bonuses the enemy ai have acquired from the modding community in recent years. (Tiger ace, Oka river, and Kharkov pursuit are the three I know of and have persisted in trying to beat)
Other then that, several campaign achievements and theater of war/ skirmish achievements are now totally unachievable due to changes the mods have made to callable off map units, or bugs within the campaign code. (since the campaign code is locked from public, those achievements are locked, the others include issues with Partisans and German light cav units)

Secondly Multiplayer.
The community mods have taken a direction that seems totally passive for allowing illegal mods and droppers to persist. There are in fact several playbacks on various media platforms that shows blatant and disregarded hacks coming from playing multiplayer across the pacific ocean. These hacks are always summarized as basic loopholes or *chance* but never investigated even though several very true players crunch manpower ammunition and fuel consumption and some spawned vehicles or abilities should not be accessible. The other side of the multiplayer problem is that the community mods will never try to ban or punish people for intentionally dropping, or accidentally dropping but repeatedly. An example of this, is that I have personally encountered one person who would drop an auto-match ai game, regardless of difficulty just because it was a map they didn't like consistently (4 recorded times). After I tried to call them out for it, I was actually berated and warned for it. Seems totally fair right?

lastly to Community Mod behavior.
The last thing that happened that altered my attitude toward the game was A constructive criticism that I made on the discussion page. After posting it, and continually commenting on it for about a week. I was reported to steam community on *language* for a post that literally had zero *language* on it. The most offensive thing that was said between myself and another player was ""POOPOO GARBAGE"" in regards to poor and unbalanced ai scripting for campaign and skirmish battles. Note I did suggest a few options that I thought would make for better ai game play so the post would not constitute negative feedback. 

Summary.
Over all I'm almost ashamed to have played this game for so long (current playtime is about 1800 hours) when the original developers and a multiplayer only minded mod community have cared so little about what players want and actually need for the game to continue to thrive. DON'T BUT THIS GAME! At this point, there's zero community support and overall the game is a waste of money. Thankfully they are working on a third game that will hopefully be better monitored for hacking and community support then this seemingly failed project of theirs.",1649182139,1649182139,False,1,1,0.467829853296279907,0,True,False,False

Company of heroes 2 is a middle of the road game its too bad steam does not give you a 3rd option Here is my review

[Campagin]

The Campagin i felt was Very shoddy it wants to have depth but at the same time the few characters presented feel hollow Its like the red army will crush everything in its way you will burn a village with your own people in it & Yes that kinda plot can be done right i don't Think Relic does stories really the best it or even capture something truly historical to make you think about something but even the Expansions of The first game Had interesting characters The Lost tiger tank one was by far Their most memorable Work in that Regard

[Multplayer & Playerbase]

The multplayer suffers the same problem its a what were they thinking feature that people did in the first people will buy the game sit in a lobby & their not even interested in playing really Their not waiting for anyone & they will just kick people for a laugh even today if you go back to the origanlly these people will still exist in that game over a decade later Relic never even cared to address it or tried to have a report system to ban these people besides i will say that their is alot of commited company of heroes players it will always be on playing something even after all these years its not dead at all

[Atmosphere & Soundtrack]

For the over all feel of the game its missing the grittyness of the first game it over all feels watered down completely & the first was a stand out game at that back at its release The music You see the Composer Orignal game was for Jeremy Soule now but far hes not in the top range but the music was very simple but at the same time very memorable to this even the menu music to this day Their no reason at all to get rid of him whats here is generic & will never have you coming back to it


[Final Thoughts]

i thought i would mention this i know someone whos played The first game with 6000 hours to it because he played that almost game everyday since it was released on the disc copy before they forced you to use steam to play online who would been better to write this review but that's not his thing even he felt in his words ""no they ruined it""


[Mods & Remakes]

If you enjoyed the first game the maps are endless in this & still to this day people keep on creating in fact all company of heroes 1 maps have been recreated even the ones the campagin here you will have to look up their names or find a playlist as theirs too many to list & different peoples takes say winter on one map or one expanded Real work of the people it took the time to Port them over Directly in the Engine",1446941739,1648596801,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I honestly tried to love this game as much as i did with other RTS like Starcraft 2 and Red Alert 3. But without Air Force and Naval Units, the game can be boring and stale very quickly. 

Come on! Even Age of Empires have Navy.

Economy system is intangible, unlike traditional rts that you set the number of miners, harvesters to get resources etc.. here just order your forces to occupy that territory and that's it. Is this a Sid Meier Civ game?

Units are so goddamn slow. WW2 is gonna be over before my KV1 tanks reach the front lines.

Selecting any Infantry and pressing T  is when they run like hell towards the base and ignore you like you don't exist. Hey, stop and merge with the other.. Hey! Stop! 

Do this for machine gunners and watch the game break.

 After years of Nerf, fix, adjust --- Nerf, fix, adjust, most of it is worked out fairly well.

For example, It focused on the Order No. 227, claiming all commissars are ruthless piece of garbage who enjoys killing good soldiers for fun, which is just not the case in the real history. The protagonist is a featureless made-up freedom fighter who got sent to Siberia after doing the right thing, and depicted the battle of Berlin as purely a ""race to Berlin"" game to compete with West, at the cost of countless soldier lives. This is just hate in the name of hate, this made the real Soviet atrocities like jokes, when you fill a history based story with lies and propaganda. I didn't see red army fighting alongside with common folks in ditch outskirts of Moscow, I don't see fearless soldiers fighting rat warfare inn Stalingrad, I don't see operation Uranus, I didn't see the Battle of Kursk, I don't see it reflecting the fact 85% of Nazi casualties was dealt by Soviet - Just propaganda and smearing.

2. The AI is as stupid as it can be in most conditions. Tank maneuver is clunky like a joke, when you navigate it intensively to avoid being hit, with close and fine instructions to backup-forward-circle around, the computer always chose the worst option and always expose the rear to enemy artillery to get itself smashed. You can't even fix that by fine tuned mouse instructions.

Having said that, the game does have a tendency to nerf on faction so that it is significantly weaker than the others. In the beginning, the British were made out of paper and very static, so playing with them against anything except AI opponents was a challenge. The Soviets were also quite soft, but they made up for that with numbers. Their tanks were cheaper and they had some very good artillery and other indirect fire.

The Americans have always been resonably good. (The Americans usually are in any game, for some reason...) The Axis have two main army types in the OKW and the Wehrmacht. The OKW USED TO give you an edge with their main builder troops being very good for close range combat, but they were nerfed so now the only think OKW has is the ability to build base structures elsewhere than in the starting area. (Sort of like the British in the first game.) The Wehrmacht is ok, but also nerfed nowadays. The downside of playing with the Germans used to be that they cost a lot but they were always very good units. Nowadays, they both cost a lot AND are made out of paper. 

Excellent game, good variety in the armies, but awful patches. I really hope they fix the armies back to something akin what they were or else this game goes into the recycling bin. Unfortunately.",1601217189,1646946183,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h2] Game play feels like eating a soup with a fork, or using your mouse with the chopsticks [/h2]
You have to Micromanage with Crude, Crap controls. Half the time your troops don't respond to move orders, or take the wrong cover. Sometimes half the unit randomly stands in front of cover it's supposed to be behind, while the other half is properly behind it. Expect your mouse to be stuck in some [i](what feels like)[/i] multi-step command preventing you from executing a completely separate command. You will find yourself mashing Esc key a lot to exit from whatever bullshit multi-step command you're in. Unit selection and control is major pain point as well - it's many little things that happen often.

[h2] Game is like those massive Swiss-Army knifes - a bunch of functions & you got no clue what half them are and what they do  [/h2]
There is pretty much no tutorial: 1 tutorial mission that goes over the basic movement, cover and flanking. Not much else is explained, so once you go to campaign, most of the time you feel like you don't understand WTF is happening & what you're supposed to do. Units have many abilities most of which are not explained, apparently there also are a bunch of in-game purchase commanders that allow you to have even more troops with special abilities. Barely anything is covered, of course. Funny enough - the tutorial only goes over some of the German troops, while the only available campaign is Soviet - thanks game, it was sure useful.

[h2] Game is fun if you're the type of person that enjoys doing homework or preparing for assessments  [/h2]
Not having a clue about what I'm doing, I turned online to hopefully learn what was left out in the tutorial. There are a bunch of separate tips&tricks videos, however if you want to learn anything of substance, you'll find yourself spending more time searching for info & watching videos of game play, than you'll spend time playing the game. Reminds me of when I was going to college & had to be preparing power point presentations for assessments about a thing, rather than actually doing a thing.

What I have also learned online is that you're expected to memorize many different troops [i](there are a lot of those)[/i] and their abilities just so you wouldn't get absolutely wrecked. I can see how this can be fun from a veteran perspective - means there is a lot of content & strategies. However, what this means for newbie player is that you'll need to be memorizing a bunch of shit - an experience reminiscent of preparing of an exam. The game has a steep learning curve & you should expect to keep on getting wrecked and not understand why, until you memorize enough little details, or until by pure chance through sheer quantity of time wasted you'll stumble across a sequence of actions that tend to work for the most part.",1646493368,1646500862,False,0,0,0.422449022531509399,0,True,False,False

Edit: 
Now that I've played the game for almost 1100 hours (making this my most played game), it's safe to say that I've thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The game is fun, fast paced, and can lead to moments not seen in other games. However, I can understand why some people might dislike this game with it's high learning curve, and rng‚Äîwhich is not seen in other RTS games. I personally believe the RNG in this game gives it's own niche/gimmick unlike other RTS games, and force it to no longer be a game of rock paper scissors, unlike others.

I was expecting a game with slow and laborious units with little territory gains, instead I got a point capture game with multiple strategic elements. My original post recommended this game. However, after I encountered so many BUG SPLAT errrors and disconnects. I've decided to thumb it down. It's also Pay To Win. They were selling the rare British commanders (Blue) for cash.

[h1][b]PROS[/b][/h1]
1. No Bob-the-builder
You don't have to build many production facilities to mass produce your armies. It really helps that you don't have to worry about issues like trapping your units within your building maze.

2. Model Orientation
Having a zone of fire, front and back armour, angled shots and wall blocking really helped in creating strategy for the game. This is the one thing I don't really see in other Real Time Strategy Games, rushing from the front or the back yields the same result for other games.

3. Campaign
A lot of historical significance from World War II. I am unsure of its accuracy but I do hope that they got important details like dates, names, locations, who won and what went on correct.

4. Unit Cap / Pop Cap
Works pretty well. Having lesser units to control helps to balance the game for those with lower Actions Per Minute (APM)

5. Retreat
Very convenient button. It's good to use when you want your troops to run fast and back to base. Don't know why only infantry have them. Vehicles do not have retreat functions oddly.

6. Terrain and Weather
Surprisingly, there are a lot of interesting terrain. Ice which breaks when fire upon or when heavy tanks run over. Snow and Mud which affects your movement. Blizzards which kill your infantry (don't really like this one since tanks seems invulnerable to blizzards, making them more valuable).

[h1][b]CONS[/b][/h1]
1. DLC, DLC, DLC
Everything I see on the store page is DLC, DLC, DLC. It is annoying to know that you can't play certain sides unless you splash out the dough. I've heard that there are expansion packs but you can see that they are divided into smaller packs.

2. Retreat
You can't stop the troops mid way of a retreat. They run all the way back to base. I would prefer a retreat that lets you choose either 50% or 100% of the distance back. Why? Because some times I just want to flank and I need to move fast, but retreating at 100% means I have to call them at base.

3. No quick end strategy
There is no zerging in this game. You can't just end the game early as all bases have machine guns and infantry die very easily to them. I don't know if this is actually that bad.

4. Mine placement
Very, very slow and tiny. No circle to show the radius of explosion. They only work well with chokepoints. I was hoping if they could make a grid (minefield) instead of an extended line. Since the mines cost ammunition to plant, players can't spam them abitrarily. Also, more mines would make mine detection actually useful. You could also add abilities to scan for mines that way.

5. Mine sweeping
Absolutely redundant. If there is a mine, there is usually a machine gun guarding the location. Thus, the engineer will have trouble removing it. Never played a game where engineers needed mine detection.

6. T1<T2<T3
Most games I played tend to be won by high-tech tank domination. The game seems to end only when one side builds up their most powerful heavy armour tanks e.g. Tiger Ace, Panther, KV-8, Elefant. I don't really remember games when light and medium tanks won.

This is a linear strategy that obsoletes infantry in the end-game. Instead of T1 being weaker thant T3, how about Infantry (Barracks) vs Tanks (Workshop) vs Planes (HQ)? 

7. Bug Splat Errors ******
Too many to count. Every time someones disconnects it's usually a Bug Splat error or a map problem. The game isn't complete at all. The errors just occur randomly or when servers are full.

[h1][b]SUGGESTIONS[/b][/h1]
1. Infantry (Barracks) vs Tanks (Workshop) vs Planes (HQ)?

Each of the five factions had a unique playstyle and with the selection of commanders at your fingettips you could either specialize your playstyle or operate on a premise similar to another faction. All of your decisions had weight and an uphill struggle could turn in your favor with the placement of a single mine or HMG while at the same time a single mine or HMG could ruin your entire deployment. With buildable cover, a destructible world and five different armies to play around with this game has given me years of fun. And it was fun, it was special, its consumed five years of my life. Once upon a time I would have given this game glowing reviews.

But now the game is different. Everything changed when a very specific country invaded. The war is the same and we use the same tools but the rules of engagement have been rewritten. No longer do your tactics matter much so long as you keep your men alive and your company has the bigger blob. The tide of battle can be changed with a single mine or a single artillery shell but you can't do it alone. This game is utterly unplayable now if you don't have a premade team, it was a challenge before and if you won despite the odds the victory felt significant. No longer. Now you struggle to fight battles and keep your teammates in the game. As soon as the battle starts to go downhill you'll find your teammates dropped from the game. They leave you alone to get stomped by 1-4 enemy players that copied the tactics used by a very specific country to win EVERY SINGLE GAME and even though the players from that country are gone the scars are lasting... and they took the fun with them. This game is no longer special. This game is no longer a work of art. Its just work. Just the cheapest tactics and the most frustrating gameplay. Now the game plays like any other RTS games and the things that made CoH2 special just don't matter anymore. To make things worse it seems the devs are complacent in the matter, with the last update the devs strived to make the factions more fluid and accessible... and they got what they wanted. So with that Company of Heroes 2 died and the people from a very specific country sent it out screaming. I hope and pray the devs take us back to better days soon. 

Or worse yet; hope they fix it in CoH3.",1645191427,1645191427,False,2,1,0.483702749013900757,1,True,False,False

and hey know what? no mechanics for hauling anti-tank Gun, No possible way America can properly defend itself against bullshit german tanks that were PRONE to break downs, Nah here's an m10 tank destroyer...Do you want this easy to destroy M10?? No??? To Bad. You want the Anti Tank halftrack back? No can't have that

I bunch of Modders did more than give players 10 Goddamn maps and a Jumbo Sherman.

I am never going to forgive SEGA for what they have done to this franchise.
First charge top dollar for the game, then flood it with shitty micro transactions and DLCs that should be updates. 
New content lacks any new game play or coherent story line and is over priced. There still no German campaign to play, instead we get a low production value American campaign that is more like skirmish mode and costs as much as most full games.
SEGA obviously doesn't want to invest in expanding this franchise but rather bleed it dry.

This combined with SEGA changing the last remaining fun aspects of the game, like only being able to build one heavy tank at a time or the inability to build artillery in your command terretory anymore just ruined the game.

It has everything you‚Äôd expect from a AAA title to good graphics, sounds, gameplay, good control setup, unit variety and the number of factions (with the DLCs). At the time of this writing, the game is coming close to 20k reviews with a mostly positive rating which really speaks volumes on how this game is. 

This game is great as it offers huge replayability for not only multi-players but also for solo skirmishers. 

If you‚Äôre the single player type this game has you covered. It offers the traditional campaign with difficulty and if that‚Äôs not enough you can grab additional mission packs. You can also skirmish vs the AI you can even team skirmish vs the AI so that you can enjoy larger battles all without ever having to play with another human.

If you‚Äôre the super competitive multi-player type? It has the usual 1v1 complete with rankings. There are still tournaments held to this day. It also has team vs team modes up to 4v4 so that you and your buddies (or random players) can play against opposing teams.

And the real beauty of this game is that it even offers something in between. 

Don‚Äôt like being super competitive but enjoy playing with others? Well this gem of a game offers an online co-op skirmish with other players against the AI with whatever difficulty setting suits you. When going through the list of games you can watch that are currently being played, this mode is one of if not the most played.

I felt it important to really give props to Relic Entertainment for remembering that there are different types of players and providing mulitple even for all players to fully enjoy the game. I felt it important because it‚Äôs something some other developers seem to have forgotten some time ago.

There are some balancing issues that have always existed in this game, with the amount of commanders and things that need it and specialty units someone is generally going to have a pretty good idea on how to find something really strong. Add in a mix of RNG with the pathing and damage system and you've got a recipe to find yourself quickly frustrated by how hard this game can punish you with extra bad luck for a lapse of micromanagement.

It was a great game, a very great game. So complex and deep my simple mind couldn't comprehend it.

Now, grown up and many more years in. 10 years after release. I still come back to it from time to time. My taste in games changed, but my love for COH 2 didn't.
The game has such a depth, such complex plays - so many facets and mechanics that interlock, synergies and complete each other - to describe it in detail, you would take ages. 

But to sum it up in a little speech:

My friends, it has often been said that I like war.

My friends, I like war...

No, friends, I love war!

I love holocausts.

I love blitzkriegs.

I love defensive lines.

I love sieges, charges, I love mop-up operations, and retreats.

Wars across prairies, in streets, in trenches, in grasslands, in frozen tundras, through deserts, on the sea, in the air, I love every act of war that can occur upon this earth.

I love blasting the enemy to smithereens with artillery salvos that thunder across the lines of battle.

My heart leaps with joy whenever a soldier is tossed high into the air and cut to pieces by well placed sniper rounds. And there is nothing like a tank operator using a Tiger acht acht  to destroy enemy tanks. And the feeling that comes when a soldier runs screaming from his blazing tank, only to be mowed down by heavy machine gun fire, is such an exquisite feeling. 

I love it when my forces are ravaged by a Russian armored division. It's so sad to see towns and villages that were supposed to be defended at all costs, being laid to waste.

I love to be squashed under the heel of the British and American war machines. The humiliation as my men crawl around like vermin, ducking the jagdbombers flying overhead.

My friends, I love war.",1642777047,1642777047,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

Cons: 
- Historical accuracy. Absolutely rubbish and russophobic presentation of USSR.
Soviet Union won the war. For those who forgot: Western armies joined the war after Stalingrad and Battle of Kursk when defeat of German became inevitable.

Unique physics and unit movements. Combat is a very in-depth, especially for the dozens of tanks available with things like penetration of tanks, bouncing shells, damaged engines and a lot of other different modifiers that make tank and vehicle combat quite entertaining and are very important mechanics for the game and the way it's played. There are a variety of infantry units each with their own abilities and equipment, which specialise at different kinds of combat, so you can experiment with different tactics.

Multiple factions to choose from and a variety of in-game commanders each with their own exclusive abilities like bombing strikes, close air support, elite infantry, elite tanks and much much more to add flavour to the already heated engagements.

The campaign missions are quite interesting and provide an alternate experience to the PvP one. There are also Theater of War scenarios, where you can team up with a friend and co-op to win battles together. 

The game does include quite a lot of microtransactions, which is a bit annoying for me and too EA-style, but if you buy them on sale you can snatch a lot of good deals.

I don't know why but even when I'm just fighting against AI I find this game really challenging, even when I set them to be easy on me. Maybe it's just me though, maybe I'll learn what I'm doing wrong later on down the road. 

Still having a decent bit of fun though, picked the game up on sale. 15$ For everything CoH so I don't feel ripped off, but if you were going to pay full price for it I'd definitely recommend you watch some YouTube videos on it first before making that choice. Perhaps wait around for another sale to come through. 

One thing I really like about this game is the skirmish mode where I can at least create scenarios for me to learn the game more, I really enjoy that. Plus all of the maps with the loaded amount of Workshop content it's got a lot here to offer for a WW2 strategy game. 

I have my graphics on max and the game looks pretty good, has some solid gore moments too where people get hit by artillery or something and splatter into a red paste of body parts and guts. 

Sounds are on point too, no complaints there. 

There are mods that fix certain things about the game, some things I personally didn't like so if you find something that bugs you, you might try looking for a mod to fix that issue.

This is like a solid 8.5/10 for me as of now. Still learning the game a lot, we'll see how far it goes. If you find this game on sale and you've been thinking about it, I'd say go for it.

(Review in 2014, when I was a whole 15 years old. being 23 now, here's a new review. some 800 hours later.) 

I used to enjoy Company of Heros 2, It used to be one of my main games. Yes, I've got under a thousand hours - but there's this thing called real life. Now, the learning curve of this game. Is a bit unique compared to other RTS games like starcraft, whereas with the latter units will mob up into one super formation - in this one, your punished for doing so. with such, it's more of a tug of war battle, where early game the allies need to wipe out the germans, before late game they push back and take it over. There is no in between. At a point, the game was a tug of war between only Whermacht, and the Russians. Similair to how War Thunder started out. Eventually, they added the americans and the OBK, than eventually the british. Throughout its time, many of the early allies were unbalanced, the devs have done an... okay job - at balancing the game, there are some bugs - which havn't been fixed, or mechanics that are downright stupid. with that being said, I have to go back to the learning curve of this game, no amount of campaign is going to prepare you for how incredibly toxic this game is, players are quick to abandon games as soon as they see it going in a different direction, although this game is a tug of war. I actually had to uninstall the game because it was making me so upset, not in the fact that I'm losing matches. but rather, people who have made this their sole game - somehow get matched up with the same players trying to start out. I'm not sure why they even show a leaderboard ranking - when theres no ranked servers. as a new player starting out, expect to get screamed at. have your entire team leave, and force you to play with a delapidated AI code that is more in the minds of feeding the enemy. You can solo against the computer if you want to learn, but nothing will prepare you from seeing the same broken builds. 200 russians charging early game with PTRS rifles, or british bum rushing you with assault corps. By this time, people have found ways to gank any emplacement, where - it almost becomes paramount to set up defenses in the backline for the absolute memery that is about to unfold. from my experience, playing the allies has a bit better players, in the sense of being understanding of new players. but the, ""Wheraboos"" as they are called. some actual, noozi flag havin individuals who give you less than 2 minutes to decide if they are going to up and leave the game after screaming you should have bum rushed the fuel spot.  

To the developers that are so detached from the community working on other games, having sponsered tournaments is not akin to making new maps - this game would never win a labor of love award. and it's quite badly optimized. The minimum and reccomended requirements are an absolute joke when it comes to what I said about the 200 russians, I find the game lagging with even 16gb and a RX560 4GB. 

~Unforgiving veteran community

~Badly optimized

Certain game mechanics, specifically vehicles getting stuck on wrecks or losing sight lines to ""smoke"" 
AT guns getting ganked in situations where they otherwise shouldn't - or getting sight lines disrupted by vehicle moshpits, as somebody would rather mob up 5 tanks. x2 anti tank guns for 700 manpower? likely to not be enough for 5 tanks. With how AT guns and such are, your better off running with a bunch of rocket launchers. 

ch1n4 players don't have their own servers, instead connect to american servers and lag the entire server.

No punishment for leaving games on your team and forcing you to have CSGO bots. 

No ranked system, besides a leaderboard based on win rate

Pump and dump game from relic, occasionally will come back to charge money for microtransactions and get take a majority of the cash from the artist.  

Company of heros 1, ironically more balanced than the second. this ones, get steamrolled by the allies. buy allies DLC, steamroll the angry german wheraboo players. 

No way to know what commanders your team chooses, without seeing units in the mid game, making cohesian quite low. 

They removed the blizzard mechanics from the snow maps, speeding up games and making certain units obsolete. at a point, it would get bitter cold. infantry would need to build fires, or be inside of armored transport. weather mechanics made the possibility for a game to 180 due to builds. removed for.... no reason?",1413547925,1641884444,False,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

I liked the first one for its simplicity, but this installment introduces so many more mechanics, not to mention the DLC is literally played partially on a map similar to Total War: Napoleon. I enjoyed it thoroughly, however be warned, this game for some unknown reason is SIGNIFICANTLY harder than the first installment. I had more trouble playing on easy than when I tried running the first game on Medium. Units will almost always lose in a 1v1 skirmish, so you have to overwhelm even the most simple of enemy squads. If you see a German Tank, unload EVERYTHING you have, because your T-34 will not survive... especially if it is a Panther. This is somewhat realistic since the Russian tactic was ""throw bodies at the enemy until they die or retreat"" due to their war-of-attrition doctrine, so dont expect much tactical gameplay, apart from one mission where you get 3 sniper units and thats it. The only real strategy is ""Use the conscripts which require no resources to just keep throwing bodies at enemies until something new happens.""

Game fails by design...

* good game mechanics
* nice gameplay
* challanging to learn 
* action action and action
* fun to play with few players... 1on1 is best gaming experience. The more players you get the more it gets a mass and gets more unbalanced... maps usually are to small with more players to have room for flanking, which is the key of the game to win!
* some maps are to small
* to much balancing issues... you can easily see how broken the game is, because with axis you can play battles even without choosing a commander. only soviets can do that too, since that have decent stuff even without commander. but UKF and USF are screwed without choosing a commander! For instance, USF do not have good mobile artillery or heavy tank without a commander. Similar for UKF they do not have good mobile arty or even a mobile mortar if not choosing a commander! LOL???


the game felt uncompleted from start since they screwed up the soviet fraction and that was never fixed.
do not understand why they put in a single player campaign that just is useless and feels like a dump tutorial...

they invested so much time for putting in mirco transactions and skins but how about balanced fractions? most tanks except of the germans are just scrap and not good against the german powerful allrounders. what a lack. no wonder the ration of playing germans is about 60% against 40% since the release!!! sometimes its even worse... 

I guess RELIC (once a good game dev studio) fucked it up... good times were COH1 and DOW1...

But in the end I just feel disappointed anyway what they had made of COH.

Cross platform playing would be nice... since Windows sucks completely.

Hope COH3 will be better... and does not play again in WW2, since we learned, just the germans had good stuff *lol*",1577197027,1641844453,True,0,0,0.486902058124542236,0,True,False,False

Company of Heroes 2 Fans, War game strategists and RTS lovers

I'm proud that I was a part of this beautiful action and adrenaline filled game and I recommend it to every RTS and War liking person out there. Unfortunately because of my newest graphics card Radeon, I can not enjoy this masterpiece anymore but you can, you out there and that's good, feel lucky of that fact. For all that who have the same graphics water flickering bug as me do not be sad, hope for better times and just send an E-Mail to the SEGA-Support so they can see that not just you have this problem and then the Programmer team maybe will realize that something must be changed and it must not be so much you know.

That's all what I wanted to say and have a good day my comrades

Particularly the AI guys. Yes you lot. I know, lets copy and paste the AI from the original Dawn of War, i.e. an AI from 2004, with all the problems that entails (yes the AI really has almost all the same problems), such as.. AI who's difficulty depends on their starting position for some completely unknown reason. AI who literally drive round in circles aimlessly. AI that, when on your side, goes MIA just as the computer AI's attack at the same time. AI that runs into tank guns repeatedly without registering why this is bad. AI that shells its allies, harasses your engineers to repair its vehicles in the middle of a firefight or deliberately drives through and destroys your defences that you built three seconds earlier. An AI that is so hopeless it needs ridiculous levels of ammo and fuel bonuses to put up a fight. AI that tries to rush you mid game with 48 tanks and if that fails goes home and takes its ball with it. AI that only wins attacks by being suspiciously successful in parts of the battlefield you have looked away from for a couple of seconds). An AI that knows where all your units are regardless of fog of war because the programmers are to lazy to implement... er.. any sort of AI. 
Each game against the AI (in Annihilate) follows the same boring pattern (on the higher difficulties). You initially deploy faster than the AI and take more points. Enemy AI spams troops from endless reserves who die by running into your machine guns. Friendly AI collapses, despite of you taking the brunt of the attacks, giving the enemy half the resource points on your side (although bizarrely it will fight tooth and nail for a distant point with no advantage... while negating to fight for one just in front of its base). An enemy mortar appears and is miraculously good at blasting your men even though you constantly move them about and it has no spotters... so shouldn't have any idea where your guys are (your mortars on the other hand seems to hit everything but the enemy). Just before you can get a anti tank, an enemy tank turns up (as if by magic) then tanks appear repeatedly, all miraculously aware of where your anti tank are set up - to the point of driving down one pixel wide lines not covered by their line of fires. When you do get your own tank out, at long last, there are several anti tank guns miraculously set up in a line to take it out if you dare to send it into enemy territory. You eventually manage to get enough tanks to out shoot your enemy and the game gives up, cue a charge into the enemies base and a win (which always seems to happen at the half an hour to 40 minutes point - if you don't exploit the AIs many other weaknesses to 'cheat'). During this building blasting exercise, the AI will deploy hopelessly ineffective forces such as machine guns to fight tanks, tank guns to fight commandos and so on. In short, the AI is a predictable, boring, idiotic cheat, whose play borders on hairpullingly frustrating (well borders is an understatement), and is still rubbish.
And the rest of the programming sucks as well. Single core CPU thrashing, stuttering game play on CPUs that at the time of release would have been mind-blowing - the game literally pauses for a few seconds to er.. floss its teeth or something, for no obvious reason at least once a game, and shocking loading times. Bizarre physics that has corpses spinning round in mid-air and weird non existent explosions that send trees flying about as if they have been hit by an atom bomb. Add that to a grubby cash grab with commanders and tactics store purchases pushing a 'complete' game into the hundreds of pounds arena. I would avoid this one, purely on this basis, even though the game has a lot of potential and is more likely to be fun against a human (which admittedly is probably what the programmers were mainly concentrating on). But hey, not everyone wants to play games 'online' opponents and I prefer single player.
If COH 3 has the same AI underpinnings again I will not be buying it. Seriously, Dawn of War's AI was acceptable in 2004, a few tweaks for the new mechanics do not, however, make it any good these days though... and I do realise good AI is hard but even a fairly terrible AI would be more fun (and better) than this to play against. And seriously, if you sort the AI out it will be one hell of a game.",1640210565,1640210565,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

People say Shocks are op German tanks are Op, well I'd say there's a way to get rid of em. 

In my opinion the paid commanders don't make you win more they just add another type of gameplay or rather style in it. 
When it comes to commanders, paid commanders don't make you win, but rather the way you play and skill makes you win.

Compared to Coh1, Coh2 is a lot more balanced in terms of units. The game offers more variety of units and tactics compared to its predecessor, The game is easy to learn but hard to master.

The only issue I have with this game is the ""Disconnected"" and ""Dropped"" problem, whenever my network weakens the game disconnects and thus leading to a undesirable instant defeat on my stats. 
around 10-20% of my Defeats is because of ""Disconnected"" and ""Dropped""

 Very recommended to those who like strategy, A timeless game. 

And By the way get the game when it's on discount for better deals.

Has an excellent singleplayer campaign which features every type of battlefield you could think off (entrenchments, villages, river crossings, shelled cities etc.). Last but not least the Multiplayer! 2 game modes, a variety of maps depending on the number of players and the fact that you are playing against humans ensures that no two matches are the same, even if they are fought on the same map with the same tarting locations (which are also not set for every map). Bought it approximately 2 months ago and played very often since then, I must admit I am very satisfied with this game, had quite some fun, and the achievement/army customisation/commanders options  make sure that you have a personalised game experience and playing style.

The only negative aspect so far is that sometimes you are matched with players that seem to possess not much more that the basic skills, due to the matchmaker looking to build even teams, and not find players that are on the same level (meaning that it will try to get 2 teams with the same average level, no matter if one team has 2 players with levels 1 and 50 and the other one 2 players with levels 24 and 26).",1403337576,1640044443,True,7,0,0.533100903034210205,0,True,False,False

Campaign is Fun: Spam Conscripts
The DLC: Good Stuff but wait for sale
Multiplayer:
The game is more enjoyable when played in 3v3 and 4v4, pure chaos and destruction when in late game. 
1v1 mode is somewhat boring and it just shoves away the other commanders since their useless in that mode.
Strenghts:
- 3v3 and 4v4 modes are the fun mode in here. I wish the developers know this, since this isn't red alert or SC with fast paced combat. Also better invite your friends to play this game, so communicating in 3v3 or 4v4 modes aren't going to be difficult.
- when in 3v3 or 4v4 experimenting with specific commanders are fun.
- The slow to medium paced battles/ ""Tactical Gameplay"" are good for the average RTS enjoyer. As you would find it isn't task intensive (micro/macro). 
Cons:
- Sometimes and especially when you're new at this game. Factions seems to be unbalanced. But as you play more and encounter those line-up you would understand that you're just playing wrong. In short the game just feels a bit overwhelming, and it takes time to understand factions. 
- A niche game, RTS ain't sexy for the majority of gamers out there. There is a high chance you're going to play with the same person in your second game in Multiplayer.
- UI, matchmaking, and multiplayer system is kind of archaic in this time and age.
- Not the friendliest community. *salt and toxicity intensifies

You grab flags, occupy territories to gain resource. 
Build up your base, call in troops and tanks to crush your enemy.

Buy all the DLCs as well as the COH 1. 
They are cheap now. Totally worth the price. 

There is a minor bug in the campaign: Transfer order on machine gun team will causing the team abandon the weapon but still labeled as MG team on the battlefield. They are not obeying the order and retreating. High command is not happy about it. Also you have to grind drop chest (or purchase at the in game store) in order to get extra commanders.

The Company of Heroes 3 is on the way.
Wish it a great success.

If you are a war history buff on top of it....whew you might just have to settle down and marry the damn thing. I hope in COH3, which will be amazing no matter what (the game is so good that changing it too much, as far as the mechanics and structural features, would just start to bog it down. New maps, units, abilities, commanders, and the newly introduced weather, directional, los & map/environment parameter functionalities that were added I can't wait for.

PLEASE INTRODUCE THE JAPANESE IN A FUTURE EXPANSION!!! 
- Naval commanders could be added: 'Amphibious Assault' ability spawns forces from a waterfront/coastal selection. Only 
   available when water is present with the selected location. (works akin to paratroopers/stromtroopers).
- Add in a 'Admiral Fleet Bombardment' akin to the current 'air-force/Luftwaffe strikes.'
- | Kamikaze |: Mark Selection 'A' first, immediately followed by a second, much smaller, target selection - as 'Selection 'B' |
 'Kamikaze Strike.'Drops a dive bomb within a selected larger encompassing area; followed by a pinpoint selected 
  plummeting airplane that explodes with excellent accuracy. 
- Japanese could have a fortifications docterine with standard improvements for defensive capabilities, with/or/and include a concealment doctrine that focuses on ruses/traps, concealed (invisible pillboxes), mines, snipers, & of course *caves that can connect caches depots 'potentially,' providing,' safe, quick and streamlined troop movement around the map. (however if the caches are destroyed the tunnels/caves are as well. If any men inside they are also eliminated as well. 
- Japanese could have an Imperial doctrine that focuses on their early-war tactics of quick advancement, overwhelming density. 

These are just some ideas right off the top of my head, I could keep going and going with some appropriately great ideas!

But there are a few things worth mentioning when getting into this game.
- Its very arcady, rifles firing point blank range and still missing, Tanks only shooting up to 30 meters, etc... This is not a realistic game.
- Gameplay is very simelar to the first company of heroes game, its only more fine tuned and has more content.
- There are co-op missions and a single player campaing, story is rather meh but the missions themself are not to bad.
- It includes a ingame store where commanders (those include units and abilities) are behind a paywall. You can get these commanders by grinding ingame currency but that takes a long time.

The factions are unique especially since there are two german factions but they still play differently. The soundtrack is great but when you have been playing for a long time, you'd notice that there isn't much OST used in-game. There are mods available but it's a downgrade of what modders are able to do in the previous installment. What most they can do is provide different stat values and in-game rules but no custom models and sound effects, although custom maps and custom icons are still available.

Unfortunately, one downside of this game is that most of the content are locked through a paywall. These locked content includes but are not limited to: other factions, maps, scenarios, and another campaign. Another issue of this game is that compared to the previous installment, the commanders are unlocked through either grinding or real money. I can forgive cosmetics since they don't mess up gameplay during multiplayer, but since it requires you to grind or buy the commanders it kinda becomes a pay to win issue. As of this review, I have 1347.5 hrs on record and I might be able to unlock all the commanders and cosmetics with the currency I saved up. It's kinda annoying if you have to sell almost 1000hrs of your life just to unlock everything. Don't get me wrong I didn't play 1000+ hrs because I grinded hard but 
 because I enjoyed the game.

Your army must be balanced and you have to pick wisely your next piece of vehicle or infantry group, time and territory are your most valuable resources... and for higher levels blobing is not an option; micromanagement and agressive play is the key for the win.
The campaign is utter garbage (the American one is quite decent), but the level of action within multiplayer games can't be compared.
