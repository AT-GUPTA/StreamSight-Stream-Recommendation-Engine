Keep in mind, for some reason you can ride a bike but you can't drive a car... hopefully they bring that back again one day.

Fifteen 'different' $40.00 expansion packs. - Totaling around $520.00
Twelve 'game packs' for $20.00 each. - Totaling around $240.00
TWENTY 'stuff packs' all $10.00 each. - Totaling around $200.00
Nearly THIRTY 'kits' all $5.00 each. - Totaling around $95.00
... and a digital 'upgrade' pack for $10.00 that adds items and clothes- as well as the soundtrack.

All this comes down to over $1000.00 - prices based on an article by PCGamesN.

 [b]Some people argue this adds a lot of variety to the series. In reality it adds;[/b]

• Instability to your save file.
• Slow in-game processing power.
• TONS of unchecked glitches and bugs.
• Broken interactions between your Sims or pets.
• Complete corruption of your 'towns'.
• A sad, empty wallet.

The funny part is just how many features this game has subtracted from previous games in the series- including various modes of transportation, the ability to create and interact with your actual towns instead of just giving you two-dimensional plots to work with, the ability to control your pets, and countless other important quality of life features the other games had.

On top of this you will receive a mostly broken launcher they released that was not even originally necessary for playing the game. Because of this 'thing' you will run into the inability to actually play the game for several days with the release of each new 'update'. And these updates are FREQUENT because instead of streamlining their ideas- they pump out new kits and 'collaborations' that nobody actually asked for and proceed to milk the Sims community completely dry like a Cow Plant.

There are some VERY die-hard fans who defend every action of this franchise. Needless to say; they're totally misguided. EA is not a good company- everyone knows that- but in the Sims' case they're not even good game designers. There are countless issues that could be solved with simpler, smarter fixes that they continue to ignore in lieu of patches that break the game for days at a time. This is not a modding exclusive problem either- it goes down for EVERYONE.

I should mention the Sims 4 developers enjoy pandering to certain audiences- and do it in a blatantly obvious manner. Collaborations with the Sims 4 are usually very shallow or frivolous to drum up the idea that they are 'champions of the people' in cultural representation. The truth is they are anything but that- they just want your money at the end of the day. The Sims franchise isn't about sending a message to the masses- it's just a video game series people enjoy winding down with at the end of the day. Everyone wants representation in some form or another- a completely fair thing to ask for- but The Sims 4 does it in such an insincere and corporate fashion that it turns my stomach. Don't fall for their false sense of equality- there are better places to look for it than an overrated and overpriced video game series.

[b]TLDR;[/b] You should avoid buying this game. If you're a die-hard Sims fan and you already own it; I advise you to be smart with your money and buy packs VERY selectively. Some will break your game, others will add nothing of real value to it. Always check user reviews to find out the PROS and CONS of each pack you want to purchase. You should typically only buy these packs or expansions on SALE; otherwise you will be wasting your money on a game you may end up playing for about a week sporadically throughout the year.",1679719413,1708539790,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You'll probably need a pack or two like Seasons and Growing Together to make it a more enjoyable game since those are essentially base game 2.0. I don't recommend buying any DLC at full price though, wait for a sale which they do often. Definitely watch video reviews about the packs from a reviewer who is NOT an EA Game Changer like LGR or SatchOnSims because some packs sound good on paper but have poor execution. If you're only playing it for building you can just download mods for furniture, wallpapers etc instead of buying packs. That being said, if you hate the base game then no amount of DLC will make this a good game for you. They don't change the gameplay enough for that.

Overall this is still a cash-grabby DLC simulator and a buggy game (you'll probably need mods to fix the annoyances since Maxis is allergic to fixing broken packs. Seriously, Dine Out is still broken but there is a mod that completely overhauls it) but my opinion of it has sort of improved recently. Still not as great as The Sims 2 and 3 as this game lacks the humor, ambition and attention to detail as the previous games, but as someone who has burned herself out on those games by playing them too much this is the next best thing on the market at the moment.",1606508634,1708381127,True,2,0,0.534537374973297119,0,True,False,False

First off, let's talk about build mode. Now, don't get me wrong, I could spend hours tinkering with floor plans and picking out the perfect wallpaper. But can we please talk about those swatches? Like, seriously EA, we need more neutral and cohesive options up in here. Sometimes I feel like I'm trying to match my sims' living room to a unicorn's rainbow vomit. But hey, despite the struggle, I find myself sucked into the Sims universe for hours on end. It's like a black hole of creativity and procrastination.

And let's address the elephant in the room – the never-ending parade of DLCs. Look, I get it, EA needs to make that coin, but do they have to make it rain expansions like it's confetti at Coachella? It's like, chill out with the pricey packs, fam. But hey, it's not like The Sims 4 is the first game to pull this stunt. We've seen it before, and we'll probably see it again.

But you know what? Despite the occasional frustration and wallet-emptying moments, I keep coming back for more. There's just something magical about watching my sims' lives unfold, even if I have to restart my build for the umpteenth time because suddenly everything looks wrong. The Sims 4 has come a long way and even though it's not perfect, it's still hella addictive.

So, if you're like me, a sucker for pixelated perfection and virtual escapism, give The Sims 4 a whirl. Just be prepared to lose track of time and maybe a few dollars along the way. But hey, isn't that what gaming is all about?

Wanted to warn anyone who may actually be tempted to buy all DLC. The Horse Ranch DLC is listed twice. Near the top and near the bottom. 

[b] 4 Mar 2023: [/b]  w/ latest updates and EA Software being forced on us, Origin is gone :( And they now require us to use their EA Software. With this in mind, I've commented in a thread and want to re-post what I posted there concerning trying to launch the game with steam and how it reacts to EA Software and launching the game itself. 


UPDATE: Seems if you clear cache and just close down both steam and ea, then reboot your PC that you can then launch it from steam but I recommend you open them both before you launch via steam. I tried from desktop and that did not launch EA Software properly. IDK if adding EA Software to Steam's Programs would help but I worry it'll affect play time documented, which is cool to see.

Update 2: I tried again today. I do my typical routine of steam stuff. I then go to launch the game and so it begins. I've tried verify integrity. I've tried clearing cache on both EA Software & Steam Cache. Both cause you to have to log in again. Even then I get that error, 500 and I'll know it'll be an issue before I even get to see my game page in EA Software because EA Software will launch with a yellow banner stating something is off. If the EA Software launches and does NOT have that yellow banner, it seems to launch each time. Once I get the game going I do not go messing with it so these tests are some time in between. I hope that helps some of you until it's fixed. I also sent an error report in EA Software (Desktop software aka EA App/Program) for PC.

Restarting pc after clearing cache? IDK but that's a lot of steps. Restarting does and is part of what makes it work. The lack of yellow banner is also a part of what makes it work. Yellow banner means my game information will not be accessible because of some mysterious situation. O.o

31 Jan 2023: Newest BASE GAME update includes surgical marks for sex changes and medical clothing for gender changes. The one thing I did notice is patches that can be worn on the skin. That could be for diabetics or heart patients? I still wish it was a free DLC, then you could get more medical supplies, braces, etc. I think they added this one more for political reasons, to make a point. I prefer a free DLC of medical, or a low fee. I'd buy it as a medical care kit, if it were that. (Note: there's also no prosthetic limbs & you'll have to pay for the dentures in a cup) I think it was just a way to get their way, tbh. This is my personal opinion. 

*I'd love a toggle to remove all in CAS (Create A Sim) But that does not exist. :( And they throw a bunch of stuff on the sims. It will take quite a while before you can even begin to design them due to needing to remove things.

I've loved sims since sims 1 (Will Wright brought it to us through someone who could help him bring his vision to life, from what I understand. The dream of seeing inside Sim City's homes.  Sims 2 forward it was a bit different. Check out the wikiipedia on it if you want more information on The Sims Franchise, early days and publishers.  

I've played each version and have seen how it has grown, as well as their greed :( (Sorry EA but it is true.. *Sad face*) Still waiting.

Sims 4 is a really fun life simulation game with tons of mods available out there if you prefer. (just be safe with those!)

I like to go to ModTheSims for mods and to Carl's Sims 4 Site for the Cheats and Tips for gameplay. 
https://www.carls-sims-4-guide.com/

Both sites are loaded with information! MTS is also for previous versions of sims. :)

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2677323318

You can record in-game play and hitting tab while playing will hide the HUD. (full screen recordings)


The game was $500 to get all, but since that review it is over $1000 :( :( So I removed what I had wrote about the enough for a car part. Now, enough for . a lot. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2697361952


The game is free here @ STEAM, and the packs can be bought from either. I used a Guide here on STEAM to make them linked. I moved all files over to STEAM so it's in one place. :D

If you want a big hospital that is mostly realistic, works in game if you use freebuild cheat, check out my upload (Origin Username: XTSMasterID) I don't have a lot but I'm starting to share more. :) I follow for follow in there ♥ As long as I know. But some are ""anonymous""?? why? I've no clue.

(The first Upload of the hospital, 2015)
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2697393771
(I've a friend who tested this. Said it worked great for them as a hospital but you MUST use that cheat to make it work right)

https://simsvip.com/2015/04/02/the-sims-4-editing-hidden-lots/

Please read other reviews for details and other perspectives. ♥

[b] EDIT: [/b] It will not show your Origin hours, sadly. I have over 900 hours in this game but it only shows the base game for here and it's time.. Just head over to Origin if you own Origin and you'll see your previous hours there, as well as updated hours if you have the steam version. :) Origin should have all hours displayed though Steam only picks up when you buy STEAM base game. Origin also shows which packs you own (it shows if it's a STEAM purchase as well) so check Origin when you want to know what packs you don't have. Steam doesn't seem to be able to track that. Then go to STEAM store and ignore what you already own so you don't buy it again.

[b] 8 Jan 2022: Fun Side Story Stuff: [/b] I'd like to add for those who liked Mortimer and Bella Goth, they are in here. I've not seen Don Lothario (some of you know who I speak of). For more information, look up Lothario Definition in Google *wink* It'll explain why I am curious if he's in the game and why I look for him. Another hint is the hot air balloon in ? Sims 2 or 3? :D Fer shame! O.o

I found myself on day being extremely upset because I lost me beloved Grandmother. It got me thinking about heaven and what my heaven would look like.

My Gran always dreamed about building a log home up in Wisconsin, but she as unable to do so. So I went to CAS and made my Gran into a SIM and then I sent her through the tree to Sylvan Glade. I build her version of heaven and it turned out so beautiful that I shared it with the rest of my family and we all found it to be incredibly cathartic and comforting.

So I got to thinking more about this and the game is pretty gross. If you approach it from a purely gaming perspective, unless you are farming reward points and popping potions of youth, your first sim or sims are going to die. And farming ""people"" with preferred stats and traits in colony sims is not an uncommon or particularly varied concept. But in The Sims it feels very different. Maybe that's because the people are modeled so much towards human beings or maybe its by design. All I know is that in my game I married a hot criminal mastermind that flew off the handle randomly but was a decent companion. Too real at this point but I'll continue. Farming potions for both was taking all my time so she unfortunately had to go but I keep her urn next to the tv so all good. Now the task ahead was to find an heir to my castle and fortune. And by that I mean moderately sized middle class home and a couple hundred grand. It was tedious at first and involved a LOT of... interactions. And soon I found the only one traited to raising a kid was not into men, at all. This is where it got REALLY strange. Because from a gaming perspective the next logical course of action is to look for the next source of ""people"" to create new sims with. I was scrolling through the streets on full speed, waiting to see new faces. It got to the point where I was recognizing when teens turned to young adults so I could peg them once and get their profile details to make things quicker and that's when it hit me. The Sims is not a people simulator, its a grooming simulator.",1707495184,1707502156,False,0,0,0.47486037015914917,0,True,False,False

ps: It is possible I broke the game when trying to activate a free holidays seasons dlc in game, the game broke the next time i tried to startup, just crash to desktop every time, I thinkk I fixed it by activating the free dlc on steam and then restart the game.

FEB 2024: At this point I only download the game so I can mess around with build mode, unfortunately I cannot perform a motherlode as easy as the sims OG (1) so yeah I cannot be fussed with all the meta socialness of this game. I think I'll leave this game for the girls and guys that are invested in Sims as a frachise.

I feel kinda robbed of a game because its not even bare bones here, some features from the old game should have been kept like console ` then motherlode or Insert cheat here or even like a dlc that would let me mess around with build mode a bit more at less expense of simeleons and more time crafting nice houses, if that was introduced I would be happy, and the review would be a recommend, note: I am not saying making cheating easier, I'm saying make a mode where you can freely build a house at no cost including plot, and it would only cost money if you move in sims whether furnished or not. That would be an interesting turn for this game. And honestly would be the only thing to bring me back and keep the game installed and updated. for now its an easy pass.

But once you start playing, you will immediately begin to notice the cracks. Unlike previous Sims games, TS4 lacks depth and engaging gameplay, making the base game feel like an unfinished demo. Travelling anywhere requires loading screens, relationships are shallow, and the sim AI is frustrating and annoying. There is so little to do in this game. And naturally, you are going to begin to look at the packs, which the launcher advertises whenever you open the game.
Buying packs is expensive. There are so many that it can be overwhelming to pick, especially since many of them seem like they add essential features that you need. And worst of all, purchasing these packs will not fix your game. It will actually make it worse. For every tiny bit of gameplay you will also have to put up with more annoyances, longer loading screens, and more bugs. And there will be many bugs. Some of them are bad enough to corrupt save files and crash the game. But because packs are so expensive, you try to convince yourself that it isn't so bad. You may even spend more money, and feel more indebted to this game. How could these packs be so expensive and so shallow, so broken? You may think it is your fault, that you are missing something, that you made the wrong purchases. And so it looks like the only escape from the hole is to dig deeper.
EA is a company that does not care about this game. TS4 has so many game breaking bugs, and packs that have been broken since their release years ago. They have a long history of ignoring player complaints, refusing refunds, and continuing to push new content no matter the backlash. They have no accountability, because this game is too big for a few players to hold them responsible. Every trailer hypes up every new pack as a must buy, and after release EA goes radio silent until the next new pack, leaving players to struggle with their newly broken game, because each patch breaks things further.
TS4 is 10 years old. It is not going to get any better. If you are in the market for a life simulation game, then you should look at any of the recent newer entries to the genre. If you download the base game, even though it is free, it will tempt you to buy these very well advertised packs that will break your game. The game engine was terrible to begin with, and piling more content on a broken foundation only makes things worse.
There are two positives to this game: first, there is a very engaging build mode, and it's quite fun to design different houses in this game. There are still bugs, but they're minimal if you don't have a lot of packs, and you can take some beautiful designs and share them on the public gallery for others to download. Second, TS4 has a huge dedicated modding community, so if you're playing on PC and can mod your game then you can get so much engaging and interesting content for free thanks to the work of these talented players. I don't think they're enough to make this a good game, but you may feel differently.
If you already own the game and are thinking of buying a pack, three rules to follow: 1) look up several gameplay videos. Make sure they're complete, with no cuts to hide bugs or annoyances. There's a million different Sims channels on Youtube, so do your research. 2) Never buy a pack full price. There are enough sales that you can wait until it's at least half off. 3) NEVER preorder a pack. They will try to entice you with exclusive content, but it is not worth it. New packs are always broken and may not get fixed for months, if at all.
But if you don't own this game, don't get it. The sunk cost fallacy is the main reason for this game's success, and EA have very good advertisements and a huge online community to encourage you to spend a little more. Maybe this time the game will be worth it. Maybe this time they'll be different. But after 10 years of consistency, maybe its time to accept that there never was a good game here, and it's time to let go.",1707427171,1707427171,False,17,0,0.696558177471160889,0,True,False,False

Opened up the game recently and found that the that 2 of the 3 that I bought are now free and so is the game itself. I was compensated $0.00. I'm not in the best position financially, but the eighty something dollars doesn't even matter. The financial cataclysm that EA ensued on so many folks, who bought a majority of their ridiculously priced DLC, is unfathomable. I read another review that stated someone spent around a thousand dollars to get the game and all available DLC. How much do you want to bet they saw none of their money be refunded and that they'd be taken to court if they tried to claim compensation or take legal action against EA? They'd probably somehow legalese their way into flipping it on the poor guy and sue him for defamation with their squad of elite lawyers. I will never support EA again for the rest of my life. These are horrible people who bend laws and take advantage of their customers with their untouchable financial & social status. And it's our fault they have this position in the world.

        [th]Description[/th]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]💾Graphics[/td]
        [td]The graphics are the best in the franchise! I really enjoy the graphics for the SIms 4. The lighting is pretty nice and everything looks pretty sharp and has an ageless art style in my opinion. The animations are good as well which is a plus (especially the facial animations). The UI is pretty good too, but can get kinda messy to me at times. I would highly recommend a reshade as well, because this makes all the color's and artstyle truly pop and looks absolutely stunning![/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎮Gameplay[/td]
        [td]Gameplay has so many elements to talk about. You can have jobs, create a social media platform, go on dates, basically anything you could do in real life, well mostly. The building in this game is the best I have seen in a game. You can literally make any place you want. Honestly I have most of my hours in the building section of this game, that’s how good it is. You can build basically anything you want and it feels so good too. I barely have any issues with the building tools in this game. It’s hard to talk about since you have so much in the gameplay section it would be too long to read. I will talk about some negatives though. The worlds are small and you have to go through a loading screen each time you go to a new area or location which can take you out of the immersion at times. This game has a TON of DLC’s. It’s almost criminal how many there are. The worst part is that some of these DLC’s should have been in the game![/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]📜Story[/td]
        [td]Story? You are the story! You can make any story you want in this game. You can have a long family history if you play long enough in your playthrough. You can have a family and give them careers, traits, different attitudes, basically anything. The story is up to your imagination and that's the beauty about the sims. It’s basically a life simulation if that makes any sense. The freedom is high and do what you want as you are one of many sims in this beautiful world of freedom.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🕛Playtime[/td]
        [td]The amount of playtime this game has is absolutely insane. Just from building alone, I have 800+ Hours! You can do almost anything in this game and the hours show. If you want a game to pass time on, here you go![/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎧Sound[/td]
        [td]The sound is pretty good. The music is pretty chill and your Sims speak a language we will never understand. You will have audio cues from your sims that represent emotion, and you can also edit your characters voice which is pretty cool. The sound department is great and I have no issues. There is probably too much to talk about in this section so i’ll just keep it short.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]❗Bugs❗[/td]
        [td]You will have some bugs. The pathing is kinda meh at times and your sims will do some weird things that they are not supposed to do. Like for example they go in a pool when they can’t swim and they drown, that’s annoying! Their personality can be kinda odd like not following what their traits are but that doesn’t happen all the time. The building mechanics are good but placing things accurately is a no no unless you use console commands.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🔅Performance[/td]
        [td]The Sims 4 runs pretty well for me. If you have a lot of detail on the map or sims it can get a little laggy but that’s to be expected. Besides that issue it runs pretty good in my opinion and the lag was never distracting if it ever came up.[/td]
    [/tr]

    [tr]
        [td]🏆Rating[/td]
        [td]7/10
Give this game a try since this is free. The DLC's are really expensive and I only recommend getting them all if you are gonna put a ton of time into this game.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🔗Conclusion[/td]
        [td]This is my first Sims game and I absolutely love it. The building is nearly perfect and you can have your own family. Create many families and scenarios that can truly get you immersed. The Sims 4 is perfect for people who are looking for a relaxing, stress fee, and immersive/sandbox setting. If you love sandbox games, creating/sharing builds, and having an immersive role-playing experience this is a must buy![/td]

That said, I’m really satisfied with this version of the game. It feels like a mixture of the three previous (main) titles. It works because it’s essentially a reboot—taking place in an “alternate universe” inhabited by some familiar faces.
Does the game have bugs? Sure, but what game doesn’t—especially nowadays, where there’s a constant demand for new content, which gets prioritized over fixing existing issues. 
My primary grievance with the game is the lack of thought-out backgrounds for existing characters. If you’re lucky, you get a short blurb with a brief description of the family dynamic. Otherwise, they’re all one-dimensional cardboard cutouts. I’m hoping “The Sims 5” is more like The Sims 2 in that regard, where each pre-made character has well-thought-out backgrounds, pre-existing relationships with other Sims, family trees… etc.,  
Overall, I’m happy with the gameplay; the game itself looks beautiful, they continue to do a great job with the expansion packs, stuff packs, and kids -- it’s clear the devs have a lot of love for the franchise and are doing a great job.",1706044048,1706044048,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

One of the DLC I own ""Get to Work"" has a feature where you can go to eat at a restaurant and it is nearly unplayable because of how buggy it is (for example, if you go to a restaurant as a group, it will often bugs out of the group so your Sims can't eat together). In the ""Cat and Dogs"" Veterinarian job, the cats and dogs keep bugging out of the medical table. At some point my toddlers starved for hours because of a bug that makes them won't eat even though there is food in front of them. Now, three of my kids got a bug that makes them fear the dark, and even a wink of sleep wakes them up. Tried potions and cheats, nothing works.

First the bugs are a little annoying, then it takes cheats to fix them, now even cheats won't fix them.
How am I even supposed to play it like this?

This game is only playable if you turn on cheats. I'm a Sim fan ever since I was a kid and this is honestly so disappointing.",1705869638,1705869638,False,1,0,0.503105580806732178,0,True,False,False

I'm quite hyped for Paralives and LifeByYou though, so I truly believe that I still am in love with the genre. The thing is: The Sims 4 is by far, not even close, the worst experience someone could have. At first I thought, ok, this is The Sims 2.5, but IT ISN'T. It is so much worse than The Sims 2 that I regret ever trying to compare them.
Why this is so bad, you say? Well, here are a few things:
- Even though it has been a while (10 years), I won't EVER FORGET that this """"""""life simulation"""""""" game DID NOT HAVE POOLS or BABIES when it launched.
- It is a major steback from its previous iterations yes, considering: ALL THREE previous iterations. It does not feature open world or customization like The Sims 3 had, the features it has were SO MUCH better on The Sims 2 (rental apartments, business, night life, etc). Hell, even The Sims (1) was better in all aspects.
- It feels like every ""expansion"" is charged twice what it was in The Sims 3 but worth a third of what it delivers. See the December 2023 Expansion, For Rent, that is just so bad. As another commentary said, they ruined apartments: TWICE!.
- EA should never be on the helm of this game. It is a cash grab. That's all it is.
- Allegedely, many ""choices"" were considering players performance, however this game doesn't perfom well enough to justify any of these choices. Every Expansion, Kit or DLC in general comes ridden with bugs that aren't fixed for a while.
- Customization falls flat. After playing The Sims 3 you can't just ignore the abyssal difference between them.,
- Life simulation is weak at best. Yes, you have some options (after spending more than 300 dollars on this, of course), but they are just bland.

It saddens me to be writing this, but it is the truth. I truly hope that either Paralives or Life By You destroy The Sims or that EA is not involved at all with the next iteration of this franchise.

I would carefully choose which packs and expansions you want in your game play before purchasing, for you wouldn't want to spend for something you have little to use for. Also I recommend using custom content/mods to make your experiences better! Unfortunately, mods are not from Sims 4 and will need to get from the web, but besides the hassle, mods are free!

Graphics does not equal more attention to detail either, because somehow EA has also ruined that.

EA, you're losing your fans slowly but surely. I really regret even spending a single penny on this lost excuse of a game. You think because of no competition you can charge us extortionate amounts but with now lots of new life sim developments, you're either going to lose all consumers to competitors, or have to step up that p*ssy (I can guess which one is going to happen).

Desde que pude jugar The Sims 3 me enamore de esta saga de juegos, más siempre había deseado jugar The Sims 4 pues fue furor en su momento de salida, un juego con mecánicas y una animación de calidad e innovadora a comparación de sus antecesoras, es un buen juego para pasar el rato. 
- Pero hay inconsistencias que hacen que el juego sea muy simple y un poco tedioso hasta cierto punto, no tiene un buen sistema de guardado como cualquier otro juego siempre en cada actualización debes estar al pendiente de tus datos guardado pues estos llegan a desaparecer y es molesto andar buscando la data entre los archivos de tu PC para restablecer los datos guardados. 
Buen juego solo le falta mas contenido mas no supera The Sims 3.

Half the packs don't work properly - I've never had a successful wedding in the years since that pack came out, and nothing's been fixed. I have my doubts now that it ever will be.

I cannot remove the proprietary clothing outfits that I dislike. In The Sims 3, you could delete the outfits you didn't like so they didn't clog up your entire game. That should be left in. I should have full control of the wardrobe of my sims. I hate the toddler phase and then they went and lengthened it with an ENTIRE expansion.  Instead of the toddler crap only being part of the expansion, it affected everyone's game. If someone asked me my opinion, I would tell them to avoid it simply because of that.  But then the franchise goes and makes things worse. The University and High School expansions are pointless and pretty universally hated, so I managed to avoid that garbage.  Thankfully none of that entered into general gameplay.  I sorta think I might like the horse ranch expansion, but every expansion comes with more crap to dislike. Are they even asking what people want? Shouldn't the horses have come out with the pets?  The money grasping is pathetic. Especially when they have, in the past, made a point of STEALING the original creations of their fan base.  This is the last Sims game I will purchase.

From the moment I launched the game, I was captivated by its beautiful aesthetics, intricate details, and immersive gameplay.

One of the most remarkable aspects of The Sims 4 is the level of customization it offers. From creating unique and diverse Sims to designing breathtaking houses, the game provides an unparalleled degree of personalization. I spent hours meticulously crafting my Sims' appearances, personalities, and aspirations, and the result was an astonishing array of digital characters that felt alive.

The gameplay itself is incredibly engaging, with a plethora of activities and interactions to explore. Whether it's pursuing a dream career, building relationships, or indulging in hobbies, The Sims 4 offers a rich and dynamic virtual life experience. The emotions system adds a layer of realism, as my Sims showcased a wide range of feelings, from ecstatic highs to melancholic lows, making their stories all the more compelling.

The expansion packs and game updates further enhance the gameplay, introducing new worlds, careers, and activities. Each expansion pack feels like a whole new adventure, expanding the possibilities and providing fresh content to explore. The attention to detail in these expansions is astounding, and they seamlessly integrate into the base game, expanding the already vast universe of The Sims 4.

Moreover, the vibrant and lively community surrounding The Sims 4 is a testament to its enduring appeal. From sharing creations on the Gallery to participating in challenges and events, the game fosters a sense of belonging and creativity. Interacting with fellow Simmers adds an extra layer of enjoyment, as we exchange stories, tips, and inspiration.

I must also commend the developers for their ongoing support and commitment to the game. Regular updates, bug fixes, and content additions demonstrate their dedication to providing an exceptional gaming experience. It's evident that they listen to the community's feedback, constantly striving to improve and refine the game.

In conclusion, The Sims 4 is a true gem in the world of gaming. With its stunning visuals, endless customization options, immersive gameplay, and a devoted community, it offers an unparalleled virtual life experience. Whether you're a longtime fan of the series or new to the world of The Sims, this game is an absolute must-play.

I'm just sad that there is no longer an online version that allows you to communicate with others worldwide. I love that the game still allows for external mods and media.  That was my favorite part from the earlier versions.  And there is an entire community of creators giving away and selling objects, skins, buildings, and clothing for the game. 

My only issue is with the game-play glitches or anomalies. Like, for example, where children are involved. I don't know if its a glitch, or something that is a result of personality and mood, but oftentimes, commands by parents aren't followed.  Something like putting a baby in its crib or in their highchair, gets ignored, or delayed. I find myself having to simplify the tasks in order to get things done, by first selecting, pick up child, then place child in high chair, then give child food.  This shouldn't be the case if there is an option when clicking on the highchair that says, ""give food to (child).""

Second, I would like (and do) hate the Infants update with all of my heart.. It's a useless lifestage where you literally just make babies try a new food on their path to adulthood, and it was probably made to get more people onboard or old players back online again. Not to mention that this lifestage is hard to control especially when I make parents go to give care to their infant and they don't care and start watching TV instead of feeding their child who hasn't ate food in what seems like two weeks.

Third, I hate how most of the stuff that should be in the base game is in DLCs. I don't want to pay $20 to get a stupid DLC that makes my sims able to eat out. I don't want to pay $40 just to have slightly more job options. I don't want to pay $10 to let my sims live in a tiny home. I don't want to pay $5 for extra patio furniture. I don't want to pay $40 for cats and dogs and a crappy videogame remake of New England.

Lastly, make some of these **DEBUG** items in the game. Sims should be able to drive cars, at the least. In The Sims 3 you could buy a car **in the base game.** Road signs should be available in build mode without cheats.

In conclusion, EA, make this game better.",1683151108,1704233772,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros : 
- Building is fantastic
- Sim creation is fantastic
- Stages of life of the Sims are great

Cons :
- How are Seasons and Pets not included in the base game, for real
- Actually too many options? Everytime I click somewhere, I have to search what to do / say / think. So much can be done and it’s a bit overwhelming. I get tired so fast of the gameplay.
- The kits contain too little and cost too much. Some of them should be directly included in the base game.

I haven't played very many Sims prior to this game (I played one of them on the Nintendo 3DS a couple years back for a short time), but I definitely knew this was my type of game. I love controlling every little aspect of their lives, and with tons of clothing, personality, and action choices to choose from, that certainly vibes great with me.

I can't say I know what I'm missing with all of those DLCs I've never thought about purchasing. Other than the most obvious (for me) being the worlds that they can live in. Only starting off with a measly three worlds seems more than a little money-grabby when there are, I think, about ten locked in the uber-expensive DLCs. Other than that, I don't really feel like I'm missing much. I feel like they would be great for people who really love the Sims and wouldn't mind laying down more than a little bit of money, but I think the base game works for me for what I wanted to do from the beginning. It's just a silly little game that I don't mind wasting my time on.

It's addictive, and I haven't found any game that is similar to it at the moment. It helps me unwind after a stressful day and calms me down while I love creating detailed stories and plots for each sim of mine!

I do have to say that the prices of the expansion packs or any kind of pack are way too expensive for what they contain. That's why I recommend buying them whenever they're on sale instead of purchasing them at their original price.

Building a house, training skills, going to work (the same as every Sims game). But when that gets boring you'll need to start draining your savings for all the DLC to get to some actual content. Which is basically the same content that EA has been re-releasing since Sims 1 and 2. It's kind of nuts that the bulk of all expansion ideas came out of those two games. Anything original after that boils down to adapting those ideas for a revised control scheme, or dressing them up a little to jive with current cultural trends. Neither of which really justifies the price staying the same or increasing.

If ALL the DLC was capped at like $150 (full price), I'd probably own a fair chunk of it by now. But instead I've spent nothing beyond the retail price I paid for the base game when it came out (pre-Steam).

Don't ever pay full price for the DLC, it is on sale every month or two. Download custom content, it will make your game way better. If you have a recurring bug, there will be a mod that fixes it you just have to find it. The discord servers for mods will be your best bet for general support with the game.

The base game is good, it runs so much smoother than Sims 3 did, and is everything you'd want out of a basic Sims game. But that's the problem, its basic and all the best parts of the game are locked away behind the most expensive set of DLC on the market. EA has once again engaged in predatory practices akin to their loot box scandals by taking what should be part of the Sims 4 base game and made it accessible only via DLC. So, if you want the most basic model of The Sims ever made, get this one, it is really good at being basic.

I played a lot of Sims 2 and Sims 3 back in their prime and it was a ton of fun. Sims 4 has a lot of standout features over the previous in it's own right, but at least the others felt like a game and not a glorified dollhouse. 

Sims 4 has removed one of my favorite features from 3, and that is Custom Worlds as well as being able to place lots where-ever, personal nitpick though as the worlds in TS4 look pretty good. 
Of course there is more, Custom Swatches is gone. Even if this was cut in favor of performance, there are so many workarounds to this, even if there are a decent selection of pre-existing colors that you can choose for each separate piece i.e. independently color the sheets and frame of a bed. I question the game performance aspect because the PAINT TOOL exsists on pets, werewolves, ect... 
And to tie it all together, you don't really have as much movement freedom going around the world. What happens is you have 1 active lot at a time and you may only move around the pre-determined neighborhood (1/3 of the current world). Doing what sims 3 might have had a performance impact for sure, but either allow seamless lot transitions in an active neighborhood or just open up the world to wander if you so choose.

TS4 has some good qualities it can be commended for.
Moods and Multitasking make the game quite dynamic, giving sims more liveliness in everyday life, much needed change.
The game runs smooth as far as I am concerned, the older games are much harder to run and were never optimized well to be honest. Still think some much needed features like custom swatches/color wheel can be afforded.
Most aspects of the game look good and were designed well for what I feel the sims is. This can vary between people but the cleaner style is quite the step up from TS3's honestly hard to look at visuals.

DLC... Only good thing I can say is the content adds some decent variety, if it were a reasonable price. TS4 recently went free, but that does NOT excuse the NUMEROUS $40 expansion packs $20 game packs and $10 stuff packs. Oh that's not enough, they decided to add $5 of useless BS that is the kits?? If EA had just bundled many of the features from between the several packs like TS3 they MIGHT be worth their price, let me list a few examples;
City Living + Get Famous
High School Years + Discover University
Cats & Dogs + Horse Ranch + My First Pet
Werewolves + Vampires + Realm of Magic + Paranormal
Growing Together + Get Together + Parenthood + The various kid/toddler stuff packs
Honestly some features should have been in the base game from the start, Especially core features such as Seasons, the Generations type packs, and even the more generic packs, which most packs are especially as you get lower into Game and Stuff packs. Bare-bones features like Lunar Cycles, infants and more get added in a free update, but they have near zero uses without their corresponding packs. The packs all together are about $1,000 off sale (Please do not pay full price for these packs). There is no use in saying boycotting them will do anything because EA has several egregious money making methods. This series is fun, there just needs to be a bigger uproar to stir up EA...",1702821819,1702821819,False,1,0,0.502201557159423828,0,True,False,False

Started with the OG Sims, and played pretty much all the games but the DS game and SimCity. I've always loved the games. While I do recommend playing Sims 4, there's a couple things about it I loathe.
  1. In Sims 3, you could make pretty much ANY color swatch you wanted. They got rid of that in Sims 4.
  2. The pack prices, primarily the larger packs, are insane. Yes, you get a bunch of content but with as buggy as they are when released (and then those bugs are almost never fixed) it doesn't add up. With buying ALL the packs, (Not including tax, and rounding the numbers for easy math) it costs (USD) $1155 in TOTAL to be able to buy EVERY pack (not including base game, which is free).
There's probably a few other things, but those are the overall main issues. I understand that this is a BIG game for EA/Maxis, but still, such a money grab that's missing some of the BEST features from previous games. Do I still overall recommend it? Absolutely, but only if you a) have the money to be forking out for all the packs, or b) you have the willpower to ONLY use base game (plus free content) and CC.",1702404318,1702404318,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I focus on the house building aspect of the game. One of my favorite things to do. But between the lazy DLC items in Buy/Build Mode where purchased DLCs will copy the same item from base game or other DLCs and vaguely change it's color and then add it as a ""NEW"" item or and the vast number of bugs while not using CC is outrageous for a game that is over 9 year old. 

Reason for Uninstalling this game as of 12/12/23 after having over 460 hours in game is as follows. I've spent the last 5 hours creating a house and going into the deep detailing work to make it look ""lived in"". Saving the game often because the Sims 4 will randomly crash while running on a RTX 3070, I7, 64GB of RAM, and all being stored on 4TB SSD. Only to have the game not save. ""Save"" function, ""Save As"" function was utilized as well as the ""Save and Quit"" function. I relaunched my game hours later, loading in from my ""Save As"" file and the house and all my work not be saved. Not the first time this has happened either.

I'm done with trying to get in touch with EA's lack of a support team over these issues. Now I'm just out the $$$ that I've spent on this broken, unfinished, overpriced, money hungry game.

I don't know how they did it, but they genuinely ruined the franchise. Its disappointing, but they’ve taken all the really great things about sims three and overcomplicated it. there are no more cars, and they tweaked the basic gameplay to where it’s more like sims freeplay. and if i wanted to play sims freeplay, i would play the crappy phone game

 you cant really run around the neighborhood, there are no cars, and the UI is weird. I just wished they wouldve essentially made sims 3 with more minor updates.

All the DLC is bizarre too. Like the really offed up the pets pack, and there are none of the perks of having pets any more. you cant play as them, and theyre very dependent on you.

Also I really dislike that they started pushing an agenda though this game. a lot of companies rightfull wrote articles of on how dumb and bizarre it is.",1702172985,1702172985,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The absorbent prices you have to pay for dlcs that should have been included in the original base game is terrible. Why are we paying 40 dollars be able to play with cats and dogs and to have weather in the game. Also a lot of the packs are extremely buggy when they are released and others haven't had those bugs fixed after nearly half a decade.

I've been an avid fan of The Sims series since its inception, and The Sims 4 has truly taken the virtual simulation experience to new heights. This game is nothing short of a masterpiece, earning a solid five stars in my book!

From the moment you dive into the game, you're greeted with stunning visuals and an incredible attention to detail. The graphics are crisp, the animations are fluid, and the overall design is a testament to the developers' commitment to creating a visually immersive world.

One of the standout features of The Sims 4 is the Create a Sim (CAS) system. The level of customization available is mind-blowing. Whether you want to recreate yourself, your favorite celebrity, or let your imagination run wild with fantastical characters, the possibilities are virtually endless. The addition of diverse hairstyles, clothing options, and accessories ensures that every Sim is a unique expression of your creativity.

The game also excels in its simulation of life itself. The emotions system adds a new layer of depth to your Sims' experiences. Watching them express a wide range of emotions, from joy to sorrow, truly makes them feel like living, breathing entities. The introduction of multitasking further enhances the realism, allowing your Sims to juggle various activities seamlessly.

Building and furnishing your Sim's home is another area where The Sims 4 shines. The Build/Buy mode provides an extensive array of tools and options, making it easy to create everything from cozy cottages to sprawling mansions. The inclusion of expansion packs expands these possibilities even further, offering new worlds, careers, and gameplay elements that keep the experience fresh and exciting.

The modding community for The Sims 4 is also worth noting. The support for player-created content has led to an incredible array of mods that enhance and extend the game in ways that were previously unimaginable. Whether you're looking for new hairstyles, custom furniture, or entirely new gameplay mechanics, the modding community has you covered.

In conclusion, The Sims 4 is a triumph in the simulation genre. It's a game that continues to evolve and captivate players with its endless possibilities. If you haven't experienced the joy of creating and guiding your Sims through life, you're missing out on one of the most delightful and engaging gaming experiences available.

If you're considering getting the game - just get it. I got it when it was still paid for and though I am still a bit salty about paying for it a few months prior to the game becoming free-to-play, both my mother and I have had a lot of fun with this game. Never hurts to try something new. Just YOLO it. 

Now, there are a lot (and I mean a lot) of DLCs and packs to buy should you enjoy the game to the point of wanting to invest more money on it, and you can add free mods for both tangible (hairstyles/furniture) and intangible things (personality traits, etc.) from online websites (just make sure you have anti-virus/-malware software just in case). Mods are also easy to add to your game, I mean the program files literally already starts with a folder for mods so you're good to go quick and easy. I've added some mods I've found add to immersion quite nicely, whereas my mother prefers the DLCs and finds them perfectly suitable to what she wants from the game. 

We all know EA and how they are, micro-transactions are the air they breathe. I agree that some DLCs should honestly have been base game features, e.g. Seasons, but honestly I understand why they're add-ons instead. Especially from a new player's POV. 

Of course, some sims's actions are also buggy/lacking. Unless I explicitly tell my sim mothers to care for their gremlin-like offspring, they just play video games all day and leave everything to dad. Sims WILL put their dirty plates/glasses on half walls and coffee tables, then complain about not being able to reach them. For a game as old as this, there's no reason why this should still be considered acceptable, but this will all depend on what you play the game for so this is really just me nitpicking.",1701082327,1701082327,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Every single person I showed this game to and tried playing became instantly hooked and almost had to be pried away from the keyboard.  The only minor complaint I have about this game is, your players are not puppet-like and are too slow to do the things you click for them to do.  That means you winde up getting behind on the minor chores like cooking, which I hate, and bathroom stuff which has to come out of some other activity that's actually interesting. 

Now there are a ton of cheats and mods to make your Sims do what you want it to and those do make the game much better.  BUT this is a game that EA seems to mod on a monthly if not weekly basis, all of which seem to trash or at least disable your mods.  So every time EA makes the most minor update you have to re-download your favorite mods and do it all over again while hoping the mod is compatible with the latest useless update.  
Other than those irksome issues this game is amazing and almost magical at times (you can get actual magic with the Supernatural update).  My favorite update was Pets, those really add very much to the game and if I had only one ex-pack Pets would be it.

The last time I checked it was free, even when not free, it's so cheap now there's probably no reason not to buy it and try it right now (November 2023).",1700890253,1700890253,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

During the isolation of Covid, this game was a way to ""live"" while stuck inside. Be warned, however, the Sims 4 has a ton of DLC and one can invest hundreds (and hundreds) of $s. 

The best way to play is to figure out which expansions to invest in is to figure out what you want to invest your Sim time in. There are things that you can decide to do, but the expansions tend to also create obligations that your Sim MUST do (or face unpleasant consequences). For example, I hate cleaning IRL, so chasing after dust bunnies in a game did not seem like a heck of a lot of fun to me. So I didn't get that DLC. I do like laundry though, so I got that DLC. I love building and relationships and pets (I'm a dog person), so I got the expansions for those. I hated high school in real life, so did not get that expansion, and thought college kids were annoying IRL, so skipped that as well. But if you love the younger person drama and hijinks, those are the must have expansions! I also like the paranormal aspects like werewolves, vampires, and ghosts! Got those, too! I like to explore and spend time, so I have my settings set for longer time and longer lives (seriously, the Grim Reaper visits are hard after investing a lot of time in your Sims), but there are DLCs where you can get medicines and potions to expand the lives for your Sims. 

Some of the smaller add ons can be fun if you love to decorate or dress your Sims, and many of those add ons are under $15. Fashion isn't really my thing so I skip a lot of the designer specific dlc. Great for fashionistas though who want to spend a lot of time making their Sims sparkle. Also, there are add ons with decorating fun elements. I got quite a few of those because I love decorating. Don't forget the Sims community also has a lot of free content and builds! Check it out.

Sims 4 is a great game, and as long as you are willing to invest only in what really interests you, you can have a lot of fun creating a Sim life! If, however, you are a person who MUST have all of the DLC of a game, you are probably going to be disappointed by the expense. Sales happen several times a year (best times to buy new content) and there are occasional freebies, too. Learn how to adjust your settings if things are going too fast or too slow for you (there are several layers like day length, week/month/season/year length, and lifetime length). The speed of a life or the speed of a game can easily be changed to your gaming style. Also, know that certain expansions and add ons open up personal aspects in families, relationships, and life/afterlife. Invest wisely. Have fun in your new Sims lives!",1700838760,1700838760,True,1,0,0.520547926425933838,0,True,False,False

I had a really good time building and designing houses. It’s fun picking a starter home to decorate and then making progress in building your dream home. Perhaps if I was a more creative sim architect I’d point out some flaws but for now, that won’t be necessary.

As for playing family-oriented sims, I wish it wasn’t so slow-going. The family aspiration is hard-won because there is so much lacking when it comes to babies and children that we know there’s no way it won’t impact their personality depth when they get older, and it is such a bummer for family-oriented sims.

You see The Sims 4 isn't just about ending Sims lives. It's about spending 3 hours making the perfect house for your psychotic Sim whilst starting a family. All whilst spend another 3 hours to make the prettiest death trap for a basement possible. The Sim murdering is only a small (but important) part of the game.

Sims 5 is looking to be multiplayer and likely a hot mess so this is to be the last decent Sims game if you love the series. The multiplayer element is probably going to get all screwy with the mods and most likely EA will do all the hosting so that will limit mods even more. 

If you have to get the DLC, buy it on Steam, not EA. Why? Because there are some little quirks to how it activates if you try to play through steam with dlc from EA. This especially effects Mac users which don't have a functional version outside of Origin at this moment. However, if you load it direct from Steam first, it applies to your EA account without issue.

Ultimately, run some decent sales EA and then I'll recommend!",1700650918,1700731799,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Cons: Simulation Lag is probably my biggest issue with this game, Your Sims can go IRL minutes without doing what they were queued to do. The Modding community is pretty toxic, you can get banned from certain communities by downloading the wrong mods by the wrong creators. Some even has spyware to doxx people. There is way too much DLC. 

TLDR. Be careful around the modding scene for this game, there are more than a few psychos. Also do research into the DLC and figure out what you want and don't want. I'd also wait for a sale when it comes to DLC.

The sims retaining memory of interactions with other sims is spot on. They cleaned up this game from its released state and it should be acknowledged or at least appreciated. 

The DLC is over course there and is overpriced. But the DLC does add a ton of features in some cases and interactions in the world itself. It took me about four years to get the DLC that I have by just buying one or two when on sale.

I use mods to add personality and some other minor tweaks to the game personally. Custom content being able to be imported into the game without any programming knowledge or having to literally the fight game to get it and working is a total plus to this game. It even allowed you to use custom content by checking it in the options menu.

Compared to the previous sims, sims 2 gameplay is more realistic and each character has a more rich story to explore, because they won't take 2 hours to finish eating.

I also wish they fixed some scaling issues for people that need to have the text size up like myself and put a disable flash option as I'm unable to play during thunderstorms or take pictures via the simphone because of flash effects. I'm really happy they are including more cultures into the game but it feels a bit weird having to fork over 40 bucks to experience my own culture in the sims. I'm still waiting on the disability rep they promised us 8 years ago as currently there is only hearing aids, scars and insulin pumps and I'd really like my sim to represent what I look like in real life as a wheelchair and mobility aid user, without having to use CC. They also need to work on the warping and weird texture glitches that happen when having a plus size sim as its a relatively easy fix and discouraging to see they haven't addressed it yet as of me writing this. I'd definitely recommend the base game to pretty much anyone who has a device that can run it but try not to get roped into buying the packs, especially the kits as I don't feel the kits are worth the cost. Some of the older hair textures do need redoing as they don't match the new hairs. I do appreciate the work to be more inclusive by the dev team, for example redoing the afro textured hair to be more realistic, and appreciate the free sims deliveries that update the game with a couple of new items that aren't locked behind a paywall.

The EA App (required to launch the game) is utterly unusable, meaning that if you, like me, spent money on this, you won't be getting what you paid for. Or anything at all, for that matter, since the launcher doesn't actually launch anything.

Origin was meh but worked; it was an app you'd only ever launch to play a game that required it. But it launched. That's unfortunately more than can be said for the current EA App 80% of the time or more. When it does launch, you have to log in manually every single time, no matter if you opt-in to remembering your login or not. The process to start a game looks like this:

1. Click game icon
2. Wait several minutes for the app to load
3. If you're lucky and it doesn't immediately CTD, you're prompted to login or sign up
4. Type in your login information (typically after going through the painful password reset process)
5. Since you bought the game on Steam, it opens your browser and asks you to login to that too
6. Log in to Steam (including two-factor authentication)
7. Close the browser; about 50% of the time, the app will not register that you logged in and you'll need to repeat steps 5 & 6. 
8. The EA App is finally opened! (After a minute or two of loading...)
9. Click the tile of the game you already clicked the tile of in step 1
10. Wait for the game to launch. If you're lucky, I assume you get to play the game after this step
11. Retry steps 9 & 10 until you realize it's been three hours since you started this journey and you haven't even seen the logo of the game you wanted to play.
12. Decide you never want to purchase from EA again.

Anyway, save your time and energy; play literally anything else. I've only been able to open this game once since the 'upgrade' to the EA App in March, and that was via a workaround that has since been fixed - instead of spending time making the app usable so that such workarounds were unnecessary, they spent it making the workarounds unusable too, leaving players like me without the product we paid for.

Rating: ★★★★☆

The Sims™ 4, developed by Maxis and published by Electronic Arts, continues the legacy of the beloved life simulation franchise. As the fourth installment in the series, it brings a mix of familiar gameplay elements and innovative features, offering players a chance to create, control, and customize the lives of virtual characters in a virtual world.

Gameplay and Creativity (★★★★☆):
The core gameplay of The Sims™ 4 revolves around creating and managing your Sims' lives. The game excels in providing players with the tools to craft unique, diverse, and intriguing characters. The Create-A-Sim tool is incredibly robust, allowing for a high degree of customization in terms of appearance, clothing, and even personality traits. The same level of detail extends to building and furnishing houses, with an intuitive building system that allows for creative architectural designs.

The Sims themselves exhibit a wide range of emotions and interactions, adding depth to their virtual lives. You can guide them through various activities, careers, and relationships. This aspect of The Sims™ 4 is where it truly shines, as it's a sandbox of creativity where your imagination is the limit.

Expansions and Content (★★★★☆):
Over the years, The Sims™ 4 has seen numerous expansion packs, game packs, and stuff packs, each introducing new features, content, and themes. These expansions enhance the gameplay experience, offering additional careers, locations, and customization options. While they do come at an extra cost, they significantly enrich the world of The Sims and provide ample replay value.

Visuals and Performance (★★★★☆):
The game boasts a visually appealing, colorful, and well-optimized environment. It runs smoothly on most systems, offering a visually pleasing experience with detailed character animations and realistic interactions. The graphic style is more streamlined than previous titles, which some may prefer, but others might miss the depth and complexity of earlier games.

Modding Community (★★★★☆):
One of the remarkable aspects of The Sims™ 4 is its thriving modding community. Players have created countless custom content, from hairstyles and clothing to custom careers and complete overhaul mods. This extends the game's life and versatility, allowing you to tailor your experience to your liking.

Issues (★★★☆☆):
While The Sims™ 4 is a fantastic game, it's not without its issues. Some players have voiced concerns about the number of expansion packs and the cost of keeping up with all the content. Additionally, some players have noticed minor bugs and quirks in the game, although Maxis has been proactive in releasing updates to address them.

Overall (★★★★☆):
The Sims™ 4 is a charming and immersive life simulation game that excels in providing players with a canvas for creativity and storytelling. Its extensive customization options, coupled with expansions and a dedicated modding community, make it a delightful experience.

It's like being in charge of a virtual ant farm, but instead of ants, you have these quirky, pixelated creatures with a penchant for drama.

In The Sims 4, you're not just a player; you're a deity, creating and controlling the lives of your Sims with a mischievous glint in your eye. It's like playing a game of puppetry, except your puppets occasionally catch fire while trying to cook mac and cheese.

The customization in this game is wilder than a costume party at a zoo. You can create Sims that resemble your neighbors, your favorite celebrities, or even your weirdest dreams. It's like a bizarre episode of ""Let's Make a Deal"" where you get to choose what's behind door number three.

But it's not all fun and games. You'll be managing the day-to-day lives of your Sims, making sure they eat, sleep, and occasionally find time to use the bathroom. It's like babysitting a group of hyperactive kids who are inexplicably obsessed with grilled cheese sandwiches.

The humor in The Sims 4 comes from the unpredictable chaos that ensues when you give your Sims free will. They'll do things you'd never expect, like painting awkward self-portraits or trying to swim in a pool with no ladder. It's like watching a sitcom where the characters constantly surprise you with their absurdity.

In conclusion, The Sims 4 is the game that lets you play god in the most hilarious way possible. So, whether you want to build the perfect suburban family or create a household of misfits, dive in and prepare for a rollercoaster of emotions, from joy to frustration, with a side of uncontrollable laughter.",1698408171,1698408171,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The base game has many features however it does get boring and the dlc is kind of lack-luster.

What do expect EA's ears are always closed when they hear customer complain. I would recommend it, if they update the out of date Direct X 9.0. They finally updated to version 11, fair enough. But why it took so long to fix bugs on the base game, it's now better but still the world is empty. Now they are adding kits, to add further insults to us simmers, some kits have missing contents, witch is false advertisement. At least they added those goddamn missing contents, later on.  

It's always fun with all the DLC's installed,but not fun when the Direct X 9.0 is not updated to Direct X 10.0 or better, we are talking to you Wilson ! Also your EA app is a pain in the ass to deal with.

5/10-Descent game play, hours of fun with a DLC that's  either a great gaming experience or a busted experience.  As for the base game it self, it get really old real quick, add an expansion or game pack. I recommend Pets or Seasons for an expansion pack, for game pack it's a hard one I would say Spa day or the werewolf pack. ( yes for now )

Needed a new life goal. Started focusing on the job and on money. Spouse and kids were too time consuming, I ignored them to focus on myself. After that success, I found that I no longer needed to sleep, leaving me more time to ignore them and become stronger.

New life goal. Have many romantic partners. Started kissing and woohooing anything that moved. Spouse caught me and interrupted me. I divorced them to get them out of the way so I could get a Gold on my date. Now I no longer require food.

New life goal. Have enemies. May as well pick whoever dislikes me the most. It's my ex. Yelled at them, insulted them, beat them up five times. They felt very sad and then very angry. I no longer need to go to the bathroom.

Last goal of that lifetime wish. Watch someone die. I picked the nearest sim. It was my ex. Apparently they were my neighbor all along, which is why they always seemed to be nearby. Not anymore. Dead now. I watched it happen. I no longer need to shower. Not even to get their blood off my hands.

Next life goal. Have a big house. I move into the my former neighbor/spouse's house because it is available and bigger. I have now taken their life and their house. I adopt some kids. They were mine. I forgot about the kids. They don't know that I did nothing while watching their other parent die. Doesn't matter, I fulfill another life goal. Now I am an eternally happy and fulfilled immortal psychopath.

     b. you can build houses, apartments, bars, libraries, anything you want!
     c. you can have your own family and watch them grow over the sims years!

you shouldn't waste your time on a game if you need overpriced dlc to make most of it fun, especially when even those are mediocre and do not stand on their own

it has been 8+ years since the game originally released. they've had time to fix this and they've been too slow with it
honestly pick up a different game. if you want a free one i recommend grimm's hollow but that is a different genre. unfortunately they did take down the sims 2, but there is the sims 3 left. the sims 3 basegame has great gameplay, though it's CAS admittedly sticks to its time.

Oh boy, where do I even start?
!The $ims 4 is a sim(s)ulation game that focuses on the characters you create, following them through their journeys as they become adults and create lives of their own. Thats the premise of the base game, Sims 4, which is now free to play. This, in my opinion, was a good idea, the base game is so simple and well basic by itself, and has been refined over the past iterations.
!Personally, I have sunk almost 300 hours into this game and spent many a buck, so please note, this game has a lot more to it when you have money.
-Cons
-Money $ink: now, while Sims 4 base game is now free, there are a lot of DLCs that are almost necessary to play the game. I will go over a few of them now: Seasons, Growing Together and Get to Work. I pick these three because they add very basic things to the game. Seasons add, well, seasons! Don't want to be stuck in a perpetual cycle of ""not a season""? Nobody really wants to pay 20+ bucks for something so fundamental. Growing Together is probably my favorite addition due to ""family dynamics"", which, again, should be just a part of the base game. Get to work adds more interactive jobs, which I really enjoy playing through, even if it is my least used of the three. Modding is very prevalent in this game and I think that is fantastic. Personally, I can't figure out how to get them, but I highly recommend looking into the community. 
!Buy the DLCs only when on sale!
-Customization: Okay, this one may change in the future because the game is constantly evolving and updating, but I highly encourage looking into modders if you find the options are fairly restrictive. Specifically, I wish I could ""fine tune"" hair the same way I could the face.
-Controls: Out of everything, I think I find the controls with the camera the most irritating. A lot of the time, it just doesn't camera, it doesn't cooperate and it can be annoying. 
-Sims autonomy: Okay, I have autonomy for my household off because I like to direct exactly what is happening. However, the one thing that somehow manages to work by itself is mischief. I cannot express how badly I hate the Mischief skill, but my sims will not stop doing it! That is probably very specific to me, but it is very irritating!
+Pros
+There is so much to do: Want to be a pro athlete and max out the fitness skill? Go for it! Want to have a huge family of 7 kids? Absolutely! Good luck trying to feed them all at the same time, I wish you luck! Want to be a freelance farmer? Make sculptures to sell? Write books?? Absolutely! If you can dream it, you can (probably) do it!
+Customization: I know I picked on this earlier, but there really are so many options, especially with the addition of medical devices, like hearing aids and glucose monitors. There are stretch marks available, top surgery scars, birth marks, freckles even! There are hair styles of different textures, cultures and colors. There are also cultural clothes to pick from! 
!Conclusion
For all of my issues with the game and the franchise in general, I do love this game and I will spend plenty more time playing it.
#TLDR: Cons: DLCs cost a LOT, Controls can be wonky. Pros: There is a lot to do, even just in base game. Pro and Cons: Customization is expansive but can feel restrictive after awhile.",1690981374,1696600738,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

1222670,147652864,76561198152946761,0,6,32,0,32,1642850489,"The sims has been in gradual decline since the Sims 3 but at least they made an effort in that game.  Open worlds are gone.  Character traits having any bearing on gameplay or story telling are gone.  graphics are more cartoony, less detailed and less immersive than even Sims 2 animations.

Unless you buy hundreds of dollars worth of DLC there's little if anything to do in the base game.  Most people will have a better time playing Sims 2, which is currently available for free with every DLC included.  Those DLC actually add interesting stuff for your sims to do rather than a series of text boxes that you get in sims 4.

Beware, many of the DLCs are broken so that the key gameplay they're focused on is impossible without cheats.  This is less a sims game than it is a House building game.  The building however is generally a step up from previous game, this is definitely the only are which is an actual improvement.  Aside from some issues with placing stairs and fences you have a lot more flexibility to create vertical levels without needing cheats. 

Some of the missing features were eventually added to the base game (like swimming pools, 4 years after release) but the game still feels empty and lacking without several DLCs.  I mean you'll want at least 5 or 6 to feel like you have a whole game.  Even for FREE the Sims 4 feels like a rip off.  If that seems harsh, I paid $50 AUD on EA store many years ago and have waited a loooong time to see if things got better.

This game is so bad that as a life long fan of Sims 1 and 2 I will not even bother to play any subsequent sequels because its clear that anybody who cared about this game has left the development or is drowned out by EA's cash grabbing management.  2/10  would not recommend.

I didn't play it much but if the Sims 2 is too old school for your tastes try the Sims 3 before wasting your time here.

Funny thing… Most mods especially, scripted ones, will need DLCS. Not to mention, I have this game on Origins which in itself, is a greatly flawed launcher. 

Long story short. Start off on steam. Overall, better deals and easier launch. Rather, try to transfer your loads, packs, and more to steam from said launcher, cough… Like me!!!

Rogue Rating: ★★★★☆ (4/5) 

Ah, The Sims 4, the game where you can create a Sim version of yourself and then proceed to ruin their life in the most entertaining ways possible! I'm granting it a Rogue Rating of four out of five stolen garden gnomes because, let's be real, the DLCs are like my wallet's arch-nemesis, and the modding community is crazier than a bag of cats.

Now, let's talk about the DLCs. They're like the gourmet toppings on a Sim's existential pizza. From adding vampires and witches to throwing in a laundry day pack (because apparently, we want our Sims to suffer like we do), these expansions come at a price that could make a real-life Sim cry. But you know what they say, you can't put a price on giving your Sim the ability to become a mermaid with a knack for parenthood.

The graphics in Sims 4 are so vibrant that you'll swear your Sim's house is more put together than your own. And the character customization? It's like playing Barbie with unlimited wardrobe options, except your Barbie can also have an existential crisis and die from laughter while eating a salad.

But it's not just the official expansions that make this game a barrel of laughs; it's the fan-made mods! Want to turn your Sim into a llama-riding crime boss with a soft spot for stray cats? There's a mod for that! Heck, there's probably a mod that turns your Sim into a sentient toaster who's trying to become a world-renowned tap dancer.

Speaking of crime bosses and animal lovers, my character Zbra was a true Sims legend. He'd steal the neighbor's flamingos one day and adopt a horde of stray dogs the next. He's the kind of Sim who could throw a neighborhood party that ended with everyone stealing the furniture. Oh, Zbra, you beautiful, chaotic soul.

The Sims 4 community is like a Sims soap opera with drama, comedy, and way too many love triangles. You'll find players who are experts at building mansions that defy the laws of physics and Simmers who create storylines that rival Shakespearean tragedies. It's a place where creativity knows no bounds.

In conclusion, The Sims 4 is a hilarious and addictive life simulator where you can play puppeteer with your digital avatars. With DLCs that rival a luxury car's price tag and mods that can turn your Sims into just about anything, it's a game that keeps on giving. So, put on your llama-riding boots, adopt a herd of virtual animals, and dive headfirst into the absurdity that is The Sims 4!",1695575523,1695575523,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

And I have a lot of mods that improve the gameplay because it DOESN'T WORK (i.e. the sims AI is stupid and brainless). 

If you don't want to install mods, I recommend waiting out the next life simulator games instead of playing this decade-old cash-grabby game. The DLCs are not worth the price they sell them for. If you really have to, BUY THEM ONLY ON SALE.

Pros:

Infinite Creativity: The Sims is all about letting your imagination run wild. From designing unique characters with distinct personalities and appearances to building and customizing dream homes, the game provides an expansive canvas for creativity.

Endless Gameplay: The sheer number of expansion packs, stuff packs, and mods available for The Sims ensures that the game never gets stale. Whether you want to explore different careers, engage in romantic relationships, or simply enjoy the daily lives of your Sims, there's always something new to discover.

Accessible to All Ages: The Sims is a family-friendly game that appeals to a wide audience. Its easy-to-learn mechanics make it accessible to younger players, while its depth and complexity offer a rewarding experience for adults.

Engaging Social Dynamics: Watching your Sims interact with each other and the world around them is both humorous and engaging. The social dynamics and quirky behaviors of your virtual citizens can lead to surprising and entertaining situations.

Cons:

Expensive with Expansions: While the base game of The Sims 4 is free, the cost of expansion packs can add up quickly. Some players may find it challenging to keep up with all the additional content.

Limited Realism: The Sims is a life simulator with a lighthearted and often whimsical tone. While it captures many aspects of everyday life, it's not a true-to-life simulation, which may disappoint those seeking a more realistic experience.

Performance Issues: Depending on your computer's hardware, The Sims can occasionally suffer from performance issues, particularly when running the game with numerous expansion packs or mods.

In summary, The Sims 4 is a delightful and enduring life simulation game that offers an unparalleled level of creativity and entertainment. It's perfect for players of all ages who enjoy building, nurturing, and guiding virtual lives. The wealth of content and the community-driven modding scene ensure that there's always something new to explore in the world of The Sims.",1695307720,1695307720,True,49,1,0.817058384418487549,0,True,False,False

Without mods, this game is as stale as a three week old burger. I previously had purchased this on console for $5 a while back, but recently got it on PC for the modding aspect. It was on sale last week. Why the hell did I think spending $4 extra dollars for the ""deluxe version"" was a good investment? ITS THE EXACT SAME AS THE REGULAR VERSION! I was expecting some extra content thrown in, but NOPE. Not a single thing.

Here's what you do in this game... you create a sim, you interact with other sims, and sit around and do nothing. Without spending all of your emergency savings on DLCs (of which there are 40. There's even a DLC for Laundry... LAUNDRY! Who would pay real money to do chores in a video game?!?) EA's greed is ridiculous. I haven't bought a single DLC, but I know how bad they are. The DLC'S are poop, to put it simply. The only DLC worth buying is the Cats and Dogs DLC. And only if that crap's on sale. You pay $40 for something that should be in the base game without question, first of all, and it adds 15 clothing items, 10 hair items, random furniture, and a bugged gameplay mechanic.

Listen to me when I tell you that you are better off downloading a 'placeholder' mod as an alternative to the DLC's. Of course, you can't get modded weather without that one DLC...

There is hardly any variety of furniture in the base game. Each object has maybe five variants (average), and you are forced to pick from the slim selection of color choices the game gives you. Want yellow counters? NOPE!

The one thing I must note is how good ""Create a Sim"" is. Apart from not being able to adjust height without a mod, you can change nearly every feature of a sim. Most of the time I spend is in Create A Sim, as I mentioned.

I'll make this simple by listing laughably vanilla features that this game makes you OVERPAY for (or doesn't even HAVE to begin with!):
-Weather
-Three extra occupations
-Laundry
-Dust
-Seasons
-Businesses
-Retirement
-Illnesses
-Transportation
-Consequences...

That last thing... nothing bad ever happens to your sims. There is no consequence in this game, at least without mods. It's not like your sims could get arrested, because there's no police officer occupation in the base game!

Anyways, greedy, money hungry jerks at EA will continue doing what they've been doing. Don't buy the DLC's. Spend that money on a brand new game, or take yourself out to a nice dinner. I spent $10 on this shit and won't spend any more.",1628563823,1695047694,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Personally, I like how creating characters is nicer than before, and the game runs very lightly. Meanwhile, the animations and the sounds in the game are very few, so they look repetitive and boring. Also, the base game is far too minimal when it comes to gameplay, clothes, accessories, hairdos, anything.
As a result, you must buy DLCs for more experiences, but [b]‘The Sims 4’ seems to be a downgrade overall compared to ‘The Sims 3’[/b], and most importantly, please check the section of DLCs; this game has terribly many contents.
Obviously, I could buy many other games or something else for the cost of TS4 and its DLCs. Maybe you should use the money for gifts to send to your parents.

Base game is free now and 100% worth it, but then EA catches you with the expensive expansion packs. Luckily this game goes on sale regularly, but under ordinary circumstances the Sims 4 is outrageously priced for the DLC they provide. Unfortunately, the game is more fun with DLC than without. The price and some glitches are my top complaints. I have logged enough hours for it to be worth it to me, and the game is incredibly addictive. 

Would I buy it again? 100%. I love this game and have loved the Sims since the Sims 2. However, I would highly recommend adding it to your Steam Wishlist and waiting for the sales.  Also, buy it on PC through Steam. That way you can use cheats and mods. It will make your gameplay much better than buying on a console.",1694737989,1694737989,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My first impression of this game was: what a bland and loveless game, stripped of every contet they had in previous sims games, just to sprinkle that lost content in thousands of dlcs, so you spend all your money on your liveless little digital puppets. ""Just another dumb cashgrab"" is what i thought ""I won't fall for that"", but i still played the basegame for a while to test it a bit more. It is free after all. And then I bought one little dlc. ""It won't hurt"" I thought ""maybe this will make the game a little more entertaining"". The time after that seems blurry. Turns out I underestimated its addiction factor. I spent hours, days, weeks and months sitting in front of my computer deciding the fate of my pathetic little creatures. I forgot to eat and sleep for days. My familiy and friends tried to help me, but I didn't even notice them. There was only sims. When I closed my eyes, all I could see were little green floating diamonds. It only ended after my power was shut down, because I coudn't pay the bills anymore, as I spent all my money on the countless dlcs.
I have never touched this game since. But I know that there will come a time, that this wicked game calls for me again and chain my mind to the endless void that is the sims 4.

Cons: The expansion packs are too expensive and there's a lot of sudiving what could easily be base game (seasons, anything age related) or consolidated into larger packs (all animals and pets should be in one expansion pack, not 3+). An awful lot of the decor and clothes are already dated.
Pros: Whenever an expansion pack is released, a few similar items are added to and help update the base game. The developers do continue improving base game.

Imagine buying a full priced game, and then there is a DLC with a tenth of the amount of content with the same price tag that was included by default in previous titles.

I would refund this if I could but obviously I can't,,, Smart play EA, but like the age old saying; ""Fool me once"" Next time EA throws out another sims or game with even worse quality of content and more heftier prices for what should have been base game to begin with; Watch to sales plummet.

This is only to spoon-feed you content at a pace for a ridiculous amount of money you'd need to pay if you ever wanted to have the FULL experience, and it stinks of that infamous mobile gaming, FOMO effect.

So, you might wonder. With about 260 hours of play, how come I don't recommend it? The answer is simple.

The fun and joy I'm having with this game is all credited to some 15.000 mods installed, and to those wonderful creative people who made them all possible. Cheers!

The game is and will always be a good Sims game. It has a lot of packs (sadly costs a lot) but means you are able to choose what you want instead of having them all available to you. And most of the time that's helpful. It's a shame the fact you cant 'fast travel' via vehicles as that feature would be better than anything.

Still, it's a good game over all and has personality and is fun. Nothing, of course, will ever be as amazing as my Sims3, but this is a good replacement.


UPDATE: This game cannot be plaid unless you have mods. It's so glitch. I've had to reinstall the game at least 10 times now. Be warned, it has a lot of problems, such as features not working, glitches and lag. 

I think it costs a lot, and though I enjoy the way it looks, playing it takes a lot of patience and it lacks the gameplay the other Sims 3 and 2 have. It feels like the dumbed down version.",1636673945,1693080692,False,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I will recommend it after all the basegame is free, and is a pretty good game to have your library. 

Pros:
Creativity
Great mods
a accepting community

Cons;
Packs are overpriced and is very highly promoted, with acts like fomo. there in £4.99-35.99 ranges maybe more in dollars.
Many Bugs, Glitches and generally broken packs.
EA.

Also, if you do want to buy packs. get them on deal never full price.
I will recommend some Seasons, Cottage Living, Jungle Adventure there okay, especially cottage living because it has a bit of a learning curve.",1647938770,1692886087,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Plants randomly reverting to their seeded state
- Actions not finishing (like conversations or writing a book)
- Writing a book, progress reset to 0 sometimes
- finish a painting, only to get a white canvas that you can only destroy
- try reading a book to you child ... either your characters goes to the pool, waits, and then cancels the action, or just looks at the child and does nothing
- wash your hands after the toilet, sim goes to the sink that is the most far away
- go to build mode at night, move one item, resume play ... after hours you realize, that your sims have completely reset all their actions and are not sleeping anymore
- ... 


Original review:
Don't start a family in this game ... your character as well as your child run around randomly through the house when you tell them to do something.

- Put to bed? can't for some reason, even though you did it multiple times the last few days
- Teach to speak? No problem, i just go to the basement and wait for my kid to come after me
- Feed the Toddler? Sure put it in the seat, get food, and ... nothing ... wife picks up the kid and goes playing with her.
- Potty train after a bath? No problem, lets just stand around for 15 minutes before actually starting.
- Toddler takes food and goes to the BASEMENT!!! to eat??? WTF who programmed the AI for the kids??????
- Eating? Oh no child ... your mother takes you out of your chair in the middle of lunch ... who need food anyway ....",1610115608,1692208730,False,1,1,0,0,True,False,False

Here is an update, the new EA APP, Steam combo Mess, makes me pine for ORIGIN!! You are forced to update the EA app and forced to stay online with the EA app and the Steam APP!!


IN A FINAL TAUNT, after not helping me at all, EA had the audacity to send me two emails today stating, 

""Hello,

We wanted to check and see how things were going after we provided you more information about your recent request.

We’re happy to help if you still need us. You can review and update this issue from the My Cases page.

If the issue has since been resolved, you won’t have to do anything further.

We listen, and we're committed to making sure you always have a personal and positive connection to our games, our people and our community. We very much appreciate you as our customer, and assisting you today was our pleasure. or get help from the player community on Answer HQ.

Regards,
EA Customer Experience"".

I am still locked out, and they didn't respond to any of my requests for help.
I am serious about this, EA offers no way of getting help!! I have repeatedly asked to update my email for the Ea app, as I lost the old email years ago, and who ever is on the other side isn't a real person. The EA app keeps trying to send a code to the old email, so I am locked out. I got several of there pretend responses, I quickly filled out the information they requested to change my email, but when I sent the email, I got a message saying it couldn't be sent because that mailbox is no longer monitored. EA IS A SCAM COMPANY!! Oh, the EA HELP PAGE ON FACEBOOK, ALSO FAKE!! BUY AT your own Risk. 

ONE LAST THING, STEAM is of no help with any of it because it is a third party game. I don't know how they are getting away with this.",1596760718,1692056712,False,6,0,0.571344614028930664,0,True,False,False

At this point were going to see gta 6 before ts5. 
I have alot of hope (almost too much hope) that one day maybe before my great great great grandchildren die that ea would add things to improve the game like

1.Open world
2.Better genetics
3.Sims growing more realistically (as opposed to the age up feature)
4. Height sliders (goes hand in hand with 3)
5.More activities for toddlers and infants
6.Preteens
7. Shopping centers, hair salons, tattoo shops
8. More living options (shelters? twin homes? living on the street?)

Along with the things i feel that would make the game better, heres what i think they should give us back from previous games

1.Sims biographies, gives more background and makes the story behind your sim much easier to tell
2. Cars
3. Playable pets
4. More traits
5. Burglars 
6. Create-a-style
7. More lots 
8. More story progression

There is quite a bit i am missing and I understand that there is mods for some of these issues but I just feel that it is such a bummer they have so many chances to add more dynamic to the game and decide they want to profit off of it instead. it's like nobody wants to work these days smh. In contrast to all the bad, there is so much that is great about the game, the horses, hearing aides, and the pride collection, overall smoother graphics, sim multitasking, adding your own events and holidays, infants, more animation and much more. 
They are such a cool things to have that i have not seem in previous games. 
One thing I also would really like to touch on is the bugs in ts4, starting with the millions of times that I play and I feel like my sim is starving to death within minutes of launching my game, the way the Sims ignore certain tasks no matter how many times you click on it, locking the computer and other sims still being able to use it, sims glitching into objects, and infants suddenly becoming 6ft tall.There are so many bugs i can probably touch up on considering a majority of their packs have mixed reviews mainly for buggung reasons but there is a final bug and may be the biggest bug/disappointment, High School Years. I love getting expelled every single day and having to cheat my way into getting back into high school, never being able to ship my sold thrifted outfits, Science fair bugs, prom happening too often, Just feels like everywhere I turn there's a bug (these have been complained about since HSY launch). The reason it's very disappointing is that it was a very hyped up pack by ea and its fallen short to everything it could've been, considering its very mixed/negative steam reviews.
If ea listened to its consumers Im pretty sure this game would be much better and have overwhelmingly positive reviews, it's a good game but it has SO much more potential that they aren't fixing. I know im not alone in how I feel because alot of what I have said is what I've seen other people say.
Since 2019 I have racked up approximately 4k hours of game play between steam and origin/ea, and this is where the mixed emotions come in. This game has many short comings and bugs but it's such a great game to kick back and relax to play. Will I complain about this game for years to come? Hell yeah! Will I still play it at the end of the day? Also hell yeah. I understand that my review is solely my opinion and no one has to agree with it, but this game will still be a recommend from me.",1691855202,1691855202,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

The core concept of the game is undeniably fun. There are so many ways to roleplay, create unique stories, and experiment with different scenarios. But let's be real here - this game's potential has been strangled by the relentless greed of its publishers.

I used to enjoy devising crazy experiments within the game, like trapping Sims inside boxes or creating chaotic situations just for laughs. It was all in good fun, and the game's mechanics allowed for endless creativity. However, my enjoyment has been overshadowed by the nauseatingly expensive DLCs that Electronic Arts shamelessly peddles.

The cost of these DLCs is absurd and sickening. Let's calculate:

Currently, there are 68 DLCs
14 Expansion Packs (39,99€ each) - 559,86€
12 Game Packs (19,99€ each) - 239,88€
19 Stuff Packs (9,99€ each) - 189,81€
23 Kits (4,99€ each) - 114,77€

TOTAL: 1 104,32€
(1 212.72 USD)

I'm not one to endorse piracy, but with the way EA is treating its players, The Sims 4 might just be the only game I'd consider doing it. It's a sad state of affairs when a once-beloved series has been tarnished to this extent by a company's insatiable appetite for profits. It's time for EA to wake up and realize that they're alienating their loyal player base with their outrageous pricing practices.",1691601117,1691601130,False,2,0,0.53947371244430542,0,True,False,False

[b]The game itself is pretty good.[/b] Don't get me wrong, I bet some people adore this version of The Sims. The problem is, it had so many great features brutally taken away (like the ability to freely change colors of furniture), that it's hard not to dislike it.

It really sucks that you gotta buy so many DLCs to get absolutely anything. In a way, I think they overdid it. There are SO. MANY. WORLDS., and the loading screen is the most annoying thing - Sims 3 didn't have that.

JUST LET ME PLAY MY GAME??? 

The sims do not listen to what I tell them to do, all of the actions I tell my sims to do get randomly cancelled, random dishes that do not get washed, bad pathfinding??? God.

HOWEVER... It rarely works for more than a week or two in a row. They update and break it literally every 2-4 weeks. Sometimes it's not playable without corrupting your saves for months at a time. Since Steam prefaced the question, ""Would you recommend this game...?"" No, hell no, just download and play Sims 2 or 3. I mean, TS4 is visually beautiful, lots of wonderful worlds to explore and reside in and vacation to, but seriously do not buy this game. Just steal it. Not a time I start up to play goes by that I don't regret getting back into this franchise. The company has lost their freaking minds. Every time they release anything new, it breaks everything old. 

Forget about even avoiding mods, they're still gonna break your game about every few weeks, mods notwithstanding. Shoot there are two entire expansion packs that NEVER WORKED AT ALL and still have yet to be fixed. Even modders, who are the only devs that help players enjoy the game, haven't been able to fix them yet. Dining Out literally doesn't let your sims go to a restaurant, order a meal, and have it take under 12-14 hours [assuming they ever even get their orders]. I have chatted with people online who had sims literally starve to death at restaurants while waiting for food. 

Nothing but a permapay cash grab from one of the worst, yet most successful gaming companies in the past 20 years. This is the most successful video game franchise of all time, and they're cutting so many corners and so much of their staff, that they will run it into the ground as soon as a better life sim comes along. I need to run Steam and EAxis app together to start this game every freaking time...? And the EAxis app is even worse and lass reliable than Origin was, ofc. If the game has to use internet to boot every time, it should be free, or really cheap at least on a subscription plan, and take less than 100 gigs of my HD space since it effing needs the internet every. single. time. If I buy it, to the tune of over $1000 american over five years [ON SALE] by the way, I should be able to play with no internet and a solar battery on a desert island. 

Even though I got most of this game's infinite EP's on sale, I still plan to get a bootleg of it once they're done wrecking it and move on to the fifth version, which they are gonna have a lot of trouble pushing after this title. Download it from the internet and get into the modding community. Without them, this title wouldn't have sold half of the copies it has. That's why they're LITERALLY HIRING popular internet modders to try and save this title!! [AND THEIR NOW PAID WORK STILL IS NOT HELPING IMPROVE THE GAME AND SOME OF THEM SAY EA SHORTS THEM ON THE HOURS THEY WORK]. america has a death penalty, well it's time for the corporate death penalty to be used on eaxis; I'm owning responsibility here, because madden players who hate every new madden [love football but never played it] and sims players who hate TS4 [yo] are the two reasons why that evil empire is even still around, it's literally the most hated corporation in the western world. That is neither hyperbole nor frustration, it's the result of one of those rich folks magazines polling people, look it up [eaxis has remained the most hated corporation almost every year they have polled for this, and usually the employees are the ones most vocal about why it's an irredeemable company].

Quit tanking the GD game every effing week, devs. I'll tell ya where you can shove all these borked updates every 2-4 weeks too. And Project Rene...? TS5....? I won't even be stealing it, this franchise needs to meet the same fate as shows like The Simpsons for the same reason, it's been going on WAY too long, with too little talent making ANY creative decisions, gameplay has not improved [honestly has gotten worse] since TS2 [2004] and TS3. Literally never met anyone in game fan groups who could say TS4 is their favorite, it's factually worse than the first OG title from the year 2000. At least that game didn't break every two-four weeks.

Hey, but besides that, it's a pretty fun and content-rich game fr. Hard not to want to do absolutely everything in the game, or otherwise try to simulate your own wants into the game, of which they have absolutely everything you could think of. You like catching bugs? Ight catch them in Sims when it's raining outside in real life. Learning guitar IRL? Learn at the same time as your sim who basically will always suck at it until around level 9. Did you watch a little too much Twilight in your teen years? Well, guess what, you can probably completely re-enact every single scene, just in this game alone. Animations are all fluid and cartoon-y and fun to watch, lots of customization for literally every single human on Earth, build mode is absolutely beautiful and free as can be, etc etc. Pretty fun game until you start trying to compare it to other Sims games.

- Used to be 40$ now its free, no compensation for buying the game before being switched to free. I was expecting at least a 40$ DLC given for free, but nope. Not only they take your money but they expect you to spend more.
- 1000$ to get all DLCs, and even on sales its still 800$, pathetic cash grab. Sims 3 are still expensive, but at least it ain't 50$ each. Pretty much all the DLCs are content from previous Sims games. For example, werewolves and vampires was free content in Sims 2, but now its 40$? At least they give the holiday pack for free, but it doesn't make sense because you need to buy the Seasons DLC to make it worth it, who puts Christmas decoration when its always summer? What a fucking joke lol
- Sims 3 has way more content and you can also have CARS, but Sims 4 is too good for cars, its seems that horses are a better mode of transport instead, but it took them years to get them in the game. Doesn't matter tho cause even if you take them to go places you just get hit with a loading screen, making it a 100% useless mode of transport.

No joke, I enjoyed Sims 4 for quite some time, even though I despise how much DLC this game has, it let you give personality to every sim you created, however they have severely limited mean/mischief interactions, which means the drama an antagonistic personality causes between sims is severely limited.

Snobby rich people are now neutered Elitists that no longer lord their income over others, and that Grumpy old man you designed to scream at kids for getting on his lawn is now Mr. Rogers, you can't have dorky slap fights, or cartoonish dustcloud fights.

I get that EA wants to live in a boring Utopia where everyone holds hands and sings Nursery Rhymes, but if you go outside and touch grass you'll find that this Utopia is detached from reality, that people want you to conform to their hivemind ideology or be destroyed, as opposed to dancing around with a purple dinosaur.

IF however, and only IF you are a headless cashcow  with no standards whatsoever, who just wants to raped repeatedly over and over against until your bank refuses to borrow you any more money, this is the game for you! They really exponentially raised the bar here in their social experiment how desperately people would allow to rip themselves off with DLC that offer very little to almost no content for ludicrous prices. The base game itself offers very little, and the developers have shown absolutely no respect towards the community's feedback. The whole game is a buggy mess, they don't fix their issues and instead focus on stealing more cash from you like the desperate blind helpless cash cow that you truly are. Hey, I get it... It's an EA product and they don't give a shit about us, I mean... What else should we expect That's fine, that's fine, but don't ever expect a positive review from me, this shit is getting BEYOND ridiculous!! To have a decent experience with this game that feels like more then an empty shell you 'll have to buy tons of overpriced DLC that will run up to a 1000 euros, you can buy yourself a top tier gaming computer instead or a bloody car!

PS: Each time I play this game I run into new issues that are completely avoidable and are purely based on EA 's greed and reluctance to provide an unbroken game to their devoted community who stood by them all these years. There are simply to many issues to mention to list here... But one of the things that piss me off most is that the game forces you to have an internet connection, even though the game claims that it works in offline mode, the truth is that it simply doesn't because the EA app (which shouldn't fucking exist!) doesn't work properly. Also the game is full of bugs, like for example when you move in an household from the gallery, 99 percent chance is they will be bald, and everything will be so fucking bugged you just wan to shut this trash down and call it a day, so you are doomed to live in an empty world full of empty houses  or live on fucking bug world where most people are bald and look bugged all over the place (even when you specifically tell the game not to load content for the DLC's you don't own, and it destroys immersion so deep that it 's game breaking in my opinion). All of these things could be fixed by a fucking amateur, this games runs like shit by choice, not because it 's hard to fix. For a game this fucking expensive, the least I would expect from them is make absolutely certain that I can at least play it.

[b]Topic: The Sims™ 4 [/b]
When I purchased The Sims™ 4, It was $39.99 + tax. Since the base game of Sims™ 4 is ""Free to Play"" now, I believe this calls for an updated review. I made my original review on February 27, 2022, and I have a playtime average of 299.9 hours.

[b] Extra Information: ""Pre-Free Players."" [/b]
Steam users who purchased The Sims™ 4 before it became ""Free to Play"" have been offered little additional content for the money they spent on the base game (however, they did offer something even though EA were not obligated to.) They were offered a Desert Luxe Kit ($4.99 + tax), which was available as free until October 17, 2022. The base game also became ""Free to Play"" on this established date. (July 25, 2023.)

[b] The Sims™ 4: Base Game [/b]
The Sims™ 4 allows extensive customization and untold stories that you control. You play through your household of sims, build and decorate plots, and create personal goals. Electronic Arts (The company behind The Sims™ franchise) has offered routine updates and bug fixes. Furthermore, there have been several attempts to include cultural diversity. The Sims™ 4 requires a separate launcher to play.

[b] DLC: Expenses & More [/b]
The Sims™ 4 has a wide range of DLC: Expansion Packs (Large $39.99), Game Packs (Medium $19.99),  Stuff Packs (Small $9.99), and Kits (Mini $4.99). The Sims™ Community commonly debates if the DLC is worth it, citing that ""it feels much like a cash grab,"" ""microtransactions,"" and ""the money isn't worth the content."" DLC releases are frequent to the point that they are monthly, and members have complained about game-breaking bugs. 

[b] Game Modifications: Mod Friendly [/b]
The Sims™ 4 Mod Community isn't small, and they have created some fairly decent mods to spice up your experience! After each update, The Sims™ 4 will disable mods, and you will have to enable them each time. Some updates will break mods, so it may be a little while before your favorite mod creator creates a patch!

[b] Company Communication: Interactions [/b]
It has been noted that a fair portion of The Sims™ 4 community feels unheard by Electronic Arts Inc, so The Sims™ 4 doesn't have the best reputation for listening to community feedback. This can be supported by several Steam comments on the base game's posts.

[b]Veteran Player: Biased Review [/b]

[i] I have created this review based on my personal experience with the game and what I have seen from numerous places. This is simply to inform, not intentionally slander or be malicious. Do not take my words as fact - rather, take them as a caution and with a grain of salt.  [/i]

[i]Honestly, I don't recommend this game. Am I biased? Yes. I have played the Sims franchise for years. I grew up on it. As a veteran player, it is common that we expect a game that is supposed to be the successor for older games to provide more content and improvements. While the graphics have improved, The Sims™ 4 feels like it has earned the presence of a mobile game. [/i]

[i]What was included in the base game that enhanced the experience has been put behind a barrier paywall. DLC aside, The Sims™ 4 lacks several great features from its predecessors. The Open World has been replaced by ""rabbit holes"" and loading screens. There is no Create-a-style tool feature. Also, wasn't there a Sims Memory Book that was great for storytelling? The Sims™ 4 has damaged the legacy of The Sims™ franchise. [/i]",1645999848,1690325669,False,3,0,0.527186751365661621,0,True,False,False

I spent $40 for a game that I couldn't even play initially, as the pack had been riddled with bugs. But, EA developers were quick to fix said bugs, so I put up with it. Now though, I can't play the sims 4 as it won't launch on my laptop. I've tried everything, but the EA app just won't work. Whenever I try to launch the game itself, it redirects me to the EA home screen but then it disappears literally a second later. There are just too many bugs and glitches for this game to cost so much money. Plus, the horses like so cartoony. The sims 3 horses looked so much better and more realistic imo But, I guess that doesn't matter when I can't even launch the game now.

From the highly detailed graphics to the flexibility of the creative tools players possess, The Sims 4 offers an astounding simulation of life that is unmatched by any other game in the industry.

Creating a Sim is one of the best features of The Sims 4. You can choose so many details ranging from physical traits to a starting personality template. It’s as simple or as complex as you want it to be and the possibilities are nearly endless. You can even design a dream-home for your Sim and furnish it with all kinds of modern amenities.

The career mode in The Sims 4 adds an entirely new layer of deepness to the game. It’s no longer just about sending your Sims to mundane jobs--you can now choose what path your Sim takes, from climbing the corporate ladder to owning a home business. It’s an incredibly fun and rewarding way to established goals in the game and the possibilities are seemingly endless.

The Sims 4 is an incredibly immersive and enjoyable game. It’s easy to get lost in the lives of your Sims, and there’s something for everyone whether you’re just starting out or a veteran of the series.

All of that is just a suggestion though, just for a cheaper rout but to still keep the game fun. Either way you play i think this is one of the greatest games and i highly suggest it, especially with it being free now. Happy Simming!",1689990333,1689990333,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Thank (the higher plane of being) that EA reminded me to give this game a recommendation against buying it with its new horse DLC. 40 bucks. For horses.

I guess my review doesn't hold as much value if I didn't ""grow up with the game"", as I only played the hell out of The Sims 3 as a kid, but I can still draw a comparison. It just feels shallow. A game you can play for a while and then just... Drop. A dip in the pool.

You do the same everyday things as a Sim and that already seeps in that feeling of repetitiveness, and the fact that to go to a bar or other building you have to bring out the map and then do the loading stuff urks me off to just not do it.

Now, with 780+ hours in the game, I have a different opinion. Should you get this game now, whilst EA has *so graciously* made the base game free? Yes. Should you have bought this game, like I did? Absolutely not. The game itself is hardly enjoyable without mods and/or custom content. And DLC? Don't bother wasting your yearly salary on a couple packs. Go find an ""alternative method"". With the few packs I purchased (Vampires, Island Living, Realm of Magic, a few others), I found the content lacking, with the exception of one (Cats & Dogs, which was the only one which felt even remotely worth purchasing). My other ""alternatively acquired"" packs were only worth the space they took up on my hard drive because they weren't making any dent in my wallet.

Good things about the game:
- Runs great for me, even with 5k+ mods installed. I have an old laptop, where i have to connect 3-4 diff things to it for it to function.
- Base worlds are great, lots of adaptability and you can customize EVERY lot. 
- Good gender versatility (But there are mods available for additional things that aren't in the game)
Bad things:
- DLCS are REALLLYY expensive in my opinion. I haven't been able to get any yet at all.
- you have a lot of options, but limited in specific furniture needs / wants (THOUGH, ALMOST ALL CC MODS FOR SIMS, BUILDING, AND BUYING ARE FREE)

You have to fight with your sims to actually make them do what you tell them to, almost everyday my sims get depressed or angry because they are very needy and they don't allow you to decide their actions most of the time. Very much like baby sitting to a spoiled child. Least but most importantly the prices are super HIGH! The packs are as expansive as the base game, nearly impossible to buy.  Its a sloppy game they only made to make money. There are many bad reviews online explaining why this game sucks, even if they had just looked at them, they could have made a playable game... but obviously they didn't",1660039644,1689438720,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Well the game itself is sound if you like designing homes and building a world that you can then interact with you can put as much or as little time into it as you desire. It's geared towards people who like to design and add color and texture to their world. You can pretty much play God or yourself and embark on whatever type of life you desire. The surrounding community is really what makes this game I would encourage you to read some of the guides so that you know what CC is and things like Maxis match unlike a lot of games this was designed so it's pretty hard to get wrong, it was designed for lighthearted fun and someone with an eye for design in fashion architecture or human behavior will enjoy this game the most. There's many ways to spend your time in my opinion this beats the hell out of solitaire and the community that is supporting this game is the reason why it'll never truly become out of date or old

Yes.... the base game is free sort of it's kind of like free puppy if you've ever had a puppy They're definitely not free There's a lot of upkeep and growing it takes place even though The puppy becomes part of the family he turns out to be quite expensive which is offset by the love and friendship he provides. In the same way the sims make the bulk of their money through expansion packs They're looking to expand their user base which means more cool things in the gallery for everyone to enjoy you can stay mad about Having paid for the game when others are getting it for free but if they want to enjoying it Chances are They're going to pay for a bunch of expansion packs and become part of the very large community. At least that's what the business is Counting on so that they can continue to be profitable which is also good for the community Because it means they'll continue to support This game which over the years has grown to a full-blown community a lot of what makes a game good is the Developers what makes it great is the modding community that comes in and customizes it and unbelievable ways with a good developer or Developers They work with their mighty community to develop an even better game the people behind the sims 4 are not only trying to work with a developers but also the community which given the history says a lot for men it's easy and more affordable to just jump ship and start up a new company with all you've learned be thankful the sims 4 team has not done this.  And yes I actually did pay for my whole steam library including Sims 4. Some of the community Because it really is that large I don't work for the developers or anybody associated with the sims.

The amount of DLC needed to even get close to the base games of The Sims 3 renders it not only frustrating, but such a big departure from what made this game so good in the first place. It's really disappointing that even all these years after release, DLC is the only thing keeping the basic points of the game playable. Personally, without seasons, the game would be incredibly monotonous. In saying this, EA is most likely hedging future bets on Sims 5. Very disappointing that EA is choosing to let their greed steer the franchise.

This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Youtube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on where you were supposed to go. I asked my Son for help and he joined my coop. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

It's got bad lighting and it's near impossible to make your Sims cute or attractive. The randomize button seems to only be capable of producing hell spawns. I recommend searching online Sims 4 CC (Custom Content). There are tons of modifiers like different clothes, makeup, body types, skins and textures and way more. If you end up downloading a lot like I have (around the 2,000 mods mark) you should look into finding a mod manager. Make sure to turn on Allow Custom Content, and Allow Scripts in the Sims 4 settings. Turning on scripts will allow some of your game-play mods to work. If you download any .script files you'll need to have it enabled. Modding is extremely easy and plenty stable for this game!! Looking up a simple tutorial on YouTube will tell you everything you need to know. But yeah, I would never play un-modded sims.. Very boring and low quality in my opinion, but it makes a great base of a game. 

Also the Sims 4 Packs or the DLC is extremely expensive, and it's very gross of EA to allow this to happen. :< 
It's lame as hell.. EA is a dogshit company, I wouldn't even buy this game unless it's on sale for like %75, and I only play it because it's nostalgic for me. :3",1688985753,1688985753,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Edit: Now that the Sims is free to play, I'd say it's definitely worth getting. Like I said previously, downloading CC is the way to go. It can enhance your game SO much more than some packs would. It's unfortunate that some key features of standard simulation games are locked behind a pack paywall. A few mods I recommend are MCC Command Center (allows you to unlock and use many cheats), UI Cheats, and More Columns in CAS (especially if you download a bunch of CC like I do). 

If you're interested in getting a pack, for starters, BUY THEM WHEN THEY'RE ON SALE. The one pack I absolutely recommend is Seasons. Seasons is absolutely crucial to the game because it does exactly as it sounds: adds seasons to the game. Not only that, but it also adds events to the calendar, such as Halloween or Christmas.",1659990227,1688937913,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Though, there is a few issues with this game. The packs are WAY overpriced. Why do the packs cost more than the game? And I feel like certain packs, like Seasons, should just be included regardless, due to the fact The Sims 4 is a life simulator, and... well: weather is a very big and necessary part of life.

Another issue is your Sims itself. Especially with the new infant update. I stack a bunch of actions in my Sim's taskbar to take care of the dishes, change the baby's diaper, wake up the dog, empty the trash can, take a shower... et cetra.

The amount of overpriced dlcs you need to make it fun is unbelievable.

Mods like extreme violence, wicked whims (download at your own risk itll scare you) and other cute little mods do add a layer of fun for basegame baddies and furniture and cas cc (custom content) is always a nice alternative to the stuff you find in packs and dlcs, but unless you use a sketchy unlocker online to get some for free, your gonna be dropping lots of money for basic necessities like weather, going to school, starting a business or even unlocking a new world.

The sims 4 at its core has 3 worlds your allowed to explore with your sim(s) if you chose to play dlc free. Willow creek, basically your bread and butter world that youll spend a lot of time in, it has a few neighborhoods and public lots (parks etc) but there nothing much to interact with, and this goes for a ton of the worlds in the sims, dlc or not, the most youll get out of a world is a street festival or a highschool. 

The next basegame world is oasis springs, it essentially has the exact same content as willow creek with sand and a different layout.

The last basgame world you get is newcrest, a completely baron world with 15 blank lots to allow you to get creative and build your own world, the only issue is 90% of the tools you'll need to build your very own sims 4 world (businesses, school, holidays) is locked behind many paywalls, see the issue?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Moving on from worlds, and i promise this wont turn into me reviewing all the packs in one long ass review, but let me list off a few things that will be locked for you unless you choose to spend some money.

- Cats and Dogs (cats and dogs pack)
- owning a farm (cottage living pack)
- owning a business (get to work pack)
- following a sim to work (get to work pack)
- following a sim to highschool (even then, the highschool is easily the most boring highschool youll ever see, and it cannot be customized) (highschool years pack)
- vampires, mermaids, aliens, skeletons, werewolfs (vampires, island living, get to work, jungle adventure, werewolfs respectively, however all of these except for skeletons are very interactive and i would honestly say are worth it)
- apartments (city living pack)
- weather, yes, you have to pay a pretty ass penny to watch it rain in the sims 4, its a scam and anyone telling you it isn't is batshit insane. (seasons pack)
- holidays (seasons pack)
- going to university (discover university pack)
- social media (highschool years pack)
-  spas (spa day pack)
- sleepovers (highschool years pack)
and much much more.

all of these necessities that you think would be basic for a life sim are locked behind $20 dollar plus paywalls with bare minimum content to customize your sim and their houses, and even then, things like the cats and dogs packs are split into different dlcs, making you buy the basics first and the fancier basics afterwards.

Not to mention half of the DLCs have become completely worthless due to EA recycling past content with a fresh coat of paint and fancier functions into other packs for a higher price.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Now for the good

EA makes modding this game VERY easy, theres a folder called mods in the game files that you just drag and drop things into, these mods can be found on pinterest, youtube, tiktok and many dedicated sites. they provide things ranging from new clothes and furniture to cheats and brand new gameplay functions, and 99% of them will be free, the ones that aren't are breaking EA's terms of service, which is ironic. 

Not to mention, if diversity is something your looking for in a game, this is it. sims are can be customized completley, from the way they talk and walk to the way they look, the pronouns they go by, if they can give birth or not, their attractions, mannerisms, physical frame, likes and dislikes and much much more.

Its also a very casual and non challenging game, which can be a plus or minus based on what you personally prefer.

-----------------------------------------------------

TLDR = you will be charged for many basic tools to make the game fun and sims 4 as a base game is baron at best, but its also a customizable experience and easy to mod and play",1686904708,1688690429,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Stars: ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ (3/5)

Sims 4, oh how you've stolen countless hours of my life! This virtual life simulation game has consumed me like no other. I've spent more time creating and customizing my Sim's outfits than I have on my own wardrobe. The attention to detail is astounding, from the intricacies of home design to the vast array of career paths and aspirations.

But let's not forget the delightful chaos that ensues. It's both amusing and frustrating how my Sims can't seem to handle even the simplest tasks without my intervention. I've watched in amusement as they set the kitchen on fire while attempting to make a grilled cheese sandwich, or stand idly by as they get lost in the house they've lived in for years.

All in all, Sims 4 is a captivating and addictive virtual experience that lets me unleash my creativity and indulge in the absurdity of virtual life. Just be prepared to lose track of time and occasionally question your priorities. While it has its quirks, it's a solid choice for fans of life simulation games.",1617811736,1688564124,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In order to have fun you have to spend hours of your time looking for mods that fit all of your sim's aesthetics and then find a whole bunch of future  mods that will add somewhat tasteful furniture because the base game furniture SUCKS BOOTY BUTT. Or you have to sell your soul and buy every single expansion pack because nobody will ever have fun with just the base game. You can't even start a family, you have to spend another 20 bucks to do that. the base game might be free now but THE GAME IS NOT FREE you will have a bad time if you have no expansion packs and don't want to sell your soul and spend half of your fucking life downloading mods and DESTROYING you storage. and do not get me started on some of the mods this game has to offer because OH BOY. There is this mod, wicked whims, this mod was the worst decision i have ever made. i thought "" oh, it won't be that bad!"" WRONG. OH MAN this mod was NASTY. the worst possible things happen and one who downloads that mod is a freak and should feel ASHAMED. Now, not only do you have to sell your soul and spend all your money, but you have to spend HOURS making not only a sim that you are happy with, but an ENTIRE HOUSE that you are pleased with. Now, not only are the building controls confusing as hell but they are also very tedious. If you want to be able to place clutter freely you not only have to manually bring up the thing you want to put on the table, but you have to estimate where all the clutter will be on the table IN MID AIR. Now I'm not sure how hard it is to be able to let players place clutter freely on tables but it can't be that hard. so if you estimate where the clutter will be on the table wrong, you now have to move every. single. piece of clutter you had positions and change it so it will actually look nice on the table, you will have to do this like 5 or 6 times. I can't really complain about any of the other building features because I had enough when trying to freely place clutter on tables. Anyways, i love and hate this game at the same time the love only comes from me getting sucked into it and seeing how much fun people have when they spend the time and money to actually have fun, so please if you are on the fence about getting into this game, do yourself a favor and DON'T. You will regret it and your wallet, your free time, and your sleep schedule will hate you for it. But I do like having silly little lesbians.

You already know EA makes you spend over 1-2k on DLCs like adding a damn kitchen appliance in a different colour. The packs aren't really worth the money, especially at full price. 

I highly discourage you from buying it on any platform because regardless, you are going to have to deal with the EA app. Sometimes it will work, and sometimes, for no reason at all, it will bring you the worst week or possibly month of your life trying to diagnose it.

Your 12 year old that wants to play the Sims is going to have to enlist you, as a tech incompetent parent, to diagnose, understand and try to fix running the EA app. It is an extreme hassle, one that I literally cannot with all my heart recommend you to go through. It's that bad.

Its the addition to the game that allows sims to be straight (yawn) but also decides what kind of food or music they like, and gives them moodlets based on what they eat or listen to.

Which brings me to my fallout-style bunker experiment, in which I put the sims on full autonomy in the game settings, and lock them all in a bunker with everything they need to live. I don't directly control the Sims, but I do indirectly mess with their environment if I think they're too comfortable.

The bunker had a jukebox in the common area, central to all the living quarters. Someone turned on the jukebox, and set it to Christmas music. The bored sims all come out and start dancing to the Christmas music.

Then I get a pop-up message: ""So'n'so is not really feeling the tunes she is listening to. Is it safe to say she *dislikes* Christmas Music?""

Fastest I have ever hit yes on a pop-up message.

So here she is, dancing to the music because the is bored, and continually getting more and more ANGRY at the music because its just Jingle Bells on repeat. She gets so angry that she goes to the bathroom to scream in the mirror for a few minutes.... Then goes back out to the common area to keep dancing! The cycle continued for some time: dance, get angry, scream, get bored, dance....

And then the message started popping up for other people, so eventually I had a whole group of miserable people angerly dancing to Jingle Bells, and it occurred to *none* of them to change the music because... They were too polite? Didn't want to change it if someone put it on? Were these Canadian bunker-inhabitants?

I expected them all to die in a kitchen fire like they did when I tried this in Sims 3, but this happening was so much better than I could have dreamed. 11/10.",1687993136,1687993136,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Otherwise I'd delete it from my library and never play it again. Why? Because it ruins custom content every time the game updates, which is frequently, and unless the author of the custom content fixes their mod, it won't work. (Which is not the authors fault, it's EA's fault for not letting us play the game with  no opt out of updates) I have 17,520 mods I use, and I'm not going to try to find every authors fix. This wouldn't be an issue if you didn't have to have the EA app, but you do, so even if you go in offline mode on the EA app when you start the game, if the EA app kicks in before you can take it offline, your game updates and your mods are ruined. Also, I just noticed the last few days that even Steam won't let me go in offline mode with this game. It won't let me play until I am online in Steam and online in the EA app. I detest both companies because of this.

I mean the base game is available for free and compare the state of this game way back 2014. It have a lot of content to keep you from playing but I do not assure the longevity of the gameplay. Especially when you do live mode. The Sims 4 brought innovative and complex build/buy mode yet the live mode aspect of the game is still lacking even you have packs included... For me this is the reason why you make go hungry for buying a pack to expand the longevity of your gameplay... To be honest some of the packs are pretty worth it and I could play those for hours... Then you burn out and drop the game for god knows how long and play it again, then repeat. In regards of buying a packs DO NOT BUY THEM FULL PRICE (unless you really want to) Im telling you the packs are worth half the price EA just love to over charge it only for a content that is worth from what its sale price... Lastly Mods and CC adds more flavor and gameplay to it but beware because every update of the game catastrophe happens and sorting these are pretty challenging. In conclusion Sims 4 is good for drop and play (well for me) style where it could keep you playing for several hours then you burn out and stop and pick up the game whenever you feel like it. The base game is good but once you feel like you have play the entirety of it you'll gonna crave for buying a pack...!",1687714298,1687714298,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've spent quite a long time on this game, and I can confidently say, it's worth it.
I mostly use the Sims for the house building, the architecture and such. If you're into family simulation, this is the game for you!
The base game already has quite a lot, and I bought it ages before it became free. 
My pack recommendations are the Cats and Dogs pack, and the Farm pack, since these implement some really awesome features into your game. 
There's even a whole community dedicated to CC (Custom Content) and things, that really add to it.
Recently, EA has added pronouns, and gender features that make the game inclusive and I quite enjoy that. Not to mention the babies! Oh my gosh, finally! Silly little gremlin creatures but they're so worth it!

Edit: Wouldn't have so many hours if it wasn't for mods. I forgot to mention how much Sims 4 is a money grab.
When a Sims 3 pack came out u had it all in it, when it comes to Sims 4 they divide it into several different packs to make more money. Quite frankly i'd get the sims 3 or wait for other games like Life By You or Paralives to come out instead of getting on the money grab train that is Sims 4.

I bought this game originally in maybe 2013, on my Xbox for myself, even before I had purchased the mobile Sims 3 app as well. Ever since I first bought it, I have been non-stop playing, purchasing the new packs and playing each and every scenario that was realised in the game, every challenge posted on the internet, (I have played MANY different versions of the generations challenge too) I love this game because of its consistent updates and new features you can implement. 

This game is about creating Sims, fictional people in the game that you play as, you can make families, single person household, celebrities, mermaids, vampires and werewolves now. There are endless creative possibilities in this game, along with creating sims you can also build your dream homes and places like spas, gyms, retail stores and restaurants that will provide a whole new aspect to the game. It's almost like creating your own little town, but enabling you to focus on a household at a time. You can make your sims become famous painters, incredible astronauts, evil criminals, amazing parents, intense business people and crazy scientists. The possibilities never stop. 

I highly recommend this game, its so fun and its so relaxing and is a great escape from reality, allowing you to play and be anything you want your sims to be with almost real life accuracy to the problems faced in reality.",1687403973,1687403973,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The most fun is giving your sims very different 'aspirations' (main quests) so there are many different areas of the game and the map to explore. Then of course they all need jobs aligned with those aspirations, and you need to grow their skill sets and friendships etc etc. 

Because of all the small subtasks you quickly forget how long you've been playing and everything about your sim and the game is highly customizable. I used to play it mostly to build different styles of houses and have fun decorating the interior. But you can also play 'scenarios' where you start with a pre-made household which has been through some tough times and you need to get them back on track. Very fun. I just wish it added in more pre-made households to fill the neighborhood with when you start the game. It's pretty empty otherwise and building that up and giving them all houses takes too much time. 

The biggest down side is the build -mode has had a horrible new lay out which makes it so hard to find stuff. And the new in-game music is bad. But you can just turn that off.",1687331834,1687331834,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
