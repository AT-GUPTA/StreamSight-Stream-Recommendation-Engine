1- No chat!
- Sometimes I just want to tell the host to make the game for 4 players. They start it with 4 and make it 6. This is just 1 use case. Improve your filter and open the chat. If a kid is able to play this game then he can read internet. You are not the parent.

2- dice
- Unbalanced like hell

3- Ranked system is based on winning. 
That's causing a lot of cheap tactics. Rank should be on game style and decisions. if 5th strongest player attacking 6th strongest it should lower the rating.

4-Stupid Bots 
They are just attacking random low enemy grounds. Don't keep soldiers for smarter attack or any kind of strategy. Just avoid them and it will cause problem for enemy players while you are safe.

5- Abusive players
Players can come up with not smart but annoying strategies. One player starts to keep his soldiers in same place for 10 rounds. Others have to do same otherwise this guy will become stronger. So for 20 rounds everybody just gathering their strength. Solution might be something like this: If player has more than 5 x (owned zone) and doesn't lose %10 if his army start a rebellion on random location like it happens with zombie apocalypse.
