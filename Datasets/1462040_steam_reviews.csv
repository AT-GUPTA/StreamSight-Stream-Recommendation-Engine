This game is 90% filler.  Of course, they wanted to milk this cash cow to death and charge $70 - TWICE! - to cash in on our nostalgia.  I suppose I can see why this could have been a tribute to the massive scale that made FF7 an all-time great, but it's executed terribly.  The amount of time you have to sit through transition movement, or go back through the exact same locations time and time again, just feels painful.  On top of that, there is what might be the worst part of the entire game: the mind-numbingly pathetic mini-game sequences.  Spending 10 minutes operating some ridiculous crane arm just to clear a path is insulting.  It's not a fun, immersive detour.  It's obnoxious.

Then we get to the actual environment where we're forced to spend so much time. 
 It's all modern 3D graphics, sure, but this world is actually not that great to look at.  It's still a linearly-confined map, true to the original game and it's era, which means running around hitting phantom barriers in front of boring junk.  ""Oh, look at this abandoned train with an open door, just a foot off the ground! Nope, can't walk in there, you're planted to the ground.  You spend battles floating in mid-air swinging your 150lb broadsword, but can't step up there.  Sorry.""

Did I just mention battles?  The combat is a hot mess.  I have flashbacks of FF15, but at least that was a simplistic action concept and they stuck with it.  Now, we have a 3D battle system with fast/strong attacks and dodge rolls, which make you think of every other action RPG you've played.  I'm fine if they took the game in that direction to make it unique.  But it doesn't play that way at all.  Your dodge roll CAN DODGE LITERALLY NOTHING.  You're just going to get hit anyway, there's no momentary protection, and it's not much faster than running.  You are apparently not supposed to button mash (and if you doubt that, just try mentioning the combat is bad in a forum - you will be castrated and crucified by the ""community"" and told the system is perfect, you're stoopid), but at the same time you need attacks to build up your ATB meter fast enough.  So while you're trying to figure out what game this is trying to be, in practice, you just spend all your time fighting the real final boss of this game: the camera.  You can never maintain a good view of the battlefield and will be getting hit from all directions by enemies who each operate on their own independent timer.  Sure, I am probably not a world champion at this game.  But there's nothing fun about this.  It doesn't know what it wants to be.  The fanboys (and fangirls) defend it because that's what they do, but it's neither action nor turn-based, and it sucks at both.

The writing (and voice acting, although they're confined to the script) is awful.  Yes, I suppose that's true to the franchise, and the original was also terrible, but that was within the context of a text-only interface where you had to use your own imagination.  Cloud's indifferent ""umph"" grunts get old after an hour, and the endless cycle of ""Tifa! Cloud! Barrett! Tifa! Aerith! Cloud!"" in any action cutscene simply don't translate to a modern, realistic game setting.  Contrast the childish personalities of Aerith (particularly), Tifa, and Cloud with the sociopathic one-dimensional ranting of Barrett, and there's nothing to get attached to.  I don't even care if this group wins half the time.  This is also where the pace of the game simply doesn't work split into two.  In the original, as epic as it was, the Midgar portion was still just the beginning.  You could still believe that Cloud was just a merc and was only in it for the money.  Now?  When I hit Chapter 16, dozens of hours into the game, and Cloud responds ""For a price"" when Tifa asks if he'll help rebuild... I mean, come on.  It's effectively approaching endgame, and we're still supposed to believe he'll just collect some gil and leave her in a ditch?

Still, with all this bad, I had trouble giving it a No.  It's FF7, which is what they were counting on, and they got away with it.  Let's be honest, they also made the characters ridiculously attractive.  Very ridiculously attractive.  Pair that with great visuals on the menu screen with their portraits, and it makes me care just enough to finish the game.

But - to sum it all up - if you take this game on it's own, and not an homage to the great FF7... it's just not good.  Don't try to tell everyone it is.  To end up playing the entire remake, we're expected to pay $140 and spend maybe hundreds of hours on the content.  If it wasn't for the original, can you really look me in the eye and say this is worth it?

If so, call me a hater then.  I'm going to finish it, because FF7, right?  But I'm not happy about that.

EDIT: Finished the main campaign.  I double down on everything I wrote above.

I had to just shake my head and resist the urge to skip through many cutscenes near the end.  I'm trying to avoid any spoilers, but let me say this in terms of the writing: you have to balance the story (via cutscenes) to fit the gameplay.  What I mean is that you can't have gameplay where you can take relentless machine gun fire and then expect the player to feel suspense when someone holds a single gun to your head, or ambushes you with a few Shinra guards.  I've wiped out the entire city with barely the need for a Cura, but I'm supposed to be scared the end is near when some guards show up?  Right.  I mean, in an earlier guided sequence (live gameplay where your path is basically forced), I was getting hit almost nonstop by the mounted gun on a helicopter.  Someone holding a pistol does not get my blood pumping.

The live, modern implementation of this game requires more effort in the cutscenes to fit the style.  Maybe you really are trapped in a corner, or your weapon has been taken.  At least make me believe there is a reason to feel suspense.  You cannot get away with writing whatever you want outside the realm of turn-based combat and text-style dialog.  There is no imagination left - it's all raw, in-your-face action.  Your writing has to understand that we are desensitized by seeing real time action.

Also, this isn't unique to FF7R, but can we please start a campaign to FORBID THE ""OOPS, THE BAD GUY GOT AWAY"" trope?!?!?  It's a game-ruining lazy trick.  The game means nothing when you take what should be the thrill of a boss win away when they just walk away.  It's one thing if you do this with some believable skill (other games do), but when you just have the main character sit there, not kill the enemy, and watch as they run away and do what they were trying to do anyway... enough already.  Why play the damn game.  At least make us fight someone else, then let the bad guy do his thing.  It completely undermines all the effort we spend playing.

Last rant: don't spend almost an entire chapter on your dumb mini-game mechanic, especially late in the game.  I already said how stupid the mini-games are here.  At the very least, they need to be toys which are played with as side-quests or very early on.  At a time when we've spent a ton of time getting this far, have characters built up the way we want (probably with materia set up how we want, which is a painful grind), and are gearing up for the main conflict... do not make me have to get through some overextended half-assed mini-game to proceed.  I didn't buy some childish mini-game.  I bought an AAA RPG.  Hell, I'm surprised they didn't make the battle with Sephiroth based on sit-ups.",1708297254,1708904517,False,11,7,0.518111050128936768,0,True,False,False

unfortunately cant rate mixed on steam so will stay with ""not recommend"" - in the end I finished the game (and in the end I have good feeling as I really liked the store, world, etc) but especially with the linearity and slow paced game play I really got some problems; down below other reasons

MINUSES
- extremely LINEAR / majority of game corridor with couple of fights followed up by animation / cut-scenes- this part was linear as well in original FFVII but there this was just one part of full game - here we have full game;
- is this even a GAME ? or just a lot of cut scenes/movie with few parts where you can actually play ?
- extremely SLOW PACES game - very often the game will simply slow down; some puzzles are not really necessary

MIXED
- GRAPHICS  = considering how big this game is and release date some areas are extremely poor graphic wise (railway for example where corridors are copy past etc.); in some reviews Graphic was considered as great - I don share this opinion 
- BATTLE - standard fights easy, boss fights challenging; sometimes EXTRA CHAOTIC; problem is as the game is so linear that there is no reason to train fights elsewhere (there are couple of options where you can train) but as it is no open battle i was not powerleveling 

PLUSES
- STORY, storytelling (although slow - see my minuses its still fantastic after so many years to again went over it + there are some new things (some dislike, some like) for me it was really refreshing as it was maaaany years ago I did play original)
- its FF VII

I was a bit worried about how much I would enjoy the new combat, but the way they have combined turn based elements is really difficult to complain about, a very thoughtful marriage of action vs turn based rpg. And it looks absolutely amazing. I'm one of those people who played the original during formative years etc, so take this review with a heavy bias in favour of the game in general. To be as critical as possible, I don't like the plot ghost things, however I am prepared to make room for that considering some of the ramifications that may come to pass in the rebirth and future sequel(s). The highlight of this game for me really is the attention and love given to the characters. Just based on this aspect, this game is a love letter to fans of the original and should take it's rightful place as possibly the most amazing remake of a game in the history of gaming (feel free to comment if you can think of a better remake, or a game that pays tribute to an original)

The dialogue in this game is, at it's best, something straight out of 6th grade. At it's worst, you'll question how certain lines were even included in the first place. There's not a lot of good things to say about the main story either. By the time I finished the last chapter of the game, I felt like I had accomplished pretty much nothing.

There were some fun parts in this game though. I enjoyed some of the mini games. The combat system was also good - at least while it was still fresh. Because you will be forced to face the same enemies over and over again. And some of the boss fights will drag on for way too long. In normal mode, there's not a lot of skill necessary to kill these bosses. I'm not saying this to boast - I'm saying this because I believe it is a major flaw in the game. And, something that could've been very easily fixed - for example, by slightly tweaking the dodging / blocking necessary for some bosses. Or, by allowing hard mode on the first play though.

I've seen some videos of the next FF VII Remake game - rebirth. It looks like some the issues I just described were addressed: more emphasis on the characters, a more complex story and improved combat system.

---The Good: The most fun combat I've ever experienced in a video game. It's not even close. They've really modernized the JRPG system while still keeping it accessible for those (like me) who lack the proper hand-eye coordination for action games.

Also, the presentation is stellar. Ever since the original Nintendo, Final Fantasy has been on the cutting edge of visuals and presentation, and this is no exception. The soundtrack is jaw-dropping.

---The Bad: They say it's a remake... except it's not. Without spoiling anything, there's a new twist on the story that rears its ugly head early on, and slowly chokes out the original story. The new story is aimed at the loyal superfans who have knowledge ( *thorough* knowledge) of the original story's ENDING. If you don't have that, YOU SHOULDN'T PLAY THIS GAME. Kind of defeats the purpose of making a Remake, but imo naming it Remake was intended as a meta-commentary on the plot twist... I'll stop there. Many people like the new story, but I personally felt taken for a ride, and not in a good way.

Before they truly swept the rug out from under me, I had some non-dealbreaker grievances, such as the player character being clunky outside of combat, or the lengthy, mandatory sidequests that take the promising pacing from the first two chapters and bloat it to high heaven at four different points. This game could have been 20 hours shorter and better off for doing that. Hell, one of its chapters could have been an email.

---So, I vote no. If you get it anyway, I hope this has managed your expectations to make room for some really enjoyable fighting and a unique art style. Or, you could play the original - it's cuter and the story is better.",1708663599,1708663599,False,2,1,0.503875970840454102,0,True,False,False

One of the standout features of this Steam Edition is the improved optimization for PC, although not without glitches here and there. The game runs smoothly, even on mid-range systems, and offers a plethora of customizable graphics settings.

The only minor downside is the episodic nature of the remake, as this edition only covers the Midgar portion of the original game's storyline. With this, it feels like unnecessary 'filler' content was added to add to the tale of Midgar, leaving you to painfully wander around The Slums and Wall Market for much longer than you should. How it can be slow, it does expand on the original Final Fantasy VII tale with content not in the original 1997 version.

Final Fantasy VII: Remake Steam Edition is an absolute triumph. Square Enix has not only successfully resurrected a classic but has elevated it to new heights. Whether you're a longtime fan of the series or a newcomer to the world of Final Fantasy, this game is a must-play for anyone who appreciates masterful storytelling, stunning visuals, and captivating gameplay.

I don't know if I say this too early?. But really this is one of the games I like the most out of all the games. The remade character is very beautiful. The setting is ultimately peaceful and simple. I must say the graphics are amazing. I love it

I was excited when i heard FF7 remake is coming soon. Upon starting my first hours I was overwhelmed by the visualization and the music, which they rearranged from the original. The ambience is amazing and I even like the new interpretation of the story.

What really bothers me though is the new combat system. They tried to pick up elements from the original round based combat and mixed it up with modern action gameplay that feels more like a hack'n'slay like devil may cry to me than any final fantasy round based game. I think the combat system in the original FF7 is genius, espacially for the time back then and it makes a big part of the game.

Also the quest-system is nothing like a JRPG and feels like simple tasks of work, poor in creativity (for example kill 5 rats, go there, etc.). I loved the riddles in the older FF titles where you didnt know exactly if someone is giving you a hint for a (hidden-) quest and maybe you get it or pass by not realizing it. NPCs always told you stories to think about and made the world where it took place alive.

Also I miss the open world, which is connected to the given quest feature. The quests happen in bordered areas and once you go on, the story pulls you straight forward in a linear map exploring.

To me, a remake should be as close as possible to the original and if not, it should make things better, which did not happen in this case. The original FF7 is one of the (or maybe even the) best games I ever played. In my opinion a disappointment!",1708545318,1708545318,False,2,1,0.458333343267440796,0,True,False,False

Some bosses remove the choice all together and require stagger. Materia doesn't matter you can slot anything or nothing.

 The best part of the game is the cut scenes and environment so this would've done better to just be a movie.

 Visually the environments lack a lot of vivid color that the original FF7 could perform, even in desolate areas the original managed vivid and expressive color that the remake seems to wash out(I tried both HDR and SDR on a PC+monitor designed to work with HDR, neither looked good.). 

 Tacked on side-quests for subpar characters stretches out the game time to increase time use of game locations so they can stay with in Final Fantasy VII but avoid creating more locations.

Square Enix did a good job bringing Final Fantasy VII back to a new generation, but not without some blunders.

[h1][b]Positives[/b][/h1]
[list]
[*]The graphics are amazing, the voice acting is awesome, and both main and side characters are fully brought to life with added depth to their personalities.
[/list]
[list]
[*]Remake's story is very good, and will leave you wondering what will go on in the future Final Fantasy VII games.
[/list]
[list]
[*]The soundtrack is incredible. Every piece of music works exceptionally well in the areas that they're used.
[/list]
[list]
[*]The Midgar section from the original FFVII is expanded upon significantly, and you'll connect with the characters more based on their desperate fight with Shinra.
[/list]

[h1][b]Negatives[/b][/h1]
[list]
[*]This game is very linear, similar to Final Fantasy 13, except without the Gran Pulse open world. There will be one path to take 85% of the time, and you will go from point A to point B for many chapters. There is no XP or gil farming. This made me feel like I was playing on-rails at times because there were pre-determined amounts of enemies and once that was done I move onto the next area and do it over again. I almost felt like I could just watch cutscenes only or this game as a movie and not have to worry about missing out on much.
[/list]
[list]
[*]The combat system was mostly a miss for me. It's designed as a hybrid of real-time and turn-based combat, which in my view disrupted the flow of combat. Since there's no customizable AI strategy, every battle has you pausing your real-time actions to tell your party members what to do. If you aren't micromanaging your party, then the AI is usually doing nothing useful. That becomes really annoying through 70% of the game because if your party AI isn't attacking, they aren't gaining ATB bars at a fast rate, and if they don't gain ATB then you can't tell them what to do. I also did not like that dodging was mostly useless, and the only form of defense you have is to block everything and tank the damage. Since you have to tank all damage, you are constantly telling your player-controlled character or the AI to heal and that takes up all of the ATB bars that you took time building. I thought having to build ATB bars to use items or cast spells really made me dislike Remake's combat. The enemies are also always stunning your characters, making them unable to move or do anything.
[/list]
[list]
[*]Remake is stretched out to a 30+ hour game and padded with side jobs, slow moving puzzles, and other scenes that didn't feel necessary. Cutting a few hours would have made this game a more focused experience.
[/list]
[list]
[*]This PC port isn't very good. Barely any customizable settings, and the keyboard controls are rough. Use a controller if you have one, or change the key mapping.

The Yuffie expansion is nice too but it's a little too short imo.

The gameplay is great too. They finally perfected the mix of ATB and real time action and it feels amazing. Way better than XV's combat for me. It does take a bit getting used to because playing it like DMC will get your ass handed easily. This is peak FF currently and it's a great entry point for newcomers as well. I highly recommend it.

It's good but not as good as most people say. My real problem comes from the Yuffie DLC. Not From Yuffie herself or the predictable happenings to her companion , or even for the disappointing Fort Condor but there were characters added which were not in the original FF7. They had stupid dangerous powers, yes just summon a cloud and around you and anyone it it dies instantly is far fetched even for a final fantasy game and they seemed boring and uncharismatic. As someone who is very familiar with the original FF7 I wondered who these guys were so after looking them up they were from a game which was released many years later in a spin off which was not very popular called'' Dirge of Cerberus. '' To make it worse because of so much going already on these '' new '' enemies make that matter worse. 

In Summary Main Game + mostly good but alot of filler and almost too much going on.

Fortunately, Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade is a return to grace, proof Square Enix can still put out incredible, mind blowing experiences that leave their fans howling for more. 

Remake is the first part of a yet-to-be-released trilogy that recreates the original Final Fantasy VII.  However, it is set apart from the original with changes to that story and incredible state-of-the-art technical competence.  It has top-notch visuals, action RPG gameplay that has some satisfying depth, a great story that builds upon the original, a treatment of the characters that significantly improves them, and a multiple-award-winning musical score.  One of the awards it won was best RPG in the 2020 Game Awards.

About the only detracting point I have against this masterpiece is that it runs pillar boxed on an ultrawide monitor.  And the minigames were not as good as the rest of the game, probably intended to briefly distract us from the greater whole than anything else.  But, honestly, no game is for everyone, I'm sure some people will have hangups that stop them from enjoying this game.

For the rest of us, get it: you're in for an amazing time.  Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade is a strong contender for the single best game in my nearly 1500 game Steam collection.",1708225377,1708316959,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story is easily the biggest flaw in the entire game, and it impacts the entire experience from start to finish. Every plot point is dragged out for hours, well beyond any reasonable length. You can't even walk down the street half the time without needing someone to walk you there and slowly dump exposition on you. Some sections got so long I completely forgot what the entire point of it all was; there were nearly 5 hours between meeting Aerith and returning to Sector 7. This gets even worse when the game randomly inserts a pointless dungeon out of nowhere. Several new dungeons are added which have very nearly no bearing on the plot but add hours to the gameplay. This is one third of a game stretched into a full-length game, and it's painfully obvious every step of the way. And then you have the whispers. They show up nearly constantly, act erratically, and pointlessly shove the plot this way or that as the devs saw fit. They're never really properly explained, allowing the game to use them however it wants to further pad out the game's runtime. This leads to some truly horrible pacing. Some segments have absolutely nothing happening for hours; then you get to the end of the game and it's so padded out with action that it feels like there's not even a second to catch your breath. Occasionally a story beat is interesting or fun, but that's generally drowned out by a sea of filler and muddy plotlines. 

The characters themselves are generally well fleshed-out. With all the extra runtime, this is probably the most well-developed I've ever seen characters in an FF game. Only Tifa really lacks significant character development, though that will presumably be fixed in the later games. Cloud also feels fairly one-note later on; he rarely seems to show emotions outside of having headaches and attempting to look cool in fights. The villains, on the other hand, are truly horribly written. Every single Shinra executive is a cartoonish mustache-twirling villain. It gets old within the first few chapters, then gets VERY VERY old when you have to sit through huge chunks of mustache-twirling. Hojo is the worst offender, a truly .5 dimensional character who exists to be evil and do evil things and pretty much nothing else. Every time he was on screen I cringed; at least some of the other executives had fun dialogue. The dialogue itself (and by extension the translations) is pretty good. It avoids the general stiltedness of the series, and from the chunks I listened to the translations closely match the Japanese with the exception of lots of added localization. Some characters veer into cringe territory, but not always, and by and large it's fine. By the end I found the random side characters the most fun (the gym bros in particular). The later parts fell very flat for me simply because there was pretty much just pure gameplay with nearly no side characters. This is excluding characters like Leslie or Kyrie though; side characters like them served only to pad out the game more and add unrelated one-note plotlines that go nowhere. 

The gameplay, is where the game truly shines. When going in, I thought the game was another generic action game, but actually it's a cleverly-disguised turn-based RPG. This game is the logical next step after FFX-2, where you now have control over the characters and can take actions while waiting for ATB to fill. Fighting feels good and moves smoothly; I never really got tired of the battle system, and only disliked it when some enemies were particularly annoying. The time pause while menus open is even more flexible than many past FF games, and works very well within the overall battle system. Each character's fighting style is distinct and useful in its own way, avoiding the general problem in the series where characters all end up playing nearly identically. The only major problem is the materia system, which felt clunky and was annoying to use when constantly switching active party members. The minigames in this game are also fantastic; for the first time that I can think of in the series, the devs were able to realize the minigames that they had in mind, and the implementation was actually fun. Squatting in particular was fantastic and felt like a throwback to a different time in game design when it was acceptable to put really weird stuff in a major game for no particular reason other than the devs finding it amusing.

The music in this game is mostly great; there's a stretch mid-game where all of the music is fantastic, from sector 5 basically through the end of wall market. Unfortunately, the composer really loved the main battle theme from the original game. A massive chunk of the music in this game is just remixes of that theme, or else one of maybe a dozen or so other songs from the original. By the end I was very sick of the same small subset of leitmotifs.

The visuals in this game are stellar, absolutely phenomenal. There's a few spots where I had to just stop and look at the view, because it was so well-designed. It makes one wonder why the original devs tried to make a game so ambitious on early PS1 hardware. There are spots where it was clearly difficult even now to bring the ideas to life, so for the devs to have tried something like this on the PS1 is honestly a pretty awful design choice. It's no wonder that the scenarios in FF tended to get SIMPLER over time rather than more complex.

Overall, despite its flaws FF7R is a really fun game. Smooth fluid gameplay and fantastic graphics mostly but not entirely offset the major structural flaws with the plot. 6/10",1708311439,1708311863,True,3,0,0.543396234512329102,0,True,False,False

Even the ""fluff"" aspects aren't great : the [b]graphics are generally great[/b] and the [b]game is surprisingly well optimised[/b]. However, [b]the story is sooooo padded and stretched with fluff[/b] that it becomes difficult to follow or even care at many points. New characters (not in the original FF7) can be instantly spotted as they look like FF15 fanfic characters and are a combo of clichés, deathly boring, shoved in your face and cringe-inducing ([i]look up ""Kyrie"", ""Roche"" or ""Leslie"" on Google Image : they play out exactly how they look like[/i]).

Lots of story changes/additions feel like they were made by reddit fanboys who [b]didn't understand the themes and tone of the original game[/b]. Instead of playing up the whole eco-environmental ideas of the story, which work even better given today's context, they added in more Sephiroth, winks and nods, cartoon-villains, more Sephiroth, B-plots that have nothing to do with the rest of the game/story, and some more Sephiroth... a character that originally worked partly because he was shrouded in mystery and was revealed with subtelty instead of being shoved down your throat like it is here. And finally, [b]so many cutscenes[/b]. All the time, for everything, [b]you're constantly interrupted[/b] in the already tedious Level Design by pointless CS that should have been dialogue while you're still moving and playing.

I'm sorry if it feels like I'm just pissing on the game for the sake of it, but [b]the pacing was really, really tedious[/b] and gave me the overall feeling that the designers didn't want nor know how to make a GAME but rather wanted to make a MOVIE. It's unfortunate because there's actually a good story there (none of the new stuff, unfortunately) and a fun combat system, but [b]you'll have to slog through boring levels and an ungodly amount of cutscenes[/b]. Given the pricetag of 80€ and the fact that it covers only about 10-15% of the game it's supposed to be a remake of, I think it's another example of how completely shameless Squarenix is towards its licenses and player-base.

It sort of remains true to the original, though my main and major complaint is it all seems padded out. A lot. While it does add a bit more depth to the characters, there are times when it just seems to go on and on in excess, though I find it difficult to pick out any one thing to really point out.
It does however do good on making an intriguing story while hinting that the original is... still canon? I can't say much there, as the first part of the remake barely covers 1/5 of the original story. Sort of. I don't want to give away any spoilers though, as I do recommend this to any fans of the series or fans of the FF7.

As for the technical side, I was surprised how well this game ran on my rather outdated machine. I had read before the game released in a less than desirable state, though it would seem various optimizations have improved the games performance. And with how lovely everything looks, I've got to hand it to the development teams for really polishing everything up and making the world feel wonderful.

As for tone, it's weird at times. The tonal shifts are strange. Going from almost goofy to overly dramatic over a short period of time. Or added segments and mini-games that feel out of place. While amusing, it left me staring blankly at the screen wondering what I just witnessed. And some sections just seemed to go on for far to long. Sure, it's world building, but it's irrelevant. Without spoilers, the Train Graveyard and the entire slums sections feel awkward. That said, I've seen how people from Square-Enix have talked about how they couldn't remake FF7 1:1 because of it's vast content and yet they pad out just about every single area of the remake. It's a surface level complaint and doesn't mean that much, I just personally find it an odd choice.

Overall though, I've almost 100% this title. I've had fun doing it too. I'm very much looking forward to part 2 whenever that comes to PC.",1708036947,1708036947,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This PC port I'd say is playable only to a certain extent without modding in my experience (Not everyone's experience is the same!) There has been a whole white screen at times which I'd reload the chapter just to get rid of [found others have entered and exited photo mode to remove] or stuttering issues at other times that would take me out of the action and destroy the immersion.

What I'd recommend is either following a youtube tutorial to either lower the chances of it happening by making setting changes or straight modding to get rid of those issues as I've done following videos and guides as a 1st time PC user and if you have higher specs there is a high chance to enjoy no issues plus 120 fps and 4k resolution with upscaled textures.

Pros: 
-Combat 6/10 (yet not very good, only enjoyable)
-Aesthetics 8/10 (but that's from the previous game, they only did well because didn't change that) 

Cons: 
-Time steal. Every corner. Game would be 1/4 of it's duration if devs weren't trying to enlarge it at every step.
-Cinematics are misplaced. This is a game, not a movie.
-Script is awful. Characters with flat personality.
-Trying to make it EPIC by adding epic music to normal things.
-Story.
-Difficulty too low.
-THERE IS NO JUMP.


***************************************************************************
Review:

-At 9 hours and planning to continue playing it, I cannot recommend this game.
About 7 of those 9h played felt very annoying. The game steals your control every 3 minutes to make you stay watching a simple repeated animation. EVERYTHING is on rails, then you add the control steal and you get an awful game experience.

-Combat is funny, the only moment one is able to take control, but still not polished. It resembles very poorly how it feel to play original. It is on a mid way from turn combat to DMC-type, not satisfying any of them. 

-If you liked FF VII on PSX, you may like the graphics as they are what you would imagine this game were to be. Nevertheless, the stage feels very oppressive and devoid of detail. There's only a few buildings you can go in, backstreets are a dead end with nothing on it. Exploration is discouraged due to the lack of a reason to walk through it, as you'll never find anything useful... only potions or items that you won't use at all because they are not need.

-The new story attacks the previous story, but not to make it better or more comprehensive. They made up a lot of absurd plots only to fill cinematics TOTALLY NEEDLESS.

-Difficulty is a joke. There's no ""hard"" mode, only easy and normal. Normal feels like easy, I don't know what easy would feel... maybe it is the correct way to play this game: as watching a movie?

***************************************************************************


Recommendations:
I could only recommend this game to devs willing to make a real FF VII remake, to watch what's not to be done.
If you like Yakuza and FF VII, you may like this besides the extra time loss.

This game is a wonderful first final fantasy experience.
It's an even better experience for those with orignal FF7 and crisis core knowledge. 

Also this game is ground-breaking. First in gaming history to do something like ~this~?

FF7 Remake has brought so many people not only to the FF7 world, but to the final fantasy world. And as it's common for a first final fantasy game, it will be the forever-favorite game for many out there.

There is a reason these characters were already fan favorites from all final fantasy games, and that was when they were moving polygons. Perfect as they are now...is just unfair.

This game brought to life the amazing world, characters, story and music from one of the greatest games of all time, and they did it justice. With a fantastic combat system mixing old and new, 9+ hours of incredible cut-scenes, and a completely new level of character development and interactions, this is a must-play game for anyone who loves games.

17 days for Rebirth, the Hype is immeasurable.

2.https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7remake/mods/586

Switch the resolution 1600. Turn off HDR, turn shadows to Low. Texture High.

The original cemented itself in my heart in so, so many different ways. It truly transcended being a ""video game"" to be frank; it was a fictional master-piece of its time. I can't say I loved this game because it re-imagined much I what I loved, as much as I wanted to love it. But it isn't a bad game. It is indeed a good game that I recommend you play. However, I highly suggest you throw out any pre-conceptions before diving in. All the plot deviations will be upsetting. This is a spin-off, a sequel, or something else - THIS IS NOT AN ACTUAL REMAKE.

First, let's start off with the good. The graphics are drop-dead gorgeous. The cut-scenes are action-packed & beautifully animated. Furthermore, the art direction, character designs breathe new life into beloved characters from the original. The English voice-acting is ON POINT for the main, core cast. I truly enjoyed the ""filler"" & non-canon aspects of the game. While the NPCs & filler characters are bland & a bit anime-tropey... the actual sector 5/6/7 side-quests & filler-stories add some new life & a bit of grind into the mix without being too cumbersome. The added supporting-character narrative scenarios (i.e Biggs/Wedge/Jessie bits), dungeon sections & bosses (i.e train graveyard, sewers, etc) are a PERFECT example of how to add content to the original canon story in a meaningful way.

Now, the OK. The battle system had its pros and cons. It felt super button-mashy to be honest. Most of the time you can grind a battle with simple button mashing & healing. No strategy whatsoever. And the AI controlling your other party members is dumb and doesn't generate ATB for you (just defends half the time). However, as the game progresses battles get more difficult & you really have to start slowing things down & switching between characters. It actually becomes & feels more psuedo turn-based. For example, when half your party is low HP and low ATB... then things started to remind me of turn-based style. It got really fun & challenging particularly with bigger boss fights that have some sort of designed objective in them (i.e hard-counters, attack-order strategy, duck'n'cover, etc). Some of the bosses later in the game are such a joy to play through because they're designed so, so well. However... a big down-fall of the battle system I felt was that you only can control one character at a time & the fact there is a LACK of a need to switch between characters. I think the devs started realizing this which is why the bosses towards the end of the game force you to switch characters which makes the battle system so much more rewarding and fun (and gives it that psuedo turned based vibe).

The bad... well... that's all in the story and scenario writing. They're definitely going down a more FFXIII and FFXIII-2 kind of route versus sticking to the more traditional/original story. Honestly, this game would've been so much more loveable if it just added filler-content around the side-characters, more areas to explore & dungeons, to supplement a purely FF7 OG cannon story. Instead, they decided to go down a ""paradox"" rabbit hole deviating from the OG cannon story quite often and honestly, completing ruining some very nostalgia moments from the OG. This game truly made me cringe several times or just verbally be like ""NOOO!! why would you do that?""... the final 1/3rd of the game just went off the rails story-wise & ruined it the experience for me.

Overall, it was an enjoyable game that I would recommend. Given the game got progressively more fun over time, I'm confident that the next two parts of the series things will only get better and better. But honestly, the original is a 10x better game, even with block graphics. If you've played the original... don't compare this to it & think of it as a completely new game. If you haven't played the original and you want to know why FF7 is a cult classic? Play the original. This is NOT a ""remake"" in any sense of the word. It is literally just another FF7 spin-off to be frank.",1704015917,1707680785,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Probably the most well-polished (I consider) mainline FF game... ever? It runs well, looks great, plays well, and paces well. If you're looking for an intro to the franchise this is probably the only game anyone should reasonably recommend. If you think you can stomach an older game then you should probably start with FF X. 

Understanding the context this game is presented in is also quite important to a player. It's a remake (in a proper sense) of a watershed moment in gaming that intentionally plays on pulling those nostalgic heartstrings. I've never played the OG VII but I could feel the game funneling me into nostalgia/sappy territory, whether it be through the music, dialogue, or scene framing. The game is cheesy, but Final Fantasy is a friggin cheesy franchise. Things are wild, wacky, randomly dramatic, and the VIIR has all those FF landmarks.

The combat is the culmination of years of influence from 12 to 13 to 15, which leads us to VIIR's combat: the most satisfying in the franchise. They've finally achieved what they've been trying to do with ""ATB"" after all these years in this game, with a tangible fusion of realtime inputs and party commands. In an unnecessary comparison, FFXVI focuses totally on the realtime, while not doing that as well as Stranger of Paradise. 

With that being said, I know the story strays from the original. I can only say that I found the story presented to me as a pretty good one and am looking forward to how it pans out in the next two games. The story is incomplete, so doomsayers really have no right to critique an unfinished story imo. 

8.5/10 the game is a quality game. can't decide between Tifa and Aerith... Wedge, perhaps?",1706236485,1707513083,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

No, it's not a 1:1 recreation of the original because that would be stupid and there are a billion mods that can do that for you for the original game.  If you want to play the original game, then play the original game.

The remake is just that.  It's the same structure, but they re-made the game around it.  It isn't an HD edition, or a Remaster.  It's someone taking the game and making it all over again.  God forbid they try to do something different with it.

I digress.  The game is fun, whacking creatures with a big sword is fun, and Roche is a character I want more of.

Hands down though, the best aspect is the dance sequence.  I'm not even joking.  It seems weird, but it just fits so well in the FFVII universe.

Ah, FF7.

I got the original PSX FF7 the same year it came out. It was the first PSX game I played, and also the second JRPG I sunk any time into besides Chrono Trigger. I wouldn't consider myself a JRPG person, but there are a few games that hook me. I suppose FF7 is one of those. 

Let's talk about the original so we can make a comparison.

So the original was extremely ambitious, and it paid off for the most part. In discussing this game in various circles online, it seems like most people don't have a problem with how the game was localized/translated. Personally, I hate the text in the original FF7. I think most of the characters sound stupid. There are even typos. And you will literally have text boxes like ""......................."". Three periods will do. Three. But hey, I seem to be in a minority on that point. I will say though that the way this game is localized makes the plot extremely unclear on certain key points, which I won't spoil. An argument could be made that the difference between East and West is Eastern stories can be more about ""the vibe"" and are open for interpretation, so if there are vague points, perhaps it was intentional. I'm not sure. But at the end of the day, I don't care for how FF7's story was told originally, although I will say it's a good story overall. Despite any gripes I might have about the localization, when Aerith dies, it's an iconic moment, even though there's no blood when there probably should have been. If that scene made you feel nothing, something is wrong with you.

Gameplay wise, I think the materia system is one of the best things Squaresoft ever came up with. You truly do have the ability to play the game your way, adapt to challenges, discover interesting combinations. I also enjoy the exclusive endgame bosses, which I never beat as a kid. 

The graphics are a mixed bag for me. The backgrounds are almost always nice to look at, although sometimes it's confusing in terms of where you can and cannot go. My gripe is the blocky ass Minecraft-tier looking characters in a game that's story driven. Some people are fine with that, I always thought it looked ugly from the moment I turned that game on.

Now, let's talk about the remake. As far as I'm concerned, and bear in mind I'm not the usual JRPG audience, I think a remake was absolutely necessary. The way I see it, the original FF7 was a fucking mess, despite everything it did right, such as having iconic characters, good pacing, and a sense of adventure. The remake's story is much clearer. I have a much clearer sense of the personalities of the characters involved. It's also a cool experience to see moments I distinctly remember from the original retold in glorious fully rendered detail. That said, there are some retcons, additions, and changes that diverge from the original game, and I'm neutral on them. If you're extremely passionate about the original, I could see how they could be borderline offensive. The original didn't involve any spooky phantoms, this does. I'm not so sure that was a good idea. But I can understand why they added what the original would have called a ""man in a black cape"" who is literally Cloud's next door neighbor for a time. Boy, you just never know who's gonna move in next to ya, am I right fellow apartment dwellers? The reason that might be a good idea is from the beginning you have that thread of the plot laid out. I can understand from a writing perspective why they would do that. Also, in an act of show don't tell, they set Aerith up as a kindly soul who donates her time to the struggles of the locals. Makes sense. 

An aspect I think they definitely fucked up is NPCs are just dressed up like...regular people. You'd think NPCs would be dressed up like Biggs/Wedge/Jessie who I've always considered a representation of the average Midgar person. I dunno. It's offputting. 

Gameplay wise, I like the direction Square-Enix has been taking with Final Fantasy. We've gone from these turn-based games to pretty much full blown action games. I never expected an FF game to make me dust off my Devil May Cry muscle memory. But you still need to address RPG stuff, such as what element an enemy is weak to, and how you're developing your character. Remake pretty much gives you a sphere grid based on whatever weapon you're using. I haven't beaten this game yet, but I could see the game allowing me to unlock everything in the grid, so maybe it's a moot point. I'm not sure if there are actual meaningful choices here, but at least you need to be considerate early on about how you're building your characters.

Surprisingly, I've found some of the encounters and even minigames to be more challenging than I expected. One particular side quest made me restart it a dozen times because I couldn't figure out when I could and could not attack. There are a lot of details about enemy behavior that you need to pay attention to and work with, or you'll game over again and again. I think a legitimate complaint is sometimes it's not obvious what an enemy is doing and how to get an advantage over them, so occasionally I've brute forced some encounters and bosses. Then again, when you understand what a given enemy is weak to, some of the encounters are piss easy.

It's also worth mentioning some of the boss fights are huge spectacles. It's probably overblown, but FF7 is supposed to be an epic story, so ridiculous boss fights are fine. Personally, I'm a fan of Advent Children, albeit somewhat ironically because the movie is pretty over the top with its action, and if they're going to make these FF7 remakes mirror the absurdity of Advent Children, I am absolutely on board.",1707296201,1707296201,True,0,1,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

However I am annoyed with the game in ways. One thing i really hate is the quests they have you do that doesnt really add much and is kinda of pointless in my opinion. 

The other thing is the combat is annoying and you cant grind monsters like in the original. The story feels more linear because of the lack of grinding which seems to be replaced with you doing quests. 

Combat as well while engaging has its draw back, certain mob mechanics just dont feel well thought out and can devastate your party.

This game's frames stutter a lot. You can get rid of some of the stuttering by switching from DX12 to DX11. However, even on DX11, some stutter remains, it's due to shader compilation. On console, this game runs smooth as butter because the shaders are pre-compiled on consoles.

A linear single-player RPG without a ton of content for the price.  It's pretty, the music is great and It fleshes out the classic story of Disc 1 of Final Fantasy VII. That said there are some serious drawbacks to the game.

1. The English voice acting, the voices are good, the lines are good, but they've got the soul of a empty pack of gum. Whenever there's conversation, it feels like they're just reading lines, no context, no response to each other. The exception is Barrett, so far. His voice actor actually seemed to be enjoying playing Barret, even though he sounds like he's a black guy imitating RDJ's character's character in Tropic Thunder. (If that's a bad thing in your opinion I can understand why. If it's a good thing, I can also understand why).

2. On a similar note, the lip synching for the English voice acting is atrocious. like the animators spent about 3/8ths of a second per character trying to match their lips to the voice actor lines. 

3. The combat is flashy, and feels great, but it's just surface hollow, you basically have two basic attacks per character and everything else is just skills/spells. They I assume did this to make it feel more like the original game. In some ways I can understand because they were, I assume, uncertain how the audience would react to a action-oriented remake instead of one that attempts to bridge the two. That said, once you get used to it, the combat has a little tiny bit more depth than what you see in the first couple of chapters. Not much, mind, but a teeny bit more.

Update: Other issues I've got with the game include....

4. The insane amount of hidden loading screens that break the pace of the game. I get it, it's a game built for the base PS4, which included a ""blazin' fast"" 5400rpm laptop hard drive, and a now paltry 8GB of ram (of which 5GB was useable for the devs) So the devs had to be sneaky and add a ton of ways to hide the loading screen from the end user. I wish they could have done something to get rid of those, or at least speed them up, but I guess that's not possible without a serious rewrite of the games code.

5. A ton of low rez textures, for 2D objects. The Devs probably had to reduce the game size, because there is a mod that increases the resolution for a TON of textures, with little-to-no performance hit, but it's 50GB.

TLDR; At lot of extra story that was added where it didn't exist before, and exploration doesn't feel as good as I had hoped it would.  It is a remake that plays like a remake. It contains many of the originals iconic elements but it plays very much like a totally different game.
Controls and map/quest system can be a little awkward at times, although the GUI and game systems are superb.
Wall Market the main city is stunning and fun to explore. But adding some new character content didn't really seem to add to the whole point of the remake. Maybe some of the content is a little hit-or-miss.
Combat: Very good, they have worked hard to get this innovative style to work. I feel it works well to provide the expected abilities along with the ATB system. It feels nice not also having another Character progress campaign to fill (eg FF15) for a change.
Gameplay: Smooth playing and innovative controls and abilities keep things fresh once again in the Final Fantasy tradition. Overall. a great experience, although very different from the original.
Cons: in some cases it tends towards a fancy walking-simulator, but this style is well suited for story telling and atmospherics.
I am finding the achievements fairly lack-luster and not really in sync with the unique challenges of the game.
So far it's been an interesting experience.  I love this genre of game and can't wait to see how the second installment turns out.

FFVII is the best gaming experiance I had as a child, I was 10 years old and played that game for a few years and was really immersed in the world and the story... the characters. It was superb.

This game is absolutely bad, it completelly destroys what FFVII was and makes it into something that doesn't even come close to the original material.

Gameplay wise it's also way too far from what the original was, it's no longer an RPG, it's just become a button smashing interactive movie where 90% of fights are just you smashing one button and destroying everything in your way they are maybe 5-10% fights where you actually need to do something else.

I'm kinda sad to see this is the best they could do with all their wealth and all the knowledge they could gather in all those decades.

My reasonings are:

They stretched out like 3hrs into a full game and changed half of the story. In the original the war is over, now its on hold ?!? You constantly run into Sephiroth, originally you only saw his sword...once. Someone is an extreme fanboi of Kingdom Hearts insisting on infesting the game with the hooded ghosts that fit neither the game nor it's lore... artificially stretching the game also means they included a lot of things that should come much later. E.g. you got the very first summon shortly after leaving Midgard...
But worst part is the combat system..it's garbage, Cloud is OP, Tifa is fun but largely useless, Barrett...I never expected holding down the trigger like a natural inbred texan could bis this boring and unenjoyable... Your dodge is purely cosmetic. Many attacks and spells are delayed and aimed at the current location of the enemy...if the enemy moves the attack misses...you loose the resources anyway...this includes limit breaks. Enemies are hardcoded to focus the player controlled character, AI teammates are hardcoded to be completely useless. Even though it is realtime you are completely dependent on the ATB (which AI teammates will never fill). And the ATB is used for everything: skills, magic, even using item..ofc using item also uses up the item and using magic also uses MP. Naturally enemies are not limited by this. Boss fights are artificially stretched out with multiple phases for no reason and literally none of the bosses or phases is overly entertaining either. All in all combat is clunky and far worse then KH, FFXV or similar.

This brings the verdict:
[b] If you are a FF7 fan like me and want to see the improved graphics, the added stories that bring life to characters that were originally named cannon fodder...you can just watch a stream or ""let's play"". You can enjoy all the good parts without having to suffer the atrocious combat system without owning the game...so what is the argument to buy it ? [/b]

Ultimately it's an RPG, you spent most of the time fighting....if the combat system is crap, then the game is beyond salvation, regardless how great the rest might be.",1706362205,1706362494,False,4,1,0.452188432216644287,0,True,False,False

People new to VII will play this game, and think they don't need to play the original because they played this game. This is the real tragedy. Instead the game introduces late game characters in the story way too early and without context (horrible writing), changes vital plot points (NPC characters surviving when they died in the original), and appears to be a way to con fans of the original into buying it. The original story is heavily modified, and I can only presume the next entry in the story will really go way off the rails. This is not Final Fantasy VII. It is not a ""remake"". It is a disingenuous facade... masquerading in the skin of FF VII while pissing on its flayed corpse.

Calling this game a ""remake"" is a blatant lie in my opinion. This is FF VII turned into the plot of Kingdom Hearts. I can't imagine that they will be able to keep faithful to the major plot points that made FF VII so poignant, wonderfully sad and triumphant. If I had to guess, I would say that it will diverge heavily from the original in Rebirth. Especially with Aerith's character. But, if I have to eat my words, I may be extremely pleased.

Is the game fun? Yes. Is it beautiful? Again, yes! Is it Final Fantasy 7 Remake? Hell no!!! If you want to play it, have at it. I did and I enjoyed it.

They took the classic story from the 90's and started a whole new tale.  While this game does not cover the whole story provided in the original release, it updates and adds plenty while being very faithful to the original content it was based on.
For those that may have had the same concern as myself when this game was initially revealed, don't worry, it is not a one for one match up to the original.  There are plenty of changes to be ENJOYED, and the gameplay is the highlight.  New ways to upgrade weapons, not only materia, and the battles have been upgraded (unless you want the original turn based system which is an option).  
The main story is roughly 38 ~ 40 hours to complete and I finished well under the level cap, many of the achievements are designed for those who are willing to replay the game and the Integrade (Yuffie) chapters are a great addition to give context and story unable to be told by the original.
If you did not like the original game, or are not a fan of stories of older RPGs, this game may not be for you.  But I think everything from the sound design, unlockables, graphics (of course), and changes to established story and characters is a huge plus to not only fans of this entry, series, or genre but to any gamer that enjoys a story heavy game with a lot to see and experience.

Reboot, that’s right. The one nobody in the world asked for.

Playing it feels like it was written by two separate entities: one competent, the other one totally retarded. So retarded that it’s like... Nomura and his egomaniac friends had breakfast at Taco Bell’s, and then closed their diarrhea in a sack to rub it in our faces.

Because that’s actually how they painted us, the original fans from 1997: flying garbage bags that don’t want the plot to change.
But the plot, the beautiful original plot of FFVII had been offensively changed, raped and sacrificed on the altar of the ego of incompetent writers.
After FFX, Square Enix did not produce a decent Final Fantasy. What could go wrong, radically changing the plot of their best one ever, right?
I’m not a purist fanboy! Many plot additions have actually improved and enriched the original world (Avalanche quest with Jessie is nice), although 90% of the side quests are shit.
But *SPOILER* bringing back in the end completely random key characters is an offensive choice for a chapter where loss and acceptance of loss are key topics.
All seasoned, of course, with an ending full of the super retarded dArKNeSs that so much pleases the father of KH.

It could have been a masterpiece and you can see it by playing it: the combat system is not exceptional but it's the cleanest of the last attempts and is enjoyable, the world is well built albeit with many compromises (PS4 game, it's miracle it's so good), dubbing and music are excellent (Uematsu sensei's masterpieces remixed in a coooool way).

I must express how amazing this game was. The entire experience was faultless, from its incredible fighting system that turned the traditional ATB into the perfect model for modernizing what Final Fantasy could be, to its excellent story mode. The voice acting was perfectly performed, and the produced scenes and game content had excellent graphic transitions that made the transitions from scene to game-play seamless. There isn't much that this game doesn't provide, though it may take some time to fully grasp the learning curve. As you get to the final acts, you'll undoubtedly want to switch to hard mode or just give it another go altogether.

Combat can be extremely intriguing, with each character having a distinct personality and offering a unique perspective. Finally, the boss encounters were the most great aspects of the show, presenting an incredible performance. The pacing is also practically flawless; some side quests feel a little forced, but overall, most of it is beneficial, whether it be for character growth or pursuing optional boss fights, which involve traditional summons.

Even the graphics aren't there. Sure, the models and artwork are lovely, but gameplay chugs. Worse than that, even the pre-rendered videos chug, for which there is no excuse. How can you enjoy the visuals when the occasional jarring motion breaks the immersion every minute or so?

I really want to recommend this game since I'm a huge fan of the original but i cannot bring myself to recommend it. So onto the bad. The combat system is beyond terrible. Final Fantasy 7 was a turn based system, not this open style that they made it. The open style would be good if they actually made it work. Any monster, not just bosses can basically interrupt anything you are doing, that makes no sense at all. Mid casting a heal an enemy could sneeze on you and cancel it out. Since this is basically a healing simulator that's kind of a big deal. This alone ruins the game for me but onto the next. The materia system is also broken. Materias used to duplicate after you mastered them, not in this one. Also, they renamed the ALL materia which is not a big deal but the new ""ALL"" you can only get 1 of in the entire play through. All was a huge part of materia setups in the original, not here. Don't even get me started on the summoning materia, as they are pretty much useless in the remake. You can only use them during boss fights and even when you do you have to wait for the game to actually allow you to use them and only once during a fight. The next thing is the terrible camera system, I'm not sure what the devs were thinking (maybe they weren't) but the camera angles especially during fights are the worst I've seen in any modern game. Onto the last and one of the biggest things IMO. It only took them 20 years to remake this game and this whole game is only disc 1 of the original... I  did not know this apon purchasing, and to me was a terrible idea from a terrible company just trying to money grab. I'm so tired of all these companies releasing half a game and charging full price then releasing the rest of the game and expect you to pay more for it. It's not right on so many levels. I mean honestly, they only had 20 years to remake it, it's not like they had limited time and so they release just disc 1. Disc 2 will be out 2-3 years after this game and who knows how long until disc 3 content to actually complete this game. They might not even release 3 in my lifetime... There's so much more that I'm leaving out. I'm so disappointed about this release. The original is probably my favorite game of all time and for them to drop the ball like this is unfathomable.

+ The modding community is extremely great;

+ Amazing Soundtrack as good as ever;

- They had two years to make a decent port, but it's a stuttering mess that you won't be able to fix even with mods and will have to use DX11;
- Square is not only ripping you off at an absurd price, but they also got money from Epic Games to have the game being exclusive at their store, this will go on with the Final Fantasy franchise;
- The only thing that has changed from the PS5 version is that now you can choose the PS4 textures and there are options for 90 and 120 FPS, you will still come across some terrible quality textures within the game;
- You don't have options for AA, SSAO, Motion Blur, Depth of Field, Film Grain and other post-processing effects;
- Even though the game is supposed to run in DX12, there are no modern technologies in this game;
- DRM, you can only launch the game through Steam, you don't need to be online though;
- All the new ""whispers"" thing and the last chapter seems like a really bad filler you just want to skip;
- Square Enix could have made all the dresses as custom outfits after you beat the game, but luckily we have mods for this;

Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade is a stellar testament to the timeless allure of the classic 1997 version, expertly revitalized for the modern gaming era. The most striking feature of this remastered edition is, undoubtedly, the jaw-dropping graphics upgrade. Square Enix has masterfully reimagined the iconic world of Midgar, transforming it into a visual masterpiece that breathes new life into a beloved classic.

One of the remarkable aspects of Intergrade is the attention to character design, with Tifa Lockhart standing out as a prime example. The stark contrast between her original 1997 appearance and her updated look from Advent Children is a visual feast for fans. Witnessing the evolution of Tifa's character design highlights the dedication Square Enix has put into capturing the essence of the original while seamlessly integrating modern aesthetics.

The battle format upgrades in Intergrade elevate the gameplay to new heights. The revamped combat system strikes a perfect balance between nostalgia and innovation, giving players a fresh perspective on the iconic battles of Final Fantasy 7. The seamless integration of Guardian Force skills adds an extra layer of strategy, allowing for more dynamic and visually stunning encounters. It's a testament to the developers' commitment to enhancing the gaming experience while preserving the essence of the original.

While the game introduces several delightful changes, there are moments of nostalgia that may tug at the heartstrings. The decision to reimagine Moggie as a child rather than an animal-type character may leave some fans feeling wistful. However, this alteration doesn't diminish the overall enjoyment of the game and serves as a testament to Square Enix's willingness to take creative risks.

In conclusion, Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade is a triumph in game development, successfully bridging the gap between the past and present. The stunning graphics, thoughtful character redesigns, and upgraded battle mechanics pay homage to the original while delivering an immersive experience for both long-time fans and newcomers. Despite minor deviations from the source material, Intergrade stands as an awe-inspiring testament to the enduring legacy of Final Fantasy 7.",1705455331,1705455331,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I've been playing between the Deck and desktop and its been flawless. Deck runs smooth even when docked to a 4k TV. Game handles like a gem with controller and I highly recommend controller.

FFVII has been around, but if this is your first step into FF and first time through FFVII, I highly recommend. Game is highly enjoyable on easy if you want to sit back and enjoy the combat/adventure. FF games have always been about the adventure to me, but that's coming from one who hasn't played ever FF yet. 

Love the combat of this game and the ability to switch between characters. Using Access during combat and switch to the right roles/elements to exploit it are a blast. It's just got so much RIGHT with it, the game is a true pleasure.

And it has Aerith. So 'nuff said.

I've played it on devices from the PS1 to the Steam Deck and just about everything in between.  So when this remake was announced I couldn't have been happier.  I waited in earnest for years and I can't be more disappointed now that I've been playing it.   

I bought it right when it was released but just found it boring and couldn't get into it.    I'm now forcing myself to revisit it and that first impression doesn't feel wrong.  I'm halfway through the game and it is just annoying the *@#$ out of me.  Let me run when I want to, why force the character to walk for half the game (yes I know about the L3 button to run, still feels slow).  It makes the character feel like they are constantly trudging through molasses.   And don't take control of the camera away from me ALL the time.  I get it you want to draw my attention to something.  Fine I noted it now let me control the camera again.  I'm sick of looking at the ground.

Those are simple, simple things that I don't think the game should have been released with.  And it's been a couple of years and no quality of life updates?  

Then there's the story and forced linear nature of the game so far which I think is untrue to the original.  Playing the original the worst part of the game was just waiting to get out of Midgar and out to the open world.  That open world was pretty revolutionary at the time and I think part of the games core DNA.  However, this entire game seems to be limited to Midgar.  One of the great things about the original was the open world exploration.  None of that so far in this game.  And did they really have to expound on every story detail to the ninth degree?  The original story was plenty detailed.

I'm not sure I'm going to finish this game.  I'm just so sick of the slow pace (the story and the walking).  I feel betrayed.",1705246332,1705250648,False,1,1,0.472440958023071289,1,True,False,False

I’ve never really been a fan of JRPGs at all, but I’ve been trying to diversify beyond what I usually play. So I started with Final Fantasy 7 remake. Firstly I loved the story, it was engaging and I felt drawn in by the twists and turns. However the side quests were droll and uninspired, I also hated how the game would judge you for not doing them. But I guess seeing Aerith in her gorgeous red dress was a good trade off.

Speaking of Aerith, I loved her so much. The characters were so fun to get to know and quest around Midgar with. I had my doubts about Barret but even he grew on me. I was even pleasantly surprised at how much I grew to love Cloud. Seeing him blush in a man’s arms after dancing with him was not something I expected, but I’m here for it.

I’m at 29 Hours at the end of playing and it feels adequate honestly. It never overstayed its welcome or got boring either. I got the game for $47 on sale and I feel like even without doing the dlc yet I got my moneys worth. However at a base price of $115 I’m not so sure.

Lastly I have to credit an extremely beautiful and bug free experience. I enjoyed taking screenshots of my journey in Midgar and my companions. I only wish the game had a better photo mode. I experienced no crashes or bugs and that is a rare sight on pc games lately especially ports. 

I’m so glad I stepped into the world of Final Fantasy 7 and I’m looking forward to playing more.",1705224139,1705224139,True,0,0,0.464037150144577026,0,True,False,False

The whole fate/whisper story arc i wasn't really feeling, and wish they'd kept it more true to the original.

Combat.. while mostly fun, i found that in later battles with the npcs focusing primarily on the character you're controlling, there was a tendency to constantly switch between characters in order to get abilities off.. making a sort of ping-pong effect which diminished the enjoyment of playing (at least for me).

I didn't like that you had to use ATB in order to use items in battle, making many of the items almost useless (except for maybe ether/phoenix down) since your abilities/spells were usually a more effective use of ATB. Then out of battle i didn't really find much a need for items either. Maybe remove the ATB restriction so you can use items freely in battle, and possibly the same with Limit Breaks and Summons.

Some of the last boss fights were a bit over the top imo. Then with a bit too many cut scenes and taking away of more player agency. There could've been a little better balance there.

Having said that.. overall the game was really quite well done. Even despite my criticisms, i found this to be one of maybe a handful of games that i've actually enjoyed over the past few years. The additional story and focus on Midgard was quite entertaining. I loved the expanded character development with characters like Jessie, and many of the new characters (well, except maybe for Andrea). I did like the combat for the most part, aside from the above criticisms. Even thought the story was done well and i'm looking forward to seeing the sequels. It gave a great balance between nostalgia while improving many aspects.

it got scraped half in the development ( sadly, and i hate square enix for this ), but the idea didn't

this FFVII REMAKE is a "" WHAT IF "" of original game, gonna be a happier ending, everyone surviving, fairy tail like
the downside is, you need to play the original game to fully enjoy this REMAKE, otherwise you'll be HELLA CONFUSED

the remake shows glimpse of original game as flashbacks, and flashforwards, without explaining much, which makes it even more confusing

and the original game is a "" 1997 PS1 GAME "" there's more than 30GB of mods to add voice acting and better graphics, but overall, it can't get better than a DREAMCAST like game

either play the original with mods, without mods, or watch on youtube, otherwise 

                                               I DO NOT RECOMMEND PLAYING REMAKE, BEFORE ORIGINAL 

the amount of references this game has to the original is a LOT, and i meant it.

speaking of the remake story itself, it's the DISK 1 to the point you exit Midgar

they made a 15h story to a full 45h story, i did enjoy both story and side stories, and i really enjoyed the game

the normal difficulty is kinda easy, the hard difficulty is just "" NO ITEMS "" and is locked behind completing game

the modding community is great, also there's a cheat table ( cheat engine ) to swap controllable character outside combat

First of all, thank you for releasing this game on Steam, Square Enix. 
It's a dream come true that we get a modern version of Final Fantasy VII and that this game is not a Sony/Epic Games Store exclusive.

For all newcomers who have never played the original Final Fantasy VII: 
This is not a 1:1 remake. Most of the elements may be identical, but the timeline has been changed. 
It's more of a ""What would have happened if..."" game, or better said: a reimagined version of Final Fantasy VII.
So I would recommend you to play the OG FF VII first and then this ""remake"".



The story mode, cutscenes, gameplay, soundtracks and environment are beautiful. 
As a Final Fantasy VII fan, this game makes me happy. Exploring the world, listening to the wonderful soundtracks (remakes) and exploring the story once again. It's everything I could wish for in a modernization of a classic game. 
And the DLC, even though it's short (2-4 hours to complete), is fantastic because we'll learn about Yuffie's past. 

Please note that this is a triology. Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade is only 1/3 the size of the OG FF VII game, but SE has expanded the story and unfortunately added some filler. 
Final Fantasy VII Rebirth will be another 1/3 (or maybe 1/2) the size and the third game will be released a few years later.



I'd like to give this game a 10/10, but I do have some cons that should be mentioned:
Unfortunately, I have encountered some technical problems. Sometimes a white image simply appears during the battle (this can be fixed by pausing the game and then going into photo mode and closing it afterwards), but the bug is still annoying. 
Sometimes the framerate drops for me, especially when I play the DLC. 
Therefore, I unfortunately have to deduct one point from the rating. 

Another problem I have is the price of this game. 
Don't get me wrong. I'm grateful that this game is available on Steam, but this game was a Sony exclusive, and it was hijacked by the Epic Game Store. These exclusivity are just wrong. It just divides the community. 
And the fact that after a few years of exclusivity you can only get a third of the OG FF VII for 80€ is cold-hearted. 
But I also understand that the development costs for this remake are expensive, so I'll let it slide.




Total and a message to Square Enix:
Anyway, I want to thank you again from the bottom of my heart for releasing this game on Steam, SE.

I am looking forward to play Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, once it's available on Steam.

But I have a question (and I don't know where to ask it):
Could you please release your older games (like the Kingdom Hearts series) here on Steam?
It would be great if more people are able to play your older games. ^^",1704809946,1704809946,True,2,0,0.510643064975738525,0,True,False,False

[*] If you cast an ice spell, it takes a good second between the spell hitting and it actually doing damage. If you're fighting a reasonably fast moving enemy, they'll just walk out of it, so you just wasted MP and an ATB point.

On the one hand you have some of the coolest characters and world, but on the other you have some of the worst pacing and level design. I also strongly feel that if i had played the original, i'd have enjoyed this a lot more and i would strongly recommend you do not play this without playing the original first. The default combat system seemed odd at first but honestly seems to be a lot more fun if you engage with it, however i opted to just go with the classic turn based style.The writing here is pretty janky as well, which is odd that they didn't try and improve that. The soundtrack is awesome. In terms of customization options there aren't many to help tweak the games graphics (eg. bloom) which kinda feels lacking. The package as a whole feels like just too much filler that just kills the pacing every time things start moving.

NOTE - If you have a vision impairment with USABLE VISION, you can play this. The lack of options to remove bloom may prove problematic if you are photosensative, but these sections are few. There is also a bike minigame towards the end of the game that may require sighted assistance to get through, luckily that section isn't too  long and is not representative of the rest of the game (should have been a cut scene instead).

The game itself is fine, the problem is, it's a bad console port. Cutscenes stutter, there is hitching and slowdowns all throughout the game and there is almost no controller support. I managed to fix the cutscenes freezing and stuttering with a mod. There was still major slowdowns throughout the game and lowering the resolution didn't fix the problem. I'm running this on a 4080 with max system memory and an M2 SSD. 

I also had issues with a my dualsense controller that made the game unplayable. When you're fighting someone and you press x, the game pauses to let you issue commands. The game would pause for me every 10 seconds like the x button was being pressed over and over. The same thing would happen when I was walking around the game world. You can press L2 to toggle between compass or mini map or nothing at all. When walking around, the minimap and compass would flash on the screen like the L2 button was being pressed over and over. I tried using 3rd party software like DualSenseX. With or without middleware, the controller glitched exactly the same way no matter what.

However I think some might disagree and miss the turn-based combat. Personally I don't have the patience for random encounters and turn-based combat anymore. And lets be honest. The only reason turn-based combat existed back in the 80s and 90s was due to limitations with gaming hardware. Now with modern hardware turn based is completely unnecessary. In my opinion the combat feels like it was intended to feel if it were in real time. I always wanted this kind of combat back in the day when games like Kingdom Hearts 1 had it but games like Final Fantasy 12 and 13 were still sticking to the old formula. 

I also like that the story has been altered. Some may also not like this but I feel like it allows new and old players of the classic the ability to play the remake and still get surprised. 

If I had any complaints with the game it's that some bosses are a little too spongy and take waaaaay too long to kill. The story is also ironically a little confusing despite having played the original and I think Sephiroth shows up a little too much. The characters also don't seem to react like realistically to dealing with multiverse level craziness. However most of this is minor grievances. 

My top complaint is with how the main characters handle the villains. You know how in most stories the villains talk too much and which allows the villain to be defeated? Imagine that except it's both the villains and main characters doing it. When the main characters have the upper hand they start talking instead of killing which then allows the villain to get away. 

Spoilers!!!

Not a single villain in the game is defeated making your actions feel a little hollow. They all are able to run away or survive somehow after the battle is over. Enemies shoot at you in cut scenes but miss more than the typical storm trooper. Bullets are about as useful in this world as Nerf guns. And nobody seems to die as if the game was meant for a G-rated audience. In some cases the story gets shonin levels over the top ridiculous. It's these kinds of examples that drag the story down. Japanese storytelling can be good but in this case, FF Remake suffers from some of the worst tropes anime tropes.

Some textures are far too low-detail for a PC port with serious graphics rendering capabilities. Make it look like a PS4 game (which it is), but additional resources/updates should have been provided as part of the PC port.

The story is far too short. I remember spending a good 60-80 hours playing the original just on the main story...and after clearing everything in a Normal difficulty run, it clocked in at just over 64. That's a terribly low amount of content.

As a ""complete"" game, most of the story was far too linear for far too long. Chapter 14 is where all the ""content"" and side quests exists before a hand-held linear path which offers very little in terms of entertainment. Shrina HQ did offer some deeper insight into the world lore, which was a nice touch.

All in all, it was good as a title, but for us who were fanatics of the original game, it felt woefully unfinished in terms of narrative and lacking in breadth that would demand multiple playthroughs. The extras from a Hard mode clear just aren't enough of an incentive for me.

Verdict: 7/10 It's worth playing, but it'll leave you wishing it brought more to the table.

A Note on the Intergrade Content: It was enjoyable (as a separate bonus standalone side quest can be) but a nagging video memory error prevented me from paying it in large chunks of time.

Admittedly after FFXIII, I fell away from Squenix because the progression of their single player RPG's had become stale and lacked imagination or innovation. As some described it: ""Things became too linear"".

I picked up this game after my best friend from my childhood advised me to have a second look after many years away from the franchise. The long and short of my review: I am torn on whether to love this game and become and once again raise my Squenix flag, or whether to raise hell at Squenix management over the idiot they had in charge of managing the sequence of save/recovery points and boss fights as you exit Midgar for good. THEY SHOULD BE FIRED AND SHAMED FROM THE INDUSTRY. Like come on... who's idea was it to stack 6 consecutive boss fights starting with the Jenova fight? ... and only provide one save point before and in the middle? Also let's talk about the Whisper Harbinger fight. Literally (as far as I can read) the whole internet basically ragequitted (including myself) from this game after attempting this boss fight. I give you this, you gave us a save point right before this fight. But what is the point? I can't go back and gain any missing levels AND I can't go back and get the specialized materia from submitting battle intel. So basically the point of no return was before I went into the Shinra power plant (even though you told me it was before Whisper Harbringer).

So basically I am stuck at my current level, unable to do random fights to level up, unable to get the specialized battle materia that I missed, and hard stuck at a boss with broken fight mechanics that can pretty much instantly wipe out your party in less than 10 seconds. Oh wait... you think I am playing on hard mode? LOL, no this is normal mode. Was there absolutely no QA on the Whisper Bahamut portion of that boss fight? I can't imagine who would even try the cluster fuck that is hard mode and those attempting it must be nothing short of sadistic. But wait! It gets even better: this isn't even the last boss in this sequence of boss fights! There are actually **7** consecutive boss fights exiting Midgar and I just happen to be stuck on the second last of them. Based on how the previous 5 went, I am guessing there is no restore point/save before the last one either!

Now here's the thing, the Whisper Harbinger fight might be manageable, IF YOU GAVE US A DAMN MINUTE TO RECOVER HALF WAY THROUGH WHEN WE SWITCHED TEAMS. But this person/team you should fire decided: ""Nah, fuck the fans. Don't give them the chance to heal up or switch gear, let's just throw them into the next portion of the boss right away."" And if we want to go back and get those missing levels or specialized materia? Like I said before, nope you can't do that either.

What I like about the game: It's phenomally pretty, elegant, fantastic story telling, stuck true to the lore, and uses a solid engine that is practically bug free. It's just a damn shame that final sequence of exiting midgar took all that was good and turned it completely rotten. I really doubt I am going to finish this game except for watching it on YouTube, which is a damn dirty shame Squenix. Shame on you.",1704655916,1704656445,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My biggest complaint was that the ending made absolutely no sense---I mean, the ending literally introduces and focuses on a new character who is never mentioned throughout the entire game. Not to mention the main plot has us do a lot of busywork, especially at the middle part, which opened up a lot of plot holes as you progress the game. The main villain Sephiroth who was teased since the first few hours of the game was just a hollow evil character that by the end I didn't even know what he is trying to achieve or why the party feels like they should stop him to ""save the world"". Who he is and his relationship to Cloud is never mentioned in the game. There were also of story beats which, frankly, were a bit clumsy. Main characters and their development throughout the game were fine and could have used more time to really flesh out their relationships and motivations. The side quests are boring and the entire game felt like I was on a rail at all times where there is little to no effort in really fleshing out Midgar. No mentions of what the world was outside of Midgar (only a small mention of a rival faction called Wutai without expanding who, what, or where they are). No mentions of what the other sectors or upper levels are like except for the ones we traverse in the game.

Small nitpick on how the game forces me to walk in certain areas and scenes which is annoying. Graphics are very impressive overall, but there are a surprising amount of low res textures throughout which really ruins the experience in some scenes.

Where the game really shines is in the music and the hybrid strategy-realtime action combat with the ATB system. I much prefer turn-based systems like in the Persona series and the latest Yakuza Like a Dragon game, though I was surprised that I enjoyed the battle system and character progression in the game. Though I will say that Tales of Arise has a more polished and satisfying combat system with a much more robust party AI, at least in my opinion (e.g. like how in the ""Tales of"" games, enemy moves are always shown on top the the screen to make it visible to the player at all times and away from all the flashy particle effects on screen). Seriously, why couldn't have they implemented a good AI Tactics system for the other party members in battle.

- If possible makes the movies a higher fps, it really decrease immersion when you suddenly go from like 60fps to 30fps, even more so from 120fps to 30fps. I know that there's in total only 3 lengthy movies, but yeah those are quite important movies.

- Chapter select with sub-chapter selection, especially on chapters where alternate route or where some decision might impact future result. Makes it less tedious and saves time & energy for some stuffs.

- Faster port to Steam.

And .... please don't botch this FF SquareEnix, please.
I'd rather have the story the same like the original just with improved graphics than a botched new spin on the story.

I lost faith on you because Fashion Show Simulat-- I mean, FF13-3 and Boyband Camping Simulato-- I mean, FF15. 
Faith somewhat returned because of Nier Automata which you helped release.
Now more faith returned again because of FF7 remake, but yeh.... If you botch this I don't think I'll ever bother with your creations again.",1704596428,1704601599,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Next part is two discs on the PS5, making this officially the same number of discs as FFVII; Part 3 will make for more discs than FFVII's original release. I am elated.

QUICK TIPs FOR MKB USERS: Right click to evade, it only displays R.
Rebind all motorcycle controls to numpad so you can just switch your left hand.
(FFVII came out on PC in 1997, let's not pretend this wasn't always a multiplatform game. In fact, the PC port is the source code for every subsequent port, because they had to rewrite it.)

Final Fantasy VII was a technical achievement in its day, ILM worked on it, it oozed style, it was robust, and told a story a novel deep within a Playstation 1 game. I remember seeing the development art of Cloud and the gang and then imagining them doing whatever their polygonal counterparts were representing... And now I get to see that come to life.

This is it. They did it. Beautiful. Optimized. Smooth. Incredible gameplay from modern FF titles and stunning visuals, this game might be good on its own but entering a room and immediately having flashbacks as you recognize the details and color is otherworldly. Ethereal. I'm not only stepping into my memories, I'm stepping into the memory of my imagination, what my kid self thought it looked like. Holy shit the crazy fuckers did it.

Complaints: 
-Exclusivity deals are bullshit and it shouldn't have taken this long for this masterpiece to arrive here.
-The MKB controls for the motorcycle segments are so insanely fucked I can't imagine how a professional developer decided on them. A and D turn as expected, but instead of W and S as accelerate/brake it's *x and z*. What the hell?",1663891184,1704599381,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

On the one hand it's definitely FF VII and feels like the original. But OTOH it doesn't even cover all the content from the original's first disc alone and that worries me. We saw how the [i]Xenosaga[/i] series only got three releases out of an originally planned eight before being abandoned.

This version greatly expands on the setting of Midgard City with new areas to explore, more quests to do, and giving the people living there a much more human feel. But it's also painfully short with no real incentive to replay the game, even with NG+, precisely because it's so short: it feels repetitive replaying things instead of nostalgic.

Personally bought it for 39.99 , not sure if I would pay 79.99 , but if you are into structured story , played any other FF titles or Witcher , You might enjoy this.  Has excelent character development particullary for Cloud and Berret ( Will not spoil any further ) .

9/10 . Replayability , you can replay each chapter if you are wise with the saves , however personally i feel this is the type of game you play once , you have amazing experince , 2nd will not be same .

Personally for me it was second best experience this year after Baldurs Gate 3  and just a bit better than Resident Evil 4 
( thats personal opinion though).

8/10 Optimalization/Performance : 
Runs fine at 120FPS lock on RX 6800 and Ryzen 5800X. System usage around 20 to 30% on CPU and 60% on GPU. Mind you if you are running some background apps 32GB of RAM and 12GB VRAM required ( had usage around 19 GB RAM and 11.5 GB  VRAM , thats on ultra , but personally I would not advise playing it on 8GB card.)",1704575812,1704575812,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

[b] The Good [/b]

- The story is well crafted and implemented. Gotta be the most important thing.
- NPCS don't say a lot of garbage. Thank you devs.
- Good Graphics 
- Almost classical gameplay mixed with non-classical gameplay
- Good Voice Acting
- A contrast between how the past thought the future could be and how it is
- Also not to mention best soundtrack
- All dialogue is voice and is done with no complaints!
- The Auto-save system is also great. Even if something goes wrong it saves your progress!
- Balanced skill build up! The fact your skill doesn't stack so you can't spam helps reduce making the game too easy! Thanks Devs.
- Good progression systems with materia. Really well thought out that you need to level up yourself, your materia and so on. Gotta put a thumbs up to that.
- The crispy cinematics. Characters look realistic and feel very well made. It is just as excellent as the original FF7 from over 10 years ago.
- Find game too hard? Set it to easy mode and enjoy it.
- Cloud in dress makes a perfect waifu.
- But most importantly runs well on most systems of hardware be it 30 fps or 60 fps or low or high. The game runs well with no trouble.

[b] What is lacking [/b]

- The ability to explore. Most areas feel good in design and game feeling but lack extra treasure for exploring. Game treasure system feels quite empty.
- Cosmetics don't appear only weapon items. Which sadly sucks.
- Weapon upgrade system is ""ok"" could have been better thought out. Like more choices.
- Spell system feels bland. The character abilities are well crafted. Spells don't seem all shiny except ""cure"" which sucks. Nothing special just bland animations.
- Side-quests are too basic to complete and just feel like pointless side quests but doing so can get rewards. Would be nicer if there was a better system more faster in pace and more interesting than boring go investigate, talk to people, fight and so on.
- The mini-games too easy and can be cleared in 1 try. It needs a difficulty boost. Also the awards suck.

[b] The Bad [/b]

- Parts of the original game are cut from a serious tone to a more silly one. Didn't quite like that.
- The bugs and glitches. Issue 1: Exploration, these additional quests fail to complete and need to reset from save to finally make them complete. Issue 2: Too bright lighting, makes you restart game. Issue 3: Too dark lighting, makes you restart game or else black screen till you load menu to exit. Issue 4: Enemies freeze in air in middle of combat. 
- Blocking with clouds sword isn't real. You still take damage but less. It ain't worth to block multi-hit attacks as the damage is still too great.
- Materia and summoning ability is flawed. You need the right elements against the right enemies or else game difficulty will be too hard and you will find it impossible to proceed with the materia you own. Meaning if you invest in just lightning and wind. The fire (firaga) element will make you lose because you didn't master it. Summons, also need to be thoughtout as they are game breaking. Some are too op against enemies making fights like too many minutes slower or some make them too long.
- Game Balance is bad. Some enemies in early game too op some too hard. Reno is fast as **** boi and has made me lost x6 times while the Rude fight took 1 fight.

[h2] Overall [9.9/10] [/h2]

With much positive and cons. It is fair to say this has been a blast to play in 2024 for first time since the original. I have enjoyed everything of the game despite its flaws.

The highs that games reaches are honestly second to none. Story, music, characters, BOSS BATTLES were all amazing. It might not be the best video game but as an experience it is among my favorites in all of gaming. 

From reading online, one of the big criticisms of FF16 was its watered down (basically non-existent) RPG systems in favor of more action focused gameplay. This were very clear to me but I was so wrapped up in the games narrative and characters it didn't detract from the overall experience. The combat was simple but flashy and fun none the less.

This takes me to FF7 remake. Another GREAT experience, though FF7 isn't connecting with me as much as FF16. I liked the more mature tone of FF16 so adjusting to this PG-13 world took a while. The story thus far (I have not played the original PS1 classic) is good and I am excited for the rest of the trilogy (Edit post finishing campaign: The story really ramps up in the later chapters. Now I am truly invested). The characters are eccentric and over the top but I am used to that in alot of JRPGs. Doesn't bother me. 

The biggest improvement I felt from FF16 to FF7 was the combat and the RPG systems. Elemental effects, de-duffs, slotting materia onto gear, weapon upgrades, etc. Its not super in depth but its enough and adds alot to the moment to moment gameplay. And having a party of characters that you can switch to/control really helps this game from becoming dull. Its very satisfying to stagger an enemy using elements they are weak to and then command all your party members to just unleash.

It's a lot of fun to play, the story is great, the combat is great, the music is great, the characters are great, it looks great, and there are some aspects that are just really weird (but in a good way) that you don't see in a lot of high profile games any more. I mean there are multiple rhythm minigames in this action RPG about ecoterrorism. You should play this game and I hope you have fun doing so.

With all that being said, this is a remake, which means you'll be thinking about the original game as you play it. Final Fantasy 7 has an incredible amount of nostalgia and love around it, and for good reason. It did things no other game had done at the time. I have always had a little bit of FOMO around Final Fantasy 7. I was a little too young when it came out and over the years I've heard nothing but praise from people who played it when it came out. Instead of Final Fantasy 7, when I was a kid I played other older Final Fantasy games, specifically 4, 5, and 6. And I thought those games were great so when I finally played Final Fantasy 7 years later I was kind of disappointed. It didn't measure up to the hype I heard about it and that makes sense. While Final Fantasy 6 had been honing its genre for years, 7 was establishing all this new stuff that paved the way for lots of other games since. It's tough for a game to be so foundational while also being perfect to return to because so much of what it established as fun will be improved upon.

Why do I bring all this up? It's basically to say that I don't think you need to go back and play the original Final Fantasy 7 or really have any knowledge of the game before playing Remake. Will it make your experience better? Maybe a little at some points. There will definitely be moments where you have more context based on your knowledge of the original and there are also cool subversions of the original game. But overall this is a great game that stands on its own and in my opinion its the ideal way to experience this game. Don't worry about the fact that this is a remake, even though that's pretty inescapable. Just play it, have fun, and be excited there's more to come!",1704466271,1704466271,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

They're a plot device that explicitly diminishes the actions of the player, saving characters that would have been defeated and killing characters by literally dragging them off to die. It's very disappointing how prominent FF7 Remake made ""plot armor"", replacing its original dystopian environmentalist plot with the plot of Final Destination, and the original corporate anarchist villains with Harry Potter-esque dementors with justification so shaky they needed Aerith's voice actor to get high and say ""I just don't know"" a bunch of times just to explain it. Finally, we have Sephiroth flashing in and out like special effects from a bad 90s movie, constantly telling Cloud ""I'm waiting for you"" with a homoerotic smile.

They didn't kill FF7's plot with what happened to Aerith, they killed it by not having the confidence to just change it.

Furthermore, the level design is terrible. Towards the end of the game, healing items are so weak that they're practically irrelevant, the majority of materia are useless because enemies are never weak against poison or status effects, and there's legitimately nothing you would spend gil on. Yet, except for a couple pieces of armor you'd never use except in Hard Mode, all of the treasures consist of useless materia (like Poison) and gil. Unlike the original, the interest in exploration is diminished. Basing gameplay around achievements/trophies is so lazy. 

I had high hopes for this game, but it just didn't pan out. I was a huge fan of FF6 and FF7. It should have been so easy for them to get this right. I don't need them to keep exactly the same plot. But Tetsuya Nomura must have watched The Avengers too many times and decided to copy all the nonsensical metaphysical stuff.

Without spoiling anything, FF7 Remake i can say is an enjoyable experience at times that is unfortunately bogged down by bits of padding and filler. This game follows the opening of FF7 up until the escape from Midgar. Set pieces from this area of the game are recreated and expanded upon significantly. There are plenty of sections included in the Remake that were simply not in the original at all, or were not given much screen time originally. Some iconic set pieces from the original game are given a much more cinematic and larger than life approach then they were in the OG and it works very well at times. (The Opening Bombing Mission, and battle with the Airbuster for early game examples.)

While the extended scope of the game works in it's favor at times, Its also sometimes brings the game to a halt, with some added sections feeling completely unnecessary and at times even feeling like ""Bloat"" Square Enix taking creative liberties with the source material is seen as early as chapter 2, and can come across as confusing, especially to those that haven't played the OG game or have little knowledge of it (Which IMO makes the Remake marketing all the more perplexing.) 

The game handles most of the characters fairly well, keeping their unique charm and doesn't go too out of it's way to bastardize their original characterization like most of the Extended Universe Compilation games/media from the mid 2000s did. (Without spoiling much, i absolutely hate the game's portrayal of the main villain, which seems more like a caricature of what made him so mysterious and intimidating in the original.)

The battle system is satisfying, and it generally feels good to wail on enemies after staggering them. It isn't turn based but IMO it's probably the best alternative we have atm, still feeling like some level of strategy is needed, although some enemies fall under damage spongy range even on the normal difficulty. Some of the mini games/ in game ""puzzles"" are mind numbiingly dull, and feel more forced than usual.  The game does well when it's paying tribute to the original game and expanding on what made the original so great, but the Remake at times does lack subtly, and fails to capture the general point of the original game and its vision i feel.

Despite all of this, i've had more ups than downs with this part of the project, generally hoping ""Rebirth"" expands upon the faults of Part 1. If i were to score this game, i'd give it a 7.5 maybe low 8. As a fan of the original FF7, it generally feels like an ""extension"" of the games universe, and there is lots of ambition being shown, but ambition alone won't win the crowd at the end of the day.

Apart from the missing widescreen support and (especially considering this) the ridiculous original asking price for the PC version (shame on you Square Enix on both counts), the game delivers an captivating experience for FF7 veterans and newcomers alike. 
Even though it only covers the events up to the exodus from Midgar, it does not feel stretched out but instead takes the time to letting us get to know the characters properly, allowing for a much more substantial investment in them by the player.

The hybrid combat system takes a bit of getting used to and can be a somewhat chaotic at times, especially if you are used to the clean tactical Active Time Battle of the original, but still can provide a fun challenge in it's own right.
With some fifty hours per play though, including all side quests, it is a little bit on the short side, but acceptable (again not withstanding the original asking price). Given that at the cutting point in the story, the original is just about to step into the open world mechanics, it is an understandable decision. This does however put a lot of pressure on the second part to create a comparable increase in scope from this point, which, I guess is a bridge we well get to cross when we get to it.

The first half felt like a major drag, with more cut-scenes than action, then it got really good in the middle, then went back to a major drag to finish. Replay-ability inst really a thing besides doing it all over again on hard or the same enemies in a VR combat zone repeatedly.

The game honestly transitions between its chapters rather smoothly, everything has a part in the story and world if I'm being honest.

The game world design is clearly dated by now, but that it never hampered the experience in a meaningful way. One of the reasons I don't like most JRPGs is because of grind is part of it. The idea of constantly fighting enemies just to reach a level which gives you enough resistance or damage to topple a boss. Luckily FF VII Remake does not have that. Even if it did, I honestly would not mind because combat is one of key highlights of the game - did I mention how good it is to wield Cloud's Buster Sword? The art direction and the spectacle of the big fights are a grandeur, which I told is a big part of the series.

For those who played the original - nostalgia is great  Graphics are awesome (but only mediocre compared to others that came out around the same time) and the combat system is more involved/innovative than the original turn based version.  However, the lack of random encounters and extremely linear game play detracts from the original.  A lot of the filler game play in the original was fun, but in a more modern game  feels just irritating.  The constant blending of cut-scenes/action in some areas is awful.  Finally, a lot of the filler game play that was charming the first time around was irritating as it was largely just random button mashing this time around.

Only played a bit, but there are cut-scenes for literally everything and I mean everything.  The game has zero flow and pacing due to this.  Game takes control of the camera all the time because the player is assumed to be too stupid to look around on their own.  There's slow walk and talk parts (ugh) and multiple cut-scenes during the first boss because why not.  I imagine I'll never be able to turn off the quest arrows and there will be a bunch of filler side quests.  I haven't gotten that far but it's a modern AAA game so the chances are likely. 

Combat feels very button-mashy like it wanted to be a destitute man's Devil May Cry but also wanted to have RPG elements and party members but it doesn't really work. They even made the weird story changes to make the bio-terrorist protagonists absolved of any kind of morally grey activity.  

I put off playing this for a long time because I assumed it would be like this but the generally good reception it got made me reconsider.

This also includes the Intermission DLC with Yuffie as a playable character.

The game takes place in Midgar, the City of Mako, surrounded by eight mako reactors and a central building where the Shinra HQ lies. The topside circular structure where the rich and well-off people live while the below that is the slums, where people can almost not see the light of day because of the “Pizza” plate above, home to the unfortunate and monsters where the people have to fend for themselves. The slums is where the main casts lives, primarily in Sector 7. Avalanche, an eco-terrorist group that seeks to save the Planet from Shinra and its use of Mako (liquified form of the Planet’s lifestream.)

The game starts of with Cloud Strife, a mercenary hired by Avalanche cell led by Barret to destroy Mako Reactor 1. Immediately introducing the gameplay to the player, from a real-time turn-based like gameplay to a more action-based hybrid. FF7R retains the ATB gauge where it gradually fills up as you do more normal attacks. This is where the hybrid gameplay comes in, when you have an ATB bar available, you can do various actions where time slows down, from using your abilities, materias you equipped or consumable items. Speaking of materia, these are items that can be equipped that gives you new spells, abilities or summons. The materia system is highly customizable, giving you what builds and roles you want for your playable characters.

The soundtrack is amazing in FF7R in my opinion. Giving the old soundtrack remixes while adding new ones into the mix. Eligor’s Theme being my personal favorite. Eligor who was a rare but regular enemy in the OG got promoted to boss status. There’s a few more enemies that got the boss status treatment.

If you’re new to Final Fantasy and thinking of getting this game as your first, I’d say get it. However, I do recommend playing the OG first. I think you’ll enhance your experience playing the Remake knowing the plot of the OG beforehand.

The main thing keeping it from greatness is the insane amount of filler. There's so much of it that one could be forgiven for thinking the devs must've spent weeks just brainstorming ways to pad playtime without having to come up with anything of substance. It just completely destroys the pacing at several points.

Boss design is... questionable, to say the least. Bosses having different phases is nothing new in RPGs, but those transitions being designed specifically to break any momentum you might have had going isn't something game developers typically do. Fights that should have been fast-paced and packed with action wind up feeling like a slog because of the frequent interruptions. I can't say I hated any of the bosses, but I also didn't find any of them particularly thrilling due to the atrocious pacing and aforementioned theft of momentum. 

The combat system itself is a bit clunky as well. They'd have been much better served simply building on what they already came up with for Crisis Core. They wanted an action RPG instead of the classic experience, but they ultimately failed to deliver. I won't say the system is bad, but it's just... again, not great. It's okay, just okay.

This game is made for the fans 100% No microtransactions, no online multiplayer. its just how games used to be, and that makes me love it 10000x more. 
The artistic rendition of every frame that was in FF7 is absolutely phenomenal in this remake.

But this remake really throws me in and i selfishly enjoyed every..single...moment. It looks like im playing a FMV or CG if your oldschool enough, throughout the WHOLE journey. 
The fight mechanics are fantatstic, though sometimes i feel like whatever im doing doesnt help a hard encounter, its still doable and satisfying. I really appreciate that all the enemies are directly from the old game and redone best they could, damn its great, pure genius!
One thing i have to talk on is the emotion captured watching the game progress, i absolutely got enveloped in the emotion each and every character expresses. the facial expressions are sooo spot on, and the voice acting is immaculate, and i cannot stress that enough.

I've always been a fan of playing rpgs handheld (gba,nds,psp) And FF7R is perfect for this form factor. Graphics-wise the game looks amazing, just make sure to use the disable dynamic resolution mod. The game plays at 40 FPS locked for the most part. Combat is amazing, attacks feel fast and fluid, switching between characters is fun, and navigating the menu to pull off spells, use potions or summons paces the combat well. Story-wise, it's hard to follow towards the end, especially if you're new to the franchise but the rest of the game is so fun and quirky that I didn't mind. The only problem I had with the game are some of the side missions. While unique, they can sometimes be a tad bit boring. But at least they're unique and help the world building, which I can't say for a lot of other game's side quests. Overall, this game is great, 9.5/10.

The new combat system looked like a massive departure from the old system, and so I was put off to the point where many years passed before I finally tried it.

Let's start with what I consider positives.
-Visuals are amazing.
-Sounds and music are amazing.
-It was great to see charters reborn and voiced.
-Materia system prety close to the original.

My personal cons.
-Expanded story (some definitely a possibility, but so much bloat that I dread to think what the other 2 segments are going to do since the midgar opening act was like 2 hours and they turned it into 26 hours!)
-Comabt system, its personal. Give me the old system any day of the week.
-Different Ending (no spoilers, but there's a whole new segment that is completely new and looks to have major ramifications for everything that comes after)

It's definitely worth a play if you're a fan, and as a game, it's pretty solid. I'm personally burned out to the point where I will come back another time for the Yuffie DLC. I just don't have it in me at the moment.",1703926353,1703926353,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I liked:

[list]
[*] Graphics: they're amazing, mostly. (It stuttered a little at first for me, but this cleared up over the first play session.)
[*] Soundtrack: excellent. Very high production value. The way the music flows and changes between exploration and battle, and different phases of a boss battle, is very well done. One of the best dynamic music systems to date.
[*] Combat: while I still prefer classic turn-based JRPG combat, this system was quite fun most of the time.
[*] Boss battles feel truly epic, cinematics have been integrated well into the battles without compromising the gameplay.
[*] The dungeons are the highlight of the game for me. This is where the game feels most like the original. They're dark, atmospheric, have some light puzzles, don't outstay their welcome.
[*] There's novelty here seeing these classic characters brought to life with modern tech.
[/list]

I didn't like:

[list]
[*] The game is mostly filler. They've taken the first part (Midgar) of the original FFVII and stretched it out to a full length game. The way they achieved this is packing it full of mediocre content.
[*] Tonally, it's kind of a mess. The thick melancholy atmosphere of the original's Midgar has been discarded in favor of silly action cutscenes and various wackiness. The music contributes to the issues with tone; I said the soundtrack is excellent, and it is, but the choice of music in certain areas seems inappropriate even if the songs themselves are great.
[*] If you walk into an encounter not equipped with the right materia it can be rather frustrating. You don't know the enemy's weakness ahead of time, you can't change your equipment within a battle, and you don't have enough materia to be equipped for all possibilities.
[*] The storytelling. I don't think you could make sense of this if you aren't already familiar with the story. Since it's a small slice of the original game, the pacing is completely messed up. There's no satisfying conclusion, no character arcs, not even a cliffhanger for the sequel.
[*] The plot. This added element of [spoiler]fate[/spoiler] is very bad. [spoiler]Our characters initially are fighting a grounded conflict against an evil megacorp. Then towards the end, out of the blue, the plot suddenly switches to them fighting against ""destiny"". Why? And why do the characters accept this without question? This is obviously self-referential, with the future they are fighting to change being the plot of the original game. But the characters aren't supposed to know that they're inside of a remake. The developers seem to be using this plot element to give themselves permission to deviate from the original plot from now on, but they never needed permission in the first place. Meta elements like this in a plot almost always suck, and this is no exception.[/spoiler]
[/list]

It could and should have been much better.  Still, I liked it enough to finish it at least.  Not at all excited for the sequel though, and unlike the original FFVII I doubt I'll ever replay this.

[h3]DLC edit:[/h3]

I played the DLC (INTERmission) after writing the above.

It's made up of two chapters following Yuffie. I liked the first chapter a lot and thought I might have to switch this review to a Thumbs Up, but the second chapter was a disappointment.  The last couple of bosses were boring, and some rather lame villains were introduced.  I later discovered that these came from some of the earlier FFVII gaiden games, which I've never played.  I guess this means that the story in the follow-up to this game is going to be an absolute mess and I'll be just as lost as anyone who has never played the original FFVII.

However, I wanted to point out the music as a high point yet again.  Did you know there's a 3-disc soundtrack of original music just for this DLC?  Isn't that insane?  As a lover of videogame music, of course I mean it's ""insanely good"", and it was worth playing the DLC for the music alone.",1702171173,1703893471,False,204,10,0.753070056438446045,9,True,False,False

(It does not include the other parts and never will)
I have never played the original, I was curious about it as everybody seems to agree on how great it was. But I can't enjoy a game so old so I though to play this one instead. 
After finishing it I didn't understand the plot so I went to youtube to see what I was missing. TURNS OUT YOU ARE EXPECTED TO KNOW ALL ABOUT THE ORIGINAL BEFORE PLAYING THIS GAME! It just won't even introduce the characters, OR THE VILLAIN EVEN. You are ment to know them already.
As a result I have learnt the story of the real FFVII throw youtube videos in order to make sense of the one I was given. The only point of buying this game was to expirience it first hand as a newcommer with no info on the game, I did not see any image or read anything about the game because I wanted to go in blind and see if all the praise was funded.

I can't stand it, its driving me fucking crazy. This game takes the originals story  and stretches it out sooooo much with so much garbage padding. So much of the game is just walking in a straight line coming to a stop to slowly crawl into a tight space. Hold down on some lever, click a button on the other side of the room to progress, or solve some puzzle made for a 5 year old. 

The average loop of this game is. Story segment, walk around ""Gameplay"" thats basically just a controllable   cinematic so why not make it one. fight, Loop of (hallway segment, fight, puzzle ) x number of times. Boss. 

The pacing of the original story is ruined for the sake of saying its a 60 hour game. The cancerous 1 dollar = 1 hour of gameplay mindset where everything needs to be 100 hours long, This is the type garbage you get.

FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE INTERGRADE, the enhanced and expanded version of the critically acclaimed FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE, is a testament to Square Enix's commitment to delivering a truly immersive and unforgettable gaming experience. Building upon the foundation laid by the original release, INTERGRADE introduces new content, technical enhancements, and visual upgrades that further elevate this iconic journey through Midgar.

Visually, FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE INTERGRADE is nothing short of breathtaking. The character models, environments, and spell effects are all rendered with incredible attention to detail. The upgrade to 4K resolution and the addition of ray tracing on supported platforms enhance the overall visual fidelity, bringing the city of Midgar to life in ways that were previously unimaginable.

The narrative remains the heart of the experience, and INTERGRADE continues to tell the story of Cloud Strife and his companions with the same level of depth and emotional resonance. The characters are brought to life by stellar voice acting, and the expanded content, including the INTERmission episode featuring Yuffie Kisaragi, provides additional layers to the overall narrative. Yuffie's perspective offers a fresh take on familiar events, and her dynamic with new characters adds both humor and intrigue.

Combat, a highlight of the original release, has been further refined and polished in INTERGRADE. The real-time action seamlessly blends with strategic elements, allowing players to switch between characters and utilize their unique abilities in the heat of battle. The addition of new materia and weapon upgrades adds depth to character customization, giving players more agency in shaping their preferred playstyle.

The music, a key element of the FINAL FANTASY series, continues to be a standout feature. Nobuo Uematsu's iconic compositions are faithfully reimagined, and the emotional impact of the music is heightened by the game's stunning visuals and narrative moments. The sound design, including the voice work and environmental effects, contributes to the overall immersive experience.

One of the significant additions in INTERGRADE is the introduction of Photo Mode, allowing players to capture and share their favorite moments from the game. This feature, coupled with the ability to transfer save files from the PlayStation 4 version, encourages both newcomers and returning players to relive and document their adventures in Midgar.

While FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE INTERGRADE offers an exceptional experience, it's worth noting that the narrative is only a portion of the complete FINAL FANTASY VII Remake project. Some players may find themselves eagerly anticipating future installments to witness the full scope of the story.

In conclusion, FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE INTERGRADE is a must-play for fans of the original and newcomers alike. With its stunning visuals, enhanced gameplay, and expanded narrative, it stands as a shining example of how to re-imagine a classic while staying true to its roots. Square Enix has not only captured the essence of the original FINAL FANTASY VII but has set a new standard for the future of the series.",1703649637,1703649637,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I played a bunch of Final Fantasy games when I was a kid... 
FF Tactics, FF8, FF9, FFX, FFX-2, FF12, etc.  But one game I always wanted to play, but never played was FF7.  I knew that Crisis Core was a prequel to the events in FF7 but was released after FF7, but figured since I hadn't played either, I would start with the Crisis Core Reunion.  I started this game after finishing that, and I feel as if I've gotten a unique perspective on my first FF7 Remake playthrough because of that.

Fantastic - you need to do this game once in your life!!!
See my profile for more details about my reviews.

Additional notes: it is really hard for me to judge this game, and review it objectively. I actually don't think I can. If I made the effort to, THIS specific game, called FFVII REMAKE, would probably get a A- (85-88%). Which is honestly a great rating already, so you know what to expect. If you never played a JRPG, you can try this one without hesitation, it is very good!

Okay now back to the people who KNOW the original game: unfortunately, as I said, I can't judge FFVII objectively anymore. Let's put it simply: FFVII is in my opinion the best FF of all time, and I played almost every FF since FF1 up to FF15 - the 13th is the only one I have left to do, because 11 and 14 are mmorpgs, and 16 is not out yet for me). FF7 is the best one ever on so many levels: lore, narration, story, characters, music, world, gameplay (materias), arch enemy, length, symbology, ethical messages... the list is just huge. Now, I was anxious with this one, because FF7 is one of the best games of all time for me, but at the same time it got old, it is ugly (the 3D parts mind you), clunky, slow... technology caught up. I was full of apprehension regarding what they could do to this game - I had almost 80% fear that they would ruin it, and 19% disbelief they could do anything great, just an okay RPG, differently done.... the remaining 1%, I could not believe it, but they did it: they replaced the original one. I really think now FFVII gets mashed together in my head between the original one and this one. Unless they completely mess up the 2 and 3 of this remake trilogy, if they keep the bar like this in terms of content and quality, I believe FFVII Remake/Rebirth/Rewhatever will simply replace the original one just because it is the updated, thoroughly re-established modern version of this original masterpiece. That is why I judge FFVII Remake a masterpiece, albeit a S- one, just for a few things (some weird jokes, a hard mode that is arguably problematic in terms of design - let's remove the items and the refill of MPs... why?), some flaws here and there. But if you played FFVII back in the day, and always wanted 25 years later to relive this masterpiece, through a new eye, with THOUSANDS of winks at you, like a love letter, so many reminiscent easter eggs, so many tributes, then you should play and enjoy this game. For the first couple of hours I was not very happy with the choice they made for the fights (real time + ultra slow pausing mode to select stuff)... now I can not help but thinking that is the best choice they could do and it is amazingly well implemented. So dynamic, so active, yet so faithful to the original turn by turn style of the old school jrpgs. Old the characters are back, and more, and if back in the day they spent X time on each, now they spend 10, 20, 50 times X on EACH character, even minor (Jesse, Biggs and Wedge! oh my god!) to give them depth, meaning, to create a layer of threads in this new narration and lore where everything makes so much more sense... just WOW. And the levels, the rooms, the graphic and illustration choices, did you see some screenshots? I spent my first run just WALKING, enjoying EACH room for the generosity of the graphics and visuals. So RICHLY done. Amazing.

FF15 had started a new trend in the series I was surprisingly happy with, and now I am full of expectation for FF16, and also I can not wait for Rebirth and the 3rd opus. Final Fantasy is not dead, it is strong and alive!",1703468647,1703469020,True,23,0,0.630066096782684326,2,True,False,False

To anyone wanting to play, its not a bad game but it completely ruins the ogs pace that has a mystery to it, the remake just spoils a lot early on. Not to mention it's just the Midgar section which is 5 hours in the og at best. Og was also split to 3 discs like the games will be into 3 seperate games, but the first disc finished way after leaving Midgar so either they'll have to rush the next 2 a bit or make them extremely long. It's obvious they wanted to add more detail but giving about 40 hours for a game that only covers about only 5 hours in the og is too much. Play the og first if you want to experience ff7 right. The graphics are old but it's still playable, and if you want you can add mods for it. I don't prefer to because I think it takes away the nostalgia but that's just my opinion. If you want the true experience play the og first, not the remake. After that though, as more of a sequel, it's not bad.",1703435775,1703435775,False,1,1,0.425074517726898193,0,True,False,False

There is a lot to like here, from much more fleshed out characters and interactions, to great combat and plenty of nods and references to other games in the FF7 universe. The combat in particular is the highlight here, and while it took a little to get used to it really does flow very well as a hybrid action/classic RPG. In addition to the the weapon system that they implemented is great and really allows you to pick the play style you prefer while keeping every weapon relevant. My only complaint on the combat side of things is that there just aren't enough slots for materia, even by the end of the game I felt like I couldn't really get the exact build that I wanted.

Now on to my big problems with this game. There is so much extra padding and time wasting that its criminal. By the end of the game I was so incredibly tired of slowly crawling between object or pulling levers. It's a special kind of bad when you have to sit still for a few seconds waiting for the button prompt to then be forced to watch a character go through a 5-10 second animation, and then be forced to do it again 30 seconds later. All of that would be more palatable though if the story flowed better, but you can tell immediately every time the devs changed the story to sidetrack you and stretch out the games length. There are sections where the pacing is great and engaging, only for a door to shut in your face requiring you to spend the next 30-40 minutes detouring through a bland environment chasing whatever macguffin will let you get to the next major story beat from the original game. Or when the game removes the run option as you painfully and slowly follow an npc around while they monologue at you. 

Slight spoilers ahead if you've never played the original game

The worst offender though  is when the game comes to a screeching halt in the last  stretch of the game when Cloud and company are forced to nicely go along with a guided tour of the Shinra building culminating in watching a literal Shinra propaganda add for what feels like 5 minutes. It's bad enough that instead of assaulting the Shinra building you are quite nicely gathering key cards to politely open doors and climb the building, but sitting there watching a Shinra puff piece made me feel like I had gone insane. Why are these eco terrorists taking the time to do all of this. It's asinine.

Fortunately it gets back to the interesting fun bits, but there's so much room for improvement. At the end of the day though the combat really does a lot of heavy lifting for this game. I do recommend it, but not wholeheartedly. The intermission dlc that is included actually had very few of these problems and hopefully indicates that the sequels will move into a much better direction.",1703362650,1703362650,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have always preferred to play on PC than on PS, just because I can be clumsy with console so (takes me longer to complete) this is a dream come true for me. The storyline, characters, gameplay and quests were fun and worth the time to complete though I wish we could skip some scenes after reading dialogue instead of letting it drag on. Also, it takes away some fun when you can only play as a party of maximum 3 and not all of them at once. The variety of bosses and enemies/monsters to fight make it somewhat interesting but would have been nice to have a bigger party. If you play lots of RPG, you would find it easy to pick up weapons without buying them, and you get extra skillpoints through sidequest and buying from the kid.

When SE teased this game, I was both scared and excited and was hoping they would do it right and not mess it up. At that time, SE was making A LOT of terrible decisions so I did not have any confidence in this game when it was first teased. When first footage of gameplay showed up, my feelings were still mixed. While the game looked incredible, I was not happy with the choice to go with the action based gameplay vs the turn based traditional gameplay. Eventually, the game released and I still did not buy it. Then I heard some story spoilers online that I was extremely upset with. I did not like what SE did here at all. So I chose not to buy the game period. Ultimately, the game would end up on PC, first on the Epic Games Store which kinda ticked me off. But then it finally got to Steam. When it went on sale, I bought it but held off playing it for a year or so. This year, I decided to muster up the courage and get over my damn self and just play the damn game. After all, I could not resist it forever. I went into it with cautious expectations.

I now have 244 hours on this game. I played it over and over again, beating it over and over again. I enjoyed and I love this game to bits. I have learned my lesson and will no longer listen to Internet haters. The things that I originally hated and was worried about ended turning into things I would ultimately love about this game. Although traditional JRPG turn-based combat will always be my favorite combat system; I loved this action based combat system. This is the most refined action based JRPG combat system I have ever played. I looked into it and I saw that the developers of this game also developed Final Fantasy XIII. I know that the FFXIII series of games were generally not liked among the fanbase but I actually loved XIII. The devs took everything they knew from this games and refined them to near perfection in this game. It feels weird to have such a fast paced action game and yet still be able to take your time when selecting commands. It is just so good. Story-wise, despite what the haters say, it is actually VERY faithful to the original game. So much so, it's quite surprising. There is obviously so much respect for the original source material. They were able to make a game faithful to the original, add bits and pieces in between with new characters and new scenes, and then complete changes that in my opinion don't hurt the story. The things that I knew were already going to happen due to being spoiled long ago worried me but when I got to that point in the story (the final chapter), I was totally on board with it. The people long ago who complained about this did not provide further context, why, and most importantly, how things turned out this way. Just goes to show you that you can't listen to what whiners say. So the thing that happened at the end ended up making so much sense to me and after seeing the bigger picture, the whole thing in this entirety - I finally get why Square chose to go this route instead of making a 1 to 1 remake. At that point, I was totally on board and my faith in SE had finally been restored. I have so much faith in them, I am ONLY excited for Rebirth - I am not worried in any way whatsoever with how that game will turn out. There are so many good things I can say about this game but this review has already gone on long enough. If I decide to tell you everything I love about this game, this review will be a couple pages long.

Overall, if you are a fan of the original game and you have been holding out to play this one, I urge you to give it a chance. It is an absolutely marvelous experience! 9.8/10!!!",1703248554,1703248554,True,2,0,0.506997287273406982,0,True,False,False

I think Square(soft) was right to try something original with the game, instead of just copy/pasting the OG. For the time being, it is far too early to judge if this choice was wise or not. Personally, I would like them to pay a slight homage to Xenogears, as there are some parallels in the themes (it was intended to be FF7 and the devs adknowledged it through easter eggs).

The gameplay is fluid, even if the audio stuttering definitely needs a fix (even if it can be circumvented with mods/tweaks). In any case, the pure joy of experiencing Midgar in 3d is pure joy. For $40 you get the main game + dlc. Worth it in every way.

For newcommers, I would encourage you to play the original version first ($7-13). Yes, it's 25 years old, yes the graphics haven't aged that well (it was allready a main issue back in the days 2d vs 3d). Give it some time and you will be hooked.

A lot of fans credit the original FF7 as being this incredible jrpg with a well written and fantastic story.  The reality is that it was mediocre, at best.  It was fun, and I enjoyed it at the time of its release but it was successful because of; graphics and cut-scenes, being a PS1 and PC release (I still have the PC disks), and had a fun turn-based combat system that utilized a unique magic system.

The original writing was okay enough to keep you engaged but really relied on pretty graphics rather than telling a compelling tale or have characters with depth.  A character got back-stabbed, not the players.  That was the original.

Now here we are with the ‘Remake’ that relies heavily on nostalgia rather than talented writing or storytelling.  I truly wonder if the writers are really that devoid of skill or talent or if they let AI take the reins.  Also, this should be relabeled to something like: “Final Fantasy VII 1/3rd Suppositor-Remake”.  The Arseholes like Todd Howard and those who work at Square-Enix want to charge $120-$150 per game, or more.  Since there’s been a lot of push back on that, they instead charge $60-$70 per title, but with half or less content than there use to be in a game’s full release (plus charge for ‘DLC’).

You used to be able to expect ~60-80 hours of play time to fully or mostly experience a jrpg title (if there was no new game plus).  Now you might get 20-25 hours.  Greatly decreased quality and content, Greatly increased profits and malice towards their fan base.  Which leads into my next rant about the combat and who they designed it for.

There’s an easy and normal setting that both have a standard or classic setting.  The primary difference between the standard and classic setting is that, when playing under classic, your characters; attack and defend on their own and roll around on the ground like pricks to dodge attacks.  The only thing you do is select and ‘extra’ option to use an item, ability or magic when an ‘action bar’ fills up.  The game essentially just plays itself without much need for the player to do any input.  If you turn off ‘classic mode’ then you simply button mash or hold down attack and you can also roll around on the ground like a prick.  You can switch to other characters but only control one at a time, AI plays the game for you.  A ret**ded fish monkey could play this without much issue.

People pay Square top dollar for this trash and herein is the problem.  This is a ‘game’ (if you can even call it that) designed for those who have trouble not breathing out of the same orifice that they eat from.  Square has literally dumbed down their games, combat systems and ‘lack thereof storytelling’ to accommodate their fanbase.  If you’re incredulous look no further than the numerous positive single sentence ‘reviews’ that typically go: “baught for tifaz yabbos”.  I use to joke around about intelligence being a dump stat but, damn, someone ‘learned these people gudder’.  

So, here we are with yet another garbage AAA title that can be compared with other refuse such as Starfield or any yearly COD release.

So long a Square can keep dumbing it down and charging more; so long as players incapable of doing anything other than nip*ling prime, and then breath, and then button mash, keep paying for this; they will continue to give you less for more.

I’ll leave you with this quandary:  I wonder if the AI-I mean, writers for Square-Enix wrote themselves as Shinra, bleeding the players, I mean planet dry of money, I mean Mako?

The game is a visual masterpiece, complemented by an amazing soundtrack. The vivid graphics and immersive audio truly enhance the gaming experience. You may want to keep your finger on the F12 button to capture many of the epic moments!

Gameplay and Combat Mechanics:
Each character's unique moveset adds depth to the gameplay. For example, Tifa's agility and physical prowess, coupled with her ATB Boosts, make her an invaluable team member, adaptable as both a fighter and a supporter. Cloud's balanced physical and magical attacks also stand out. The variety in weapons and materia allows for diverse and enjoyable builds.

Memorable Battles: 
Key fights, such as those with Reno, Rude, and Rufus, are particularly memorable and the amount of work that was put it is truly noticeable.

Difficulty and Challenges
The Hard difficulty offers a satisfying challenge, with stronger enemies and new obstacles in Intergrade. Yuffie’s gameplay is a highlight, especially when mastering her sync with Sonon. Her ability to dodge and imbue attacks with spells is a game-changer. Their playthrough on hard has really displayed the power of some of the support materia such as, Parry and Deadly Dodge.

Story and Progression
The story has its highs and lows. The whispers, in my opinion, detract from some of the action-packed sequences, such as storming the tower. Additionally, the extended areas such as the train graveyard reminded me somewhat negatively of Final Fantasy XIII's pacing.

Gameplay Balance
The game doesn't require much grinding, except for specific battles, DLC content, and mini-games. However, certain limitations, like the capped blue materia and the restrictions on summons, can be a bit disappointing.

Summons and Limit Breaks
Summons like Ifrit, Leviathan, and Bahamut add a thrilling element to tougher fights, though their usage is limited. The reset of limit breaks after each fight, while understandable, was a bit of a letdown.

Linear Progression
The story's linear progression and the inability to return to previous locations are a notable departure from traditional open-world RPGs. However, this is inline with the first CD of FF7 and I am super hyped for Rebirth!

Conclusion
Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade is a game of contrasts. Its stunning visuals, engaging combat, and memorable characters are offset by some narrative and gameplay choices that may not appeal to everyone. Despite its flaws, it offers a unique and enjoyable experience, especially for those who appreciate strategic combat and character customisation.

I love it, best game I've played all year. Materia system is good, battle system feels flushed out and takes more than just running in blind, dig the upgrade system. Love the voice acting and watching the how character development plays out. 

Great PC port as well, playing on Keyboard/Mouse is very functional but I do imagine that a controller would be way better. Need to buy one asap!

This one makes the characters feel more alive and real, delves deeper into the world building, combat it WAY more fun and engaging, I never had an issue with feeling like i needed to grind at all, overall this is an outstanding game.

I went into this thinking ""Well, I'm curious what the hype is about and it's on sale so I might as well give it a try. I probably won't be a huge fan, though."" And now here I am approximately 3 days later, just having beat the game, with both the original and Crisis Core newly sitting in my library. I feel like that says enough. As far as specifics go, the characters are phenomenal, and I thought the story was really good too, even though I'm not a fan of games heavily relying on sequels. The ending didn't make much sense but for now I'm going to assume that's because of my lack of knowledge of the original—although for a game clearly advertised towards newcomers to the series, there's definitely a lot I didn't understand. Hopefully they fix that with the sequels, but we can only wait and see I suppose. Visually, I don't need to say anything. It's one of the best looking games out there and the music is just as good. Gameplay wise I actually enjoyed the combat much more than I thought I would, but action games aren't really my thing so I played on easy so I could focus on the story. My biggest gripe with this game is that it sends you through way too many convoluted sequences of running around, solving puzzles, and fighting mobs just to the next plot point. There's a sequence like this in every chapter and it gets really annoying after a while. I assume this is to pad out the runtime since they needed to make a full game out of however many hours of the original, but I think there are other ways they could've done it that aren't a pain in the ass to play. Aside that, though, I had a really good time with this game and I'd recommend picking it up while it's on sale. 8/10.",1702903638,1702903638,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I like the yuffie side story and glad her and vincent are getting more character development then original where they where optional characters etc.  It is gonna  be interesting to see how yuffie over comes her trauma after what happen to sonon death because of nero, since new trailers show her running from jenova with cloud grabbing her, Since she tied more with deep ground like vincent. She probably gonna be on edge around him to(creepy) so more healing as she slowly warms up to everyone and her soon to be friend vincent which ties with them in dirge of cerebus time line/friends  team work.  Also Vincent taking over sonon spot as a friend for yuffie can see if they continue to do more side story with deep ground with yuffie along with vincent tagging along with her.  etc

For 10 years I had this hype of them making a remake, it took a crazy long time but finally I could play it.
There has been a lot of criticism, and I get some of that, as in:
*A lot of parts where added from the original title - which is more than fine, but most of them are truly not necessary
*They added multiple passage/references to events that you would only see much later in the original game - which makes me worry that they will not include them in the Parts 2 and 3...
*The game is extremely linear...It truly makes me think of FF13, you simply have no liberty - nevertheless when thinking about it, in the original game, you're not that free in Midgar either...Let's see how much liberty they will give us in the following parts
*Red 13 is not playable...?! How? Why? I simply don't understand that part, you can play with anyone but him...
*Hopefully it's because that's only the first part, but you have space for maybe 18 materia but at best I could get about 12 of them...but most of the time only about 8
Let's see how they will build the following two parts, but looking as it took a 30h game to play only Midgar which is 10% of the original game, I'm very scared they will skip a lot of things unfortunately...
I realize this is a lot of criticism, but the game is very much worth it, it was a real pleasure playing it and they nailed many scenes which was fantastic!",1702828236,1702828236,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are some good additions to extend the story that was present in the original. The voice acting is good, I'm playing in English the Cloud sounds great (albeit just a male version of Lightning, every line he delivers sounds exactly like Lightning in FFXIII XD!)

Now what annoys me is, Normal (Classic) doesn't work as a difficulty. It let me play Classic for the first 3 tutorial combats and then it switched it to the regular, button mash combat style. This combat is simple, but I want to play on the Classic mode not on this version. I am someone who loves my turn based RPGs, and when it comes to action based combat I fat finger so bad T_T. I find myself staring at the menu instead of the whole screen with this type of combat. Devs, please fix the Classic mode to work! T_T

Next the AI in combat is absolutely STUPID! On the first boss, Barret was controlled by the AI and it does it's laser and he doesn't hide behind the cover... WTF. The AI controlled characters also will not use their ATB automatically, I don't know if you can set up tactics to tell them to just yet, but why is it not a default setting to have them use their abilities? 

The dialogue is somewhat alright, they have left some original dialogue but they have done weird things with the interactions and dialogue. For example, Tifa tells you to hang out with Marlene while she finishes up some stuff, you go to talk to Marlene and Marlene runs away and says, ""Daddy told me never to talk to strangers."" Barrett and Marlene leave, you go back to Tifa she says, ""So what can I get you?"" 

Next at two hours into the game, I have to progress the main story by completing SIDE QUESTS! The padding in this game is insane. 

I'll try to finish this game since I've already passed the 2 hour mark (I just put in my request for a refund, lets see if I can get my money back), but this is going to be so hard T_T. I hate the combat so much, it isn't even strategic or exciting, it just completely boring.

Play the original, or download Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis on Steam and enjoy the story for free (using the complete original dialogue) with the new beautiful graphics on super cute hi-res chibis instead of the low-poly chibis of the original.

I dont understand how SE can be this bad of a developer that they can't be arsed to fix their game, also note there's hardly any graphical options apart from character display amount.
textures and shadows only have a ""High"" or ""Low"" option
This game runs on UE4 and there's numerous tweaks out there including a hook that allows players to tweak their settings as they should be allowed to.
But alas it makes no difference, the biggest impact was setting the game to d3d11 but this only fixed the issue until I reached Wall Market.

Leaving this negative review for whoever cares, SE stopped development on this game and does not plan on releasing any patches. Ironically the only patch they released changed the .exe file so you literally have to downgrade the game to be able to change its settings (via the hook some kind modder developed)

It looks and sounds great, the combat is the most fun version of the ATB system I have played.  I binged this game and then immediately started a hard mode playthrough which was even more fun, basically NG+ with no items.

Only a couple complaints.  The side quests feel like fluff, a little time wastey.  I only did them because I was worried to miss out on XP.

My other complaint is regarding items.  The game is littered with them and you will likely only use a tiny fraction of them.  Many of them are redundant, some are unnecessary and they cost ATB to use in battle.  It is also annoying and distracting to be forced to deviate from the right path constantly to check every chest for valuables (but will probably get a potion instead.)  Hard mode makes you unable to use items at all, which is great!  It makes you learn the materia system inside and out and squeeze every drop of utility out of it.  It feels like the best version of the game to me.  However, even though you can't use items in hard mode, they aren't removed from the game either. So you will end up with a full inventory of stuff you can't touch.  Their only use is to be sold for money to buy materia but you will probably already have all the money you need since hard mode is basically NG+.

That said, this is a good game and worth playing. I'm not a huge Final Fantasy fan and haven't played many other games from the series. In fact the only other one that I played was FFXV, which I enjoyed. As a life-long gamer though, I'm very familiar with the franchise of course and the characters from this game are some of the best-known and most popular. I never played the original FF7. 

I always use KB+M when I can rather than controller. Spec is 13700k CPU, RTX 4080, M2 SSD and 32GB RAM played at 1440p and I played this in 2023. Just stating all of this so that people with similar set-ups can get some context.

[u]The Good[/u]
[list]
[*]Well would you look at that: A triple-A game that doesn't have loads of game-breaking bugs!
[*]I enjoyed the fighting style that they've come up with, a sort of compromise between real-time fighting and turn-based. It means that you can utilise all your characters quickly and easily during the fight. Once you get used to it, everything flows smoothly.
[*]All the characters have got unique fighting styles, which makes you want to use each character at different times depending upon the fight or boss.
[*]The story is relatively enjoyable. It even made a modicum of sense compared to FFXV.
[*]The graphics are really good. They haven't gone for a photo-realistic look but the style is very distinctive. It feels like a Final Fantasy game. Tifa never looked better at 4K.
[*]Some people have reported FPS drops. I had no issues at all though and everything flowed at 60fps without taxing my graphics card particularly hard. There was occasional micro-stutter but nothing that was particularly distracting and nothing that impacted key moments during fights.
[*]The sound is also good. The actors do a great job even though some of the lines are super-cheesy! The music is also good as well and reminiscent of other Final Fantasy entries.
[*]Although cheesy, the characters are nice to spend time with as well. I wish some other companies (Ubisoft cough, cough) realised that we don't want characters that are deliberately grating all the time.
[*]Chapter 9 is going to drive the transphobes nuts and that makes me happy!!!
[*]Although it's clearly a console port, KB+M support has been well implemented. I had no problem whatsoever playing with the KB+M except on the motorcycle sections where I needed to use Auto Hotkeys (for some reason you can't rebind the throttle)
[*]It's a long game. You get your money's worth (though note the later points on padding)
[*]It has cats in it.
[/list]

[u]The Neutral[/u]
[list]
[*]There are a LOT of boss fights. There must be 25-30 throughout the game. If you like boss-fights then you'll love this. However, I felt there were so many that they no longer became an event and, at the worst times, they felt like a chore. There must have been 7-8 bosses in the final two chapters alone.
[*]It's a console port so there are hours upon hours upon hours of cut scenes. However some of them are excellent so I didn't mind as much as I normally would, and most are less than 5 minutes long. No 1-2 hour long exposition cut-scenes [i]a la[/i] Hideo Kojima.
[*]It's a console port so the menus and ability/updgrade screens aren't great. Your mouse won't work on them for example.
[/list]

[u]The Bad[/u]
[list]
[*]I haven't played the original FF7 so can't say for sure but some of the chapters felt like padding. It got repetitive to be honest and I ended up taking a long break from the game about 2/3rds of the way through. It was easy to get back into the game when I did return though.
[*]The bosses are bullet-sponges and some take an age to kill. You don't really need a lot of skill to beat them and I defeated most on the first attempt. I think the Hell House (yes, at one point you fight a house!) was the hardest and even that only took 3 attempts. However, I didn't want to bump the difficulty level up by another notch because the idea of having to go through the same battle for another 30 minutes if you die at the last gasp wasn't appealing.
[*]You can't rebind the keys in game for the motorcycle sections (or at least I couldn't find where you could do this)
[*]It's a depressing reminder that Square Enix are really good at developing games when they focus on that instead of grifting and NFT nonsense. How they have fallen!

The original is one of my favorite games of all time. This Remake Intergrade is part of trilogy and only contains the Midgar part of the story. I didn't know that it only contains the beginning of the original story and was very very disappointed when i saw the end screen after leaving Midgar. 

This is one of the best games i have played in the recent history, i could play for 6 hours in one sitting which is rare for me nowadays. It has all the character's i used to love as a kid, RedXII was my personal favorite as a kid and its a shame i didn't get to play with him as party member, maybe in the next part of the trilogy i'll get to party with RedXIII.

The combat system in this remake was changed from the originals turn-based combat to more modern real-time combat which is done quite well. The AI of party members is ok, although i would like to have more control over the AI in combat and change the AI behavior. Now i felt like i need to micro manage them all the time and sometimes they seemed to use skills i didn't want them using and would have preferred them saving the actions for more useful things. You can skip between your party members during combat and can control whoever you like. One really good thing about the AI is that while exploring the world they do great job at staying out of your way unlike in some other games.

I remember seeing some articles about the PC port having poor performance which wasn't the case for me and the issues seemed to be fixed. The highest mode is 120 FPS limit, which is more then enough for single player game in my opinion. With my PC i was hitting the cap of 120 fps 99% of the time. Didn't get any crashes, very stable game.

I played this game on Linux Mint 21.2(kernel 6.2), 4k/165Hz screen, GPU:AMD Radeon RX 7900XTX, CPU:AMD 5950X, 32GB Ram, game installed on PCIe 4 SSD.

I've played the original 4 or 5 to completion, and love just about every part.

This game is not a FF7 remake, it's just an obnoxiously expanded midgar... 

While I would have enjoyed seeing more of the city districts, you stay in the same places for 2-3x as long, which personally felt like a slog.

What was lost

Gone- the beautiful sweeping landscapes

Gone- the culmination of world changing event

Gone- half of the playable characters

What we get in it's place

A ton of pointless filler quests

Very few materia, specifically summons

Pointless banter with characters and bosses who won't matter (leaving Midgar)

A very poor ""active"" rpg system where you mostly mash auto attack waiting on cooldowns (like a slow mmo)

A weird weapon enhancement system in place of character customization

Summons that are bad

Overall, it's very expensive for just chapter 1, and at this rate, the whole series would be 6+ installments.

Pass unless you've never played the original

~~~
Some good things

The game is very pretty

Minor characters have more interactions (Biggs, Wedge, Jessie, etc) which is overall good, but some characters that got this treatment are not worth the time. 


Each character feels distinctly different to control in combat

Enemies are more complex

More meaningful interactions with core characters

I'm really torn here. I think my thumbs down is due to my mismatched expectations for what I was looking for in a game. Not that its inherently a bad game.

My biggest beef is a result of not paying closer attention to other reviews. I was hoping to come into an expanded, and remastered FF7. And visually, that's absolutely what it is. Its gorgeous, and I love the greater depth to the early story. 

But the gameplay just does not resonate with me. Now, that's not necessarily a bad thing (generally). Everyone has the style they like, but I was hoping and expecting the ""old"" style turn-based-ish combat. The running and frantic button mashing just isn't my jam. It looks amazing, but quickly became tedious and mildly frustrating for me.

As a vaguely interactive movie, its awesome. As a game, its a bit of a drag.

I fell in love with Aerith, and it was heartbreaking to watch her die. So let's just say that Squaresoft deciding to do this remake is the best decision they have ever made. 

The Game. 

The game is quite phenomenal, bringing back the old feel of the original. Somehow hard to believe, but they managed. The music, the cutscenes, the voice acting, all phenomenal. 

My complaints are with some things that I just find cheesy, annoying, etc. For instance, the tool basket on the red motorcycle that was from soldier. Goof ball garbage over the top crap. Why put that filth in the game?? Also, the questing got annoying, as I HATE the whole ""fetch these three things and bring them back to me"" crap, but compared to other games, it was kept very minimal. I guess I really can't complain too much. 

One of the maddening things, is they will bring you into a new area, force you to move forward with the camera, all the while, you are walking past and missing a valuable item.... So, instead of being able to move fwd when you come out of the cutscene / story, you have to turn around and go back for that chest etc. that you were just forced to pass up. I dislike this, it seems they are trying to make you miss ALL KINDS OF GOODS on purpose. Personally, I find this ridiculous, as I don't want to have to use a damn walkthrough to make sure I get all the weapons etc. that should not be concealed in the game. I missed ""stealing"" Aerith's weapon from the boss fight, also missed paying 10,000 to the guy in the library and getting Barrett's final weapon. This kind of thing is maddening, but now I realize that you can replay ""chapters,"" so maybe not that big of deal. It was a HUGE deal back in the day on PS..... 

PC Port:
I played this on PC. And as far as everyone claiming that it was a half A**#D lame port to PC, I have to disagree. I did run the game in DX11, and I experienced absolutely no stutters, glitches, or other ilk whatsoever. It was flawless. 

That being said, the characters are ""blurry."" I do not understand why. Is it because the level of detail being rendered clearly was not achievable on Playstation 4/5??? Now we have guys releasing texture packs that greatly enhance the resolution, clarity etc. of the game. Well, thankfully on PC these things will be able to be installed and used in the future. 

Overall, graphics wise, it's phenomenal. Very please that this release was made, and that it is available on PC. Can not wait for the sequel!

P.S. Squaresoft could take notes from Capcom on textures, voice over speech being accurately represented by the mouth, and quality of atmosphere in general. While I realize the scope of FF7 remake was HUGE in comparison to Capcom's Resident Evil 2, I do believe I have not been impressed more by any other game. RE2 was 10 notches above the competition in unbelievable polish, quality, and immersion. To have seen this Final Fantasy 7 remake done with this care, it would have been unbelievable. 

Maybe the sequel will be better????

Call me a milf cause man, i love Final Fantasy.

GAMEPLAY:
FF7R was my first JRPG that I've played that had real time turn based combat. I know it's not a new concept, but as my introduction to this type of format, wow. I was blown away. I cannot stress this enough, but the combat is so cool. Being able to slow-mode a skill menu, while actually hack and slashing outside of that window gave a perfect balance between rapid-fire action and remaining faithful to a ""turn-based"" system. Need a breather to take a moment and think about your option select? Open the combat menu mid-fight. Don't need to? Mash the inputs that'll get you to the skill you want to select and the battle flow remains uninterrupted. The quick-swap character system allows you to swap between Cloud, Tifa, and Barret (and sometimes Aerith), allowing you to min-max your damage output and change up the pace of the game if you so desired. Every character boasts their own unique movesets, with Cloud having his signature buster sword, Tifa being an up-close and personal brawler, Barret being a machine gun simulator, and Aerith specializing in magic. While you select one of the playable characters, your other team members are controlled by AI. Admittedly, this system isn't perfect, as the damage is not optimized, nor do you have full control of your party at all times. Thankfully, your autonomy as the player is more than enough to clear any difficult battle, and there aren't any consequences for rapidly swapping between your roster.

The game also gives you plenty of autonomy with building your characters, and the skill tree system is near-perfect, allowing you to truly polish the skills you value the most. Do you value survivability? Raw damage output? Speed? Being able to have more accessories equipped? The game gives you full control of what you want to invest in. Me personally, I'm a numbers kind of guy so I appreciated the game allowing me to just become as powerful as possible <3

The gameplay outside of combat consists of going from Point A to Point B in the world, and the occasional odd mini-game. Exploration is present in this game, but is not a core part of the gameplay as the game is pretty linear in structure and has limited movement options apart from walking, running, and climbing up ladders. I'd love to see a greater emphasis on exploration, and movement options catered for it in the future games of this trilogy (please Square Enix at least give us a jump button)!

Also I need to address the motorcycle riding sequence in the game. This is personal. WOW. It sure was surprising to see when I first experienced it in game, and it was so cool. It was one of the moments during my playthrough that made me realize that what I was playing was truly something special. It's not even a significant concept in the game, as it only appears twice, but it's one of so many small aspects that make the whole of the game that FF7R is so amazing. That one motorcycle boss fight near the end of the game sucked, though. LOL.

NARRATIVE:
You'll hear this about a lot of Final Fantasy games, but it's because it's true. The story is in fact, quite amazing! As this game is part one out of three games, you can't actually talk about the entire narrative here. But what Square Enix has done with Midgar from the original FF7 game is astounding. The game devs have breathed so much life into this remake, and the segment of a game that used to be Midgar has become fully fleshed out, and feels like a real and believable world in a fantasy universe. One key difference in the remake is that the game allows you to get to know more about the side characters, such as Jesse and Biggs. The characters all feel real, so when something happens, you FEEL something. The story and character writing is phenomenal, and the beautiful and compelling setting of the game exponentially builds upon that.

GRAPHICS:
Cloud Strife is hot. Oh wait, um, I meant that the graphics are gorgeous. This is without a doubt, one of the most aesthetically pleasing games I've ever had the privilege of playing through. Just LOOK at the game. And the in-game cutscenes of the game are on a whole other level. When a cutscene played, it felt like I went from playing a video game to watching a cinematic experience at the theatres. I've never described a cutscene like that before (and this is HIGH praise), and I honestly never thought I would. But here we are! The game also had brilliant moments of transitioning between gameplay segments and cutscenes. There's a point in the game where you're playing as Cloud, fighting off a bunch of soldiers, and upon defeating them you realize that they've called backup. There are simply too many enemies for Cloud to fight, and you transition to a cutscene where he jumps off the side to land on top of a moving train. It's one thing for the game to be cool, but it also makes you feel cool for simply playing the game. W game.

SOUNDTRACK:
The amazing graphics, combat, and narrative all breathe life into this game. And the cherry on top of all this is the music. This game already made me feel things, and the music only made that worse <3. I could go on and on, but I'll just leave it at that. IT'S REALLY GOOD. I PROMISE.

OVERALL: 5/5

The game world so far looks great, and offers a deeper glimpse into the city of Midgar.

Growing up I played FF7 and loved it, saw it on offer and was so excited for it.

The non important NPCs looks like botox plastic models....I mean this is Square Enix we are talking about and they lost to Ubisoft's Assassins creed in this regard? shameful really.

The combat is a more manual FF13 ATB/stagger system. The swinging camera and all the effects flying everywhere makes it hard to make out whats happening half of the time. In this regard FF13 actually did it better with turn based ATB.

Im not sure if the cringey anime style acting fits the now more realistic looking characters. Everyone felt more like a caricature and unbelievable. Strange stiff actions and anime head tilts are everywhere, its hard to believe these characters are even alive. 

The nostalgia  magic is there but really, it feels hollow and soulless to me. I'm not even sure if i like or dislike this game enough to recommend it. Get it on offer and try it yourself.

Not only is there cutscenes galore, but even regular gameplay (not to mention boss fights) is constantly interrupted by cinematics. Then there are situations where the game for no apparent reason removes your ability to run and/or forces the camera in a particular direction. It's less pronounced in chapters where the game gets more open-world-like, but in story missions it's downright terrible. So much so, in fact, that for about half of the final boss fight you're relegated to watching the game fight on your behalf. WTF?!

Perhaps it's just me, but I find this so disruptive that it completely ruined the experience for me. Which is a shame because the other aspects of the game are actually really good. I like the story and the characters. The graphics are beautiful. And the voice acting is great, not only in the Japanese dub, but in the English dub as well.

I seriously doubt that I'll be playing the sequel unless the developers significantly reduced the cinematics.

I finished with all the trophies on the PS4 version and bought this to play Intergrade. This is going to be quite lengthy so if massive walls-of-text bother you, read the review above or below mine.

Final Fantasy 7 holds a beloved place in my heart as the game that really got me into JRPGs back on the first Playstation. The story was paced well, the characters were memorable, and the combat system was new and fresh to me. Keep in mind, games like Diablo 2, Twisted Metal, Age of Empires 2, and Civilization 2 were the standard I held games to at the time. When I played Final Fantasy VII at a friend's house I *begged* my parents for a Playstation for Christmas. They gave me one and the rest was history. I played FF7 for two years straight trying to find every little secret the game had hidden away until FF8 was released. With the background out of the way, let's review the remake shall we?

The game's opening cinematic opens up and reaches the point where we see Aerith. At this exact moment, the nostalgia hits *hard*. I hadn't started a modern game in so long where I was this excited to dive in. The graphics blew me away. The music conjured so many memories. I felt like I was in for one of hell of a ride and this kept up all the way until the end of the opening mission. I didn't mind the new combat. It felt natural and still felt deep enough that it's not just another action game.

But then the bombing mission ends. You're met with Sephiroth. An audible sigh escapes my lips. Since this is only supposed to cover Midgar, we shouldn't even *see* Sephiroth yet. We barely know his name by the end of Midgar, but okay. Expand away, I'll survive. Then I meet Aerith and we're met with the time ghost police and this is where I realize I'm not settling in for an epic retelling of a masterpiece. I'm about to get Kingdom Heart Nomura'd. All pretense has dropped and I'm no longer enjoying the game, but dreading just how much they were changing the story.

I have a love/hate relationship with this game overall because of reasons already stated, but the parts that are done well and written well are genuinely phenomenal. If we could have cut out every segment that didn't need to be in there (Train Graveyard ghost story, Leslie story, every single side quest... sorry, side job, mechanical hand puzzle, etc.), we'd definitely would have been able to get out of Midgar and see more of the world before part 2. There was so much excessive padding that it makes a modern Assassin's Creed game look tame.

The ending is atrocious. I won't go into detail to avoid major spoilers, but Nomura has no business directing any story. Period. His creative writing skills are comparable to the absolute drivel I was writing when I was 8. All he had to do was add on to an already existing story by fleshing out the dialogue and cutscenes and it would have been perfect, but he just couldn't help himself. He just had to go inserting his Kingdom Hearts nonsense into a story that doesn't need it.

With that negativity out of the way, when the game shines, it really burns bright. There were so many moments in the game where I was swept up in the nostalgia and being able to experience it with modern gaming standards. Despite loathing what they did with the story, I'm pumped to go back with Rebirth and experience more of the incredibly phenomenal moments from the original in full HD and voice acting though I'm sure there will be many moments where they changed events for the worse and I'll wince in pain.

TL;DR Despite butchering the original story, the parts they did well were so well done that I highly recommend the game to fans old and new. Though if you never experienced the original, I'd implore you to do so. It really is one of gaming's greatest achievements.",1701221338,1701221338,True,4,0,0.542580127716064453,2,True,False,False

Pros: 
Every moment feels like a celebration in this game, it feels like everything is just quite a lot extra, every boss fight has so many events and quite a lot have phase transition cutscenes, every small region has so much going for it and obviously if you liked advent children and you ever really wished for a game to feel like that movie, not in the sense of just graphical quality, but how every small conversation that would in other games be just a chatbox or voiced by grunts is completely voiced and animated, and also by how the party members react to so many things you do, even going around places to find treasure that clearly has nothing to do with the main quest, you got it. 
This is it, This is the most game translation into movie quality but still a game not just a narrative with less focus on gameplay like untill dawn you will ever get.

Cons:
This sadly will bring in the problem of so much money and time being put into those things that the game itself suffers a bit, enemy variety is good but not great, there's a lot of moments the game just pads out with side quests or side content that you can ignore but by losing amazing rewards that you just really will want to have. You can't go back to get these quests done out of their own chapter, only after finishing the game and going through chapter select.  Some of those quests are good or at leaast decent but some were really annoying me, especially the ones around just finding cats or kids really got into my nerves.

Overall it's a great game, but its a weird game, it's still very much worth playing, just be aware that it's not completely perfect as people might have you believe, the thing is just that while the weird padding and pacing problems from the side quest content is a downhill point for the game, everything else is so beyond all reason and extra that it brings it up on people's minds",1701186245,1701186245,True,26,0,0.721005678176879883,0,True,False,False

Technical:
*Visual stuttering/framedrops, usually when rotating camera or loading a new area
*Audio stutters like crazy when opening the weapon upgrade menu and in the Chapter 12 cutscenes
*Screen randomly turns white at times
(Pretty sure none of these are issues on console)

Game itself:
*The dozen or so headache cutscenes
*Party members blocking your way when you're trying to move
*Enemies scripted to interrupt you on the very frame you use an ability and you're not refunded MP/ATB
*Random boss cutscenes that waste stagger/Limit Breaks
*Forced walking areas
*Drawn out animations that don't let you open the menu like the benches
*Sephiroth's voice
*The weapon upgrade interface
*Having to keep switching layouts in Chapter 17
*Items don't really serve a purpose
*Accidentally turning off the minimap then forgetting the game has a minimap

Combat is flashy, colorful. Characters are expressive and life-like. Magic and special effects have a wow factor. Half a point deducted for common poor background textures such as walls, doors, city backdrops, nature, lots of flaws that can stick out.

Story/Dialogue (4/5) - Based on Japanese, the voice actors are generally good at portraying the characters. The English version is ruined by their attempt to sound 'anime' and overdoing it. With many more opportunities for interactions, they did a really good job with fleshing out Aerith, Yuffie, and some secondary characters. Dividing the game into parts is an odd choice, making the game feel incomplete even after dedicating dozens of hours to beat it. The story is changed a bit with an added theme of 'fate' that got shoehorned a bit awkwardly, coming across as very 'meta' to whoever played the original. The villain is treated poorly, showing up too frequently throughout the game. The lack of restraint kills the suspense and weakens his character.

Accessibility/Difficulty: Good, not a concern with distinct difficulty settings, the ability to pause and collect your thoughts, this game is friendly to all players.

Gameplay (4/5) - Very enjoyable gameplay loop that modernizes the turn-based combat with more interaction in between the turns, acting like a hybrid between action and turn-based combat, leaning more towards the latter. The high quality content is sadly not always present, with side quests and some main story sections feeling like they exist to stretch the game duration, which doesn't need to be any longer that it already is. The equipment and materia management system is rather tedious, especially as you transfer them from character to character. The excellent combat system makes up for it and helps make the least interesting sections enjoyable enough. I wish the game didn't encourage grinding so much (hinting how well you can maximize your characters if you grind), but playing on normal was accessible enough to beat it with very limited grinding.",1701135885,1701135885,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Whilst I think most of the things and chapters they added were great there were parts that I thought kinda dragged out for too long , or just slowed down the pace a bit too much . Like for example the train station chapter . 
The story changes they did kind of makes this not really a remake but a sequel since you have to have  knowledge of the original to some degree , but the effects of the changes don't really show them selves much in this game and will be more prevalent in the next iteration .
The combat is great . Although it takes time to master it . It gets really fun at subsequent play through as in new gen plus . Even though it doesn't look like it , it is quite deep. The dlc with puffy has the best combat out of any characters , even better than tifa's .
The soundtrack and voice acting (JP) were great . The new version of One winged angel was amazing .
Overall I'd give it a 8,5/10 .

I've always had my problems with the original because I thought the serious story clashed quite a bit with the more childish way a lot of the conversations between the protagonists were written. So I hoped that this remake could mature the dialogue, so it matches the great story. And it absolutely did!
I love the story of the game. It is very personal, has deep motives about enviromentalism and self-image and a lot of the characters are extremely likeable. 

BUT, and I regret to say this, I just cannot play this game for more than 2-3 hours without quitting. And the reason is the combat system. I just hate it.
It's some kind of weird hybrid between the more action orientated FF XVI (which I love) and the classic ATB pseudo Turn-based system (which I also love). 
I understand what the devs were trying to do. They tried to implement a more cinematic and involved combat style, without losing the identity of the ATB System. But it just doesn't work for me.
Your characters aren't responsive enough to really play it as an action combat game, all the menus in between really grind the flow of combat to straight hold and the new ATB system is just waiting around while running in a circle.
I know a lot of people enjoy the combat, I just don't.
Make it true action like FF XVI, or true oldschool. This in between just takes the worst of both worlds.

-literally every minor attack stuns you or cancels your attacks, but it feels like there is no attack or ability that cancels any enemy attack
-so many enemy attacks/spells happen off screen, especially boss fights, so you tend to just run in circles hitting dodge or holding block but still taking massive hits to otherwise unreadable and entirely unavoidable attacks

I still remember the advertisment i saw on Tv and even though i didnt know anything about the franchise i was mesmerized. Coincidentally my brother was about to buy a ps1 and asked me what games i'd like to have. And i settled for FF7 and Tekken.

Anyhow I personally didnt have much hype for the remake since i played almost all FF games and the newer ones (some bad FF13-13-2) and some okayish to good  (Lightning Returns, FF15). I didnt think they'd be able to pull it of. Luckily they did.

There are criticisims about how the story got kind of changed, but i dont see that as a bad thing. I wont go into detail here because of spoilers, but if you want to relive the same story and game with better graphics just mod the old game and play it.

Pros:
*Tifa
*Beautiful Artstlye + GFX
*Good Combat
*Great adaptation of the locations we all love and like
*New Versions of the songs we love
*Good difficulty imo
*Beautiful character models(especially tifa daiummnn)
*No stutters 
*DLC hit me right in the feels
*Hot Tifa mods on nexus


Cons:
*The ""fate"" stuff needs to be fleshed out more, 
but well there are other games upcoming so they still can do that.
*Even though i like the combat system,
but i wish materia would be more important(maybe it will with added materia in the next game)
*The game has more of an impact if you played the original else it might be slightly confusing.
*Sometimes shadows and hair textures look grainy because of TAA (afaik) but there is a way around that.
*Not enough Tifa
*The other parts will take their time to release :(

As a child, I was first introduced to the Final Fantasy series while visiting my oldest sibling who was away to college and he showed me his new game, ""Final Fantasy VII."" Back then, the graphics were astonishing. But even more so, the story line was incredible. After tasting just a few dozen hours, I could not get enough of these ""Final Fantasy"" games. Nearly three decades later, I was nervous about the remake. I wanted to avoid rushing into it just for nostalgia, and I was worried that a ""remake"" would ruin it. I am pleased to say that the remake is still fun, the graphics are great, and the story is great.

[b]Pros:[/b]
+ Graphics: the graphics are beautiful and the environment matches the settings very well. While there are a lot of cutscenes, they are usually very well done and smooth.
+ Combat: Combat is fun though very simple. If you can time your steps and buttons well, you won't have any problem.
+ Story/Content: The story, though weird at times, is enjoyable and enough to keep the player engaged. There is a lot of side content to enjoy throughout the entire game. I especially enjoyed how they added so much content around NPC's like the Avalanche members. Overall, they did a great job creating a story that hits all the right notes. It was a the one thing I was the most worried about, and I'm glad I was not disapointed.
+ Music: The music is beautiful in this game and enjoyable throughout the entire game.

[b]Cons:[/b]
-- Voice Acting: The English version's VA often comes off goofy and over dramatic. It's like listening to a cheap dub. Aside from one or two characters (such as Biggs and Jesse), the VA is way below the quality that I think most people had hoped for in a game of this quality. Seriously, I have no idea who signed off on it, but they did a pretty lousy job.

[b]TLDR:[/b]
While not as ground-breaking as the original, I still very much enjoy it and I look forward to the rest of the story. That said, the game is a little weird and most of the English voice acting is pretty bad. Still, if you can get over that and some slightly quirky combat, I recommend this game. Overall, I would say it is a solid 8/10.",1699205752,1700623702,True,0,0,0.49438205361366272,0,True,False,False

The game nails almost everything I, as someone was a huge fan of the original, would have hoped for. So far I've completed the game on normal but not the section with Yuffie just yet, nor have not gathered all of the collectables; though, the fact I've considered that something worth mentioning should show as an endorsement of the game.

Normally, I'm not one to write a review beyond a couple of words, but I'll make a happy exception. The game was so enjoyable for me that the parts that annoyed me, really annoyed me. This is likely because of my love of the original, but without going into spoilers, simply, Sephiroth should not have been in this game. What I mean by this is that the game has basically two sets of story pacing, the first being the original story beats, and their respective pacing, that roughly follows what you could call the ""Midgar Saga"" from the first game, which is paced very well despite minor alterations, and then what feels like a compression of elements that you did not originally learn about until way into disk 2 or even 3. This includes characters introduced early, Sephiroth being the prime example, as well as events and references that in the original were had not sometimes explained until well into disk 3.

The reason this bothered me was that it forced the writers to use some contrived plot elements to allow the story to progress, which is a shame as throughout the game they had already demonstrated that they were fully capable of writing with the same care and restraint as the original. I'm not even talking about how some elements diverge from the original completely, I actually love what they did with it for the most part and will absolutely be playing Rebirth. The issue I have is predominately the pacing. I think if there was no Sephiroth, or if he had been an elusive threat like how the Necromancer from The Hobbit was written; if there had been no mention of the ""Reunion"", [spoiler]and the spectres' involvement had either been a slow burn or explained upfront,[/spoiler] then I think this game would have been 11/10 for me.

The rest of the frustrations with the game, I'm happy to call a skill issue. Issues with combat, the lock-on not always working as it should, enemy lock-on's working too well, and some bosses resetting pressure due to cut-scenes; I'm happy to just ""get good"" and finish the game on hard. There is also a fair amount of backtracking, which is not specific to this game, but a general gripe I have with modern games, though in this case, it's the ladders, could just be a me thing again, though.

Overall, I would recommend this game, it was a load of fun, and it was great to see characters and locations rendered as closely as I could imagine to the originals. The soundtrack is stellar, the compositions are all evocative of the original. I can say that if you were a fan of the original FF7, then there is a ton of content for you here. I haven't played Crisis Core yet but I image that if you liked that, you'll probably like this. Lastly, if you're new to FF7, I'd say the game is still fun, though with the effort to compress the story elements from the original, the plot might seem to make even less sense, but obviously I can't say for certain.",1700574042,1700574042,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So its going to read as a bit of a ramble, but that's because I am just so conflicted on this game.

For the record, I only played the original game 1 year prior... but somehow I have already developed nostalgia for it. It holds up, and is very special even playing for the first time in 2022. I highly recommend it. I see this remake as a companion piece rather than a replacement/upgrade.[/i]

[h3]Pros:[/h3]
- The main cast is great. They have enough unique banter to keep things feeling fresh, their movesets have just enough depth where I didn't tire of them throughout the playthrough, and they all have very nice player models. They are very close to what I pictured them as when playing through the original, and their voice actors all do a great job. EXCEPT FOR SEPHIROTH - I'M SORRY.

- The visuals are lovely. The slums and upper Midgar look fantastic. During the beginning of the game you solely play as Cloud for a while and get a chance to soak in the scenery of ""Fancy Midgar"" and it really is lovely. 

- Sometimes the game really nails the original's charm. Some of the minigames in particular made me smile, as well as some other shenanigans I won't mention here.

[h3]Mixed:[/h3]
- Normal difficulty really doesn't require much use of magics, let alone statuses like sleep, paralysis, etc.

- There were certain materia I used for an entire playthrough, that never leveled up. Elemental weapon in particular. Perhaps the XP gain needs to be adjusted a bit. 

[h3]Cons:[/h3] 
- The anime grunts. They are miserable. Fortunately, I HIGHLY recommend a certain mod that removes them from all cutscenes. He is doing the lords work. I played through Final Fantasy 16 recently, and crikey the voice work is just leagues more mature and believable. The complete lack of anime grunts in that game makes 7 Remake stick out real bad.

- The stuttering is absured. The performance is really strange on this game, and required me to dabble a lot with inis and mods to get it running smoothly on my 3080 setup.

- Side quests are very bad. There isn't much to say about them besides them just being extremely low effort fetch quests that barely offer any world-building worth digging into.

- Chapter 18 is bad. People are picking sides on this portion of the game, but I just don't like it. Read more below in my spoiler block.

[h2]THE SPOILER BLOCK: [/h2]
[spoiler]While I knew going in that this game was going to change some events, Chapter 18 really soured my opinion of this game right at the end. I was loving it prior to this. Fighting Rufus, escaping shinra HQ, driving on the bike with the gang in the truck... I was loving it. It captured a bit of the goofy magic of the original, and I was nearly gonna preorder Part 2 right then and there.

I think my frustration with Chapter 18 lies in the fact that we still have a vast majority of the game's story ahead of us, in 2 more whole ass video games. From a narrative stakes perspective, you're really telling me that the gang just killed Fate and bested Sephiroth, all before leaving Midgar? What comes after this? Are we going to go back to fighting rats and what not outside Cosmo Canyon? 

Other video games have encountered this problem before, but they usually throw in some contrivance to explain it away. Kingdom Hearts 1->2 pulls this off, he forgets his abilities. Mass Effect 1->2, Shepard is ""re-constructed"". But are you really about to tell me that Cloud & the Gang just trip, drop all their materia, and then bump their heads and forget all of their abilities? Sure the devs have said that they will ""start at level 22"" or whatever... but it just seems really odd. 

Clearly I am conflicted because this review will show that I do recommend this game, but wowzers I am really curious how this is gonna go after this. I think they blew their load too early with Sephiroth. 

Also, I welcome some of the new changes honestly. I think the ghosts trying to protect fate is a really neat concept, and maybe this next game will completely go off the rails. We just don't know. All I know, is that personally speaking, Chapter 18 put a weird taste in my mouth.  
[/spoiler]

Note: I will hopefully come back and edit this section once I get around to playing the Intergrade content, I'm just going to play it before Rebirth to get back into the zone. 

[h2]Conclusion:[/h2]
I recommend playing the original. Then give yourself a nice break, and then come into this remake. I think it really does benefit having played the original, then getting to see everything you pictured in your head come to life. I don't think this FF7 remake series is going to be a proper replacement, so I think you should get the original's story/pacing under your belt, so that you can throw caution to the wind with these new games just to see what Tetsuya Nomura nonsense he cooks up for us all.",1700343674,1700343750,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
1462040,150354790,76561198090186960,0,8,744,0,744,1700170070,"Got this game on sale, well after it was released, along with the DLC. For context, I've played almost all other mainline FF games over the course of a decade and a half, and just played the OG FF7 half a year ago. I went in with high expectations based on the comments I read about the game on Reddit from communities that shared my enthusiasm for JRPGs. Needless to say with the thumbs down I'm giving this game, I am extremely disappointed with the product. 

The GOOD: 
-Game looks great, the graphics update for the characters are 10/10, there are no complaints. It's a beautiful game to look at in many moments.
-The combat *system* is generally fun, even if a bit button mashy at times in order to fill your ability gauge.
-The updated music of the original soundtrack is so, so, SO good. Boss fights gave me chills and hype was through the roof - then again, FF & Square Enix knows how to deliver epic boss fight moments with their sound, and this game was a prime example of SE's master ability. 
-The voice lines and character interactions add life to the characters that simply didn't exist in the PS1 version. Barret is such a funny dude, and he and Cloud make a particularly great duo with their back-and-forth dialogue.

And that's it. Those are really the only good things I can say about the game. I'll dive into these points a little bit more once I outline the bad, and.... hoooo boy. 

The BAD: 
-Filler to pad the storyline/playtime. I know you might read some comments defending these filler missions and side quests as a way for SE to flesh out the world of Midgar, but SURPRISE, this is not my first time playing filler missions and side quests, and the ones in this game do no such thing. The quests are on-rails, you-can't-screw-this-up, follow-this-corridor-and-squeeze-through-this-gap level of repetitive, unoriginal fetch quests, and once you recognize the pattern that they are more or less ALL like this, you don't actually want to do anything that takes time away from the main storyline because they are so uninspired, repetitive, and unnecessary. Speaking on on-rails...
-The game is so on-rails it might as well have been a movie where they only let you pick up the controllers for the boss fights. No, seriously - the world is not open, you're shoved into these corridors with little to no reward for exploration, you can't ditch the main story in the middle to go fight some mobs or do some side quests (which, like I previously mentioned, aren't even worth doing), you're forced to partake in filler story arcs... the world of Midgar is a theme park ride and NO, you can't get off the road to go grind some mobs - how dare you? 
-So remember how I said the combat SYSTEM was good? Yeah, well, that enjoyable aspect is something you can only do when the game decides it wants you to engage with it. If I want to grind mobs in a dungeon (for example in the second 'dungeon' of the game), I would have to run around for five minutes to somehow reset the encounter mechanic to fight the same two types of mobs that show up in the dungeon. WTF? When I think back to FF6, FF10, hell, even the widely panned FF15, the game let me fight mobs whenever I wanted because grinding and encounters are a core part of the FF and JRPG experience! But in this game, I instead have to get through the 5 mandatory encounters that pop up through the course of a dungeon and fight the boss and that's supposed to be that. 
-And the sad thing is that there isn't even a huge incentive to grind out the encounters because the leveling system to power up your characters is uninspired (hey, I'm using that word again - see a pattern?) - they get stronger either by equipping materia (which I don't have too big of a problem with - that's how the original game was) and by powering up your weapons by clicking on shiny baubles that ... give you +8 attack power! Or +6 speed! Oh, boy!! No, seriously - with all the games that are out to take ideas from, SE is stuck giving me +8 attack power? Boring. And lazy.

So remember those good things I said about the game? Looking back, those things are really the bare minimum they could have done with this game - updating graphics, adding voice lines, turning up the music, and modernizing the combat system. Everything else, though? It's just lazy and boring. Why create an entire game just for Midgar if Midgar can't be explored except via corridors and cutscenes? Why create a fun combat system if I'm only allowed to engage in encounters when the game wants me to? Why release an updated version of a game decades after its original release if you don't take inspiration from the hundreds of great game ideas and designs that have come out between that time? Like, imagine if Midgar was like Night City from Cyberpunk 2077... or the character power system took inspiration from Monster Hunter.... or the side quests had the depth of Witcher 3... There's so many things that the developers could have done to make this game unique and breathtaking, and they just didn't or couldn't do anything but up the graphic fidelity. Congrats, I guess? But I definitely will not be playing the second - or third - installments in this unnecessarily elongated, disappointing trilogy.

This is one of the games why I decided to move from console gaming to PC. Could never play this game since I only had a Xbox. And I'm glad I did make the change. Like many others, I was a huge fan of the original FFVII, and getting to experience more of the world and personalities of the people in it was great.

Story line does stray from the original a bit, but I still really enjoyed it. Still not sold on the whole [spoiler]Whisper[/spoiler] thing though. Also, since this is a whole 40-50 hour game based off a small section of the original, there are a lot of ""filler"" type sections that don't expand much on the overarching story. But, again, it did add more to the world, so not a total negative.

Combat system is great and easy to get into. Really enjoyed getting to take control of the other party members at any time during fights. Fast-paced action is a little different from other Final Fantasy games, but I think that made each fight more realistic.

Graphics are okay. They can seem a little blurry at times, especially when compared to the cut scenes. I also kept having an issue where my whole screen, except for the hud, would turn blindingly white. Only way to fix it was restart the game.

I wished allies could do some of their own abilities on their own but I understand the core concept if having you being in full control. The story was fine and I personally don't mind the changes as I already know the story of OG 7, and I probably wouldn't had played this game if the story was just going to tbe the same 1 for 1.

Some gripes, the final arc of the game is a bit of a slog. The final battle is a bit disappointing as the boss itself isn't really intractable besides the ""other"" final boss. The motorcycle  sections were horrible, I really disliked them and just wanted a more traditional combat section instead of the the motorcycle mini-game, even more annoying on higher difficulties.  Also not a lot of repeatability imo, very easy to complete all side quests in the initial run as well as doing the side arena content and the VR missions/Shinra Training missions. Yuffie's story was fun but it leads back to being a  one and done kind of content.

As someone who has never played the original FF7, this game is extraordinarily good for new players. I was fully engrossed from start to finish. Most players who don't like this game that I've seen don't like changes from the original which is fair but for newcomers this game does everything right. The best part (or worst) depending on how you look at it; is they divided the original game into 3 parts which will be there own games themselves.

I do recommend playing through it, but there is nothing game changing here. 

THe biggest thing that struck me is just how much padding there is in this. The whole middle section from Cornea is just fluff. I'm up to CH15 now, I'm really just wishing this was OVER so I can move onto the next game. Visually this is gorgeous, and the mechanics are decent, but...its not very creative in terms of what it throws at you. The source material in the original was great, this is just...meh. 

For the Yuffie bit...its OK. Had I known what it was...a couple chapters of meh, don't know I would have bought this. I expected there to be more to it. Again, its OK. Completely unnecessary. Just looking at things that Avalanche did from a different viewpoint, and Yuffie invades a materia manufacturing facility, and comes across 'experiments'. 

These 'shinra' experiments are also padding in the main game. They are different style of padding, but its the same principle. As a game its probably 7/10. Its just not fresh. 

In comparison, the division 2 (which I played recently), was excellent beginning to end. 

It's a typical triple A release. Going back to it immediately after Spiderman 2 (on PS5), this is better than that. At least this has the where-with-all to to vary its enemy type, but...playing a game where almost all the scenes that your character is thrown into are unnecessary doesn't really motivate you to continue. That's the problem with this game, so much 'meh' that its not funny. 

I've put all my 30 hours on this on my Steamdeck while watching TV shows...even the distraction of TV shows couldn't pump up my feelings about it. Its OK, but get it on special, yeah.

[b]If you are not familiar with the original, play original Final Fantasy VII first instead. Otherwise, you will not understand some flashbacks and events.[/b]

The 1997 original is better in that it is a self-contained game with a complete story and a diverse and interesting world to explore (you literally move freely around the entire spherical PLANET, even now it sounds and looks cool).

This is the first game of the announced trilogy, the plot here ends after leaving Midgar (the first city from the original).

Pros:
- Detailed character models and locations in modern quality at 60 fps on the GTX 1060.
- Fanservice.

Cons:
- Controversial plot with alternative timeline and open ending.
- Excessive length. In the original, Midgar was just the intro of the game, but now it has been extended throughout the entire game and not always in the best way. Also, many interaction animations are overly long.
- Blurred image in 1080p. Apparently the game uses a combination of different technologies to increase performance (dynamic resolution / image reconstruction / anti-aliasing), which causes the image to become too blurry. After the crisp CGI cutscenes, this difference becomes even more noticeable.
- Overpriced.

Overall this is a good game if you like the original Final Fantasy VII and get it at a discount.

But for those unfamiliar with the series, I would recommend something lighter and more modern, like Final Fantasy XV.

I was expecting to do a lot of grinding and have to adapt to a lot of JRPG systems but honestly this game was just too good. This game is basically perfectly paced. There might be a few times I can think of that felt only slightly slow or drawn out but barely. I was expecting a weirdly adapted turn based combat system in the form of a real time combat system with clunkily added JRPG elements. But nope, this combat system is just way too cool and feels way too good. Even bosses that I expected to be damage sponges were perfectly long enough. 

Gosh, the story at times was like watching a really good show. The music is siiimply divine. It had all the up and downs and totally made me feel things bro.

this was my introductory game to serious games other then roblox and this was a perfect game to go to first.
i played the remake first before the original although im currently finishing the original with my friend at the moment.
from everything ive seen in the original game, i believe that the remake shows the charm of the original game and adding its own twist to it. its very fun and the graphics compared to the first game are truly amazing.
i hold this game dear to my heart.
ALSO THEY KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING WITH ALL THE CHARACTERS CAUSE MY GODDD THEY'RE ALL SO HOT.

I can't wait for the other parts to come out as well! :D AAAA

I didn't expect this review to blow up lol but ig it did. feels fair to give yall an update.
I finished the original final fantasy 7 with my friend and OML-- IT WAS GOOD.

also, ngl I was in big denial that aerith died. for some reason I convinced myself that she was going to be alive again somehow. i just love my bbg (still in denial istg)

im very excited for final fantasy rebirth + the third part to come out! istg it's going to be SOOOOOOO GOOOD the graphics already in the remake is phenomenal. i can't wait to just see how the graphics will amplify. especially the environments/cities/the ending.

They managed to take a 6 hour sequence and flesh it out into a 25-40 hour experience that never felt like a chore (minus the lack of early game fast travel) and legitimately added to each character in a way that was faithful to the original. The battle system and graphics are everything a fan of the original could have hoped for in the re-imagining of one of the greatest classics ever. My biggest complaint is that there wasn't enough!

The story is pretty much about Avalanche who's goal is to save the planet from Shinra, an electric power company that misleads the public that Mako (basically the life blood of the planet) is a 'limitless' resource, so that they can use that energy to build its Cities and roads, cars and manufacturing. All while draining the planet, turning it into a barren wasteland. 

Personally I enjoyed playing as Cloud Strife, I never really liked great swords in video games but here its really satisfying, and when hits connect against different enemies you can feel the impact of them. the battles are faced paced and the bosses are exciting. You can add Materia to add skills and spells to your equipment, so changes up the game play pretty frequently. One of the things I don't like is that Cloud is always the character you play as and you cant switch to others outside of the battles.

FF7 remake is incredibly detailed and immersive, whether you are talking to quest giving npc's or just roaming the world. Unfortunately it's levels are very linear, almost suffocating at times. Like you can clearly see there is a a way over to the objective or a quicker way around, you have to go through a puzzle so that the game time pans out longer. You can't jump, and you can't fall off no matter what either. When it looks like there is a small hill or windy path you can cut across. nope. gotta follow the path. 

I like the Banter between the characters as they all grow with each other over time and on the player as well. not everyone is like-able at the start, but over the course of the story you have memorable experiences with them, and I really enjoyed that aspect.",1698864497,1698864615,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

THE GOOD
- Characters, world, story and even the soundtrack are quite faithfully reproduced, with a new and modern look that is breathtaking and gripping
- Emotionally, it packs the same punches as the original in the key moments

THE SO-SO
- The more action-oriented approach is not bad per se, and it's actually quite frantic and involving while retaining a good tactical approach (though a bit confusing for those used to pure turn based, or not immediate enough for 100% lovers of pure button mashing action)

THE BAD
- Lots, lots, lots of filler and boring ""on rails"" exploration: this is a remake of the first 5-6 hours of the original, needlessly padded out with lots of non-interactive movies and boring ""walking around"" parts
- No sense of exploration, no freedom, everything is on rails from point A to point B (even the new expanded areas). The game constantly leads you in an extremely linear way, forbidding you to access parts of the map which are there but that it doesn't want to let you explore
- No sense of freedom to the evolution, and the RPG growth is extremely on rails too. The game wants you to develop weapons and characters according to a predetermined way, with little possibility for personal variation or choice, most of the time without letting you revisit areas to strengthen stats; hey, you can't even select which party members to use!
- After a brilliant start, there are several moments in which pacing is boring due to the above padding, linearity and lack of freedom
- The choice to divide the remake in three separately released chapters screams cash grab, robs the player of the wonderful sense of freedom the original had when going out of Midgar, and the biggest emotional peaks are delayed until... 2025? 2030?
- The new style is fascinating and realistic, but somehow the quirkiness of the original is lost

Addendum: I have spent a few more hours with the game, finished and did some extra stuff. And I confirm all I have written. My review may seem a bit harsh, and I wish there was a ""middle of the road"" rating compared to ""Yes"" or ""No"". I still think that for all the good things that this game does, the pacing in particular is irritating and uselessly dliuted.",1695071604,1698563880,False,172,11,0.668305277824401855,2,True,False,False

Also it's not even the full game so that is lame that i will have to buy FF7 Rebirth in order to finish the story whilst not having my save file carry over. 6/10 if the graphics and story not being so immersive I would rate this negative but if you can live with the change of gameplay and enjoy sort-of Devil May Cry action games then i'd recommend it.,1698471102,1698471102,True,1,0,0.509063482284545898,0,True,False,False

On their own, they're inoffensive, but they add up (There's a part where you literally have to hold triangle for like 3 seconds to high five Aerith.. why??)

On the other hand, I think this game has the best battle system of any FF. It's the perfect blend of real-time and turn-based. I didn't really appreciate how good it was until playing Hard mode. It can be frustrating if you try to play it like an action game, because you'll get hit by things that are actually guaranteed damage. Unavoidable. But that's the point.

I'd say the highlights for me are the combat, which has to be the best iteration of the action/turn based formula Square has ever come up with, and the graphics which look great and make for a great recreation of Midgar. 
Still, this game is but a shadow of what the original was. It is often poorly written, contains everything I dislike about Nomura's style of writing, convoluted unnecessary story pieces, changes in the script (like the way you are introduced to Sephiroth) and cheesy dialogue. It also contains a lot of filler content and repetitive fetch quests. Tech wise I'm running the game on a 4090 and it runs OK except from some traversal stutters, which occur pretty frequently and are immersion breaking for those that notice these kind of things.

I honestly don't know what I can say about FF7 remake that hasn't been said already. I have a very soft spot in my heart for JRPG's and FF7 remake just takes it all. Just really greedy and takes all my love fr. Absolutely beautiful scenery that gets you really immersed into another universe, complex and heart pulling story, amazing interactions with characters with relationships, growth, and passion, full of different game play styles and that sound track. That sound track is pure my funeral music.

I really fell in love with FF7 remake because of the characters and story. Spending genuine time with these characters and getting to know about them really gave me almost like a para-soical relationship with these identities (in a healthy manner) (not really). The characters feel so alive, ambitious, full of life and intriguing that it keeps you constantly wanting to be there and care for these characters through out it all. Mix in some wholesome moments with disaster and you have a great story that keeps you wanting to know more and more every game play sit through. The game feels so immersive, like I cannot express that enough just playing this game really is like LSD, it takes you to a whole other universe in your own little bubble and you just really get lost. What makes that immersion? Creative, fun, unique, and different story quest , mechanics, and game play quality. No mission lead the same and each mission felt like a true progression to the story and the characters. When something did happen it always lead to something else and the plot keeps a mysterious tone in ways of you constantly questioning everything. 

Game play is top tier to me. As you slowly build your squad throughout your play through you just feel so bad ass and it feels so rewarding. Slashing down physical with Cloud and then rolling out to cast a huge elemental spell to then switch to Tifa to deal more physical then to Aerith to cast healing and more spells and etc etc just felt so sick. Fights felt like genuine fights and you can feel the power difference with harder foes but never felt impossible. You had to think, you have to be a strategist, and you got to adapt.

For returning fans from the OG FF7 as like me, it does take a slight shift from the original story and events and it gets different especially once you throw in the whispers in there, Zack, and crisis core and yeah. But hey, rebirth is still to come and we have yet to see how the whole story will play out but I think the adaptation was very well interpreted and I like the spin for something a little different. 

Overall, if you're looking for a game to just completely dissociate from your terrible friends, boring life, and depressing thoughts like me, bro just get the game.

This game changes a lot so I wouldn't recommend anyone new to FF7 because it would get very confusing.

I emailed the developer when I got back, and told them I had freezing issues and couldnt even play this game, could they please refund me.

They emailed back in 72 hours; saying that ""i had been in game for more than the allowable time; around 4 hours. Therefore, cannot be refunded.""

I emailed back, explained what happened, and even offered them to be able to look into my steam account and see that I never even reached a save point or anything like that, never even passed the first scene because it was frozen.
They basically advised that I was screwed and there was nothing they could do.

Forced walking sections. The game would be like 2 damn hours shorter if they removed them. Game, I can run around even if characters are talking, you're slowing the gameplay to a crawl and it's incredibly frustrating and takes me right out of the experience.

The version of this game that exists on ps4 and intergrade on ps5 (probably, don't have a ps5) are one of the best games in at least a decade for me personally, perhaps ever. FF9 remake would be the only thing to top it if done with the same care and attention to not only preserving the original heart and emotion of the original but also enhancing and supplying many exceptional additions.

Finished playing Crisis Core Reunion last week which was pretty good even though I had some criticism about it. After watching Advent Children, now FINALLY I'm going back full circle to this game that started this whole journey for me and god, I can appreciate things now WAAAY more.

The game not being a 1 to 1 Remake with better graphics was the best move ever. Square can finally create the Final Fantasy VII that they wanted to, but were limited by the tech at the time. Admittedly when the game got announced to be real time action oriented and episodic I was scared as an original fan purist. But they knocked it out of the park. The story has been fleshed out to be even better than the source material. And the combat was nailed adding the ATB for commands and the command menu slow down was the best way to incorporate turned based combat elements in an Action RPG. I played this game on PS4, PS5, Epic & Steam a total of around 250 hours all together across each platform. I know that's a bit excessive but that's how much Final Fantasy VII means to me. I remember when Remake got announced you had to be there to feel the hype. I'd recommend this to anyone curious about FFVII or Final Fantasy in general. While you can jump straight into Remake, I would 100 percent recommend playing Final Fantasy VII Original and Crisis Core OG or Reunion at least to get the full enjoyment. As the game will make very important revelations that you will not understand or appreciate if you have not played those games including media from the Compilation. That being said you are more than able to enjoy Remake as a stand alone experience. In closing this game was an 11 out of 10, have fun if you decide to pick up this game cause it's peak fiction. Can't wait for Rebirth!

I think 50% of the new ""expanded stuff"" is unnecessary or at least FEELS it.

Midgar was 4-8 hours in the original game for the first time. Midgar has become 30-40 hours worth of content, the stuff remade from the original game has been captured and modified (as necessary) extremely well. The extra content they've added really helps expand Midgar and gives you an emotional connection to it and it's people in comparison to the original where it was very 0-100 as it was so much shorter. 

My main problem is that the side quests are all locked to separate chapters, so if you want to do all the side content, you need to put whatever interesting main plot point that is currently going on hold and do them quickly, and something amazing like ""Storm Shinrya HQ"" constantly overshadows having to find some Chocobos, making said side quests more unenjoyable as you're taunted by the cool-ass main plot point waiting for you.

I was constantly rocking between ""enjoying the game"" and ""not enjoying the game"" up until I got on to Shinrya HQ as I felt forced to do the side-content that soon would be locked out to me. To sum it up, I really just wanted to play the remade content, not the new, expanded content. Though there were some really good remade moments, like Biggs, Jessie, Wedge arcs and the whole Corneo incident, I feel like the more menial, irrelevant ones hampered the experience.

Though this doesn't make the game worth not playing, it is still extremely enjoyable and when the main plot is driving, you don't want to put it down.

i kinda hate the changing or alteration of the story for whatever Remake games out there so i am not in fan that much for new storyline.

after saying that. i will admitted its really great remake. i am still enjoying the new remake story eventhough i am not really like what they are doing.
let just said, the combat mechanic are to simple and just massing B or O button for most of the time, i am not in favor of when you get hit, you get pose damage but when you did to the enemy they didn't get pose damage, not really saying i am satisfied with that tbh. but i am still half enjoying the game mechanic so far. the split slow mo when you picking up the skill, i quite like it tbh. 
next my problem with hidden item most of them feels too bored to loot since the backtrack mostly unsatisfied. the invincible wall just doesn't make any senses when you logical can walk or jump or climb through it easily rather than backtrack decision. technically no jump mechanic so its fair for that, but other it kinda lame IMO. it get bored pretty easily.
Yuffie in intermission gameplay on the other hand is amazing for me.

Graphics and music are a real treat, can't even complain about the framerate focused experience either, as it allows for a smoothly running game. Voice acting is top notch as well, however the default mix drowns out the excellent music, so make sure to lower the volume of voices significantly.

While we're on the topic of music: The remasters are great, but, are remasters nonetheless. The original tunes are brilliant in their composition, always able to perfectly convey the mood and atmosphere, telling a story of their own, on their own. As well written and technically well done these remixes are, they are remixes still, offering a great throwback to the original tunes at times, but lacking in emotion due to their overuse of additional layers of bombast.

This criticism goes for the entire game: The original FF7 was a masterclass of epic world-building and cinematics on PSX. FF7r attempts to one-up the original in every single way, but whilst doing so, fails to live up for the simple fact that it offers a whole lot of style over substance. In order to add substance, the world is padded out with significant padding ranging from from dull fedex sidequests, to downright dull filler dungeons. 

What remains is a reimagining of a game that has its highs dilluted by an over-abundance of sub-par padding severely disrupting the pacing of the game, which was something the original did exceptionally well.

Play this if you want to experience Final Fantasy 7 in a 2023 cinematic fashion and find PSX graphics and mechanics distracting you from enjoying the original experience.
Play the original if you, like me, are in it for the story, value a properly paced classic RPG experience and are able to appreciate a story told, and find voice acting, set pieces and triple-controlled action RPG-mechanics a nuisance, rather than fun.",1696782281,1696782281,False,15,7,0.522497713565826416,0,True,False,False

The Problems/CONS: 
-Loves to hold your hand. Why bother creating a environmental puzzles to get to the next area if each companion as you approach the area says ""Hey, I bet we can flip that switch"", ""Hey maybe if we lower the water with that pump we can get down there"". THANKS SQUARE! Square must think their core demo is 7 year olds. Sometimes, it waits a little to give you a hint... and by a little, like 15 seconds... not even enough time to explore the area first. Want to go get the treasure you see on a side path? You must be struggling, heres the answer for how to progress. **Lame**. Nevermind a difficult environmental puzzle, this one puts you in a room with 2 objects and then gives you the hint: did you notice/use the 2 objects.  
-The Side quests are mostly uninteresting fetch quests. ""Go find the children"", ""Locate all the different Music CDs"" etc... Please. Make it stop. I know interesting side-quests take time, but maybe half as many, twice as long/detailed? A few were good. 

PROS: 
-Combat works surprisingly well. Good mashup of old turn based ATB and action-RPG.
-Voice acting is both good and often funny/interesting
-Good expansion of the universe, while still honoring the feel of the source material
-Great cut scenes
-Excellent pacing
-I especially liked the closing montage showing you what you did over the game-- more games should do this. 
-Don Corneo. Memorable, great voice acting... love to hate this sleezeball. Im glad it wasnt dialed down from the original (which, Im sure was something they considered given the... pretty NSFW aspects of this guy). I hope he makes his way into the next one.

The battle system is now just hack and slash, and there is basically no strategy to the game at all. Heal hack and slash endlessly. The story changes are obviously an issue. They didn't expand on the original story. They actually changed many things making it a different story all together. It reminds me of fable except with many less features and much later in time. The game is incredibly linear. Anytime you even attempt to get off the rails it stops you and forces you toward the next objective. The cut scenes are overpowering. You will spend as much or more time watching the game instead of playing it. But if you are looking for an interactive movie with limited gameplay features to zone out to maybe you'd like it.

Thus, I cant exactly claim to familiar at all with Final Fantasy or with Square Enix all that much in the first place. With that being said, I really enjoyed the OG FFVII and I feel like I enjoyed the remake even more. 
-For those unaware, this remake covers only a portion of the original, only about the first 10-15 hours (that's what it took me at least) but it finished in a very natural place. In comparison to the original, this is more of an action rpg than the turned based rpg that the original one was. I really like this new combat system. Its extremely hectic, flashy, and always keeps you busy. Story-wise, this portions is more or less the same as the original with it being lengthened by a fair amount with quests and the occasion tangent here and there. I feel like some, especially those who are fond of the original, wont be a big fan of this but personally I like that type of stuff so I was totally cool with it.
- Visually, this game is absolutely gorgeous. I have a 1440p display with a decent gpu and this game really pops. Cutscenes are seamless to the gameplay and I was wowed time and time again by some of the crazy moments. This is absolutely one to play on a nice big screen with decent hardware.

The music is also fantastic thanks to the amazing and talented series veteran, Nobuo Uematsu, returning to help with revising this already memorable and iconic soundtrack, while also putting a new spin on classic themes throughout the game. And finally, the newly improved battle system takes the cake of it all. Before, the battle system was turn-based where you had to select actions that strategically gave you the upperhand in combat, the downside being that it was archaic and out of date and disconnected the player from the fight. The new battle system sees the player fully in control of the characters actions by using the square button to do basic attacks, but by charging gauges over time, you can add a string of combos to your attacks by pulling off special moves. Add magic on top of that, and it's a type of battle system that, once you get the hang of it, can be very satisfying to get good at and defeat your enemies not only with ease, but in style as well. On top of that! The newly added side story of one of the party members from the original that wasn't introduced until several hours into the story finally gives some much needed backstory that wasn't there in the original back on the Playstation. This remake sets the standard of how a remake should be taken when trying to bring a classic game to a newer audience who didn't get a chance to experience it before. Not only that, but improves over the original and further improves the experience.

This ain't it. They remade maybe 1/12th of the original FF7, and then put some childish spin on it, defy the fate god, kick some ass and camera pans out as they stare into the sky kind of ending...

We're supposedly a SOLDIER, yet as i played i questioned if we're just stupid. Normal characters often seemed more powerful/capable than Cloud. One moment he jumps 15 meters up in battle, falls from 100 meters and not even a bruise, and then you cannot jump at all during the gameplay, or to jump off a ledge instead of using a ladder.

Faces of some characters were weird, and at times the game looks really well, only to pan to weird setting where suddenly tifa's ""skirt"" feels like a solid cone.

Sure, Cloud is supposed to be popular with ladies, but this felt like some male fantasy where within first 5 minutes a girl is teasing him, first 3 female characters simply put presented themselfs as if they were heels over head for Cloud, and ofcourse our main hero behaves like autistic child that only likes tanks, so he doesn't get it.

Mini-games were a nightmare. the fact that some items required me to be in exact spot to use them was annoying. The brainless AI in non classical gameplay felt useless. I did not enjoy this experience. The only thing that was nice is few scenes and graphics for screenshots.

the DLC (Intermission) is also badly implemented, so you suggest i play the main story first so you don't spoil what this character will be doing in the middle of the game, without ever seeing cloud, and not having any impact on main story? Hell, in the main story we see a cat that is replaced by this character in DLC, and i still do not coprehend whats the point of all this mess.

You completed the game and now you can play on harder difficulty, oh and in chapter 17 now we added more enemies to your simulation. Thanks game, what i needed after i walked through this mess of a game.
Best part? With difficulty increase we gave them all extra 1 ability that you never saw, but we won't tell you that, and suprise suprise, some of them will one shot you if you do not dodge them the right way, good luck tanking a suprise 9999 damage attack otherwise.

To do few last challenges you need to go back to certain chapters to get items that you might have missed/missions to unlock another mission to complete another challenge, and no, the chapter selection does not let you do it from any specific point, but from the start. If you wanted full replayability, its there, if you wanted to just skip side quests that you already did, too bad.

Oh, and max level is just 50. Not 99... 50....

2. ""Classic"" mode isn't great. Even on normal, it feels off.

If you have the option, play it on PS5.
I thought I'd grab the PC version so that fifteen years from now I won't have to dust off the PS5 to play this, and if the other parts don't take too long to come to PC I might as well collect them here.
I'm going to battle it out with mods and tweaking to see if I can fix this, but Square really should have done better. It's pretty bad.

UPDATE:
Ok, Got it working better, but still not perfect.
1 - In the game, set your FPS to 90 or 120, regardless of if your monitor can handle it.
2 - If you need even less stutter, add ""-dx11"" to the game parameters. Disable HDR. Install a ReShade Mod to bring back HDR. If the screen is tearing a bit, force vsync from your GPU control panel.

This got rid of about 95% of the stutter for me, but I'm toying with the idea of disabling game mode on my TV to fill in some of the frames at the expense of input responsiveness. Not really a reaction game so that's perhaps acceptable.

Still, Square should have fixed this.

UPDATE UPDATE:
Continued playing for a bit. Stutter got worse when loading certain parts.
Screw it. I'll play this on the PS5 instead. I won't refund this in the hopes that in the future a fan patch will come out for my next play-through in 20 years time, or that the computer I have then will just brute force over it.

Square really should fix this because it's frankly embarrassing that a company of that size can't even port their games properly and are OK with leaving them a stuttering mess.",1695560727,1695801708,False,1,1,0.496732026338577271,0,True,False,False

Here's a simplified breakdown of this game: cut scene, cut scene, cut scene, follow along a linear storyline, cut scene, cut scene, boss character that is ridiculously strong with massive attacks that destroy your party. Wash, rinse, repeat.
The boss battles show a lack of thought and tactics from the creators, and instead leaves the player guessing on what special key move you need to repeat over and over for 15 minutes to defeat the boss.
For the first time in my 45 years of playing video games, and 35 years of playing Final Fantasy games, I really wish I could return this for a refund.

The visuals are absolutely stunning, and a few of the cutscenes bring back fantastic memories, however... the dialogue leaves a lot to be desired. I know the dialogue in the original wasn't that great, but they seemed to have doubled down on it with this game. It's abrasive to me, like trying to rub my brain with a cheese grater. The lack of random encounters is also disappointing. I'm hoping with part 2 they give you a little more exploration and stay a little more true to the original FF7 formula. The side quests also leave much to be desired. Most of the side quests in the original had something to do with world building, character development, etc. The side quests in the remake seem to be simple cookie cutter rpg nonsense, like fetch quests. They don't add much other than something to sink your time and get a little extra experience.

As far as positives go, the movement in the game is super crisp. The transition between types of movement, like climbing a ladder and running are a lot more fluid and not as jarring as the original. I like that the movement is also incorporated into the battle sequences. Fighting the scorpion in the intro and having to hide from its laser was wonderfully immersive by comparison. The animation sequences and the art are right up with the Advent Children movie, which was exactly what I was hoping for.

Do I recommend the game? Absolutely. If you're a fan of the series, then it's worth the trip down nostalgia lane to see what they're capable of. Is it a good game? Not really.

Not a ""top tier"" game, but definitely not awful either. Good enough that I enjoyed it quite a lot and would recommend it.

For reference, I've played the original LOTS, did 100% completion runs, watched the movie, etc.

What I wanted from this game was to enjoy the story and hangout with my favorite characters. Everything else is whatever. People want very different things out of this game, which VERY much changes your experience.

A lot of things were done right in this game. Without spoilers, some of the more annoying and grindy parts from the original were changed to something enjoyable instead. I like the tweaks and changes, though I can see how this would upset ""purists"". For me, this made things exciting.

Voice acting was good. The dialogue was FAR better, imo, and livened things up a lot. Combat is flashy. Everyone is extremely pretty! But not Hojo. Screw that guy.

Some gripes:
- The combat has problems. Dodging is almost useless. Getting interrupted for the dumbest reasons is VERY obnoxious. Be ready to get pissed a lot. Some balance problems.
- Everything has too much health. My hands got tired and literally were sore by the end.
-- Note that combat was NOT my prime reason for playing, and I still liked it in the end. Just noting if your main expectation is great combat, there's other games that do it better.
- There are some weird lag issues on PC, as others have noted.
- The game definitely felt too linear. I'm not sure how they'd change it, but there was definitely a lot of ""run in a line, do fight, cutscene, rinse and repeat"". Wasn't always like that, but enough to notice.
- I'm not a fan of quest boards in ANY game. WoW may have ruined this for me, but quests just feel like an annoying and unnecessary chore.
- Wasn't impressed with materia changes, for balance reasons. Can't say more without spoilers, though I would say I did like some of the changes. I'd recommend don't think about it, just try it and decide for yourself.",1695608545,1695608545,True,1,0,0.424385666847229004,0,True,False,False

And I'm happy to say that version exists! On PS5. Remake Intergrade on PS5 is a great upgrade. On PC its a different story.

The only feature bump up you get is 120fps support. I'd say native 4K at higher FPS as well but by default the game uses dynamic resolution scaling.  Even if that wasnt the case, the PC version is prone to heavy stuttering when run under DX12. Its possible to use DX11 but only using a launch command. The only way I can recommend this port is if you want to play it portable on steam deck. The issues persist there but at least its kinda novel.

First off, the story (or actually, 1/3rd of a story) is really boring.  It desperately tries to actually tell a message but completely fails.
The side quests are absolutely awful. Unfortunately, I did all of them because I thought that there must be something relevant to the story in them, or at least some world building, but there isn't. Every quest is just a fetch quest. Compare this to Final Fantasy XVI in which every quest enhances our understanding of the game's world in some way, And the difference is night and day.
Combat is some of the worst I've ever had the displeasure of using. Even the first goddamn Nier had better combat than this, and that game released in 2010.
Here's how the combat goes: Spam Square, occasionally dodge (the dodging doesn't actually do anything) and then when your mp meter gets filled you can cast fire or whatever. It's awful.
The optimization is not awful, however the hair textures look horrendous unless you mod the game to disable dynamic resolution.

In my opinion, this game is really bad. Save your money and buy Final Fantasy XVI instead.",1695560683,1695560683,False,4,1,0.35496211051940918,0,True,False,False

The developers had a vision back in the 90s when they made the original game. However much like George Lucas and Star Wars, the technology of their time limited them so they had to tell their story a different way. The Remake series is Square Enix's vision come to life, and then some. This game is NOT a 1 for 1 and you get so much more out of it if you play the original. However, if you find that the OG has not aged to your liking, you can ABSOLUTELY introduce yourself into the FFVII world with this title and the coming 2 sequels, Rebirth and the unnamed 3rd part. 

Hardcore original game fans will criticize this game for expanding on the story and introducing changes. I am a big fan of the original, but this game does take liberties in a very tasteful way. I don't want to spoil anything, but let's just say Remake as a subtitle has some major plot significance. That being said, 99% of the stuff in the original game from Midgar is in here. They only added content, they seldom cut things, even seemingly insignificant characters and locations get extra bits of detail and depth. 

If you have yet to play this masterpiece of a game, I highly suggest you do. You will not regret it. That is not to say the game is without flaws. There are definitely some chapters of the game that are complete padding like chasing a two legged goat through sewers or exploring a needlessly large laboratory. Barring the padding and overtly simple side quests, this game delivers in terms of story, gameplay, music and graphics.

The game mirrors the spirit of the original game while adding new twists and turns that make it surprising even for those who have played the original.

For me, the combat system is a standout feature of the game. It seamlessly blends real-time action with the original's ATB System, resulting in a truly unique experience. Engaging in combat is both enjoyable and accessible, and as the game progresses, the Shinra Combat Simulator presents increasingly challenging battles that demand practice and strategic thinking. The hard difficulty, in particular, deepened my appreciation for this battle system, making it my all-time favorite among any Final Fantasy game.

The characters are well-written, and many side characters are more expanded upon. I found the relationship between the main cast even more enjoyable than in the original.

As in every Final Fantasy game, the soundtrack is amazing and also worth mentioning, with memorable tracks that perfectly capture the mood and tone of each scene.

Overall, I would highly recommend Final Fantasy VII Remake to anyone looking for a compelling RPG experience. The game pays homage to the original while also standing on its own as a more modern, friendly version.

On the good side, the visuals are beautiful and the music is top notch.
I also enjoyed them fleshing out midgard into a more realistic city and making Cloud less of a ahole edge lord.
The liberties they took with the original story are alarming but not YET catastrophic.

The real problem is the combat system; it is just bad:
They ditch the turn base system for an action system that feels untested... To perform any action (spell. item, summon, skills) you have to mash the attack button to fill a gauge (ATB) that will allow you to use these actions, but most have an activation time (so you can get interrupted and lose your ATB and mana/item) or they have a travel time (so they can miss or be interrupted by a cut-scene, and you lose your ATB and mana/item)...
it's not too bad when you're fighting trash mobs, but incredibly frustrating in boss fights and when facing flying/out of reach enemies.
And the AI... your companions will die by standing in clouds of poison or get hit by every possible unblockable attack.
Mashing buttons to get a gauge up so i can heal/revive my companions...

Major gripes I had with the game were the lackluster side quests, which although optional, I'm a sucker for achievements so I felt compelled to complete all of them. Some of them offered humor which I appreciated. Another aspect I disliked was the new storyline. These weird phantoms weren't a part of the original game, and the game makes alot of references to it's upcoming sequel. If I were a new FF7 player, I'd sort of be spoiling myself for what was to come, and I hope that's a decision they revert on in the sequel. Music is fantastic, yada yada.

The DLC chapter is so wonderful. Music is just as upbeat if not more than Remake, and Yuffie's kit is so much fun with how quick and agile her movements are. Even though her chapter is short, it's a good representation of how synergy combat may play out in the sequel.

Even on sale it is not worth it, whilst it looks amazing that is the only positive this game has.

This means you have all this equipment, materia and skills to level up and alter but nothing to use it on since the game is devoid of enemies for the most part.

Balancing a full-time job and gaming can be challenging, but this game made every minute I invested in it absolutely worth it. Here's why I'm so thrilled with this modern reimagining of a timeless classic:

1. Captivating Visuals and Audio:
The first thing that struck me was the jaw-dropping visual upgrade. Final Fantasy 7 Remake brings Midgar to life with stunning graphics, intricate details, and a level of realism that I could only dream of back when I first played the original. The characters look more lifelike than ever, and the environments are nothing short of breathtaking. The soundtrack, too, is a masterpiece. Hearing the familiar tunes reimagined with modern orchestration was an emotional experience that transported me back to the late '90s while still feeling fresh and exciting.

2. Faithful to the Original:
Square Enix managed to retain the essence of what made the original game so beloved while injecting new life into it. The story remains true to its roots, offering a familiar narrative with enough twists and turns to keep even long-time fans on their toes. The attention to detail in recreating iconic moments and characters is astounding, making it clear that the developers were passionate about preserving the legacy of the original.

3. A New Level of Depth:
One of the aspects that truly impressed me is the expanded character development. The Remake delves deeper into the backstories and personalities of the main cast, giving us a richer understanding of Cloud, Tifa, Aerith, and the others. This added depth enhances the emotional connection with the characters and the overall narrative, making the game's events even more impactful.

4. Engaging Combat System:
The combat system is a departure from the turn-based battles of the original, opting for a more action-oriented approach. While I was initially hesitant about this change, I found it incredibly engaging. The mix of real-time combat, strategic thinking, and character switching kept battles fresh and exciting throughout the game. It's accessible for casual gamers but offers enough depth for those looking for a challenge.

5. Stunning Worldbuilding:
Midgar has been expanded upon, allowing us to explore more of the city and its inhabitants. The worldbuilding is fantastic, with every nook and cranny offering intriguing lore and side stories. It's a testament to the love and care put into crafting this world.

6. A Beautiful Homage:
Final Fantasy 7 Remake is not just a game; it's a love letter to fans like me who've cherished the original for decades. It pays homage to the source material while simultaneously setting a new standard for what a modern RPG can achieve. This makes it not only a fantastic game but also a remarkable celebration of gaming history.

I can't recommend the Final Fantasy 7 Remake enough. It's a stunning achievement that combines nostalgia with innovation, providing an unforgettable gaming experience that's perfect for both veterans and newcomers. Square Enix has taken a beloved classic and elevated it to new heights, and I can't wait to see where they take us next in this epic journey.",1689376977,1694748328,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The original has been in my top 5 of all time since about '98. When they dropped the initial reveal trailer for this reboot, I was over the moon. It's why I went out and got a PS4, which is hilarious since I do not actually own a copy on PS4. Anyway, I've gotten through the first section and gotten a feel for the updated combat mechanics and here's what I got to say so far:

Graphics: It's gorgeous. This is what I always wanted the original to look like and they more than delivered. Animation is a bit choppy at times, but that's probably thanks to my mid-level PC and crappy internet connection.

Sound: It's a Final Fantasy game. The soundtrack is excellent. I also love the voice acting, though Barret's voice doesn't fit his dialogue as well as the other characters (in my opinion anyway).

Controls: I'm using mouse and keyboard and it's obviously meant to be played with a gamepad. It's a bit clunky, but it's fine. I'd use a controller, but I'm lazy and the controller is all the way on the other side of the room--probably ain't gonna happen.

Gameplay: This ain't your granddad's FF7. Combat is faster, more fluid, and a lot more satisfying than it was back in the day. Don't get me wrong, I love some good turn-based combat, but this feels so much better. It's more strategic and more thrilling. 

Putting it all simply: this is, from what I can tell, the same game that well all (presumably) know and love, just with a much nicer coat of paint. It feels like the game they had in mind all those years ago but could never have been able to deliver due to, ya know, technology being what it was then vs now. It feels familiar while also feeling like a fresh experience. Exactly what was needed.",1694467542,1694467542,True,1,0,0.491957604885101318,0,True,False,False

-Visuals are great (graphics, effects and art direction)
-Combat is fun and engaging, has build potential. But it gets repetitive real fast, so you have to constantly switch between characters.
-Performance is silky smooth ( I don't know about other people, but I'm playing on an 11400 and an RX 6700 XT)
-Great voice acting 
-expanded characters

Cons:

-Too many unnecessary and un-skippable walking/talking sections and squeezing through tight spaces. This is my major issue with the game. Sometimes you just WANT TO PLAY THE GAME and not be forced to walk very very slowly while another character spits out exposition every five minutes.  I dread the thought of having to go through the first Aerith section on a second playthrough.

-Too many filler in order to extend the game. There's this part where the character switches to Aerith and she has to go to 7th Heaven to rescue Marlene.  In this segment you're basically just running through a corridor where debris blocks the path in fixed routes. It absolutely serves NO PURPOSE other than to artificially extend the runtime or provide a false sense of tension. The sequence could've been easily executed as a cutscene. 

Speaking of cutscenes... filler also extends to the cutscenes where characters sometimes have awkward pauses and roundabout dialogue. I had moments like where I was 'please just get to the point'.

-Some characters can be really annoying in the way they talk and act. The dialogue can be really bad and unnatural sounding sometimes. 

-Boring sidequests (mostly kill these, fetch that, or find these). 

-Bosses are damage sponges. Especially that stupid f-u-c-k-i-n-g House Boss that took too long to kill. You're required to fight this boss to progress btw.

-No ultrawide support. I had to use Flawless Widescreen to enable this. (look it up. it works on other games as well)

-too many linear corridors that railroad you (slowly) from point A to B

MIXED:
-the writing. It's a Japanese game so expect a lot of Anime bullshit (which can be good or bad for some)

everything from its music, graphics, voice acting, gameplay, style and animiations, this game is so so good, Final Fantassy has been in such a bad spot for such a long time im so glad this hit its mark and for me, I got emotional just to finaly have this game and love it so much

its not without its issues tho, for one, my lord this PC release on the epic games store was a disaster, first of why make it a epic exclusive only to release it on steam a year later anyways? second, the epic games verison of this game is horribly unoptimized, like on some systems almost unplayable, but here on steam? ive had no issues at all on 3 differnt rigs i tested on with varriying hardware set ups (from what ive seen it was a intel CPU problem, no clue if that ever got fix BTW to watch out) on the acutal game front i really only had 2 main problems, first i kinda felt off that at certin points you just slowed down in movement to look at a wall, on first playthrough i get it theres a story to tell but after you beat the game you really should be let loose, and second, the wispers and this whole mulit verse thing there setting up is very bold, but my god i hated the wispers, I get its a metaphor for not wanting to do a one for one on the story but they could have, you know, just tell people the story is going to be differnt or go in a differnt direction, the whole Idea that the wispers are trying to uphold the orginal games story one for one and it being the main point of the first part kinda sucked, not a deal breaker cause the rest of the story and writing are really really good, but it was a mood killer every time they showed up

my favriote thing about this game is how it handles itself with its previously under devolpted characters to give more life and scale to midgar, having wedage biggs and jessie have actual character and back story to uphold there motives for what they do and why was, just awsome and it was well writen too, giving more scale and life to midgar is awsome too. It really felt like midgar is more then just a mega city theres so much more to it that I truly loved to see that the orginal never got to cause of how little you where there

gameplay is a little mixed, for one I love how much weight and flair was added to the combat, it makes fights fun with how much is going on, all the smooth animimations with all the effects are so good and gives combat a lot of style with each character having uniqe combat styles that fit them, but thats also a problem in itself, this game was not kind to barret and arith, easly the worst party members in the game, cloud and tifa just are too good at raw damage that the other 2 dont feel like they have a place in the game, barret is a pea shooter that can move and arith is supposed to be like a mage but enemys can and will easily move out of the way whenever you use her uniqe attack its really frustrating, also the fact that there are so many flying enemys with this poor air combat really sucks sometimes, barret is the best for air enemys but if hes not availible in the party then your kinda screwed so hope you enjoy tons of landing lag on cloud and tifa

music, music music music, one of the biggest parts of how iconic the orginal game was, and my god I was not ready for how amazing and impactful this games music is, you can tell how much effort went into not only preserving the soul and Identity of each returning song, but how much passion was put into also giving each song, no matter if it was orginal or returing, its own twist and swing, hearing jenova and its 3 phases almost made me cry for how beautify it was, starting slow and more cinamatic at first as the fight gets more intense and too its apex to phase 3 hitting you with this massive wave of nolstagia all at once to finish her off, this games music didnt get enough reconition for its work and it really sucks too as this was long time series composer Nobuo Uematsu last final fantassy game before moving on to other projects, he did however vet the new guy to make sure the remake games are in good hands and considering how good this games music was with him merly supervising and not being the outright composer? I think its safe to say he found the perfect man for the job, we will miss you sir, thank you for all you given us

my last main point is the lack of a real endgame/super boss, somthing final fantassy is really known for, having some of the hardest and most challenging superbosses in gaming history, well its sad to admit but this game has no true endgame and its ""super boss"" is kinda a joke, hopfuly the next 2 games fix this part cause bulid crafting and min maxing is not at all required to compete in the endgame which sucks cause thats part of the fun for this series

Overall, remake is truely the worth its long dev cycle and how long we had to wait for it, from its strong and loveable cast of charactes, to its powerful and amazing music, all the way to its chilling clifhanger, the Final Fantassy 7 remake is one of my favriote games ever, even with its few bumps and cracks, its still going down as one of my favriote games ever, and sue me but should have won game of the year in 2020

The story is revisionist whitewashing, changing the characters from interesting and flawed into pristine marble statues.

That's right friends, nobody on the heroes side did anything wrong, and you don't need to trouble yourselves thinking about how the main characters would have to deal with any moral dilemmas.

You can then enjoy several hours of side missions, running around the slums of Midgar, getting the people to like you. Because, you know, that's what Cloud cares about. And it's not a waste of time at all!

The whole game feels stretched thin, with very little substance and no real heart. Even the combat feels clunky and unrewarding. It feels a lot like a movie with some game mechanics tagged on.

Never played the original but I found this game close to perfect, for my personal taste.

The graphics are impressive.
The combat system is a perfect mix between KH, FF12 and FF13 (If you liked these games, you should definitely play it).
Materias and weapons development make characters customization really enjoyable (customization never feels like too much, nor too little).
The story starts a bit slow but gets better and better as the chapters go on, I think the same can be said of music. 

The screen going white is the only bug I've experienced so far, but it can be really annoying, especially if it occurs during a fight.

Get this game on sale, and play one good playthrough on Normal difficulty and you'll have fun. But if you're looking for a game with replay value and to 100% - go somewhere else.

While I enjoyed my first playthrough, running through it again on hard and for achievements has felt boring and unfulfilling. Cutscenes and visuals are great, and i've enjoyed the new directions taken with the story, but the gameplay and performance are severely lacking. I'll go back and 100% this eventually, but more than half way through my hard playthrough has me pretty bored, as now it's just running through the same things again with nothing left to upgrade/enhance/progress...I just don't feel like continuing right now. Beating the game on normal WAS fun, but easy - which i thought was fine for the first run to take in the updated story and stuff...then starting off in hard mode was also fun, the difficulty on the first boss felt right where it should have been but i was still around level 42 at that point. After leveling to max and all the AP buffs, even hard got way too easy...and that also happened way too quick

Combat felt fun at first, but gets boring pretty quick. I didn't really feel like I grew a whole lot as the game progressed - instead of skills feeling like they're useful and necessary for later battles, it just felt like I got more and more overpowered, while the difficulty didn't really increase. This feels especially true on my hard mode playthrough, having max level, all skills, and high level materia allows you to cheese hard mode fights too, and it doesn't feel like there's any difficulty to it. The game also gives you a 3x EXP and 2x AP boost after your first run to make progression even easier - there's literally no way to prevent yourself from just being totally op unless you create some sort of personal challenge to do so. And with no option to just start a new game from scratch on hard, there's just no real challenge besides learning a couple extra mechs per fight. The hardest parts of the game are the simulator superbosses and the yuffie dlc box breaking challenge.

The game hasn't performed well on PC either - it suffers from a lot of stuttering and FPS drops, and there doesn't seem to be much rhyme or reason to it. You'll experience this even just running around normally. Half the guides on Steam are just for mods available to try and fix this. it's unfortunate that there are these issues still after this modern game has been out for quite a bit. Hoping this is fixed ahead of the next installment. 

Also have some complaints about some minor bugs in battles. You can quite easily lose your ATB/MP to an attack just never coming out - not getting interrupted by anything, just the attack just doesn't happen for some reason. I don't really think this one is a bug - but there are also transitions between fight phases where you can do zero damage to the boss, and unless you know it's coming, you can easily waste valuable attack resources on that too. Also had a few frustrating instances of getting stuck on things or places, issues with switching targets, issues with the camera, etc. It's also very tedious to stop attacking when you need to to avoid an incoming mechanic and this gets to the point where it's easier and more efficient to just get hit and continue doing a couple extra hits of damage. Trading attacks in a game with action focused combat really doesn't feel fun. There are a few bugs that have been fixed over time too - there were some accessories that would sometimes just fail to work and it's really annoying to have a character die because they were put to sleep even through they're wearing a headband to prevent that exact scenario - but at least that has been fixed. But all that adds up to the combat feeling draining and boring.",1693187517,1693187517,False,1,1,0.497925341129302979,0,True,False,False

By updated story, I am talking about the dozens of hours put into the game which would take you like 3 hours on the original game. That's right, this whole game is about 3 hours of the original game. So there is a lot of new stuff to do and explore.

It also touches on things in the original that you could only speculate on, and this game outright shows you more of the backstory. Which is great, but I think the next part might suffer in terms of being a ""faithful"" remake.

Without going into spoilers, this game is obviously not a one for one remake. That's fine, and is probably a good thing. The original story line wasn't very good but the adventure was. While the dialogue and cutscenes are odd, I do think the story is overall better so far. The way this game sets up the next game makes me believe that this will be a different story all together with the same events, and more then likely a different conclusion to the story.

Gameplay for the most part is set up very well. I like how they modernized the game, but it does suffer from the fact that the characters you do not control don't really do anything. That might be a good thing since the game is very easy once you get the hang of it. I don't think there was a single instance I had to reload from a death, and I only had a character down a handful of times.

Because of the gameplay, there were a few fights that had to change. So the elevator fight in the original is now a lobby fight. Being vague on purpose. However it would have added more complexity to a unique fight in the original.

I do not know if the free form of the combat changed so much in terms of difficulties in battles but I do not think I used a single item in a fight outside of a phoenix down once or twice. Again this game was very easy on normal, and the only ""difficult"" fights were just people who were sponges that just took it so it was a time sink more than anything.

I look forward to replaying this on hard mode, and I definitely look forward to the future parts. I don't know if this game is worth $70 or any game for that matter.

The story, while complicated, is fun to see unfold and the characters are very memorable. As such, I was very excited to play this game. I originally completed this game on PS4 back in 2020 and I recently played it again on Steam Deck. After playing the game for over 70 hours across the PS4 and PC, I can say that this game is very good but does not live up to the magic of the original.

Story: I didn't play the game when it first launched on PS4, so I already heard the complaints about the story being different before playing this game. The remake follows the story that is explained in the first 4-5 hours of the original FF7. There are new twists and a bunch of side stories that allow the player to experience Midgar on a deeper level. Everything was going along with the original story until the ending where the story takes a radically different turn. Basically, it's turning an already confusing story even more confusing. If you are expecting the remake's story to be the same as the original game, then I advise not getting this game.  In my opinion, the original game's story is way better and easier to understand.

Combat: I'm very conflicted with the combat in this game. On one hand, it is really satisfying once you master the combos and customize a materia setup that suits you the best. On the other hand, you can get severely punished for mistiming an ability or making similar slip ups. The ATB system is a neat idea but it can be very frustrating if you need multiple actions done in a short time span. Couple that with the really long boss fights and you have a recipe that makes the boss fights agonizingly painful. I never realized it at first, but the last two chapters pretty much have 5 boss fights, not including the final boss. I only realized this on my 2nd play through on PC. The combat is definitely the weakest part of this game in my opinion.

Music: The music is very good. I even purchased the full soundtrack after I completed the game back in 2020. The original FF7's soundtrack is one of my favorite video game soundtracks of all time, so listening to new versions and remixes of the music pleased me very much. 

Voice acting: The voice acting in this game is pretty good. I think the actors who played their respective roles did a phenomenal job with delivering their lines. There are some lines that were pretty awkward but I don't expect dialogue and writing to be a top priority in a modern Square Enix game. 

Overall, I think this game is pretty good. It has some good elements here and there, but it is definitely not as good as the original. The original game had this magic and feeling that really hooked me in the first few hours. The remake doesn't have that and it is pretty disappointing especially when people hyped it up when it was teased a few years ago.

Oh and here are my thoughts on the Yuffie story: The story is fun and it is fun to play as Yuffie, but I think it is stupid that I couldn't experience the DLC on PS4. One of my main reasons for buying this game again on PC was for the DLC. At most the DLC is only 2-3 hours long and the story isn't all that memorable. If you have completed FF7 Remake on PS4 but haven't experienced the Yuffie story, I don't recommend buying this game. At most, you are getting 2-3 hours of extra content for buying the game again. 

Here is my advice: If you are a new player that wants to experience the story of FF7 for the first time, then I recommend playing the original game on Steam. Not only will it make the references and easter eggs in the remake more sense, but you can appreciate the elements of the original game that made the game iconic.",1692768803,1692769422,True,15,1,0.638124346733093262,0,True,False,False

Especially the gameplay part of it. A balance between action and rpg. While it leans more toward rpg, some bossess and especially superbossess require you to react reflexively to each attack to defeat them.

Each party member has a role in story and in combat. And eventho it's not that many, we get to know all combination of them fighting together. Having highlight moments in final fights. And that's what i like about jrpg, shonen power.

First playthrough is just a tutorial ground for more rewarding fights in hard mode. With complete materia, level, and enemy intel, we can fight enemies and bosses in hard mode prepared and proper.

As usual, voice acting and body movements are just like usual jrpg and might not cater to all. But for me, it's great especially barret's voice in english. Would love some more banter between them just like XV.

The story is great introducing elements that make this game will not be the same as its predecessor in light of story. But a tad bit confusing at times.

Materia swapping is annoying when you keep switching characters and have only a handful of high level materias.

The game is ok, but for the price I think its a bit too much for what the story is.
I haven't completed the original FFVII so I can't say how much different it is, but I completed the story in less than 20h. (I think I fell asleep a few times because I stayed up late so you can probably complete it in less) However I haven't really done any side quests, so if you go all out 100% completion it is probably longer.
Still, this doesn't change the fact that the game is priced at ~80€ where I live. If you find it during a sale it might be worth it, but only if you genuinely want to complete it in my opinion.
The graphics however are really good and the game performed well on my pc. I would say that the graphical quality was almost identical to the cutscenes, which is insane.",1692547209,1692547283,False,0,1,0.489510476589202881,3,True,False,False

Although this is only part 1 of the Remake trilogy, Final Fantasy VII Remake delivers on almost all fronts making it a worthy continuation of the FFVII universe. 

What I enjoyed the most from my time with this remake is that it doesn't try to replicate the original game. No, it sets out to do its own thing. From the moment it opens with its simple, yet deep action turn based (ATB) system, Final Fantasy VII Remake boldly tells its audience that it doesn't want to be its predecessor, it wants to evolve, push forward into new uncharted territory. And it excels greatly at that. The fast, slick gameplay offers so much customization with its Materia and upgradable weaponry allows players to play however they feel suitable to them. On top of that, each of the party members have their own fighting styles further mixing up combat! I was thrilled each time I entered battle because I always wanted to try something new.

And I gotta talk about the music, easily some of the best pieces I've heard in the entire franchise even. They turned the Happy Turtle theme into this amazing buttrock track that blessed my ears the moment the first key hit. Also, we can't talk about the music without recognizing how they remixed music from the original in new stunning ways. Yet another example of the game taking what was old, re-polishing it, and pushing things in new ways. To give a new experience to both new and old players.

Though its not without its flaws unfortunately. While I do appreciate the team exploring new character writing and expanding on lore, at some points it becomes a detriment. An example being the Railroad Graveyard. In the original game, the trip was a short breeze; storywise, the gang needed to be quick because of where it takes place in the scenario. However, Remake greatly expands this section to a 3 hour long dungeon which, in my opinion, greatly hurts the game's pacing. And there are more examples of this peppered throughout. Adding to that, the game has numerous segments where the player has to walk across certain platforms slowly and carefully, hold Y to advance, crawl across debris, and so on. I know why they exist in the game, but after a while, the time it takes doing those adds up and can make the slowest parts of the game even more of a slog. Fortunately, the DLC, Intermission cleans some of this up offering better level design and a more fast paced adventure!

What else can I say though? Throughout it all I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Final Fantasy VII Remake and I look forward to seeing where this new journey takes us.",1692487648,1692487648,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This not only pays close attention to the character canon as the original, but it adds a lot more dimension to the character development and helps you connect with them more emotionally through the voice acting, which I give a 9/10. The game play feels slightly hindered during some heavy story parts, but the flow is excellent, the look is gorgeous, and the nostalgia was turned up to 11. I also really enjoyed FFVII: Advent Children and the personalities and look of the characters all reference that well without leaning away from the original FFVII. Though, this installment only takes you up until you leave Midgar, it is really fulfilling and paced well. Also, the Intermission with playing a bit of Yuffie's back story helps her involvement later make more sense. She's also super fun to play. If I were to be critical of a few spots where the lighting looks weird on the characters I'd say that is as far as said critique would really go. I wish the open sandbox feel was a bit easier to access, but at the very least you have the enjoyment of a much more fleshed out Cloud Strife, which I thought was a little lacking in the original. 9.5/10 overall.

[b]Rating: 3/10 - Very Bad[/b]

This game is, to be quite honest, an fucking mess. A visually stunning mess but a fucking mess nonetheless. All they had to do was create a faithful remake of one of the most beloved games of all times. I'm not even saying that everything should have been the same, some attempts at making the story more detailed actually worked well. Jessie went from a throwaway character to a character whose motivations were clear - even if she was annoying as fuck with her constant attempts at trying to get into Cloud's pants. But overall the changes fail, not only that they feel as though they are an insult to the fans of the OG [b]FFVII[/b]. I honestly don't know what was smoked in the development studio but whatever it was it somehow birthed fucking dementors into the FF7 universe, and every time these fucks appear on screen I couldn't help but roll my eyes because I knew that I was about to witness bullshit over 9.000. Without wanting to spoil anything: It is unclear what exactly causes most of the divergences from the original timeline and I doubt any of it will ever be explained, did [spoiler]Sephiroth[/spoiler] fart after he did whatever he did, causing a ripple through time and space that somehow explains why the fuck some of the differences exist? Probably not, it's probably all just a cheap excuse to have the dementors appear on screen.

The story is a fucking embarrassment, not only did they stretch a 6-8 hour story out to 30-35 fucking hours, they also butchered everything that the original stood for and then spat on it. The final chapter is basically just that, an insult to the fans of the original, a cheap attempt at meta commentary that is supposed to seem deep and meaningful but ultimately fails because of how badly it has been written and because of how unnecessary it is in the first place.

Gameplay is mediocre at best, the combat system feels unrefined and not well thought out. They should have either committed to a more turn based system or a more action based system. I didn't mind the command aspect too much, what I did mind though is that there is more unavoidable damage in the game than there is avoidable damage, it feels cheap; seldom did I actually feel like I was killed because I made a mistake, more often I just got stun locked upon entering combat and just watched my health bar disappear into nothingness as though it had never been there in the first place. Who the fuck balanced this shit? A first grader? I did eventually beat the game on Hard mode which was far easier than expected but god was it frustrating. There was absolutely no challenge in this game, only frustration, frustration that made me even less interested in the absolutely butchered version of a story that I remember being quite fond of when I played the original a few years back. I may not have grown up with it but I do faintly remember that I played through the game a few years ago.

The cherry on top of all this bullshit is the atrocious level design solely centered around padding out the run time of the game for as long as possible cause you gotta get a few dozen hours of game time out of this absolute dumpster fire. A dumpster fire that costs 80 fucking €, I feel ripped off and I bought this game during a sale for like 40€. Final Fantasy VII Remake doesn't respect your time and money, nor is it worth either of those.

[h1][b]Final Fantasy VII Intermission[/b][/h1]

[b]Rating: 6/10 - Fine[/b]

The side story is much better than the main game. It doesn't overstay its welcome with an overly padded out story, it has unique combat mechanics that actually give some level of fun to the combat and it has an awesome mini game. I was actually a little disappointed at how quickly this side story ended since I would have loved to see more and experience more of the combat. The synergy system is amazing, it's fun. Honestly had they included it in the main game I might not have disliked the combat quite as much as I ended up doing.

You play as Cloud, a half-man, half-chocobo mercenary who seems to be the center of attention of everyone in Midgar. Everyone seems to be attracted to Cloud this time around and I mean everyone - Tifa, Aerith, Jessie, Biggs, Wedge, Barret, Chadley you name it.

Story is stretched very thin and filled with fillers. Changes made to the story is going to be hit or miss to long time fans, and very confusing to new comers. Also the ending feels like the script was accidentally put on a blender and they tried to piece it back together with scotch tape, it completely bonkers.

Despite it's flaws FF7RI's combat is Fantastic, and I could confidently say that this is the best combat system from any Final Fantasy I've ever played. The combat mechanics is packed with old and new ideas mixed perfectly that it feels both new and familiar, a feat that Square Enix have been trying for years and this time they finally hit the right spot. 

Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade might have the word ""Remake"" on the title, but that isn't entirely true.

Most of the games are cinematics.

This game could have been completed in 4h (the original game takes that to get to the end of this game), but devs decided to make it longer to justify its price. So you end up with a bad game that has nothing good. Everything is just empty. Feels like an unfinished game that not even an Indie company would have released.

[b]STORY: 9.5 (Phenomenal) -[/b] Original fans of Final Fantasy VII had unofficially been dreaming of a modern remake for over 20 years and officially for 15 years when Final Fantasy VII Remake finally launched in 2020. The very idea of getting to experience this one-of-a-kind treasured classic again remade with modern industry technology not only remained a powerful force but steadily swelled through three console generations. What was it about the original game that enchanted millions so thoroughly that they would keep such a hope and dream alive for so long? Ask any legacy fan and the most common answer will be because of how the story was told and how emotionally moving it was for them. As I explained in my review for the original Final Fantasy VII, the story was nothing short of literary magic and a once-in-a-lifetime experience that touched millions of hearts and helped define a generation. Final Fantasy VII Remake took what was only the first 5 hours of the original game and expanded it into a 40 to 50 hour epic to create an incredibly lore rich version of the tale that that small section of the original represented. Aside for the controversy encountered in the final chapter of the game, I find Remake to be the perfect realization of a 20 year dream.

[b]CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT: 10 (Perfect) -[/b] An enormous part of what made the original Final Fantasy VII’s story so memorable was it’s cast of characters and the manner in which their tales were told. At that point in time gamers had never experienced the depth of detail or superb quality of character development that Final Fantasy VII gave us. Part of the dream for a remake was to see that already amazingly deep character development expanded upon even further. The development team clearly understood that and did not disappoint the fans in the least. Characters that already had so much history and richness to them feel practically alive in Remake. Adding to their expanded history is a voice acting cast that I feel is the best ever assembled for any video game. Even NPCs are treated as important parts of the world and sound like real people.

[b]MUSIC: 10 (Perfect) -[/b] The original game’s soundtrack was already legendary and considered one of the finest video game soundtracks ever composed. How is it possible to improve upon something like that? You bring in the original composer (who just so happens to be a true musical genius) to head the music team. This is a soundtrack that is nothing short of a masterpiece. It absolutely stands as Nobuo Uematsu’s opus and this is just game one of three with him leading the musical assets alongside several other supremely talented composers. Every track of this massive OST is, if not a work of art, perfectly written accompaniment to whatever scene, event, or emotion it pairs with. 

[b]VISUAL PRESENTATION: 10 (Perfect) -[/b] Over the years, Final Fantasy VII’s style has changed slightly as it has grown and matured. Even with those changes, they are unmistakably unique to Final Fantasy VII and immediately recognizable. Remake not only establishes a new normal for the universe’s signature style but takes everything the original did and overhauls it, bringing it into the modern environment flawlessly, and fixing the stranger and goofier elements that plagued the original. The end result is a world that feels real enough to get on a train and visit. Just be sure to bring your ID.

[b]GAMEPLAY: 9.8 (Phenomenal) -[/b] As soon as my childhood best friend and I beat the original Final Fantasy VII back in '97, we were daydreaming not only about what a modernized version would look like but would also play like. The physics and combat system Remake offered to the world is exactly what he and I eventually envisioned as our perfect Final Fantasy VII with almost scary accuracy. Remake’s gameplay is as close to perfect as it possible to realistically achieve or expect. In fact, I only found one single point in the system that kept me from giving it a perfect 10. That is where aerial combat is concerned. Melee characters have a difficult time effectively engaging flying enemies. It is annoying enough for me to shave off the two tenths of a point from an otherwise perfect score but since there is always the option to switch to a ranged character or use magic, this is effectively a non-issue.

[b]CONTENT: 10 (Perfect) -[/b] I believe the part of Final Fantasy VII Remake that I have seen the most complaints about is with the side quests and extra content with respect to it being too disruptive to the flow of the main story. Personally, I found it all to be perfectly planned and executed. On its own the main story flow is essentially perfect. The side quests and extras are not too numerous or too scattered to effect that flow in any negative manner. Honestly, I think they were perfectly placed and interwoven with the main story in a manner that introduced more depth and lore that never breaks the flow of the overall narrative. The only exceptions to this are the end game challenges. Since those really do not even become available until after you have cleared the main story they have no real effect on the flow at all.

[b]GRAPHICS*: 9.5 (Phenomenal) -[/b] The first thing the world could not help but marvel at when we first saw Remake was the amazing graphics. The gaming world was blown away by how incredible it looked and for good reason. Square Enix absolutely pushed the PS4 hardware to its limits with this game. What we got was practically a PS5 title on the PS4. The PS5/PC Intergrade version pushed it even further and looked even more realistic. In short, Remake's graphics are absolutely stunning in every way down to the smallest details. The only problems are the now infamous areas where low resolution textures appear instead of higher resolution versions. While starkly noticeable against all of the super high quality assets around them, they are very specific and isolated occurrences.

[b]TOTAL (CORE): 9.9 (Phenomenal) [/b]

[b]TOTAL (EXPANDED)*: 9.8 (Phenomenal) [/b]


[b]FUN FACTOR: 10 (Perfect) -[/b] I have so much fun just playing Remake that if I were forced to choose a single game to have to play over and over, I would choose it without having to think. The combat system alone is fun enough to get lost in for hours and that is with just taking out common trash enemies. Add in the many cinematic boss fights and challenges and I could spend days straight replaying most of the game.

As I have explained before, I am a legacy super fan of the original Final Fantasy VII. It is my all-time favorite game to the point of knowing the lore and errata inside and out for the entirety of the extended universe. I was one of those dedicated followers who waited 23 years for this dream to come true and that saw the first potential for it at the infamous E3 2005 tech demo. I will proudly admit that I was as hyper-critical of Final Fantasy VII Remake as I was excited for it. The development was guided by such love, passion, and respect for the original that they were true to every detail I could have nitpicked. The only question that remains is what the story will look like once the Remake project is complete.",1686194513,1691287221,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Port: The frames are capped at 120 and ultrawide resolution are not natively supported. You cannot unlock frames without mods. In addition, with FlawlessUltrawide, the maps are messed up with artifacts. Not to mention, if you try to play with just keyboard and mouse, good luck. Your bindings won't even matter because you can't rebind changing characters. Therefore, you better use a controller even though it's a PC game. 

Combat: Absolute worse mash up between turned base and action base. The camera is notorious. Your character actions aren't rewarded. The combos are so simple that a child can learn them in 20 minutes. If you play any fighting games or DMC5, you can breeze through them. The skill expression for the ""action"" is non-existent. The turn based is all dependent on the ATB bar. It is absolutely infuriating how items consume a whole bar. If you're not in control of the character, the AI might as well go out for a smoke. They're useless without you switching commands every 10 seconds. Not to mention, there are fights where you cannot go damageless. Also, why is the enemy's priority target always the character your controlling? The game is easy but so tedious. You barely even see the spectacle of your characters' action if your want to min/max the gameplay.

[h1]Okay, let's get the good stuff out of the way:[/h1]
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The atmosphere and design of this game are top notch and if you are a fan of the original, you will likely want to play this game. The soundtrack is amazing. The changes are not over the top at first and slowly creep in until you get to the last chapter which literally goes off the rails. There's a lot of ""bear ass"" quests, but it's not excessively tedious and most of the content is pretty good. Combat with regular enemies is fun once you get used to it and summons and powers are great.

[h1]The medium stuff:[/h1]
=========================
Boss fights can be a slog as they are all damage the bosses weakness until the boss is stunned and then wail on them. Every single one of them goes like this. Some of them have awesome cut scenes but they are all basically dodge roll fights where you wait for the exact moment.  The linear story is exceptionally medium and only escapes being negative because of how good 90% of the game is. 


[h1]The negative:[/h1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Basically that whole last chapter. Everything about it. It knocks the whole game down. 

[spoiler]Goddammit Nomura. First of all, for a narrative based around defying fate and change you chose an ironic choice to put the players into a linear time travel story. This makes no design sense at all. If you wanted to do time travel, you should have been WAAY more open ended and allowed players to make changes to the story line. 

Secondly, the way this works doesn't make any sense and removes all stakes in the future and remembered history of the game. If Sephiroth can just time travel at will, he basically is omnipotent. You can't actually kill him, he can come back at any point in the timeline, and he can retry indefinitely. There are no stakes for changing things because we literally killed fate in the first game. Who cares what happens now? Sephiroth can just time travel and change things. Hell, we should be Sephiroth in the next game. There's no cost to anything and no causality to hold it together. Why not?

Thirdly, that whole last chapter is one long ass boss fight slog. It could be 90 minutes of boss fights with the cut scenes included. There was really no need to do that, because IMMEDIATELY AFTER the escape the group goes to a town to discuss Sephiroth. Which would have been a much better place to jump off the deep end. Everyone is talking about Sephiroth and what happened in Nibelheim. It would have explained a lot of shit  (like who the fuck the Zack is and why Cloud hates Sephiroth) and let the players cool down before the end battle for a bit. It also would have  made much more sense to throw in the timeline stuff at that point because you can take the direction of everyone else remembering things differently. ""When did this happen?"" ""No, it happened this way."" Then you let the player realize Sephiroth is trying to subtly change things and he can confront the party at that point. But it literally just goes right off the rails. [/spoiler]



I don't know how invested I am in the future of this line of games. After that last chapter, I may not even bother.",1690722026,1690723331,False,0,1,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

The combat system is very different from the original. It's real-time, you can run around freely and dodge (though you don't have any iframes).  When your ATB bar fills up (over time and from attacking) you can do stuff other than basic attack. Namely spells, items, moves from yellow materia, and the new moves characters learn from their weapons.  You only control one character at a time. The others will do basic attacks and dodge, and slowly fill up their ATB gauges.

There aren't random encounters.  There are monsters you'll encounter when in set areas, and they respawn slowly, but you don't get the traditional ""walk walk walk FIGHT"" anymore.  This is fine because that can be kind of tedious, but also kind of a bummer because the combat system is fun and you don't actually spend that much time with it.

This also means you don't really get to spend a lot of time with the other character's combat styles unless you go out of your way to switch to them.  You can easily cruise through most of the game on cloud and never spend much time with Tifa's moves. Which is a shame because her moves are cool and fun.  Barret's alright, too.  Aeris I felt suffered because despite her potentially massive MP pool, it's hard to spam spells with how ATB works.  Also there's only like one ""All"" materia (called Magnify), and it weakens the spell when used now.

Each weapon you find has its own skill the wielder can learn. They're slightly annoying to unlock - it'll be like ""Stagger an enemy with this move"" or ""finish off an enemy"".  But there's no random encounters and respawn rates are slow. I got a mod that makes respawns instant so I could unlock more of Tifa's moves without waiting around.  The skills are fine, but I didn't go super deep on what to use when because there wasn't a big opportunity to do so, and the game was easy enough it didn't demand it.

In the original FF7 (and 4-6, too) the random encounters weren't very difficult. The same is true, here. For me, part of the fun in the original games was coming up with ways to win those fights with the best of fast + easy + cheap.  Slash-all + added-effect:death, Ultima+mp-absorb, etc.  In this game, the fights are infrequent, easy, and full heals are common.  There's not much incentive to go deep on your loadouts, nor is there really a lot of time to.

The materia largely work the same as the original, with some significant differences.  Most of them don't debuff your stats anymore, so loading up with magic doesn't have any drawbacks. They also don't produce a new copy when mastered, which is a bummer.  You can't give everyone Elemental support because there's only one in the main game.

Summons have been changed to be kind of bad.  Each character can only equip one. They can only be used in fixed fights, and only once per battle.  They summon the appropriate dude and provide some special moves that need your ATB to use, but that's it.  In the original they were a lot more impactful.

The story is alright.  It's very similar to the original, but then it starts to diverge. I had some suspicions about what was going on. I'm intrigued about what the rest of the games will do.

It's a little weird but not surprising they made tifa mega be-boobed but made her arms and legs kind of tiny.

There's some optional post-game stuff I haven't done. I might go back and do it if they do some sort of save-import to the next game.  None of it seems as deep as like fighting emerald weapon or getting the master-materias from the original.

There's a DLC where you play as Yuffie. I'll probably play that.

Overall I liked it. I'm left wanting more. More time with the combat system. More opportunity to play with builds. More muscle on Tifa. More boss fights. Hopefully they finish remaking it and release it on PC before we all die of old age.",1690658629,1690658629,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Anyway I played the original at least 10 times. Its one of the most memorable games I have ever played and sadly this ""remake"" doesn't live up to its potential.

Leaving aside the main story changes for now, it doesn't seem like the creators understood what made the original such a classic. Side quest are MMO fetch quests given by NPCs I dont care about. Usually they dont take to long but its such an obvious time stretcher that you just cant enjoy any of it. In the original the side content was way more naturally integrated and it didnt feel like a drag to do it.

Combat is so-so. It looks fantastic and definitely has great moments but at the same time it often is to chaotic and is lacking any strategic depth. It also gets kinda repetitive by the end due to the lag of depth. 

The changes they made to the story are probably the biggest offender especially at the end.I dont want to go into to much details but you can tell they didnt change the story because it felt natural to so, they did it because they wanted to let the first remake part end on an epic note. But it doesnt work at all. I somewhat understood what was going on since Ive played all the necessary content but someone who hasnt played the original will have no idea what the hell is going on or who these characters are.

So im not sure who this remake is for. Its not for the veterans from back in the day because they would have preferred the original with new visuals. Its not for new players because they dont know what the hell is happening at the end.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note: This is a general review. Might do a detailed one later.

I absolutely loved the first installment of Final Fantasy VII Remake: Integrade. It brought much of the nostalgia back from the original game with a variety of beautiful things. The story is different in some regards and a little bit lighter in the section it covered thus far. I only have a few gripes with the Remake, but they stem from the ongoing issues Square Enix allows to plague the FF franchise--mainly on PC. (For the TL;DR version of this review, scroll to the bottom XD).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Story
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, the story. Albiet this is only the first of three, how they tweaked the overall plot is not at all bad to me. I enjoyed how the devs explored the world of Midgar a bit more than in the original, giving depth and realism to the world of its citizens. I felt I was right along with each person, either empathizing or sympathizing with each person I saw or interacted with. I also enjoyed the game making light of the typical social and moral hierarchy that challenges any nation, addressing people's needs, impact of social classes, ect. 

I got to observe how that did or didn't affect each of the main cast: from Tifa to Cloud, Barret to Aerith, and so on. I could go on to give specific examples, but I could talk about it all day. I might give an in depth analysis one day, but today is not that day. Anyway, there were many facets of the political life and social life that affected our characters and I think how it influenced their decisions to take the actions they did. Barret is an ideal example of how corporate greed corrupts the government and he and some others in the working class/impoverished respond to that kind of treatment.

The story is pretty straightforward and predictable but gave a few nice twist and turns in comparison to the OG FF7. Although it was predictable, it was still very enjoyable to play through and witness. It was every bit of impactful I wanted and more.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Characters and Relationships
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The characters, the depth each is explored in this installment, and their designs is beautiful. One of the biggest surprises was Tifa's development. She was always portrayed as a pure bad ass not afraid of anything to me. But, they added some innocence, timidness, and more emotion. I think these are positive imo. I felt it gave more depth to her character and more meaning. A badass in combat, a badass in general, but showing how vulnerable and human she is. Cloud will be Cloud XD. Although seeing in literal detail how he seems to be this emotionless ex-SOLIDER to showing the cracks in his armor as the story progressed. Giving light to his past, his PTSD,  trying to be vulnerable with others, and showing that he is a human too. 

For Aerith, I pictured her as the steadfast, at times silent, innocent, and playful gal. I saw much of that in OG FF7, but seeing that she was the opposite of Tifa at times was pleasantly surprising. It's as if the devs made her the badass Tifa was in the original game.  Barret is Barret. Loved every ounce of him in this remake. I don't think there's too many changes I saw with him, other than seeing his raw emotion in 3D action! In general, I think the devs did wonderfully for our cast. The examples I gave are just a snippet of my thoughts on the matter.

The development of the relationships seemed a bit more intimate. Although they were phenomenal in the original game, I felt with with more sounds, voice overs, and more amazing visuals, I felt more immersed.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Combat System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I absolutely loved the combat system. Integrating the KH model with their twist took me back. It was wonderful re-experiencing a much beloved game mechanic that defined the KH console games. I hope they keep it in the next 2 FF7R installments! Being able to switch characters on a whim and give the AI-controlled chars commands when their ATB gauge filled was so much fun. There's so many strats and combos a person can do.

Being able to save at any point in the game is always going to be amazing! The characters following you around and doing their own things at times made the game feel more immersive. When they followed me around, it reminded me of the old school party following in the older games. But no one stayed in a straight line this time xD.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Frustrations with the Game
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

Graphical issues:

My gripes about the game are the same as in any of the installments with the games proceeding FF10 and later. The first issue is with graphics. In the year of our lord 2020 and later, the graphics still differ from the cinematic. When FF10 first came out, I can forgive SE for pushing for lower quality graphics on characters, environment, ect.--from like 15-20 years ago. When FF7R came out in 2020 for console and last year for PC, this is unacceptable. While the graphics are almost on par with the cinematic visuals, it's still noticeable. The games have come a long way in terms of this context. However, FF7R should be an example of how games with a lot of quality about them should be meeting the standards or exceeding them. There should be no excuse as to why SE pushes for jaggy, blocky, and unrefined details in the game. Shadow of the TR for example, met or exceeded graphical expectations in every possible imo. FF7R being a remake of this calibur, should do the same, if not better. 

To be fair to the game though, the graphics are almost on par and I tolerate them. From certain angles and distances, the graphics look fine. Movement and combat is more fluid looking too. But, that's all I can say about it. Fingers, boots, ect. still look noticeably blocky and overall graphics still look like they were made from top of line visuals from 2013-2015. And if SE is going to make faces and hair look like they are from 2020/like the cinematic visuals, make the the rest of their bodies to match! What's with the standard of making the faces look real and the rest of the body look like Black Friday crowds stepped all over them?? I want to see those beautiful ankles of Aerith's look real, too! >:C

Optimization Issues:

One more gripe is the stuttering issue that plagues the PC versions of FF games since FF10. Each game has similar issues, and ones unique to a game. I didn't experience the green screen effect from cutscenes like FF10 or the game crashing all the time like in FF13 or FF13-2 (of the latter I was never able to play on PC, cos it always crashed after the intro, even after trying a bunch of mods). I did experience moderate stuttering and frame drops in FF7R Integrade though. I wish SE would optimize the PC ports of all these games and not force the community to come up with workarounds to get these games to work well enough to play. I did look into a couple of community guides and workarounds before I started playing FF7R. They did mostly work. I did experience stutters though as I said. It did take away from cuscenes and fighting at times. But, I guess since I got these workarounds kicking first, it was bearable.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Conclusion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overall, I very much enjoyed this game for its story, characters, environments, exploration of Midgar, somewhat new take on FF7, and seeing a more realistic Tifa :Cloudsmugface:...I MEAN AERITH'S ANKLES. Yes. That. XD

Two major issues that continue to take away from the experience is graphics refinement and optimization of the FF PC ports. For FF7R, for me it was moderate stutters and fps dips.

Very much looking forward to FF7R Rebirth...whenever that comes to PC XD T_T

As a die-hard fan of the iconic Final Fantasy VII, I was both excited and somewhat skeptical when Square Enix announced the release of FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE INTERGRADE for the PC platform. Having played the original remake, I wondered how they could possibly improve upon an already impressive game. However, after delving into this upgraded version, I can confidently say that Intergrade not only met my expectations but exceeded them in every way possible.

Graphically, FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE INTERGRADE on PC is an absolute masterpiece. The enhanced visuals take full advantage of the PC platform's capabilities, providing stunning character models, richer environments, and more immersive settings. The lighting effects are nothing short of breathtaking, breathing new life into the world of Midgar. The level of detail is so remarkable that even minor elements contribute significantly to the overall atmosphere and storytelling.

The most significant addition to the game is the inclusion of a new episode centered around Yuffie Kisaragi. This additional content offers a fresh perspective on the narrative and fleshes out the world of Final Fantasy VII even further. Yuffie's dynamic personality and her interactions with established characters inject new energy into the story. This episode seamlessly weaves itself into the main storyline, creating a cohesive and engaging experience.

Combat has also been refined for the PC version, making the battles more dynamic and thrilling. The combat system remains true to the original's action-oriented mechanics but incorporates additional layers of strategy and depth. Players can now switch between characters during battles, allowing for better tactical coordination and exploiting enemy weaknesses effectively. The combination of this new feature and Yuffie's unique fighting style introduces refreshing gameplay that keeps players on their toes.

Square Enix has optimized the game for the PC platform, resulting in improved loading times and seamless transitions between areas. The game runs smoothly at a consistent frame rate, enhancing the overall gaming experience and minimizing any interruptions.

Beyond the technical aspects, the musical score remains as breathtaking as ever. The remastered soundtrack, accompanied by the unforgettable melodies of the original Final Fantasy VII, beautifully enhances the emotional depth of each scene and brings nostalgia rushing back for longtime fans.

Though the base game itself was already a masterpiece, FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE INTERGRADE elevates it to a new level. With enhanced graphics, the fantastic addition of Yuffie's episode, refined combat mechanics, and optimized performance, it provides both newcomers and series veterans an unforgettable journey through the beloved world of Final Fantasy VII.

In conclusion, FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE INTERGRADE  is a must-play for fans of the original and an essential experience for anyone who enjoys captivating storytelling, thrilling combat, and breathtaking visuals. Square Enix has undoubtedly set a new standard for remakes, and I cannot wait to see what the future holds for this beloved franchise.",1690346742,1690346742,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I don't think I'd classify this as an effective/quality remake. The whole point of Midgar from the original game was to set the story. There's so many significant plot changes to this that I feel its more like some alternate universe storyline versus the original it was based around. The rehashed soundtrack has its highlights, but there was some glorious nostalgia to the OG stuff and I feel they deviated too far from it. 

I would say the combat is enjoyable for the most part and has decent flow/controls. Good mixture of live/turn based. 
The storyline and plot points though - wtf. Climbing the staircase of the pillar just to take these drawn out pauses for what? effect? didn't feel it at all. and the excess side stuff just felt like fluff.

If I had never played FFVII original, this would be alright - but to classify it as a remake it falls superbly short. Like, the whole point of Sephiroth is the mystery/suspense and to be overpowering to the 9's. But lets just pop him up all over the place for no damn reason. And then lets lay out a plot line like we are supposed to alter the future of Aerith; the biggest catalyst in OG is her death. 
end of the rant

If you never played OG then this will be alright (except the visual issues as explained in other reviews)
If you've played OG and were committed - This game will dissappoint you and sadden you, both story and price.

It is hard to explain why without spoiling things

If you have not played the original you are going to enjoy the first 90% of the game, but the last 10% will likely leave you so confused and turned off that you are not likely to want anything to do with FFVII in any form for a while.
[spoiler] This is not a remake, this is a time travel/multi-universe sequel. Important plot points from the original are not explained at all and the game just assumes you have played FFVII AND Crisis Core. Causing a new player to be completely confused. And if you want to ""catch up"" on the lore to understand it you will get completely spoiled on both FFVII and Crisis Core [/spoiler]

If you are a fan of the original (and by fan I mean someone who played FFVII, Crisis Core, watched Advent Children etc) then just get it, don't read any reviews etc. You are in for a ride with your favourite characters and you will likely really like the game.

Overall I am very mixed on the game. I have played FFVII long time ago, and have not completed it (but read up on what happens), played Crisis Core fully, watched Advent Children. [spoiler] I just wanted a remake. I wanted to introduce my wife who has not played/watched any of the FFVII games and for myself to finally get the full FFVII experience. This is what I had for the first 90% of the game (more or less), but the last 10% is a complete mess for both new and returning players. For new ones = ultimate confusion. Why is Sephiroth bad? Wtf is this Cloud looking dude with black hair? None of this is explained in any way. And for returning players? Fuck If I wanted to watch a Marvel multiverse stuff I would watch Marvel. I didn't come here to read fanfiction about ""what if Sephiroth/Aerith time travels into the past to change it"". It all feels extremely corny, hamfisted, sudden and like an excuse to give all the Aerith fans FFVII where she does not die. This is FFVII-2 part 1, not FFVII Remake. Funny enough how FFXIII-2 was also a time travel story, and it sits at a well deserved mixed. [/spoiler]

Other than the Story concerns the game is absolutely great. Amazing OST, Graphics, Fun combat system mixing an action game with a JRPG in an interesting way. Side content is a little bit tacked on, but it is just small part of the overall package. Despite all of these positives I am not coming back for the part 2.

I am giving thumbs down since there is no neutral ranking. [spoiler] If they rename the game to FFVII-2 part 1 I will gladly change my rating to positive. False advertising is NOT OKAY [/spoiler]",1690102809,1690102964,False,94,13,0.603302538394927979,13,True,False,False

Update 3:
Quiting halfway through Yufi's story Intermission (2/5 Chapters). The re-use of cutscenes I just watched in the main game is really sloppy; I skipped one of these and apparently missed half the story of how yufi gets to the shinra building (lame af). Objectives locations/markers are just terrible to use. I hate the concept of adding Fort Condor and 100x more breakable boxes to fluff out the game time since Yufi actually traverses the overworld quickly (as Cloud should have). Why do I have to switch 5 weapons in the first 2 hours of gameplay? The combat is cool but I feel like the RPG element is non-existent aside from wasting time menuing.

Update: Chapter 16/18 40 hours played. This is only disc 1 of the original FF7 game. A massive let down and extremely annoying money thieving move. Wait for 2035 and buy the full 3 game package on sale. 1/10 such a con.

 Former review: I wasn't able to change the default monitor to my secondary monitor. Refund requested. I'm just looking to play a little bit at a time and its a hassle to do extra work for my casual fun time. Hoping there's a fix in the future to repurchase on sale. **Update: this was patched a few months after my initial refund.

-update After struggling with setting up controller. Really dissapointed in the ""customizability"" of the controllers. Sure you can set anything as any button, but it also makes your vehicle and menu buttons absolutely F^CKED.

- I have to add in some of my most hated parts of the first 10 hours of playtime. There were at least 5 forced walking sections (not short walks either). These walking sections usually require you to wait for npcs to climb ladders are stand in a specific spot before you can move into the ""trigger"" for the scene. 
 
- ""arrows"" and ""panels"" are extremely finicky and may require you to back up and run directly forward into it to be interactable. side note on the ""arrows"" these sections are not unidirectional contrary to their appearance and you'll have to move up to go right followed by right to go up and the left to go right in order to traverse a narrow passageway at a snails pace.

- The AI for companions and summons is bonkers R^tarded. they'll run into walls because they can't remember how they just pathed to escape a monsters attack.

- THIS IS AN EXTREMELY SLOW PACED GAME WITH FAST PACED COMBAT.

Last 2 chapters feel a bit rushed but since they said that the game will have 3 parts its okay.

Pros: Fights are fun and feel dynamic, story is extremely good, overall environment art and design is well thought and implemented. Since you are able to switch characters during fights it offers a variety of fighting styles. The game has Tifa and Aerith in it. Aerith is cute and all but i would fight Sephiroth for Tifa. *wink*

Cons: Bloom and Auto exposure settings sometimes glitch out when transitioning from different post process volumes, you need to save and load if this happens. 
Some particle effects, especially the whispers are not optimized enough. Some pre rendered cutscenes are also glitching a lot when loading. Some light bake problems exist on small props due to normal bake errors or not using bigger lightmaps but this was probably done on purpose to save on hard disc space so i will let it slide.

2. The lowest price I have seen this game go for is 40 bucks. Considering who Square Enix is, this feels greedy to me and it's not a good look. They act like they have the midas touch but really they're like any other luxury brand, making a mid tier product polished, up selling it with the brand name, and being a bit pretentious about it.

The soundtrack was astonishing and beautiful, adding to the overall experience.

Final Fantasy VII is one of the most beloved Square Enix franchises to date. This remake not only resonates with fans of the original, on the original Playstation, but with new players as well. The complete package with the DLC, formally a PS5 exclusive, made it's way to Steam with great rapport.

There is so much hype behind this series for good reason. The story, the setting, the characters, the gameplay, the mechanics, the music, the art, the design, the graphic, everything about this game is made with skill and passion, and it shows.

This game is worth well over the asking price for what you get. It's a fantastic experience, that should not be passed. The replay value is worth it alone. Even if you've never played a Final Fantasy game before, this is the best place to start.

As of the time of writing this review, there are two sequels on the way. They are easily the most anticipated video game releases of our time. The only downside is the next game is releasing as a PS5 exclusive, but will most likely make it's way to Steam in the following year, just as this title did.

It's not a remake, it's a new game that recreates what the original game was like. I think last chapter of the game is massively disappointing though. Doesn't ruin the rest of the game, despite the effort. 

The rest of the game is however plain amazing. I've enjoyed it a lot.

It's far from perfect, just like the original. It didn't go for the safe route. Which for such AAA title is just.. This game is one I didn't think could exist, I thought it couldn't be made anymore. I'm so blessed to have been so wrong.

Something to keep an eye out too is how it utilizes ideas and systems from FF XII and FF XIII. Especially FF XIII borrows are interesting because while playing XIII, I often didn't understand how those systems were even supposed to be enjoyable. Now I know, as this game makes them work while leaving them largely unchanged. FF XII on the other hand is one of my favorite games of all time so borrowing from that is guaranteed to make me happy, and it does.

Some of the borrowed systems don't work tho.This game for example steals MMORPG style quests presumably from XIV, and it is very boring and game'y feeling padding that actively fights against you being immersed in the world of the game.

Similar to XIII, at the end of the game, I was waiting for things to open up and that there finally would be that Final Fantasy feeling of being able to explore things... And it never came. The corridor you were pushed down was way more spacious though, so it didn't feel nearly as bad as FF XIII, but it still triggered bad memories.

The highlight of the game has to be overall fighting, and specifically boss fights. The fight system is interesting, a bit barebones and not too carefully crafted, but boss fights specifically utilize it to an extent I didn't expect.  So many interesting things I found out by facing a new boss that could be beat by utilizing some different interaction I hadn't really used before. Really interesting stuff, and overall just fun times.

Another highlight has to be characters. I think these are the characters from the original game, but fleshed out. The plot fails them at times, but the characters themselves are exactly as I imagined they should be, with depth I honestly didn't even expect. They are simple characters with a lot of depth, which to me was a surprising combination.",1689528559,1689764837,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

For anyone that hasn't experienced the FF7 universe. I highly suggest to watch ff7 Reunion cutscenes-videos (there are plenty on youtube. You don't need to watch all the 5hrs. Just very specific scenes like for example) the Nibelheim incident and Sephiroth's discovery. Cloud and Sephiroth's interaction and of course the ending) or a lot what is happening in this game won't make any sense.

Finish it on normal ~50h + Intermission which was a little too short but definitely worth playing. The game run good on my RTX 2070s at 1440p.

Spun a wheel and it landed on this game. I have played the original Final Fantasy 7, and ended up buying this game as soon as it was released (on steam). I have been meaning to get to playing this eventually and now I have finally done so!

As someone who has beaten the original game, maybe because I'm still feeling the high after just beating it, but this game is basically a masterpiece!! I don't care if Sephiroth keeps showing up early to make sure his boyfriend is okay. I don't care that they keep extending areas so they can extend the playtime!

5/10

Not a fan of this game. The animations take a long time for simple things like resting, opening doors, shimmying through tunnels, etc. and you are doing one of these things every 30 seconds. This makes the game feel very slow paced. Couple this with the extreme amount of cinematic scenes and you have a game where 75% of the time you aren't even really doing anything that would be interesting anyways. The puzzles are like... walk over this way, press a button. Opens a door back the way you came. Run back and go through the door. Press a button. Drops a ladder back the way you came. Etc. This is done so much that it makes it feel tedious. 

The combat system is just flat out not enjoyable to play. It is more fast paced than the rest of the game which I guess you could say is a benefit, but it ends up not feeling like one. I hate to put it so bluntly, but it's really difficult to explain why exactly it's so enjoyable, but it is. The fights are filled with gimmicky situations where a character become immune to a certain type of damage, which makes it feel very tedious frequently trying to figure out which type of damage you are supposed to be using at this moment only to find out that by the time you do it, it was too late. Your party essentially stands there doing nothing when you are not controlling them, all the while taking damage. Having to constantly switch between characters manually to get the most out of your abilities is just downright exhausting, not to mention the fact that your character will often be far away from the enemy when you switch to them so you will have to run over to the enemy, again and again and again. I don't know. It just feels like a chaotic mess of random things happening.

The original games battle system was just sooooooo much more enjoyable. Like night and day difference. It was so much better there really isn't even any comparison.  It was strategic, tactical gameplay that wasn't too chaotic or random in any way. You could take your time and think about what you wanted to do for your next attack, and what applied to the given situation. 

I dunno. The original was one of my favorite games of all time, and I still enjoy new games that I play to this day, so it isn't just reminiscence. This game I find myself struggling to even continue playing it, and not getting any satisfaction out of playing it even after winning battles or finding items etc.

That's another thing. It's extremely linear, which I get it we are in Midgar which was a very linear part of the game, but they also threw in quest markers telling you where to go, and made it to where most of the NPCs cannot be interacted with. This kind of ruins it, because you always know exactly where to go, so there isn't any figuring anything out. Sure, you can figure out the boring side quests if you want, but they are just more of the same dynamic. Talk to an NPC, follow the quest marker. Complete quest. Woohoo how interesting, not. The original was different. You could click on some random flower pot and find an item, so you had to explore and click on everything. You could talk to an NPC and he could give you an item, or possibly unlock some other activity, so you had to talk to everyone. You didn't know where to go, so you had to figure it out by talking to everyone.

All in all I would say this isn't a terrible game as it draws from the same good story as the original game did. The gameplay and way they decided to implement things however ruin most of the good parts of the original game, and leave a hollowed out game that is missing the magic. This game is basically mediocre.

If you want a good RPG go play something like DOS2, BG3, or DQ11. Better yet play the originals FF7, FF8, FF9, & 10. Chrono Trigger, Cross, Legend of Dragoon. These games had depth and charm.

This game is just mediocre

Pros: 

- Awesome graphics. Pretty sure all FF7 fans wanted to see this game in a modern game design, and they delivered. 
- Good combat system. I like how you can move during a fight while also switching characters and give commands. It makes perfect sense with this game and takes advantage of the different fighting styles in your team. I am glad the game is not turn based. While older fans liked turn based games, this is one of the reason why I was never bothered to try a FF game before.
- Music also good. I don't think there is a FF game were the music is not epic, isn't it?
- The game challenges the player. It really compels you to do team work otherwise you can't play, period. The difficulty really does spike on that theme; everytime you fail is because your team work wasn't good enough. This strengthen the choices you make for your equipped items of all kinds and your strategies. Although to be honest you will encounter these difficulty spikes only a few times during the game.

Cons:

- Story length. I learned later that this game represents only a tiny fraction of the original, but even without knowing it the story feels incredibly stretched. Some segments felt really unnecessary and pointless. I don't say that a game cannot have some escapades like the red light district part, which is probably one of the chapters the players enjoyed the most, but at the same time they must deliver something to you, and towards the end of the game you will get more and more empty chapters, just to delay the important part of the story, to the point it gets unnerving, especially when something critical is happening. 
- Some story elements. As I mentioned before, I didn't know the original story, but even without knowing I didn't like this remake so far. Why? Without spoilers, Sephiroth appears everywhere, Cloud has seizures all the fucking time, and there are always the specters which feel invasive and annoying every time they appear.
- Unsatisfying story. From what I heard this is only 1 of at least 3 games that will rewrite FF7 so it's expected that it doesn't end with this title but at the same time it's a game on its own, which means it has to deliver something to the player. The game tries to build up something and then it doesn't give anything in particular. You fight some bosses and it brings you to weird places. So the most it delivered to me is confusion.
- Pc controls. You can customize them, but unfortunately not all of them, specifically the the motorbike section and the minigames. It's incredibly stupid, it could be solved easily and it makes me wonder if whoever thought this was a good decision actually knows how a hand works.
- Materia available. Maybe since it's the first title of the remaking of FF7 they wanted to add only the basic stuff, but I was hoping maybe to see something more crazy. Not to misunderstand there are useful materias, since there are monsters that get completely immune to physical or magic damage, but most of the things you will find during exploration unfortunately are doubles you already have or have inconsequential effects, which turns off your excitement everytime you find a new materia going forward.

Conclusion:

Despite the gameplay being optimal and very appealing to the eye, for both the environment and the characters, the story ruins all of that. Of course is not as fucked as the Last of Us 2, which leaves you angry, disappointed and betrayed, but it doesn't leave you satisfied for sure. I can understand why they decided to make a whole game only in Midgar, since making the world geometry takes an incredible amount of work, but that's not enough to justify it. If you want to remake the story it still need to be a good story. You can stretch it, you can change it, but in the end it must have a sense and intrigue the player. Obviously after playing everything I learned about the original story I have to say it had more suspense and mistery compared to the remake; definitely builded better. Also there are minigames, which I found cool, but the further you progress in the story the more you notice they feel like trying to cover the emptiness you start to feel. The value of FF7 Remake depends exclusively on how good the sequels will be, in order to make it essential for the player to understand the rest of the following story. For me, it could have been better if they followed the original story and kept ALL of the side content meaningful. As for the DLC, it has similar problems but way less than the main story, since it's shorter and simpler; cool boss fight at the end.",1676041274,1689693461,False,1,1,0,0,True,False,False

I know, I know. I'm late to the party, but better late than never, right?
FF7: Remake overall, was a fantastic experience even if it was somewhat hindered by pacing and weird game design decisions. 

One of the best thing about FF7R happens to also be one of it's biggest flaws as well. I loved the decision to make Midgar the focus of this game and take a slow burn approach. The best part about this is spending time with the characters. You get a much better sense of bonding and who these people are compared to the short stay in the original. Seeing Midgar in more detail, particularly areas like Wall Market was a welcomed experience.

For returning fans, the call backs are here. A little wink and a nod, for those on the inside. The revamped soundtrack is a great example. A lot of returning motifs and recognizable melodies, but redone to keep things interesting a fresh. The same could be said about story beats as well. While you had a good handle on what was coming, the differences kept you on your toes on just how things were going to play out. 

While I mention loving the slow burn, I also found that the way it was executed in conjunction with the game design also hindered the game in some aspects. Particularly, certain chapters are filled with nothing but side quests that don't really offer anything engaging outside of materia and items, which is always nice, but it felt like padding and caused certain points to feel like a slog. I think the biggest reason for this is that the game is very much on rails with ""chapters"" vs an open experience. Had we had full reign of Midgar and the options to choose our pace, it likely wouldn't have felt as rough.

The combat shines here as well. Being able to swap between characters as well as give them orders felt smooth and natural. The materia system is just as good in the original. Couple that with the various weapons each character has really allowed you to build your party in tons of ways to fit any given situation. On the other hand, certain ""overworld"" controls and mechanics felt annoying. Forced walking speeds, constant interactions and buttons presses to interact with certain aspects of the environment and slow animations for doing so didn't feel too great, but a minor complaint. 

Overall, I greatly enjoyed my time with FF7:R. By the time the credits were rolling I was excited for Rebirth, my head swirling with questions and possible answers to the ramifications of the ending. While we still have two games to go, I can confidently say I'm looking forward to the next chapter.

TLDR; Game is easily an 8, but could be a 9 had certain design elements and pacing been changed.

I didn't initially like that the story was going to be broken into three parts, and I wasn't sure how I'd enjoy the new combat system as I was a huge fan of the turn based strategy elements of the more traditional approach.

Long story short - just get this, the game is amazing. It's fun, the combat is engaging, the story is cool so far, and It made me actually excited to have a trilogy to look forward to!

The gameplay is fun and probably the best action combat style Final Fantasy yet, with the quality stagger system and an ATB gauge to adds significance to each move. It's biggest short comings are in the form of a distinct feeling of padding, it feels like there is a lot here that really could have been skipped, and a low quality to the base game equipment other than weapons.

the only good things about this game are the combat system, which is very complex but rewarding once you learn it and the upgrade and ability system, which makes weapons feel unique.

in sum, like a 6/10 cuz i spent way too much to not finish it at least 70%. just go play something else or pirate this shit",1689297826,1689297826,False,4,3,0.500834047794342041,0,True,False,False

Like nothing makes sense. Its terrible. there are ghosts that werent in the first game. this is the main bad guy it turns out and they are the ""players from the real world that like the original game the way it was"" so you beat them at the end so... it becomes a totally different story and game both before during and after midgar.

so it really isnt ff7 in either controlls, mechanisms, or story.

have you watched irobot the movie and read the book? notice they share the same character and location names but nothing else? it is like that except in ff7 remake they also cut to scenes of characters you havent met, and will never see again. why? who knows. 

there was clearly a massive budget around character animations and wireing and environments, as there is a lot of character animations doing all kinds of useess garbage that never comes up when the player is in control...

when the player is in control they will have the option to attack ot use an ability or be stunned in any number of ways. 

also there are maybe 6 or 7 enemies total in the game, and the rest are reskins, or they took the models and inverted and recolored them or resized them. its really sad like you are playing and there is an awesome cutscene and then you fight the same 10 rats you fought 15 hours ago and 10 and 5 hours ago as well.  then a boss that comes from no where is never explained and just yeah.

its like if the writer of kingdom hearts series heard about what ff7 disc 1 was about then made this game and created a plot to erade the rest of ff7, then wrote all the dialogue using some chat GPT. its all really cringy and bad.

Barret say ""Oh YEAH and oh NOOOO"" ike a thousand fing times. its kind of shocking that they think black people walk around just shouting that all day reacting to their circumstances. wtf was wrong with the writers, who knows? definitly no script oversight or any culture team.

but hey, maybe the localization was just so bad that the english made no sense? no. the words were coherent and made sense together it is just that none of it was anything. 

it is a big nothing burrito of a boring rpg with highly repetitive combat wrapped in a 69.99 price tagged final fantasy 7 wrapper. I'm certainly not buying any of the ff7 sequels after that experience.

and my playtime is the complete playthrough on normal most of the time, sometimes i switched to easy when i couldnt handle the repetition anymore. found almost every treasure and explored every area and did every side place. 

it FELT like more than the playtime it was which is saying that the game was really boring. they make you do these really awful slow walk sequences behind and under crates over and over and over from the start to the very end its obnoxious and disrespectful of the players time while providing no add to the story or gameplay.

There are genuinely great aspects of this game, but in exchange the story has been butchered in several areas. I'm honestly not sure if I even would have finished this game if I didn't enjoy the combat and character building as much as I did. It isn't an easy recommendation but I do think this game is worth your time if you are able to look past its faults.

The first thing I want to talk about is how the story was ruined. This is the first 5 hours of the original stretched out to 30. Because of that, there was a lot of filler and new plot threads put in to stretch the material out to a full length game. I won't was all the new additions were bad, but it integrates a lot of things so poorly that it is hard to enjoy them. Sephiroth was ruined in this game. He was shoved into the story right after the opening and he is already interacting with Cloud and taunting him. Because of this, his presence as a looming villain and a lot of the mystery and horror surrounding him is gone. He just feels like an edgy anime character now. I understand putting one of your most popular characters in a remake, but they just never stop letting him interrupt the story for some visions of future events that you wouldn't even know unless you actually played the original. The fate ghost are just as bad. I can't see this story appealing to old fans since the story they wanted to hear is being changed for the worse, and I can't see new players following along because these ghost are directly there to ensure that the orginal story does happen. And again, they are shoved into the beginning with no build-up, they are just flying around messing with the characters. Any complaint I have about the story really comes down to how it affects the pacing of the game. If they were to just give these new plot elements a little more attention and care, I would be praising how this game changes things and would be excited for what is coming next.

Besides that, there are a lot of good parts to this game that I really love. Combat is fluid and engaging. I like the reintroduction of materia which they translated perfectly into an Action RPG system. One of the best parts of the game is how flexable every character is. You can make anyone fill any role you want with materia, and while certain characters perform better in certain niches the flexibility is appreciated and helps you feel like you aren't missing anything no matter who is in your party. This complements the games visuals as well. Midgar has been fully realized in a 3D environment. I spent a lot of time doing side-quests and fighting in the arena because exploring the world and seeing all the unique enemy designs just felt so fun to do. If the story changes turned you off, you might want to consider the game just to see how great everything looks. The only downside to the gameplay is that when you aren't going through dungeons or being a merc around town you are doing these really stiff parkour segments. All you do is run up to a blue arrow on the floor and you do a jump or climb a ladder or hang from the ceiling and get to move awkwardly across. Whenever you are in one of these scenes where you can't just walk to your destination you will see that the models are rigged to move along one path in probably some of the most unengaging game play I've ever experienced. I only bring it up because it happens so often that I really hope it isn't in the next game.

I'd say wait for a sale if you're interested. I have some big issues I hope they fix in the next game, but I still think the game is fun and worth your time. These remakes probably aren't going to follow the original story too closely after this game and honestly I think that is exciting. At the very least the main cast is great and lets you interact with these characters in ways you couldn't in the original. Tifa and Aerith have more of a friendship in this game. Barrett is really fun and plays well off of quiet old cloud. A lot of characters who didn't have much screentime in the original get some more development and depth. And despite everything I said, I still think i'll play more just for the inclusion of a hard mode that actually is more engaging than just buffing enemy hp and damage.

Remember the characters, who were so likeable? The story, mostly grounded but with some humor here, some slightly outrageous but still understandable opponents to fight? The first few hours of the story, Midgar, which was a cool setting you could learn all about and would take no less than four hours to progress through while still understanding what was going on? 

Remember that sense of freedom you usually had? That sense of progression when you wanted to? 

Now, throw all that away, save for Midgar. It took me 40 hours, whilst still getting all you could, to progress through this game, and I'm here to say- it is brutal in almost every sense of the word, in relation to things you do not want to do. The characters have been fleshed out, but have been made out to be so, so annoying most of the time. The setting? Aside from being mostly faithful and having relatively good graphics, cramped. The story? Butchered beyond belief, a few things remain faithful, but my god if they didn't just shove things down your throat to make the story longer. Longer! So much was done to make this game 40 hours long, and none of them were any good. 

I'm talking forced slow movement at seemingly every turn, I'm talking unnecessary dialog at random, I'm talking making every part of the game that existed beforehand, and making each little thing five times longer. Moving from one town to another for the first time? That's an hour! Why is it an hour when it took ten minutes in the original? Because they want you to spend more time, but they didn't know how else to do it! It has the worst, slowest, most unnecessary pacing I've ever had to endure.

 It was reminiscent of FF 12, in the way you moved, and somewhat of the fighting in it, but my god, it was nothing like 12 in the way of content. I am telling you, this game is a 40 hour movie. You have almost no freedom. Exploring gets you almost nothing. The side quests were a joke. You can't go where you want almost ever, and the most important decision you get to make is whether to take the stairs or the elevator. 

Listen to me, I could go on, I could say bad, bad things about this awful excuse for a game all day long. I could tell you it was so padded you can jump off a three story building onto it and be uninjured. I could tell you the characters were turned from halfway normal people into two dimensional, almost buffoonish cartoon characters. Heck, they even throw in some new characters that are even worse than the main characters when it comes to this. What's the word? Cringe. This game is a bad amusement park ride from a show that you remember fondly from childhood, only to discover the ride is 40 hours long, not because it should be 40 hours long due to what's in it, but because the damn ride will slow and stop and random to fill you full of exposition.

They brought back a classic with most of the niceties of their newer games like being able to save wherever you want. 

The graphics are outstanding. The game's already impressive pre-rendered backgrounds have received a major upgrade, with character models boasting high poly counts and beautifully detailed slums and cities. Final Fantasy 7 still looks as good as, if not better than, most AAA games released today. It even runs more smoothly than I expected, surpassing the frame rates of FFXV, even in its more confined areas. The magic effects add flair to combat, and the lighting in most areas is stunning. However, the intense lights of Wall Market don't look ideal on the player character models. I didn't initially experience stuttering issues, but they became significantly more apparent in the latter half of the game outside of the Slums.

I hope the sequels bring back the open world aspect of the game, but I'm uncertain how they will incorporate features like the airship and the random encounters like finding Yuffie and teaming up with her. Im curious how they will implement the Weapon Bosses which spawned in the open world once you completed the game if they do.

The combat system in this game is slightly less complex, with fewer combos and less technical fluidity compared to FFXV. However, I believe it to be more enjoyable. I love that each of the four playable characters have their own unique moveset and abilities. Unlike FFXV, you can control each individual character, which is amazing! While Tifa and Cloud play somewhat similarly, as do Barrett and Aerith, they still feel distinct, particularly with the unlockable abilities and combo variations available to them.

Switching from the agile and powerful Cloud to the faster and more punch and combo-focused Tifa, both with devastating abilities that can stagger enemies when combined with basic attacks,or playing as the less mobile Aerith and Barrett, who deal burst damage from a distance they all provide their own unique playstyle. (Aerith being my personal favorite as you have an ability that allows you to double cast your damaging abilities dishing out Limit Break levels of damage.)

Materia makes its return, retaining its somewhat tedious leveling grind. Nevertheless, I enjoy it because it allows for diverse playstyles for each character. It's also convenient that you can swap Materia between characters even when they're not in your current party. (I thought it wasn't a thing in the original but it apparently was.)

The story has some additions and changes but remains mostly faithful to what I remember from the original. As I've not finished the game I don't know where the story leaves off before the sequel episode releases. (hopefully next year or probably 2 for the PC port.) You follow Cloud the Mercenary and Ex-Soldier assisting an Eco Terrorist group Avalanche in destroying Mako Reactors made by the Shinra Corporation that are draining the planet of it's life source.

Overall, I believe this game is a fantastic introduction into FFVII and may spark interest in playing the original for it's story while we wait for the other two games releasing in what I believe is going to be a trilogy. The story and characters in this now 16-game franchise (excluding part 2's or in FFXIII's case a part 3) are what I believe to be the best of what Final Fantasy has to offer. (though I'm unsure if FFXVI will be as good as I'm awaiting a PC release).



After having finished the game I can only say this game is a must play but only after finishing the OG, watching Advent Children, and I believe even Crisis Core as that acts as a precursor to Zack's story as to my knowledge he may not have died in the remake. I was unaware just how much they play into the original with flashbacks and how this game is more of a sequel than a straight remake. The game is still fairly similar in most of it's story beats but there's an overarching plot of Sephiroth coming back with a vengeance against Cloud and Aerith. This game heavily plays on the original themes of the first but adds onto it as more of a seperate timeline of the original than being an outright remake.",1688015287,1688942776,True,1,0,0.494223356246948242,0,True,False,False

This game is a turn based game with extra steps, if you do not like turn based, do not get this game. 

The game allows you to move freely, and enter combat freely, you can attack at any time, dodge and block, you have abilities and magic, each character has their own special attack mode as well (for cloud it changes his sword stance, you become slower but can swing more times and attack faster) however this is as far as the fun goes. Now comes the Active Time Battle system (ATB). This is a bar below your HP that dictates how often you can perform actions. Doesn't sound too bad right? Every normal action doesn't take ATB bars, however abilities, magic and ITEMS uses the ATB bar. 

Now that you have a basic understanding of the combat system let's put this into action and explain why it fails as an action game and why this is a turn based game with extra steps. -Intro spoilers ahead-. The very first boss you encounter is a scorpion sentinel. Every boss has a gimmick of some kind, and this boss weakness is lightning, so okay not too difficult. you switch over to whoever has lightning materia on hand and hit him with lightning, simple, right? Nah. The boss has 2 attacks in particular that are completely ridiculous, stay too close and he will do AOE lightning damage that does way too much damage, stay far away and it will barrage you with rockets. So of course in this case it's easy just dodge and block stupid. Nope. Does not work like that at all. Dodging doesn't give you I-frames. Dodging an attack is literally not any different than just simply walking away, it's useless. So whats the next course of action? blocking the rockets shouldn't be too bad right? haha no. You still take damage from blocking, and a significant amount at that. so, can't get too close or risk early death, can't stay too far away and take chip damage until death. Okay then, I'll stock up on potions and just use lightning spells and use any long range abilities and out heal the damage. WRONG. it's here where the ATB system weighs you down. HARD. You cast spells it uses the ATB bar now you're on cool down, you use an ability, now you're on cool down, you used an item (potion) you're on cool down. The system punishes you for every action you take. You dodge an incoming attack? you took damage, oh shit here comes an attack I better block it, you take damage. Oh no my health is low, better use a potion now your ATB bar is depleted and now you can't use abilities or magic attack, okay I'll attack normally and wait, oh fuck my health is low again better get some health oh wait I can't attack I have no ATB charge. Now you can see why it is such a terrible system. You have to drag out fights by walking around and attacking whenever it's relatively safe and it is just so awful. Fights take too long not to mention you have to use a MENU to use abilities, spells and items which slows down your game and the fight even more. This is the opposite of fun it is a frustrating system that offers little control and you must do one thing at time. Just like a turned based game. This was my deal breaker. It's an incredibly disappointing ""action"" game. 

For those of you who played the original game before unlike me, and know the story, I encourage you to read up other reviews on the matter. As the story was ""re-imagined"" and you will not be greeted with the same story.

8/10 if you're new to FF7, 6/10 otherwise. It's objectively a very good game. Definitely buy it if you feel like you're tip-toeing around it. It's fast paced with skill-based action and tons of content coupled with decent/good storytelling.

However, I wouldn't recommend it to someone who's looking for the original with better graphics, game-play and a more fleshed out world. A lot of the time it's very frustrating with too much padding and bad story changes.

[h2]Long version (spoiler-free)[/h2]
The original was one of the first games I played and I don't know how many times I've played it at this point. It has some heavy nostalgia magic attached to it for me, so I'm biased, but this is what irked me: 

- [b]Story[/b]: A majority of the game is true to the original, but most of the story changes added nothing of value and cheapened key events. The mystery of following the main villain's foot steps, slowly unveiling a horrifying story, has been heavily downplayed and replaced with shoe-horned appearances. The addition of the whispers/destiny add nothing and they remove urgency.

- [b]Atmosphere[/b]: The brutal tone of the original has been Disney-fied, e.g. where blood is mostly cut out (what's left is purple) and they play into a ""cutesy/happy/silly"" jargon instead of showing the depression of the down-beaten and struggling people - completely bypassing the heavy psychological undertone of the original. 

- [b]Content[/b]: A beautifully fleshed out Midgar, with tons of unnecessary padding. I don't think the Midgar section should have been a full game, or at the very least they should've added more content that built on the existing characters development (Jessie's part is great), not content that add surface level story like the hours long segment where you follow Don Corneo's bodyguard. The side-quests are mostly generic MMO-fetch/kill-quests. For me, a frustration built up with the very frequent slow walking segments, slow animations and yoinking of the control from the player.

- [b]Combat[/b]: Fast paced, skill-based, mostly fun, with well made bosses. However, you constantly get interrupted when performing your actions and getting hit cancels your abilities but it still take the resources (or the enemies often move too fast so the ability misses), which get very noticeable in hard mode. Mid-combat cut-scenes, which happens many times in most boss fights, cancel your staggering/abilities/limit breaks (while still taking the resources). The fights that handle combat with flying enemies, of which there are too many, are poorly made.

Even for those of us who have not yet gotten around to playing the original FF7 the story and characters are incredibly well done. The game looks and performs great. 

There are few downsides with the game. One is a lot cases where you are randomly required to walk slowly, or enter some form of special event in order to move from one area to another, which is a result of the game being developed for PS4, as these things were required to hide loading screens. For someone playing with a modern PC they are simply an annoyance, but one which is certainly worth putting up with. A second is that the side quests are very weak, and feel more akin to those common to the PS1 era of the original game than what you would expect from a modern game, but the strength of the main story makes up for this.

I would strongly recommend getting this on sale. It is probably worth getting at full price, but (as with everything else on Steam) you might as well wait a few months and save yourself £30.

Well, let's say that if you played the original one, this game is a slap in the face... Like, seriously... Games are meant to be created for the customers. We did asked for a remake, but not this garbage. So many cool things got removed for emotionless filters, and running around doing some dumb missions. I've finished the original game and honestly it was a correct game (6.5/10), but no where near our expectations. DLS was garbage, absolute zero of value on its own. The only thing that was more or less worth -> DLC ending, that you can watch on YT for free. 

They've messed the whole game up and now you are basically playing a FF7.5, as at least 35% of the story were changed, and from now on its basically freestyle, as I won't even expect it to be logical anymore.


However, if you haven't played the original and never saw either FF7AC or played Vincent Valentine game on PS2, I would give it a solid 7.5/10.

What a game, what a story. The Remake was perfect for me. SE expanded the first SIX hours of the original game and made it into a 40+ hr feast and they did it beautifully.

It is the definition of a terrible present with pretty packaging. FF7 Remake has got to be the worst single player game I have ever played in my life.

It has:
Dull and repetitive combat that doesn't develop much as you progress
Blocking, dodging and parrying attacks are basically useless
Terrible pacing
Boring enemies
Boring story
Garbage side missions
The dialogue sounds like it was written by a 15 year old
Terrible and irritating side characters
The villains are also garbage and forgettable
The game constantly forces you to walk through sections, balance on steel beams, and do repetitive puzzles that make you want to uninstall the game
I feel like I'm fighting control most the time as the game is constantly taking it away from me

The worst part of this game is that there are way too many cut scenes. You usually have a useless cut scene, run for 5 seconds, and then be presented with another cut scene. Most of them add nothing to the experience and most of the dialogue within them could easily be communicated between characters while running around in game. I have spent most the game so far moaning at how bad it is or laughing at how seriously it takes itself. The only part of the game I enjoyed was the motorcycle chase. 

If the game had an interesting story and compelling characters then I wouldn't care for the gameplay being bad. But that is not the case.

Overall I give it a 4/10

Not enough to ruin the game-play but enough to annoy you every now and then. This game only exists for fans of the original FF VII. If you did not play the original this is not just an inferior version, this is straight up 2006 Gaia Online tier fan-fiction that will leave you scratching your head about everything.

The people who worked on this game like Final Fantasy VII too much to do it justice in a remake. It diffuses all possible tension that could have been carried over from the original by blowing the load on Sephiroth immediately. It has a bunch of time ghosts added to the story who are trying to make sure that the plot plays out the same way that it did in the original FFVII which is narratively atrocious. In the original things happen because characters have goals and take actions to fulfill those goals. In this game things happen because it happened in the original FFVII. The story / universe itself is aware that it is a remake and has decided that the sequence of events is dictated not by causality but by fate as determined by the previous version of the game. This is a fun idea on paper but is fucking awful as an actual story detail because it minimizes the agency of the characters in the plot.

Spoiler that isn't really important because nothing in this plot matters or makes any sense: At the end of the game Sephiroth tricks you into killing the time ghosts (?) so that time can be off the rails from that point forward and then the game immediately ends.

From a game-play perspective, it's fine but you shouldn't let the inclusion of action combat fool you into thinking this is an action game. It is not like Devil May Cry or Ni-Oh. You cannot just be skilled enough to make it through encounters without prior preparation because the game is full of literally unavoidable damage and there are no i-frames on dodging. The combat is real-time but this is still very much a ""big numbers"" battle system where the thing that matters most is whether or not you have prepared for the combat before-hand. There are some fun and memorable set pieces but most what's interesting about the combat is just set pieces. They are scripted sections that have interesting rules or a bombastic enemy/animation. As a rule, the combat is not at all strategic. It's about having a big enough number and having enough healing on hand. And that... starts to really SUCK at the end of the game. There is a certain point about 2/3 of the way through where it feels like they sort of just ran out of ideas for things that could make an encounter interesting and every enemy just has god-awfully large HP pools. It became so mind numbing that I used cheat engine to multiply the damage by 12 times just to end the tedium. Even then it still took what felt like way too long to kill enemies / be killed by them.

I don't hate this game but I cannot recommend it because it only exists as sort of extended fan-service and reverence for FF VII and does not serve as a remake of FF VII at all. It's Nomura being insane at you for 40-something hours. I had alot of fun. But this just is not a good game without the context of having played the original FF VII. Also Tetsuya Nomura is a crazy person who should be kept far away from Final Fantasy.",1688486892,1688487050,False,8,1,0.54703676700592041,0,True,False,False

The absolutely faithful recreation of Midgar, truly stellar lighting, and a soundtrack which is always referencing and expanding upon the original to enhance story moments. The characters are perfectly represented by an excellent script and voice cast. 

You have the gruff, tough Barret in all his extreme passion, but with the capacity for equal devotion in personal relationships hiding beneath his intimidating exterior. Cloud is aloof as ever and wary of revealing his emotions - damaged, secretly a bit shy, and sometimes as awkward in social situations as he is effortlessly cool under pressure. Tifa is observant, capable and thoughtful, but the last trait tends to win out: she prioritises others to the extent that she often has to be rescued herself; yet she tends to have the best grip of anyone on the bigger picture, and is somehow the 'normal' one in the party. And Aerith, a secretive troublemaker who seems to have a lot of fun playing innocent and cutesy, but has probably the darkest and bleakest past in the party; she has the extreme mental fortitude to continue to take the initiative in a world that treats her as what she is, rather than who she is - which makes for a strong contrast with Cloud's aimlessness, and his at-times vague personality.

Whereas Cloud has a weak grip on his identity, at least when we first meet him, Aerith asserts her role in defiance of the one the world has given her, and challenges the destiny that comes with it. The portrayal shows Barret and Aerith are idealists trying to change the world, while Cloud is just running away from personal demons and a wrecked past, and Tifa meanwhile is trying to keep all the good people in one piece. She can be demure, but also upbeat, and will take charge and be the boss in situations where others don't know what to do, She has the 'farmgirl' forwardness and assertiveness about her unless she's nervous. Aerith instead enjoys keeping secrets, teasing, and probably would go skydiving just to laugh at the other people for being scared. I suspected but did not know these things about the characters when I played the original. The strength of the characters makes this more Final Fantasy 7 than the original, and I say that's a worthy trade for the alterations to the plot. As long as I am learning more about these beloved characters, i'm happy. Also, Midgar is now 40 hours, and it was really smart to capitalise on the standout setting of FF7 and really soak up the green metallic atmosphere on a new level.",1688465440,1688465546,True,2,0,0.522769808769226074,0,True,False,False

I don't care if it makes sense partway through, it should have never been introduced to the game to begin with and puts a foul taste in the mouth of any old fan of the original game. I think that guy should be fired from square enix or at the very least not allowed to work on the remainder of the remake. It's too bad. It's really just too bad.

If you can get over that, it's a good experience, and it is even if you can't. But it is SO BAD the way it happened. It's also just weird to have a game that is basic rpg enemies for the entire playthrough. There is little to no power scaling because it all takes place in the very first part of the original game. Kinda sucks. Maybe my brain is too small to comprehend the scale of their vision, or maybe it's just a shitty vision the ends up feeling largely convoluted. 

I still think it is a good game, but damn these are some horrible decisions.

edit: Beat the game, should have waited to review till I beat it. This game is SOMETHING AWFUL. Do not recommend. Not worth it even if you can get it for 10 dollars. I don't care how good the art is, the gameplay is insufferable and the writing is insufferable.

Would still recommend because the combat mechanics are great, the story is interesting enough, and the soundtrack is top notch. It's a solid Final Fantasy 7/10.",1688288559,1688289250,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Few of the NPCs and sidequests have more than a rough sketch of character or story import, which is a big mistake. Very few seem like people instead of pretenses. Some of the new character and scene additions are banal or base and unimaginative melodrama, feeling like the worst of the newer age of Final Fantasy infecting the old. Though some new scenes (or entire game chapters) that use the original game's characters are pitch perfect and brilliant.

The most interesting story change decision they made in the remake is usually on the micro level not very impressive as it pops up again and again in annoying fashion.

The gameplay is pretty good, too. Not to mention the great OST. Plus, the additions to the original FF7 story are great.
However, I had to resort to playing this game on PS4 instead. Despite my PC meeting the requirements, the port is unbelievably unoptimised to the point where I had to get several external mods simply to prevent lag - and, keep in mind, that this was with the lowest possible graphics settings.

- Annoying camera. There are some scenes (actually quite a lot) where the camera angle and distance is fixed for no good reason and it messes up everything.
- What sucked most, was the movement. While in battle, Cloud can jump like 30 feet or more up in the air to attack an enemy, but out of battle a simple fence 2 feet high is unbreachable. There are plenty of sections, where movement is insufferable slow and if you want to explore the ""wrong"" part of the world, the game just takes over and forces your character to walk in the ""right"" direction.

Keeping in mind that 10 is literally perfect this is a solid 7.8/10 with some fights feeling too tightly tuned on normal difficulty during the end and other annoyances with combat like having to go through 6 minutes of a multi-phase fight again because I died to what felt like impossible to dodge attack dragging it down.

But, if you played the original and then see what you get in this game, you will feel disappointed. The actual area you can explore is really small. It really feels like the devs milked as many hours as possible from the game, which is around 50. 60 hours to complete both expansion and game is generous. I left the game running for several hours without playing. The paths to travel are so linear and thin. No feeling of exploration, lots of tedious and boring side quests. The battle system is amazing.. in theory.. but just wasnt very fun. The boss battles look super epic and are done amazingly well, but still not super fun. I think only people that played the original could appreciate this. Loved the plot, the characters, audio, cutscenes. The new weapon system is amazing. I think what put me off is knowing that leveling materia and characters is worthless as this isnt the kind of game you beat and then can explore and have fun with for years to come.

Original review:
Still a good game but it doesn't help that this is only actually a third of the original game (or less). They have done some things better than the original, sure. Got rid of poor translations, added some information so things made more sense. Biggs, Wedge, Jesse are much more filled out. But they screwed up the music in some instances. I can appreciate that they converted much of it to orchestral, and the multiple different versions of the regular boss theme each time the final boss changes phases at the end was nice. But I also get the distinct impression from playing this game that the subsequent games are NOT planned to follow the original as closely. So kind of disappointed overall, but hoping for good things. The original is still worth playing.
Good...
-Weapons no longer become obselete, each weapon has it's own leveling, so you can use the iconic buster sword the whole game if you want to.
-Cut scenes added to flesh out characters and store. Some of those cut scenes the game would be fine without (President Shinra).
Specific complaints...
-While it's good weapons no longer become obselete, changing some of the old limit breaks to weapon skills is kind of a downer.
-too many materia that level up too easily and don't have as much impact on your build. Firaga before leaving Midgar??? Holy crap if that was in the original...
-music - missing some drum notes in the regular battle music, and the music for the Don's town has changed to something far more annoying to listen to.
-The ATB system is bad this time. You can attack constantly, but special abilities and spells only when the extremely slow gauge fills. Guage fills faster the more you attack, would prefer it filled at the same rate all the time. I would not consider it an improvement over the original. However, being able to dodge and guard on demand is good.
-The ""intermission."" Not impressed. Generally speaking, chocobo do not fly. See the ending. Occasionally, a special chocobo, such as a black chocobo/breed, is capable of flight, but not the vast majority in any game except 1 FF game, and I don't recall which it was, and it still couldn't fly very high.",1684884428,1687029364,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE INTERGRADE takes the already remarkable Final Fantasy VII Remake to new heights, offering an enhanced and visually stunning experience that fans of the series will absolutely adore. As a longtime fan myself, I was blown away by the depth and attention to detail that INTERGRADE brings to the beloved world of Final Fantasy VII.

First and foremost, the graphics in INTERGRADE are nothing short of breathtaking. The level of detail in character models, environments, and spell effects is truly awe-inspiring. The game takes full advantage of the power of next-generation consoles, immersing players in a visually stunning world that feels alive and vibrant. From the towering skyscrapers of Midgar to the lush and atmospheric landscapes beyond, every location is rendered with meticulous care and precision.

One of the standout features of INTERGRADE is the addition of Yuffie Kisaragi as a playable character in the new episode, INTERmission. Yuffie's playful and energetic personality is a delightful addition to the cast, and her unique combat style injects a fresh and exciting element into the gameplay. The new episode offers additional story content that seamlessly weaves into the main game, expanding the already rich narrative and providing a deeper understanding of the events in Midgar.

The combat system in INTERGRADE remains true to the original remake, combining real-time action with tactical decision-making. The battles are fast-paced and intense, with a wide range of abilities, spells, and Limit Breaks at your disposal. The revamped Materia system allows for deeper customization and strategic choices, encouraging players to experiment and find their preferred playstyle. The combat encounters are both challenging and rewarding, requiring a mix of skill, strategy, and teamwork.

In addition to the enhanced visuals and new gameplay content, INTERGRADE introduces a Photo Mode that allows players to capture and share their favorite moments in the game. This feature adds a creative and personal touch to the experience, letting players immortalize their adventures and share them with friends and the wider Final Fantasy community.

The audio design in INTERGRADE is top-notch, featuring a breathtaking soundtrack that perfectly complements the emotional moments and epic battles. The voice acting is superb, with talented actors bringing the characters to life and infusing them with depth and personality. The iconic themes and melodies of Final Fantasy VII are reimagined and enhanced, evoking a powerful sense of nostalgia while also introducing fresh musical arrangements.

Overall, FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE INTERGRADE is a true testament to the craftsmanship and passion of the development team. It delivers an unforgettable and immersive experience that honors the legacy of the original game while also pushing boundaries and introducing new elements. From its stunning visuals and exhilarating combat to its expanded narrative and unforgettable characters, INTERGRADE is a must-play for fans of the series and newcomers alike.",1657031052,1687025662,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As a long-time fan of Final Fantasy VII, I approached Final Fantasy VII Remake with expectations of a faithful adaptation of the original. However, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that it offered much more than that. While the game is split into three parts, the story it provides not only stands on its own but also sets the stage for an exciting future for the series.

The development of Final Fantasy VII Remake hints at the ambitious direction the series is taking, and as a dedicated fan, I'm eagerly committed to staying on this journey. The introduction of ""Rebirth"" and its attempt to remake an entire timeline adds an intriguing twist to the story. This is not just a simple remake; it presents a variation in the name that signifies a larger narrative scope.

For those seeking the original story in its purest form, I recommend getting the original game. However, if you're looking for an enhanced experience with voice-overs, the Tsunamods Echo-S mod is a great option to consider. Final Fantasy VII Remake should be viewed as a sequel, one that can be enjoyed and understood even without playing the original version, as it showcases a distinct departure from the familiar.

In conclusion, Final Fantasy VII Remake surprised me with its expanded narrative and promising future. It embraces a fresh approach that moves beyond a mere remake, making it an engaging and enticing experience for both long-time fans and newcomers.

[Chapter 1: Where's My Toy?]
I was 8 when my father brought me into a Burger King for a kid's meal. I reached into my bag for a toy but was presented a Playstation 1 variety demo disk containing a taste of amazing classics, such as Spyro, Medieval, Tomb Raider, Tony Hawk Pro Skater, and of course Final Fantasy 7. I didn't have a Playstation at the time, so I walked to me cousin's house, whom lived just 3 blocks down. 

[Chapter 2: Let's Go Again... and Again... Once More.]
The Final Fantasy 7 demo gifted me with the opening sequence of infiltrating and escaping the first Mako Reactor. Never played a turn-based strategy action game before and this gem hit me in all the right places. The Scorpion boss fight was so freaking exciting to play, especially when you had a plethora of abilities already unlocked. I must've played that demo 30 times. On my birthday, I asked my parents for only two things, a  Playstation and Final Fantasy 7. The game was outstanding and I have fond memories revisiting it several times throughout my next 25 years of life.

[Chapter 3: You F****** Did It SquareSoft / Enix!]
The wait was finally over. Final Fantasy 7 Remake finally released and I took 3 days off work for this! As the game boots up for the first time, I'm blown away with how far the technology has taken us to this moment in time. Graphically it's outstanding, gameplay feels new and familiar at the same time, faces still look anime-ish but somewhat realistic when the facial animation tracking really shines. I'm overwhelmed with immediate nostalgia as I breeze through the opening sequence as fast as possible for the final goal, beating that Scorpion Boss one more F****** time!!! The battle was way more engaging and cinematic. I really felt like this B**** was challenging and needed to destroy it before the bomb blows up. I used ""Limit Break: Cross-Slash"" for the first time as I strike the final blow, vanquishing the Scorpion Boss just like I did several times before. The boss falls into the Mako liquid and explodes. In that moment in time, a grown as man in his 30's pauses the game to shed a tear of disbelief and overwhelming joy.

Here's the thing. This was only the beginning. I did spent the next 3 days off work beating the game. This is only part 1 of a 3-part series, but that doesn't mean a lack of content. The city of Midgar is massive and full of life, stories, and beauty among even the dirtiest slums. If you're new to this game, the FF series, or an OG veteran looking for that same dopamine burst, this game will not disappoint!

Thank you for your time to hear my story. :)",1686904808,1686904808,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,True,False

They've already broken the fourth wall several times. The way they are pacing, introducing Sepiroth early is very jarring to the mood of the story. Too many ""Sure, you've murdered 50k people, but I'm the good guy, so just say you're sorry and I won't kill you."" moments, even though Cloud is already a killer. Biggs, Jessie, and Aerith don't die, and with the way they are telling the story, apparently nobody can die unless it's their ""destiny"" due to sudden, randomized appearances of off-the-wall plot devices called ""whispers"", even though they give a 30 minute death speech during a time sensitive part of the story... ~sigh~ The story is already going off the rails, and from what I hear, it's going to get worse in the next game. Kiss your nostalgia goodbye if you play this version. The arrogance of these writers, thinking that they can do better than the original, or even compete. Just the dialogue alone for some of the new side quests:
NPC ""My GF gave me this ring and left me for a richer guy with more status.""
Tifa ""I think it means she is coming back to you""
NPC ""Oh really? I'll spend the rest of my life waiting for her then!""

Wow, who wrote this quest....? NO, SHE'S NOT COMING BACK TO YOU! Also, sorry, she's probably monster kibble now.

The good:
Lighting is superb. Character models are outstanding. Weapon design is of quality work. SFX is decently done. Skyboxes are well-done. Fighting system works great, albeit a few minor complaints that pale in comparison to what they are doing to the story. New Game+. The parts of the story they stuck to are done well and have nice flourishes. Decent humor. Music is so-so, the original being better. Granted, this remake isn't nearly as bad as the recent Hollywood remakes, but it suffers from the same lack of ability to tell a congruent story with enticing moral dilemmas. And, despite it all, at least they didn't make Tifa a flat-chested diversity character, and they didn't make AVALANCHE into a BLM parody, so kudos for not joining that crowd of game devs.

Final note: If you don't like Jessie, Biggs, or Aerith dying, that's fine, have a surprise side quest for time travel materia, or something that is lore-friendly, but at least have it make sense. Butchering Sephiroth's character and introducing 4th-wall-breaking whispers interfering with literally -everything- you do is not the answer.",1682211105,1686894290,False,5,1,0.443813830614089966,0,True,False,False

Keep in mind this is only part 1 of the story, they (understandably) plan to release the full remake in splits since they're adding so much content. Unfortunately, that means we have to buy each part AND wait long periods of time between each major part release as they continue development - I'm okay with this personally. BUT, that also includes the timed exclusivity on Playstation (actual bruh moment).


The story differences are an interesting take but remains mostly the same. Optimization is pretty good considering the game runs mostly on Unreal Engine 4 - I feel like Square probably modified the engine a bit.

Letting your friend die for a F***ing 30 min cutscene except your inventory is full of potions or phoenix. Check ! Or you could easily cast a spell on him/her, but nooo !!
Over-stretching the original story with uninteresting filler sub-quests, overly long cutscenes, backtracking, forced walking. Check !

While I could get over that and buy this game on sale to just relive my childhood and enjoy the beautiful graphics and music, maybe explore some new content, it all got ruined. Horribly ruined.

It's like someone broke into a museum of the fine arts of video game history, they lowered themselves by grappling hook (relevant to this game here) to the display case of the first copy of FF7 for PS1, and then took a giant dookie on the game and smeared it all over the display case, then set it on fire, all while video taping it for the world to see.

Listen you've probably read a bunch of reviews already so I'll sum up some of the major points:

+1 for music. The music team did a super job on this game, it's incredible. I'm not mad that the original songs were all remixed and are usually not as good, because overall it's amazing.

-1  for graphics. They're not the best graphics, but they are gorgeous. They really took some stuff in the original that you had to use your imagination on and fleshed out massive 3D models of that look awesome.
BUT
They're EXTREMELY poorly optimized. This game does NOT have uncapped frame limit, it must be forced into 1 of 3 settings that my monitor doesn't even want to be at. I went online to get a mod to make it smoother, then locked my 165Hz monitor at 60FPS to keep my $550 graphics card from struggling. That's trash.

+/- 0 for gameplay. The main character does 0 damage in his primary fighting form, so you must switch to his ""attack mode"" to do ok damage, but that makes you move like a snail and makes it hard to block. Rolling (a commonly used mechanic to avoid unblockable attacks) takes you out of attack mode. So think about that.

The later you get in the game, the more enemies will stun lock you or interrupt you. If you had to struggle to fill your ATB bar to heal your party, now you can't heal them because the enemy that just attacked you 5 times did it again, making your character fall over and never use heal. The later the game gets, the more annoying it gets. It had me wanting to say some bad words while trying to just trudge my way through fights, constantly interrupted and annoyed while just trying to use attacks. The system they used is awesome. Upgrading weapons is awesome. They took a great system and then the producer took a big dookie on it and ruined it with the annoying interrupts and stunlocking. Status effects, both buffs and negative ones seemed like an afterthought in this game. They added a boatload of materia, but since it's just Midgar, I kept thinking ""yeah well I'm just trying to get out of Midgar, I should be ok with these ones and can ignore everything else."" Anyone who played the original as a kid has it ingrained in their mind that the best place to grind AP is DEFINITELY NOT Midgar.

-99999999999999 for story. They took a confusing but cool story of the original and just completely and utterly ruined it to the max. It's like the producer was paid a large sum of money to ""tick off the fans."" Or they were on drugs, lots of them. I really can't put into words how bad the story got as the game progressed. It was weird at first, and then as it progressed, I just had this growing sinking feeling that it was gonna be terrible at the end.

I really got angry with how they completely redid the story for breaking into Hojo's lab. That scene in the original with the ominous orchestrated music, dead bodies everywhere, trails of blood from Jenova. All of that was gone. They got rid of that and instead Sephiroth is hanging around the whole game talking to you and making you have horrible flashbacks. In the original Sephiroth was scary because you basically never saw him, only glimpses, but the threat was there and you knew he could merc your whole party. In this game he's just really annoying from the jump and you can never tell if he's there or it's just Cloud hallucinating. Speaking of hallucinating, your party keeps asking why you're yelling and grabbing your head, but you never tell them the truth, cause that would make too much sense.

Then the stupid whispers. Why are they there at all. Just change the story if you want. Keep Wedge alive, I don't care, just don't use a stupid mummified floating finger as an excuse. Their actions are never explained, so you never really understand what's happening, you just know that they show up flying everywhere and suddenly your nostalgia and immersion go out the window and you're annoyed. Then it reaches a culmination at the end where it appears that Sephiroth is allied to the things, but it's not explained like they are allied to anyone. If they were, it would be the planet itself, not your enemy. If they were there to change fate, they would have carried Sephiroth off after he took Jenova and then the end of the game would be you driving to the end of the highway. But no. They had to take a giant dookie on the game and confuse everyone.

I give this game a -5. It would be a -10 but the music and graphics are awesome.

It is miles better than the original in story and in pacing - it's obvious that they've taken cues from Square's non Final Fantasy games, from developers like Bioware & Capcom and from their own video media, and it's so much a better game for it.  The characters are so much more legible in their characterizations and the storyline much clearer.  Also by expanding the timeline to include small side quests and to really crawl all over Midgar, it really sells the dieselpunk world so much better than the PSX version did.

It is also QUEERer than the original game, and that's saying something.  As a ReallyBigFan podcast said ""Cloud is an ace twink in a harem anime."" The men you fight as bosses in the game are all astonishingly pretty and come across with that ""lesbians in mecha"" vibes where you are more certain that they want to fsck you, not fight you.  That whole ""Oh we are struggling together, but I am going to luridly grind against you as you do.""  I absolutely love it. This game must be very painful for the bigots to play.

And the women, the women are so direct with their hunger for the chocobo-headed waif, that they all-but reach down Cloud's baggy pants. Even Tifa, who the most coy of the harem is still pretty forward with Mr. Stryfe.

The gameplay is tight and concise and obviously draws from their work on FFXV and also shares more with Parasite Eve than other action semi RPGS like Devil May cry.  However, the action feels more cohesive and organic the more you play it.

I hesitated before giving this game a negative review. The game itself is good. It's the Midgar section of the first FFVII with some twists (the Intergrade content deals with Yuffie). Won't give any spoilers, so I won't talk about those twists. You can choose which combat modes you want, which is nice for people who like the classic mode. All (or at least most of) your favorite characters make an appearance. Some of the characters are more fully developed. Only one additional character is unnecessary and, frankly, better not existing. When you see him, you'll know which one I'm talking about. Some of the more... questionable... moments of the first game are reworked or removed (the bathtub scene with Cloud anyone?). The graphics are great and the action is fun. Most of the voice acting is great. So why give this a negative review? Because the port is terrible. Much less customization for controls, graphics, and, well, everything than there should be. The biggest issue for me is how messed up the mini-games are for the keyboard/mouse crowd. Things like driving and darts- just to name two- are made nearly impossible by the clumsy implementation. So if you want to play this game, a controller is almost a requirement. Like most PC gamers, I don't want to use a controller on a PC game. If I wanted to use a controller, I'd be using a PS, Switch, or XBox. But, again, the controller is only necessary for select portions of the game. KB/M works for most of it perfectly well. Just be aware that without a controller you will be put at a disadvantage of biblical proportions, and that the ability to customize your settings is severely restricted.",1656907117,1686342119,False,1,1,0.488835275173187256,0,True,False,False

However Cloud is Nomura's design and he nails it. The attitude, the voice acting, the character. Everything in here is done in a very loving respectful and interesting way. It is not the OG FF7, but they give a LOT of fan service to it and ADDS to the OG FF7 game. Seeing it in 4K HDR full voice acting and the moments they touch on it brilliant. 

So far I'm only through chapter 9 of this and the amount of details this game has is insane. You really need to pay attention to the visual and audio clues. This game brings not only Midgar to life as a living, breathing city full of emotion, daily problems, ect. but the characters as well. 

There is a LOT of subtext and subtlety that one might not pick up on if they aren't paying attention. I would highly suggest not going in this game blind / uninitiated as a FF7 player. Go get the base FF7. Crisis Core was recently released - That is critical in understanding some of the visual and contextual cues the game gives. Then go find the movie Advent Children. THIS IS CRITICAL of understanding the context of things with this game/story. You're playing a story  - hence Role Playing Game. 

The changes to the battle system is done in a hybrid manner that is well suited and challenging to real time combat and turn based combat. There is plenty of strategy, custom-ability, and difficulty. 

If you pay attention to the city and the characters, especially Areith - You can pick up this is something that the city, and it's inhabitants have been through before. SE, Nomura-san is holding back deliberately for some big reveal that if they gave away ahead of time would spoil for whatever they have planned. 

Technical stuff - 

I'm running this game on a ASUS Dark Hero board with an AMD 5800x3D and AsRock 7900XTX card. Unleashed it will do over 200 fps @ 4K. It will cook and stress heat in the case. While it's cool if your card can do that, limiting it to 90 or 60fps is just fine and keeps things in line. I haven't had to deal with super resolution or scaling. Card doesn't need it and with the textures, 2K should do just fine (they don't have 4K textures, which I wish SE would release). Supposedly there is a mod for this but it's currently taken down @ Nexus mods for whatever reason. Either do it officially or back off and let the mod community handle it SE. 

The ""ghosts"" - I wish SE opted for more of a hair like or cloth like flowing model, and I think they would have if not given the limitations of the PS4 for which the game was made for. On modern CPUs if you want to go all out, not having rigid ""trash bag"" ghosts would go a long way. Just give us the option. I see what they are going for, unless the ghosts are supposed to be a meta commentary on the rigid specters holding things back. In that case it's pure trolling on the part of Normura-san and SE. However I think they ""dumbed"" them down because of technicalities. They really pushed themselves in development and it shows. 

Price - 

You're getting this full voice acted modern game plus it's second part the Yuffie inter grade which basically a side game for $70 as of 6/7/23 . There's still more to come. The additions the game gives you. - you can indulge in them all and they are modest in the base game or in the intergrade. Not in both. The stuff from the base game doesn't carry over into the integrate Yufie quest. This is fine. Inside the game it allows you to choose. So it's 2 games built on the same engine in the same package. That's worth it I think. If you like to immerse yourself it is very much worth the investment. This game is a piece of art. 

If you are new or a fan of the FF7 franchise I would highly recommend. Bring a box of tissues. Some of the moments are just golden and it will hit you in the nostalgia. I would not recommend going into this game blind with no knowledge of the OG FF7, Crisis Core (Zack's game) and Advent Children. Those three are required reading / experiences IMO to really enjoy this.

That said, if you have hardware that is significantly better than a ps5, you can get a higher resolution and/or higher framerate during the 90%-99% (depending on your hardware) of the game that doesn't have any stuttering (which is probably all the story cutscenes and combat, I only noticed stuttering when walking around certain quest hub areas, and that was eliminated by mods, but I also have a high end GPU).
But it does suck that the game was released in a state where modders have to do Square's job for them, so it might be worth waiting until you can find it on sale.

As for the content of the game:
1. This is not a 1-for-1 remake of the original. The overall plot (so far) is in tact, but there are new and/or altered elements.
2. This is the first game of what is planned to be a trilogy. Like the first entry of most trilogies, it is decently self-contained, but with obvious room open for more content. It covers the Midgar portion of the original game, but with a lot of extra content and expanded story to make it the length of a full RPG.
3. It has a more action oriented combat system than the original (look up youtube videos to see it in action) even though that wasn't what I wanted I still found it fun. I was concerned at first before trying a demo and finding that it was actually pretty good.
4. It doesn't have the best graphics out there (it's mainly a ps4 game ported to ps5 and PC with some texture improvements), but it looks way better than the original, and you get close-ups of the characters during cutscenes, complete with voice acting and improved dialogue.
5. Slow walk areas were used to hide loading areas/screens on the ps4 version, the ps5 and many PCs have SSDs, so it would have been nice if they sped those up based upon your storage, but they don't 
Note: I use hotkeys on Cheat Engine to speed up certain slow walk areas that don't have dialogue.

Overall I am pleased with the base product, but the PC port could have really used some more attention. The expanded plot is good for people who liked the original and want a reason to spend more time with characters they already like. I am somewhat concerned that a new player might find the plot to be a bit drug out, but I personally enjoyed seeing some new content and having good looking cutscenes with voice acting.

PC version specific upside: if you have the power, you can make it look better and/or run faster than the ps5 version, and you can install mods. 
Downside: it will likely have at least some stuttering without performance mods, even on high end machines.",1685321918,1686188844,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This honestly gives the likes of Pixar and Dreamworks a run for their money. What's especially impressive are the animations. Everything is perfectly smooth and glitch-free even at 120fps which is very cool. Since often at these framerates you will see animations break down or see the interpolation between keyframes, but not here. The summons are wild, Seeing Ifrit or Ramuh was mind-blowing every single time. The real feat is how well they are integrated into whatever battle you happen to call them in. I never saw any visual glitches with these massive monsters showing up in the arena which really surprises me.
The writing is also fun, Barret and Cloud's banter is consistently hilarious overall far more likeable than it was in the original game. This is thanks no doubt to Barret's great VA elevating otherwise generic lines with passion and levity. Likewise, watching cloud warm up to the crew and begin to care is also a great experience. There are definitely some important narrative liberties taken, mainly with the addition of the whispers, but without going into spoilers I'll just say that I don't hate it. But I'm also not sure how I feel about it yet. It'll be more interesting to judge when the rest of the game is complete.",1685919266,1685919266,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You end up feeling like you really know who they were and who they are. Graphics are amazing and the battle system works great.
Cons: Although they include some really memorable moments from the original, some moments seem to not go with the feel of the game, or seem very childish/weird. I feel they were making this version more realistic, but some mini games can be silly, and I don't mean in a good way, like having a dance battle....really? There are time where I felt like I was walking around doing things for no reason, like going 5 minutes out of the way to pull a switch for no reason but just to do it.

- Lack of graphics settings.
- Image is blurry.
- Big fps drops. Had few drops on the intro scene. Not my PC problem.
- Mouse support is mediocre. You can use it, but you can't move it freely on the menus. The mouse wheel is used to switch between tabs. In combat/tutorial, you will see F/R for attack/evasion, not LMB/RMB. The default out of combat run button is CTRL. Not as big problem as poor mouse support, but still.

Overall, not the best PC port. The game was released on Steam two years after the PS4 version. Year after PS5 version. Half year after Epic PC version. Square Penix had the time to improve this version, but they chose the other option. I'm not surprised that their business have problems. Sold rights for big franchise, Avengers game was received poorly and so on. 
I buy games legally, and FFVII RI isn't exactly cheap here. If this trend with second class citizens will continue, then more people will play on consoles or stop playing games at all (Not counting the shit-eaters. They'll buy anything, at any price).

To players with at least some dignity - Wait for big discount/patch/ignore PC version.

A bit of info from pcgamingwiki: 

[h1]Heavy FPS drops[/h1]

""The game's frame rate can drop from 120 FPS to below 30 FPS when texture settings are set to high on a GPU with 8 GB of VRAM or less. This may be caused by poor VRAM management, as the issue is resolved by alternating between low and high settings. This appears to force a VRAM flush. There is no word from the developers about the issue at the time of this edit.

 NVIDIA driver 511.65 addressed an issue with VRAM allocation calls that improves drops caused by VRAM swap, but don't completely solve the problem. Drops will still happen in more demanding areas, while the problem won't happen anymore in less demanding ones. The mileage of this will vary.""

Do I recommend this game?
Without a doubt. There are parts of the game that perhaps have become a bit tedious for me, but the rest compensates with its strong points (Gameplay - Graphics - Sound - Story).

The Story: I really mad about splitting the game since I'm really invested on what's next. The truth is that with this first part of the story I feel that I am heading towards something that will stay with me for many years. An adventure that aspires to greatness and for which I am not prepared. 

Sound & Music: The voice actors do a spectacular job of carrying out the emotions of the characters. 
The Ost is so well implemented for its respective moments. 
Electrifying. Gentle. Tense. Sad, etc
Especially in those moments that make you sigh.

Combat: Real time fights of simple attacks with selection of certain actions/attack using slow motion it's awesome. It gives you a modern perspective on classic turn-based combat by doing it in real time, it also makes it dynamic and amplifies tense moments for the big fights. 
Weapons upgrades - Magic - Skills are interesting.
I feel that they are going to use this system as a blueprint to improve in the next installments. 

Also, the Cinematics are so well executed. Even at the middle of some boss fights makes it much more dramatic and I love it.

This is so cool man.

Now I want to play the original FFVII now to experience the game's worldbuilding.

Simple answer is: Yes, Definitely, Absolutely!
This is everything I hoped a modern RPG could deliver both in terms of story (which I'm guessing is mostly taken from the original), mechanics and what I dare say is most important in any game: Fun.
This game is very fun to play, there were very few sections in the game that I didn't like and most of those did not last long at all.
I found myself excited to do the sidequests, something I rarely experience, and the main story kept me hooked throughout.
The combat is super fun, the way they handled new weapons is brilliant where it's an alternative playstyle rather than an outright better weapon and had different abilities which you can unlock for all other weapons if you're proficient in them, none of which felt like a grind at all.

From what I've heard the main story takes place in the first two hours of the original FFVII and the fact the got 40 hours worth of content (not even counting hard mode or extra challenges) out of it and none of it felt like it was meaningless fluff is astonishing to me.
In fact, I want to play the original FFVII now to further understand this game's universe, I'm hooked.

It's worth the price, trust me it is WORTH it and that's coming from someone who is not a particular fan of Final Fantasy or the Original FFVII for that matter (altho I feel that's about to change).",1685563113,1685563113,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The highlight of this remastered world is undeniably its breathtaking and realistic visuals, which contribute to an elevated and immersive gaming experience. However, there is room for improvement in some aspects.

While the character models are detailed and true to their original designs, they do not completely escape the notorious 'uncanny valley' effect. This subtle yet pervasive issue pertains to a sense of unease experienced by the observer due to the imperfect realism of digital human-like models. Although this phenomenon is mildly noticeable in this rendition of the game, it detracts slightly from the otherwise immersive world of Final Fantasy VII.

Despite this visual shortcoming, the characters' personalities shine through their dialogues and everyday interactions. Their casual chitchat and murmurs create an authentic and intimate atmosphere, humanizing these beloved characters and making them even more relatable. This layer of realism greatly compensates for any visual shortcomings, especially in the depiction of the revolutionary group, Avalanche. Their actions and motivations against the oppressive Shinra Corporation are portrayed in such a way that players can't help but sympathize with their cause.

Another minor area of critique lies in the game's camera angles. At times, the camera position can be awkward, leading to obstructed views or disorienting perspective shifts. However, this doesn't significantly affect the overall enjoyment of the game. It's more of an occasional inconvenience than a substantial flaw and becomes a part of the game's learning curve as players adjust to it over time.

In spite of these minor flaws, Final Fantasy VII Remake is an impressive revitalization of the original classic. Its strengths in narrative depth, character development, and stunning graphics largely overshadow these issues, making this remake a commendable and enjoyable gaming experience.",1685371831,1685371831,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Usually I rate games after considering all features, details and mechanics. For this one I will just recommend it because it's fun. It's really fun. Hours are going by and I don't even notice. 

If you do care about if the game offers its money's worth then yeah I see a lot of detail in this. When I first picked up the game I was just stunned by the amount of dialogue all these NPCs have. Pretty much every NPC you go close to has dialogue depending on what is currently happening in the game. The characters are interesting (I've never played the original and I didn't know anything prior to playing this), the story is keeping me hooked and there's much to do. 
The dialogues and voice acting might seem slightly akward to some but they are typical Anime, JRPG so I've you're used to that, it won't bother you much. 

If I had to say something negative is that unfortunately, even 3 years after this game's release, there are still texture issues and low quality objects that really take you out of the experience.

What does this game do INSANELY well?
- The soundtrack and music is MAGICAL and it's one of, if not, the best OST you'll see in a game
- The characters look exactly how I would imagine them if they would be in a modern remake and their voices are perfect (especially the voices for Barret, Cloud. Sephiroth and RedXIII)
- The world design is impeccable and they expanded SO MUCH on Midgar and they made it thousands times better than the one in the original
- The atmosphere is so cool and it really makes you feel like you're in actual Midgar with the many corners, secret passage ways and lively NPCs
- The combat is smooth, fluid and solid pretty much
- The materia system stays simple, just like the original, where you can make many fun combinations 
- They improved a lot on the Avalanche trio, a.k.a. Jessie, Wedge and Biggs to the point where I actually started caring for them
- The extra-minigames are really fun
- Graphics are amazing and the game runs really well on high to max settings, with little to no stutters (I have a mid-tier PC)

What does the game do meh? (There's not many and none of them bother me that much but still to be noted)
- Even though this game is quite expensive, it ONLY COVERS THE START (Midgar) of the original FFVII and there will be more parts being released making people spend more money on the next parts
- The non-important NPCs models look kinda off
- The side quests are not bad, but not amazing either, they are there if you want them
- Some parts of the game, even boss fights, drag on for too long
- Although mostly staying true to the original the story is changed a bit
- There are a few audio glitches but it happens extremely rarely

Does the story stay true to the original?
Yes, and no. The game does actually stay in line with the original story, however, they implemented the Whisper guys that force the remake's story to be on track with the original story, which is odd but it's not really a big deal.

In conclusion, I love what they did with the remake (especially Midgar itself as a city) and I can't wait to see what they do with next parts of the FFVII remake, because this 1st part really does captivate the atmosphere that the original did.

Let me start with a quick history lesson. I was born in 99, I was too young to play the OG. When I was in senior high school, I started going back and playing older games I missed while I was growing up. I played many great and innovative games back then, for example MGS, Ocarina of Time and FFVII. I completely fallen in love with all those, each for different reasons. So when they announced the ramake, I was screaming, it was during my playthrough of the original and I remember how much better it looked. ""Games can look amazing and suck"" I thought and continued my playthrough.

A few years have passed and this comes out on steam. Sooo is it any good? Well, yeah, it's good enough to stand side to side with the original. What makes both games special is the main party of Cloud, Tifa, Aerith (or Aeris) and Barret and there is a reason MOST of this cast crossovers with Kingdom Hearts while most games are ignored. The characters bloom of life and the voice acting in this is really good. The storyline of the original is full of suprises and weirdly enough, so is this one even for returning players. A few changes and a lot of additions to the already huge story were included in this package and personally I really loved all of them. 

Combat-wise, this is 100% an improvement over playing turned-based combat. I like turned-based combat but real-time is always better than imagining the action. It's very deep and you can't see everything in one playthrough and you NEED to replay the game in hard a second time. Pretty unique!

The immersive story and voice acting add depth to the experience.

However, the combat falls short due to issues with controlling multiple characters and their lack of meaningful contribution during battles. It feels like trying to juggle both tactical and real-time combat simultaneously, resulting in a frustrating experience.

The level design is disappointing, consisting of repetitive box-like environments that lack creativity. Whether it's dungeons or train stations, they seem to be generated with random props, lacking the craftsmanship of a skilled level designer.

The side quests are similarly disappointing, exacerbated by poor map navigation and uninspired level design.

Boss fights introduce frustrating difficulty spikes, and the retries are marred by lengthy cutscenes and multiple phases, which can be tiresome if failed repeatedly.

I really enjoyed this game a lot, it brought the charm from the original and remade it into something more beautiful than just pre-rendered backgrounds and blocky characters. The soundtrack is amazing, it really added to the original soundtrack as well. Though, this being a remake, is not a remaster. There are a lot of things that players would not understand if they did not play the original or know of the events that take place in the original. There are a lot of changes in specific scenes, and at chapter 18 people would not really understand the ending without having knowledge of the original FF7 and Crisis Core. That being said, I still don't feel like these things would take away from a players experience. The game is really well made, the details are amazing, and I enjoyed it thoroughly.

There are some clumsy interactions scattered across the game and you gotta accept the cheesy action sequences.  But overall I'd say the story is well done and one of the better stories I've played in recent times.  I think the setting and characters are the two strongest elements.

The combat is fine.  I just lowered it to Easy Classic after while because I was bored with the combat and didn't find it that engaging.  It wasn't hard at all, but just annoying.  I like strategy games and action games, but just find that this is a mediocre mix.  So much of it, is based on countering different weakness, but you can't switch inside the battle.  So, that means you should start over to have the correct items installed.  But that's not really interesting strategically IMO.  It's just choosing the right one.  Kinda boring.  I also didn't find many interesting combinations of materia, but I'm sure there are a few interesting ones.  For me, the side content wasn't interesting and didn't really wanna keep visiting the shops, staring at menus, etc.  Anyway, if you set it on Easy Classic, then you can skip all that hoopla and move the story beats along without the annoying parts of combat.

I'm looking forward to the second game, but I hope for more versatility and interesting choices in combat.  There's gotta be a way to make it more engaging on a strategic level.  Off the top of my head, I think they should allow switching of materia in battle, but make it cause weakness in character who switches for a period after the change.  Then you have to protect the character while they are switching over.  This would create interesting decisions inside the battles.

Rating: ★★★★★

Final Fantasy VII Remake is a masterful retelling of one of the most beloved and iconic RPGs of all time. Developed by Square Enix, this reimagining delivers an awe-inspiring experience that successfully combines nostalgia with modern innovation, bringing the world of Final Fantasy VII to life like never before.

From the moment you step into the vibrant city of Midgar, it's clear that the developers spared no effort in crafting a visually stunning world. The attention to detail is remarkable, with beautifully rendered environments, lifelike character models, and breathtaking cinematic sequences that showcase the game's grandeur. The game's updated graphics, along with the superbly composed musical score, create an immersive atmosphere that captivates players from start to finish.

The gameplay in Final Fantasy VII Remake strikes a delicate balance between preserving the essence of the original while incorporating modern elements. The real-time combat system is a standout feature, offering a refreshing departure from the turn-based battles of the past. Players can seamlessly switch between characters, each with their unique abilities and playstyles, creating a dynamic and strategic combat experience. The ""ATB"" system, which allows for the execution of powerful abilities and spells, adds a layer of depth and tactical decision-making to battles.",1684518917,1684518917,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

On one hand I was sold a story of a remake for 15 years and was crazy excited about it and couldn't wait for it to release for pc, on the other hand it came out and i started to hear rumours of it being episodic and i wasn't sure if I would be ok with that. Alas I gave in hearing of the second part being maybe a couple years away from the next pc release i could wait no more. I now find myself in a conundrum of sorts where my feelings are torn between a good fun to play game and the feeling of utter betrayal from square for telling me (for 15 years) they were remaking one of my favourite games from my youth. Now I must say that the game itself is quite fun to play and i would definitely recommend a play through or two. The story is not bad and it will definitely pull some of your nostalgia heart strings before tearing you to pieces with one of the most convoluted endings that left me reeling with so many more questions than answers. I was a little disappointed  with how linear it was with very little if any side areas to explore. I also felt like the battle system needs improvement as it did seem a little clunky at times. As a loot goblin I absolutely was appalled by the fact that for basically half the game(hard mode) items and therefore the need to search them out is completely redundant.    
In conclusion I would say that on its own as a new game if I didn't come to it my my own preconceptions of what I felt made Final Fantasy well Final Fantasy I would give this game 4 out of 5 stars, however growing up with Final Fantasy and having it mean to me what it has over the years I must say I have never been more disappointed.

The only thing that I didn't like from the game are the side quests. They were a bit repetitive and boring imho.

As the name of the suggests. Its a remake of the game, not a remaster of the older version.
While the general idea is similar between the original version and this one. There are a lot of differences between the two and it has to be mentioned!

When it comes to the story, Intergrade took the approach of expending upon the original story and updating it for the modern era with and put more emphasis on character development and story telling.
The idea is def keeping the player engaged and immersed with the world around them and Square has certainly did well with this regard. It is important to mention that Intergrade is just the first part of the FF7 Remake saga and the second part will ship later on to the PS5 and PC (As of the May 18th 2023).

Gameplay and Mechanics? Intergrade moves on from the simple idea of turn-based gameplay and fully embracing the modern real-time gameplay due to the existence of joysticks on modern consoles and the PC being far more mainstream as a platform compared to the era of 1997. While I realize that some of the fans might prefer the older turn based approach. the remake tries to bring new people into the franchise.
Although some older ideas of the past still remain in the game. For example, the inability of the player to jump or lacking the complex movement of modern titles.

Graphics and performance? When the game was released for the first time. Performance issues were really common and the game was effectively unplayable even on high end hardware but however, it has got an update since then which did fix a large part of the issues and made the game much more of a smooth sailing.
The hardware I used to play this game on was an i9 9900K + RTX 3080 10GB + 32GB RAM and maxing out the game at 1440p was proven to be no challenge at stable 120FPS at all times. But there is something that has to be mentioned and it is the constant micro-stutters.

FF7:Intergrade uses Unreal Engine 4 as its engine and unfortunately the engine has an issue with newer Windows 10/11 builds as the OS automatically enforces CFG (Control Flow Guard) across all programs and that causes various performance issues with UE4 games specifically.
I would recommend turning off CFG for this game specifically through the ""exploit protection"" settings (don't disable it system wide, use Program settings) on Windows 10 1803+ in order to completely get rid of the performance issues and making the gaming experience more sane for the eyes.

Overall, FF7:Intergrade is a solid title and I definitely had my joy playing so and experiencing the past but in the form of new. it has been done well and I'm surely waiting for the next chapter of the saga. 8.5/10 from me personally.

To be fair, this is not a bad game, I did enjoy (mostly) playing it, but what I came to realize is that I enjoy it because of the original, not this 'recreation'.
What I like most about it is that I can see and finally hear the characters in HD. And this is of course the biggest improvement, something we've all been waiting for. The problem is, that outside the graphics and audio, the game is just inferior to the original.
For me, I look at parts of this game: combat/gameplay and story.
[h1] Combat [/h1]
This is very subjective, because personally i prefer turn based combat. But I do play and enjoy actions games. Unfortunately, even if I look at the combat from action game perspective, it's not the best one.
It's definetely flashy and has nice effects, but in long run it wasn't fun.
Two main issues are:
1. Companions are doing nothing. They are just mostly standing and guarding, and because of how ATB works, they are also not building their ATB bars. Unfortunatelly that almost makes it a single character game. I usually just take Tifa and punch with her (her gameplay was most fun for me) and just check other characters when she'll get low health, to see if I can cure her using their ATB. It really disconnects you from other characters, compared to original when everyone had their turn to shine.
2. Sometimes you can't see sh*t and foes are just annoying. The absolute worst type of enemy are the flying ones, more than anything you just try to catch them. You can't even do full combo on them, because they fly away after one hit. And more than once, you just miss your special ability for the same reason.
The winner of the worst fight for me is ""The Valkyrie"" on your way to Midgar, 99% of the time, you just guard, so ""fun"" ...

[h1] Story [/h1]
Starting lightly, the subquests .. they are just boring. You could easly cut most of the game, when you try to find cats or childred, and you wouldn't miss much.

But the biggest issue for me is the treatment of Sephiroth and the main story itself.
[b] SPOILERS BELOW [/b]
Sephiroth, was this enigmatic figure that you came to know during the whole game. Here, they just plaster him whenever they can, even if it doesn't make sense, just to show him as the main villain. And even they did the final battle with him (even if it's only the first act of the full game!) just to have the 'advent children' style ending. The final fight makes no sense to be here, there is no build up through the game for that kind of fight!
They just tried to push some fanservice moments throuout the game, even if there was no point for it (and it will just confuse new players, who didn't play the original).
Also the change for them seeing the glimpse of future. It completely takes away the anticipation and surprise for the characters.
And i swear if they [spoiler] make Aerith live, they will change one of the most iconic, dark and emotional pieces of gaming storytelling and switch it to one of the most braindead actions of gaming storytelling. It will be a joke and a spit to face of all the fans, of original game [/spoiler]

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]
For me this version is mostly a cash grab on fans. I bought it few years after the release, with 50% off but it still costs more than most new games, it's crazy.
Imho it definetely does not deserve this kind of money. If the original would not exist, and this game would have different title, i doubt I would look to play it. I would definetely choose other games. And it wouldn't get to the same legendary and loving status as the original.

Being able to see some of these environments and people brought to life in a modern graphics engine is just amazing.  

That said, the character movement and camera in this game feels terrible, and the combat feels great til it doesn't; the stuns and staggers feel oppressively long for example.  As for movement.... why can't I jump, at all, or roll as I please, why? And the slowdowns during transitions are just annoying; one second you're running along just fine and then all of a sudden you're walking... ladders, why can't I just climb the damn ladders? why does there need to be a transition between walking, running, climbing a ladder, and platforming segments?  It's just a frustrating game to get used to moving around in. 

Inventory management is meh; why can't I just use items from the inventory menu? 

... I could go on about things I don't like about this game but, I won't.  Final Fantasy VII:R is not as bad a game as I feared it was going to be but, it's not nearly as good as it could have been. Hopefully they fix some things in the next part of the game when it's released.

It's not the full game, they're releasing it in multiple full-priced instalments, and this doesn't even cover a third of the original story. It's stopping point in reportedly 35 hours of gameplay is about 15% of the original story, which, takes about 45 hours to complete. At this rate, we would need 5-6 more instalments at $90 a piece, totalling 210+ hours.

Controls on PC (mouse and keyboard) are bizarre, the hardly interesting story is expanded on so there's a bit more to go off of, which, could be good, but likely won't amount to much (Own and beat every FF game, FF7 is def low in the list for the ""best FF game of all time"").

Combat is boring and clunky, in part to the control scheme and in part to the design of trying to make a hybrid tactical/hack and slash game.

Please play the OG if you are confused what the hell is going on. 

Pros:

+ Goated Combat, this game rewards you for exploiting the enemy's weakness and a lot of ways! That is always a fun combat design. It is pretty similar with how Devil May Cry does like ""Interrupting this enemy during this with that move will stagger them"" etc. Goated design choice.

+ Japanese Dubs is massively leagues better than the localized version. Most of the localization for this game kind of butchered some of the character's dialogues to make it seem they are quirky or funny when it is not consistent with the character's personality.

+ Despite being only 1/5 of the original game, this game manages to explore some of the aspects of the other FF7's universe such as the Shinra company as a whole as well as connecting all of the lore to make sense. Like Crisis Core and Dirge of Cerberus knowledge is a HUGE plus to understand and speculate what is going to happen next in the next part of the game

+ Soundtrack is really great, it holds a special place of hitting your nostalgic feeling as well as keeping it fresh. Sasuga Uematsu

+ I like how they made the research facility in Shinra actually feels scary and kind of unsettling.

+ Amazing and fun boss fights. Save a new save everytime before a boss fight! You can replay the experience anytime you want! I do this if I am bored and wants some action.

+ Cloud is massively developed well in this game. He grows tremendously but he does act out of character sometime especially the Honey Bee Inn sequence which I dont like. But I get it, they try to give it charm but thats not it. Cloud would not do that

Cons:
- Garbage side-quests that is very random and not interesting or fun to do. Some side-quests that involve minigames can be fun. Comparing the side quests for the original where what you do in the side-quests actually alters how you progress the story, however this is not the case in this one. The sidequests also removes any sort of urgency that you have in the game. Like okay I get it, we need to help the people in the slums, but cmon man, my friend is in danger and you put SIDEQUESTS IN BETWEEN HERE????? WHAT????

- Too much padding that ruin the pacing of the game. Like the robot hand sequence is completely unnecessary. The crouching or interacting with buttons to progress in the map also is unnecessary cuz they are so slow, what the @#$% is cloud thinking that he needs to pause for 2 seconds before turning on a lever??? Might be he is thinking ""Did Sephiroth did this"" to pulling a @#$% lever perhaps????

- While the new Materia is cool, the equipment you get is kinda @#$% as the AP multiplier equipment doesnt exist in this game. Only in the DLC if I am not wrong. This limits your choice of customization. Not to mention the Materia slots are supeeerrr limited in this game yet they give a lot of Materia and its also annoying that the AI does not utilize some of the materia that you equipped them with

- English Dub is super @#$%

- This game's UI design and fonts everything kinda felt soulless? But this is my personal preference. I needed to mod the font to take the form of the old FF7 style to feel more stylized and aesthetically rich.

- The FMV cutscene stutters a lot cuz Square being Square as usual

Neutral:

= This game is more fun if you have mods that makes the AI to be more aggresive and other qol mods

Overall its a fun Final Fantasy game, too bad its padded too much that it feels so cheap and you felt ripped off. Which is understandble. But I am fine with how the story is written. I was skeptical at first. But I do agree that Sephiroth do need Original Game knowledge to understand what is he on about. But the Jenova fight was a surprise. Rufus too. Alot of surprises amazed me in this game and in a good way. If you're a fan of the Original or just FF7 universe in general try this game out. Its pretty worth it. When its 60% discount.

2/5 = Without prior knowledge of the original
3/5 = Enjoyable solid experience if modded
4/5 = If Nanaki is playable
5/5 = If Barret cursed more like in the original game and they put stuff like @#$% in the subtitle would be charming. Actually yeah this game lacks a lot of charm",1683720448,1683720536,True,1,0,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,False

Taking a perfectly paced first disc of the original game and extending it into a full game was purely a mistake.

At times I felt that I was enjoying myself, but it was all because of moments from the original game - everything new is tiresome, long winded and very much 'modern square-enix' in its soulless saccharinity.

To be clear, while the original game's moments provide the best pieces of enjoyment, often they are inferior to the original's subtelty and directness - we do not need to excuse that Avalanche are a morally grey group - it makes them more interesting.

I found many of the cut-scenes stuttered, and the controls are messed up on keyboard & mouse. Even after re-mapping everything it is still virtually impossible to play the mini-games without a controller, which I do not have at the moment.
Combat is fun, but gets a little repetitive and there are few challenges. The number of particle effects can make it difficult to understand what is happening and turns dodging into a luck game against some effects. Most side quests are ""go kill the rampaging monster"" or ""click on 3 cats in town"" and add little to fleshing out the world or the characters. It's not that the mechanics of the missions are inherently bad, but they are very generic and most add nothing but slightly harder fights to grind.
The story does a good job fleshing out the characters from the original game, particularly the secondary characters, but does little to get me invested in the main cast. I am definitely expected to already know and like the primary characters. There are some scenes that I feel would be confusing and meaningless to anyone who has not played the original, and it feels the writers skipped over tension building in favor of fan service (mainly thinking of Sephiroth), much to the detriment of the game.",1683174647,1683398976,False,1,1,0.474916815757751465,0,True,False,False

While certain design choices in the game can be frustrating here and there, Square Enix has done a wonderful job constructing a game that stays true to the original while updating the combat systems, graphics, and characters to more modern standards. The combat is fluid, dynamic, and brings a surprising amount of depth to each encounter, the story is captivating, and the characters all have moments that really make you appreciate the work that went into the writing.

Heal every wound, and make me whole

Foolish and blind, to everything
Had I realized, had I thought it through
Would you be here, in my embrace?
Shine bright, once more
Guide me, to you
Smile bright, once more
This time, I will never let you go
With your every smile, hiding something more
Dark mysteries, lurking beneath
But I was consumed, with this emptiness
This selfishness, this void to fill
Hear me, once more
Show me, your smile

I'll see, the truth hidden inside your tears

Features side quests and chapter replay (which is often way better than New Game+ modes, and I wish more developers would utilize it). Battle mechanics can be switched between classic (characters fight on their own, and you just issue occasional commands, similar to the original turn-based mechanics of the original) and modern, which pretty much copies the excellent combat mechanics from Kingdom Hearts and adds in slo-mo when picking commands, as well as the ability to switch between different team members.
The DLC tells the story from Yuffie's perspective, as she infiltrates Midgar in search of materia. They change up the mechanics slightly, and add a pretty decent board game for you to play through on the side.
Overall, great game! Well deserving of all the hype!

~World design is just amazing. Steampunk like world, which I love.
~The way you go through the game is very unique. 
~Characters are awesome and unique. Their voice is spot on too.
~The fighting is good.
~Story is great. It's complicated and unique.
~Graphic is not top of the line but it's good enough. It's nothing to complain about.
~Soundtrack is good and some great. One example, ""Hip hop de chocobo""! Genius.
~Dialogue is amazing. Everyone has something to say and everyone changes after an event.
~Not open world but that's ok... Woulda been awesome if there was more maps though... because I want to explore more!!!
~Price is expensive. These days prices are just so over the place that I don't even know what to say about but compared to some other games this is pricey. Some really good ones can be half of this.

1) This is FF7 Remake, not FF7 Re-skin.  Compared to the original, this is full 3D environment (not a flat pixel map) with a new combat system and an adjusted story.  If you wanted re-skinned nostalgia, walk away now.
2) This covers only Midgar, but expands on side characters and adds side content to make it longer.  Still, a full play, covering all side quests on just one difficulty will net you about 35-40 hours of play.  Obviously more if you go achieve hunting or go for hard mode.
3) A large portion of the music is Full Orchestra, with certain songs obviously with synthesizer and a few hybrid of the 2

With that out of the way...
FF7 Remake is very much a Triple-A experience that I would expect out of the franchise.  In this case, it is not a mere reskin, but a full modernization of the highest grossing Final Fantasy game of all time.  But is it worth $10 more ($70 total) than other Triple-A franchises?

The good:
1) full graphics overhaul:  I love the modeling and 3D environments.  Iconic areas had faithful 3D reproduction that were just amazing to see for the first time.
2) Combat overhaul:  It utilizes the active hack-n-slash models with the old ATB system attached.  While this is a point of contention to some, I feel it makes the game significantly more immersive rather than staring meters waiting for them to fill.  You have control to avoid devastating attacks or help that ATB bar along.  You can do basic attacks rather than wait for a bar to fill to do a basic attack.  This makes ATB more about special moves and high damage abilities as opposed to just your next action.
3) Material adjustment:  Lets be real here.  If you were good at the old materia system, you knew how broken OP it was and made the game absurdly easy.  This one clearly limits availability of stronger materia while still leaving the capability of making solid combos.  It also adds materia specifically for the new system.  All fairly balanced in my opinion.
4) The voice acting: Overall, I feel it was a win.  For me, it really was 1 of the party characters I just didn't want them talking anymore, and some of the NPC voices were just awful.  Otherwise, I feel they were on point
5) the OST music is just fantastic.  As someone who enjoys that sort of thing, I love to hear what was envisioned but not delivered at the time due to technical limitations.
6) the weapon upgrade system:  all weapons upgrade over time with level and finding special ""manuscripts"".  This helps players tailor characters to roles while also making old weapons still viable.
7) I did not encounter a single bug or crash.  You won't find any other Triple-A game that can say that.

The bad:
1) Story adjustment:  It was confusing for a bit.  I don't want to spoil it, but the game is very much getting the Spiderman movies/Marvel treatment.  I guess they don't want to take away from what it cannon but it is just a ham trying to make it work.  It is their game so I think they can reserve the right to change the story as they see fit.  That said, the story is still very much similar to the original so this isn't necessarily that bad.
2) The combat system:  The ATB still felt tacked-on as opposed to merged into a cohesive system.  I can't really think of a way to better integrate it so I can't really hit this point too hard.  However, the AI controlled party members are not very smart so you have to micro-manage a lot.  Fortunately, they made that easy-ish to do.  It still feels like the controlled character is doing 80% of the work.
3) Materia adjustments:  You have a significantly smaller pool of materia types to choose from.  This simplifies the system a bit, but it removes a lot of potential combos.  I know they needed to balance it, but balancing on a materia by materia basis might have been a better, albeit far more time consuming and costly design choice.
4) lack of info:  between how attack is determined and what stats do what and poor translation of some descriptions makes many things unclear in what they do and how it all fits together.  This clearly was not on their priority list when getting close to release.  A little experimentation and you can figure it out.
5) 40 hours of main content:  I know it is a Triple-A game and this is pretty standard lately.  It just stings knowing that the original could keep you occupied 120-150 hours on your first playthrough, you know?

The ugly:
The work that they put into this remake is incredible.  It is definitely a Triple-A effort level.  While imperfect, the imperfections don't take away from the gameplay and immersion with no bugs to boot.  I may not personally like the direction they went with the story, but I can understand they want to make room to explore more of the world of FF7 in continuing games.  I hope they picked solid writers for future content so I can be pleasantly surprised at the story as opposed to knowing the spoilers of the original.
Now is this worth $70?  I personally say ""yes, barely.""  It plays like a Triple-A, is produced like a Triple-A, while decently walking a tightrope of upgrading parts of the game but not detracting from the original content.  This, combined with all of the music and visual upgrades, it is appropriately priced.  If it is too rich for your blood, wait for a sale.

It speaks volumes about both original and remake that the answer is a resounding ""yes"".

[hr][/hr][i]This review intentionally does not elaborate on Remake's divergences from the original story, primarily to keep the review fully free of spoilers. Whether these changes make the game not worth playing is for you alone to decide. I recommend the game regardless.[/i][hr][/hr]
Before a ""review"" proper, I will say that I played the game for close to 60 hours at 1440p60, ""High"", with a GTX 1070 Ti, i3-10100F, and 16GB RAM. The game ran smoothly throughout, and my Steam Controller worked plug-and-play. Remake, uniquely, has zero issues with switching between keyboard and controller mid-gameplay; I can begin a fight with the keyboard, switch to the controller mid-way, and it continues working absolutely seamlessly. All things considered, I would hazard a guess that most issues people have with the game are a result of user error. Load times on an average M.2 SSD are short to nonexistent.

I will begin immediately with what I feel is this game's [i]only[/i] noteworthy ""flaw""; it is advisable to play the original first. Though I think it is worth playing standalone regardless, I will say that I enjoyed it a lot more knowing just how much the remake improves on some original areas and events. The game also makes allusions and overt references to the events of the original, which often double as welcome fanservice.

Remake's audiovisual standard is superb. The soundtrack (without the jukebox track versions and the DLC tracks!) clocks in at almost [i]nine[/i] hours of pure delight, and I have no complaints about the graphics; though, as with any game ever, NPCs are left slightly wanting for detail. The game has many moments well worth pausing, taking in the sights, and using Photo Mode in. Many a time, I caught myself thinking that Remake presents some events [i]better[/i] than I imagined them as a kid, which is the highest praise I can give any remaster or remake.

A game objectively obliterated by the passage of time is restored to modern technical standards exceedingly well. Knowing the original paints that picture all the more clearly.

When I say [i]improves[/i], I mean that literally; characters that were glorified props in the original now feel like they belong, get some actual screen time and character development, and the game is all the better for it. Midgar is a sufficiently interesting area with sufficiently interesting characters and plotlines to warrant in-depth exploration, and Remake provides in spades. It's nice to have a sense of how the populace of Midgar lives through the chaos unfolding around them; it's nice to have a sense of how they perceive Avalanche; it's nice to have new minor characters breathe life into locations and events that were left insufficiently developed in the original. Most additions in Remake are executed well, and I did not feel that they took too long to complete. A cast I already loved from the original I love even more after having spent close to 60 hours with them in Remake and the DLC.

It would be remiss not to mention that Remake also has some more divisive and contentious changes. My opinion is that you should play it yourself and form your own thoughts. The care and effort put into it merit giving it a chance.

Helpful quality of life tweaks abound; the game is very explicit about spelling out where points of no return are located, back-to-back fights allow you to break to the menu to reorder your materia and equipment in case you forgot something, checkpoints and arbitrary saving allow uninterrupted progress, enemy intel (after using Assess) can be pulled up at any time during combat if you need a refresher on enemy weaknesses, and enemy skills and noteworthy steals are stated clearly to avoid having to faff around the internet to find key information. In this sense, the game is more comfortable to play than the original and other mainline entries.

Before we talk about the combat system, an analogy is in order.

The year is 2006. Final Fantasy XII and Kingdom Hearts II are unveiled. The former has a phenomenal story, an equally phenomenal English localization, and an innovative Gambit system that semi-automates gameplay. The latter has none of that, but it's vastly more fun to play second-to-second, with insanely fluid action that still stands the test of time. It is easy to understand, yet has a phenomenally high skill ceiling.

Then and there it was clear that ATB would be replaced by mixed-action gameplay. VII Remake is no exception. I [i]highly[/i] recommend you select the modern combat system instead of Classic; the gameplay is compelling, intense, satisfying, and possesses a dynamism than the original never could. Many fights are elevated from glorified filler to mildly challenging and [i]exceptionally[/i] satisfying, suitably epic encounters. Some new battles are added; some are reordered; some are reworked; all they have in common is that they're vastly more engaging than the original. Beating the snot out of a boss after countering a critical attack never ceases to entertain, and feels deeply rewarding. And though gameplay is dynamic, it is not unforgiving; you have plenty of time to think about how you wish to approach an encounter or adjust to a new phase. Unlike Kingdom Hearts, time slows to a crawl while you select commands, letting you make decisions in peace as you steer the party towards victory.

Normal mode is truly not difficult; every major fight revolves around one simple mechanic that you need to consistently apply. Usually, using Assess will directly spell it out for you, and in some rare instances you will have to deduce it yourself. Even if you repeatedly get hit by a dodgable ability, or fail to utilize a mechanic, the game is forgiving enough to give you a few more shots to stick the landing. If a fight lasts too long or you find yourself uncharacteristically struggling on Normal, in all likelihood you only need to pause and rethink your actions or retry with a different set of materia. Fights executed well are intensely satisfying and rewarding.

In Remake, there is no concept of grinding levels and AP during your first playthrough. While there are technically options, there is no reason to do it; the difficulty curve is uniform and you can expect to be suitably prepared for the challenges ahead of you at any time. Completing the game gives you a substantial AP and EXP boost, as you're intended to ""grind"", if ever, only after you've completed the game once.

For those seeking a greater challenge, completing the game unlocks chapter selection and Hard mode, which is far from a stat-stick difficulty increase; it substantially changes many fights to be more challenging. I personally have no interest in it, but it's there, along with two superbosses if you wish to test your limits.

To summarize, Remake is very much the [i]definitive[/i] version of the Midgar portion of the original; it is a truly lovingly crafted homage to a classic game that finds ways to satisfy time and time again. The port is technically sound, audiovisually pleasant, and substantially improves on the original gameplay while giving a new life to characters and events left painfully unexplored by the brevity of the original Midgar segment.

Midgar was massive! Or, at least, that's how it seemed. It was certainly feasible that the entire game would take place in this massive and sprawling, yet clearly divided, metropolis. Remake takes that feeling and makes it truth by greatly expanding on the city to provide the entire setting for the first of the remake games. And wow, what a superb accomplishment.

Midgar plays such an important role for the game though not just because it's the setting, but also because of how much character it has. It's genuinely immersive as you're slinking around back alleys and garbage dumps in the slums whilst the wide roads and brick houses up top give free space to run around in. It is part of the greater story being told. You start by associating with some eco-terrorists and part of that is seeing the social and economic disparity on display. This isn't a clasping interpretation either, it's part of the game world to comment on these issues. Like the best characters though it grows and changes shape with events happening, informing other characters and so on. Being in the world is alluring. 

It's by no means the only character though. The OG7 cast are back incredibly faithfully adapted and then expanded upon to give more depth and nuance to their actions and dialogue, all delivered with some truly excellent voice acting. Impressively, child actors are used to complete success where they could have otherwise been awkward or annoying. Instead they can steal scenes with their genuine emotion. All of this is of course fuelled by some fantastic writing that holds up from start to finish. From giving characters moments of introspection to straight up having each of them have several moments of generally just being cool, everyone is given plenty to do. This includes many NPCs who give as good as the primary cast and help to sell the world of Midgar as being alive.

The writing as a whole carefully takes the best elements of OG7's early stint and tweaks them to fill out an entire game and for newcomers should present a really engaging story that skillfully drifts into different genres without ever feeling out of place. For fans of the original, the game feels at times almost like it's teasing you to know what's coming next and either more than delivering on expectations or offering a surprising twist that is more engaging than what was originally present. By the end of the game the story is such that what comes next, what I'd expect to be next, is almost entirely up in the air. I have my guesses, yet the fact I can't know for sure is genuinely enthralling and has me poised for the next release. Whilst this ending may not quite land for newcomers to the story, I think there's enough throughout to get you up to speed on what should be, what might be, and what could be.

Running alongside all of this though is the combat. The materia system from the original game returns with some tweaks and allows for some real creativity in character builds and capabilities, even if the characters are a little more aligned for specific tasks. Though the game is no longer turn-based, and I found the active component a little overwhelming at first, after a short time I found it incredibly enjoyable and satisfying to the extent that even having 100% the offerings, I'm still inclined to go back to the combat simulators and mess around. Each of the characters have unique abilities that are fun to command or use yourself and overall, the combat has a real depth and complexity to it greater than what OG7 could have ever mustered. 
That combat is kinetic and splashy, yet still being easy to understand what's going on from simple rodent kills to strategic boss fights, just makes it a real joy. 

And on top of all this, the presentation of the game as a whole is brilliant. It looks fantastic, the menus and general interfaces are slick and easy to understand and use and the soundtrack is simply excellent. Just every track from top to bottom sounds phenomenal and covers so many different moods with perfection. Older tracks are given a burst of energy and/or layering to sound better than ever whilst newer ones slip in easily with the rest and never sound out of place. This is a soundtrack that both elevates the game it's a part of by helping to tell the story and smashes it out of the park in how track after track is just a treat to listen to.

Remake is an engrossing and enthralling game in almost every facet. Everything about it has been handled with a deft and caring hand and the result is a game that some time after finishing it I'm still thinking about it. Moments that resonated due to the scale, spectacle, performances and any combination of former, or what it means for the future games in the remake series. Few games have made me intentionally respond with joy or sadness or excitement and Remake achieves all of these with ease. This is excellent.",1682947938,1682947938,True,1,0,0.484375,0,True,False,False

This game was an amazing experience. I have played the original Final Fantasy VII and while the remake is not 100% true to the original when it comes to story, it exceeded my expectations in what it delivers as a whole. Some may complain that you are not getting the entire game as Square Enix has mentioned that this is part 1 of several episodes but Final Fantasy VII Remake will give you 40 to 50 hours of gameplay (minimum not counting extra post game content) and after you see what content was put into this game you will understand why Square needs to expand the game into separate parts. This game alone is 2 blue-rays long!

Graphics- 9.5/10: This may be the best looking PC/Console game I have ever played. Square used the unreal engine 4 giving character models and environments the royal treatment. I could clearly see the texture of main character Clouds purple turtleneck. Very beautiful game.

Characters- 10/10: Square did an exceptional job with its characters and their developments. It felt like they were real with real emotions and heart. Chemistry and interactions between characters were as good as top notch movies. We got to know the characters to their core like never before. Most character's voice actors and actresses were also right on target!

Story- 9/10: For the most part FF7R stayed true to its roots and expanded on some of the characters, environments and storylines that the world fell in love with in 1997. However, there were some expansion of story that I find questionable especially in the latter parts of the game. 

Gameplay- 9.25/10: I was worried that I would not like the battle system. Even after playing the demo I wasn't truly convinced. It is a hybrid of action and turn based. As I progressed through the game I appreciated it more and more. Now I can honestly say I love it! The new battle system might be my favourite of all Final Fantasy games. It is not perfect as aerial combat is not perfected and camera angles get messed up every once in a great while but the foundation of what it demonstrates is amazing. Aside from gameplay the game is very linear but I didn't mind it as the original was linear during the Midgar portion as well. 

Combat System- 9.8/10: Combat is amazing, boss fights are epic, story and characters truly lived up to my expectations (I also loved how they brought life to characters like Jessie, Biggs, Wedge, along with a few new faces), and I felt the materia system was truly a next generation approach to one of the things I loved most about FF7. I liked how all the classic area we all loved in FF7 (for me, wall market, shinra HQ, Aerith's church, climbing the wall, and train yard) still made an appearance, and in a lot of ways even better in FF7R. One of the best things about FF7R is the replay value, beating the game on hard, getting the bonus items/gear, and watching mechanics for some boss fights evolve truly made the game feel so rewarding once completed.

Music- 10/10: This could be the best soundtrack I have ever heard. Square brought back Uematsu (legendary composer). The music brings boss fights to full adrenaline rush as well as sets the mood of the narrative of each scene. The music itself was worth the purchase!",1682927754,1682943543,True,31,0,0.691438376903533936,8,True,False,False

I was pleasantly surprised with the additional gear and summons, which explains the beefed up price you'd also pay at the Square Enix website.
I'm an hour or so in, so I'll probably update this review at a later time and date.
I'm no stranger to the FF series; it looks pretty sweet so far...

Update:
By now, I've worked my way through normal mode and am hunting achievements on my play through on Hard. From what I'm reading, I'm sorry I didn't play the original; the story is excellent as are the graphics. Mind you the story apparently got remade quite a bit as well.
As a sympathiser with Avalanche, you'll be made to feel like an eco terrorist. the stuff you and your party will do shall have an impact on the NPC's and the environment which is part of the story. It'll also cause you to question your cause and the cost which is excellent storytelling.

A couple of glonky hallmarks of old such as Cait Sith are only present in a cinematic cut scene (so you might wanna google that).
And once you play through the game, you'll realise it is a two-parter; this is part I, and part II will get released the end of the year on PS5.
Launch dates on part II for PC are as of yet, not definitive which is a shame.

In the end, I feel satisfied and challenged by hard mode.

I had 45 hours of playtime. I completed everything, looted everything did all side quests. I can honestly say maybe 20-25 hours of this time was due to forced slow walk or crouching, back tracking, horrible movement sections, useless cutscenes, or just really, really bad map design.

Cutscene spam was insane. I don't need a 3 minute cut scene getting out of an elevator that I'm going to do 10 times. Shinra tower, and the train graveyard probabky amounted to 7 hours of playtime alone even with me constantly skipping cutscenes. It's just so badly drawn out, I was relieved to be finished with the game.

Every enemy is a giant bullet sponge, the sections are all hallway running in rails... Just so sad. Theres so much nostalgia in this, I lo Rd the Characters, but the story changes are confusing, boring, and just so drawn out for no reason.

Sections that were 2 screens in the original are 2 hours long. Why? Some of it helps immersion and Character building, but even those parts are just so sand bagged.

FF7 is one of my top games of all time, but Remake is money greedy, drawn out, just sadness. I was getting angry in the tower at just how badly disrespectful of my time the game was. No I don't want to watch 5 minutes of cut scenes, change my party, do 45 seconds of work, watch another 3 minutes of cut scenes walking a hallway, repeat. For 1.5 HOURS.

So much potential, the graphics were on point, the fighting, while fun, was power spam. The ATB system they used was horrible. Most of the characters are way underpowered.

The overall story makes zero sense thru most of the game. Avalanche is getting blamed for Shinra being sketchy. Okay. But Avalanche cell we are a part of means nothing to the main HQ Avalanche, we are the D team.... But the A-C teams suck and can't do anything?

Especially Jessie, who I barely remembered then. The world of FF7R is even more beautiful in the remake and the music... I find myself stopping sometimes to take in the music. It instantly hits you with nostalgia and sets the mood for the game. I love that it has sort of a dating sim side to it too. Tifa was always a favorite of mine and I totally ship her with Cloud. You didn't have much of a choice in the original, but this one you do! I was sort of against the idea of this remake being split into episodes at first, but I'm kinda glad they did. They've added so much to all the characters and world building that makes me want to take my time and enjoy every aspect of the game.

That being said, I think there are only 2 issues I have with the game right now. The first is that I want to level my characters up to be more stronger, but fights are so spread out and respawn time is super slow. There's no good way to level up until the 2nd to last chapter in the game, chapter 17.

The second issue is the face models for Cloud, Tifa, and Aerith. At certain angles, you can see their similarities. While it's not completely terrible, I preferred her face model during the advent children movie. Seemed less like a reused facial model and more unique. The one now kinda resembles even Yuna from FFX. But that's just my opinion.

Overall, I love this game and I'm glad they were able to remake after all these years. It's been one of my favorite RPGs of all time.",1682756441,1682756441,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First of all, think of it as of an anime - a really good one you'll enjoy even if you're not a fan of the genre - where you take control of the characters for fighting and exploring. The story has a lot of depth and subtlety, it is a an elaborate and complex drama, where all the characters, even the secondary ones, are well developed. Plus all the characters are characters, if you know what I mean.
Then there's the exquisite attention to detail where nothing is left to chance but also nothing is superfluous. 
There's a lot of moments of sheer beauty and tenderness.
The mood is supported by the scenery and a beautiful soundtrack that always fit the theme of what's happening, during the fights the music gets you hyped up like nothing else.
The battle system I find very original and also free-flowing and fun once you get used to it. It's a combination between action combat and a turn-basted RPG style where the action turns very, very slow motion while you select abilities, spells and items - you can practically freeze and select a counter during an opponent's attack. Doing more in active combat increases the speed at which you can select abilities and makes for a blending of cool combos with strategic play. They nailed it with the battle system! 
It also feels very much like a classic video game where the level design limits what you can do. I find this very charming, it doesn't try to imitate reality and feels entirely like a video game.

But first you need to know that I never played the original games on SNES or PS.
I only watched a friend playing it back then.

My biggest issue with the game are the dialogs and the whole plot.
The second thing is the low framerate although the graphics are nothing special.
I played visual better games fluently.

But the plot ... oh boy.
The characters in some scenes reacted sequentially to some events/sentences.
It's like ... somebody tells you a really bad truth and the developers felt the need
to show the reaction of each single character. So they showed these reactions one
after another with a little delay ... this felt really weird.
Similar to the scene where John Snow tells Arya and Sansa about his origin/ancestry.

Also where the ""bad"" thing happens to the city (will try to avoid spoilers).
And for no reason a totally unknown, never mentioned character appears and breaks down
in pain because of the incident. This happens in absence of any sound ... and yeah, this ""cat""-racter never appears again later. So, what was the point of it?

And of course all these ""sudden"" insights of the characters about others and
the situation ... but everyone was seeing this coming from miles away.

But the most thing I hated were the flat dialogs in general.
""I like flowers""
""Do you like flowers?""
""Hm. Ah. ...""

I fu**in' hate Cloud.
But a friend told me that on PS he was even worse.

[spoiler]
And then again ... what was the whole story about?
In the beginning you are sabotaging a company by destroying the reactors.
Later the company (for some reason) decides to crash a whole sector. Why?

After that, you never hear of them again ... instead it switches to the
crazy doctor and a folk which was not mentioned before and somehow did
not really matter after knowing about them.
The doctor escapes or ... it seems more like the heroes just lost interest in hunting him down.

Then you have these insanely stupid ""car chases"" ... oh boy.
I would prefer polishing an elephant's ""horn"" rather playing this crappy scene again (but I will ... I know).

And after finishing the ""final"" boss it just returns to nothing.
And all this shit like ""we change the future"", ""I fear changing the future"" ... ""7 seconds left"" and ""I decline the future/destiny"".
Felt like an AI generated ""write me some general shit about destiny and future which makes no sense and is not important although it contains a shitload of text"". AI: ""sure master, I will take a review from BaronFalke"".
[/spoiler]

To be honest ... the game has some nice moments.
But I would rate the game at best a 7/10.

I played way better remakes (like Resident Evil etc.)
I also like the other FF games like FF15(?) with this metrosexual boyband cruising around
and going to sleep at 20:00. Or the one game with a ""real"" open world ... where you play for a girl called ""Lightning"".

I will play FF7 Remake with some ... let's say ... ""special"" mods for the female characters.

You allied AI is beyond passive, especially for characters like Tifa who are fast attackers. I spend too much time watching my allies slowly walk around it circles to only sporadically attack the enemy without you taking control. Truly disappointing the didn't make the allies as smooth as the did FFV12, a huge miss imo. Then we have the stun-lock of enemies, not stop or slow, but stun-lock; there are certain enemies that have a mini stun when they attack and you can easily get stuck into a 5-10 second stun-lock as they keep attacking your character. Enemies also tend to focus the player controlled character the most, which when combined with the stun lock and slow allied AI movements makes battles feel incredibly clunky and unlike Final Fantasy. 

The side quests are sometimes vague in where you need to go, making a quick side quest take 4x longer than it should simply trying to locate where to go. E.G. with Don Conero's treasures the quest marker CONSISTENTLY is highlighting the place to turn it in before you have collected all the treasures. The map is also poor, not only can you not set markers (which make no sense with an interactive map) but if you view the map via your menu its completely different than the Chocobo map making using the fast travel to your quests more frustrating than it should be. 

Then we have some monsters having abilities that are just . . . well dumb. E.g. the ghost fade away ability, it doesn't make them any harder what-so-ever, it just make the battles with them more time consuming. Then we have the fliers, while I get not letting melee characters attack flying units it's incredibly frustrating when you are given 3 party members but only ONE can actually fight, the other two are stuck waiting for the flying unit to fly over passable terrain. Once again this doesn't make the game any harder just makes the battle more time consuming. I truly hope they fix these with the next one because mechanics like this make the game more tedious than entertaining. 

Last we have the ENDLESS boss battles, it feels as if there are more 'boss' battles in this game then regular battles which feels out of place for a Final Fantasy game. Then these boss battles have their own issues mainly the mid battle cut scenes and health bars. These issues tie together, first the health bar of any boss is for their TOTAL HP pool, not their hp pool for THAT stage of them. Too often when I encountered a new 'boss' I would get a limit break and use it when their HP pool was half full or more, only to have the limit break deal minimum damage because once the boss gets to X hp a cut scene interrupts, canceling all attacks and damage being done. This means unless you KNOW where the boss changes stages you can accidentally spend an entire limit break dealing maybe 50 dmg. Not to mention how incredibly disrupting they can be to the flow of battle. If you are grooving and fighting a boss that seems nowhere dead suddenly the controls get taken away from you as your forced to watch it change forms for a few seconds. There has to be a smoother way to do this, it detracts from the impressiveness of the game.

Overall I'd give graphics 10/10, changing and expanding the story 10/10, game play 6/10 at best. I'm hoping they improve the battle mechanics for future installments, simply having a more smooth battle system would have me switch the to a recommend; but as pretty as the visuals and story are, without good game play I must recommend against this title.",1682617985,1682641668,False,3,1,0.496165484189987183,0,True,False,False

If I had never played the original, some parts would be a bit confusing. It really plays on the aspect that the player has finished the original FF7. That being said, I will say the presentation is very good. Half the side quests are fetch quests, the other half are only a [i]little[/i] more interesting. I won't say any more about the story because I believe it is something that should be experienced firsthand if you don't know anything about it already.

The combat is so-so. It's not dark souls but you can tell there was at least a little inspiration there. There is a parry, block and dodge mechanics - although I will say there are lots of enemies and attacks that are unblockable/undodgable/unavoidable. You WILL take damage if you happen to be in range of these attacks, no matter what you do. This is probably my biggest gripe with the game - especially [spoiler]Hell House[/spoiler] and [spoiler]Type-0 Behemoth[/spoiler]. Those 2 boss fights do not paint a pretty picture for the combat system. I will get flak for this but I also did not like having to wait at certain points for my ATB to refill. I get the reasoning behind it but running in circles mid combat while my ATB refills (during the aforementioned boss fights) so that I can use a healing spell is NOT ideal. Otherwise it is relatively decent for the most part, a very interesting take on adapting the ATB system to a more modern and accessible real time system. I believe they are heading in the right direction with the combat system, but it still needs a little work.

The graphics are very good especially cutscenes involving major characters. The detriment to this is how jarring it is when you see an npc with a face from Fallout 4. (Yikes!) In fact most minor npc's have very bad faces, even compared to other AAA games. I'm not sure why this is the case but it is one of the only visual peeves I had with the game.
The music is decent enough. They re-imagined a lot of songs from the original and have several new groovy ones as well. 

The intermission is a brand new Yuffie based story segment that links her and solidifies her motivations for joining Avalanche. It is basically more of the same - although much easier in difficulty for some reason. The big draw to playing it is the large cutscene at the end that sets up the next game. So I definitely recommend playing through it.

Overall I do think this is a great game - perhaps it would have been an even better movie. If you haven't played the original it may benefit you to watch a recap of the story. If you have played the original I will say you may or may not like how the story has changed. 

However I will absolutely riot if they removed [spoiler]""let's mosey""[/spoiler] at the end of these remakes.",1682637380,1682637546,True,4,0,0.556266605854034424,0,True,False,False

The worst thing is that it's either trying to be the original game or it's trying to be it's own game and it can never make up its mind. The concept of this game's storyline is good, but it's not good in it's execution. The battle system in this game is abhorrent and it's actually the first Final Fantasy where I hated the battle system (XIII is a bad game but I kinda liked its battle system, for example). The music in this game sucks and is brought to you by the guys who made the music for the XIII trilogy. Uematsu did oversee the project be he wasn't involved in making the music and this game really shows that. Finally, the game logic in this game is broken. One moment Cloud can walk over dilapidated concrete like it won't fall down and the next he has to stealth across the same debris to make sure he doesn't fall. Oh yeah, speaking of Cloud. He's a really big asshat in this game, like it's really bad. His character is severely unlikable in this game. I also don't like that they keep showing Sephy every hour in the game, like to remind us that he exists. Also, this game has a case of ""Final Hallway"" in the first couple of chapters, and when the game does open up, you can only go back and forth in the slums and no where else in Midgar. This remake is really just all around bad.

Really the only thing this game has going for it is immersive graphics, and if you want to live in Midgar, this game owuld appeal to you.

My final complaint, because it's a Midgar-specific complaint, is that the lighting in this game is strange when you walk outside of buildings. The game has a strange afterglow (probably to try and emulate real life) when you walk out of buildings, and it's blinding like you just stared at the sun.

Okay. So yes, it's worth a buy. Fun combat, amazing environments, cute girls. Graphically, it's AMAZING.

HOWEVER. Overall, I can only give it... let's say, an 8/10 at the highest. Why? Firstly there's SO MUCH that isn't explained storywise. Why am I even fighting Sephiroth? He's trying to kill the planet supposedly. Why?  Who even is Wutai? They're not mentioned for more than like 5 lines as some huge enemy of Shinra, and that's all I learned about them. What exactly is Jenerva? What exactly happened to Cloud to make him half-stumble over all the time?  Won't Shinra just go right back to using the mako reactors while Cloud and gang are off hunting Sephiroth in the wilds? Why didn't we get any content whatsoever outside of Midgar? Who even IS Zack? He just shows up in like 2 custscenes randomly at the end. What ended up happening to Don Corneo? I feel like the whole ""Aerith is an Ancient"" thing was built up a lot but really just went nowhere in the end too.

And then, secondly, after the story, we have the level design. You will, no matter what, ALWAYS pick the main path before the side path you wanted to go down to find bonus loot.

And there are some slight annoyances I have regarding gear. Re-arranging materia every time you need to swap weapons was mind-numbingly tedious.

Like I loved this game and it had great production quality but even then the story and whatnot still feels either rushed or unfinished.

I did not want a 1-to-1 remake of FF7, I was excited to try the new combat and to experience a more fleshed out version of the original's story. I am a fan of the original who played it in the year 2000 and I bought a PS4 specifically to play this game. I enjoy it when a remake takes creative liberties like with the Resident Evil remakes and am fairly open minded. I went in with low expectations because I do not like the modern Final Fantasy titles but FFXV made me a little bit hopeful based on its gameplay. That being said, this game did not just disappoint me. It insulted me. 

This is not actually a remake of FF7 despite the name and being advertised like one. I wish someone would have told me what I am about to say here. Spoilers incoming... this is a sequel that takes place in an alternate timeline with a heavy emphasis on time travel and destiny. For a science fiction game, I can accept that. I like Marvel and I enjoy a little ""What If"" scenario type stuff if it is done well. However the new story is boring, poorly executed, and the writing is terrible to the point of being unbelievable. The characters may look more realistic than ever but their motivations are hollow and two dimensional. My least favorite part of this game is a new entity known as ""the whispers"" who are, basically, physical manifestations of destiny. 

The whispers love to interrupt the story whenever a character does something off script from the original game which happens a LOT and then put things back to ""how they should be"". This sounds cool in theory but in practice it is really annoying, immersion breaking, and eliminates all sense of urgency. I'll use an analogy to explain how it feels when playing. Imagine watching a movie titled FF7 Remake with your friend at their house and they hold the remote control. Now, every 10 minutes your friend will pause the movie to comment ""actually, in the original game, it was supposed to happen like this."" Then your friend gets up off the couch and physically moves the characters around on screen until everything is the way it should be and then unpauses it. The characters inside the movie are aware of your friend and comment on what just happened but then quickly drop the subject to move on with the story. This continues for the next 40 hours of the movie until, eventually, even Sephiroth is annoyed by your friend and cuts a literal hole through your TV and instructs the other characters to go beat up your friend. For some reason, the characters agree and they go beat up your friend. Now the movie can finally continue uninterrupted (credits roll)... and that's how it feels to play this game. When fans of this game say, ""this game is a fourth wall breaking meta-commentary"" that's what it feels like in practice: somebody who keeps pausing the movie and won't shut up.

So, yeah. I hate this game. I don't like back-seat drivers and it was an annoying experience. This would have been a great game if they had simply CUT the whispers out and taken the creative risks that they wanted to take as a writing team. That's why the Resident Evil remakes are so wonderful. They aren't afraid to make changes and to take risks. This game, however, was terrified to make changes and wanted to get your permission first before doing so. That's why they made you defeat the original script of the original game as the final boss; they couldn't do it themselves as writers. The whole destiny meta-commentary about overthrowing the script of the original game is pretentious at best and annoying at worst.",1682363450,1682363450,False,5,1,0.471548199653625488,0,True,True,False

More seriously, I think the game's rhetoric can be summarized by one line spoken by one of the main characters: ""Don't fall in love with the girl"" (slightly modified from the original quote to allow for generality). Equality as an ideal is about that which is, rather than that which isn't. It is about appreciating the world you have right now, as opposed to trying to change it. The writers of this game understand this point very fundamentally, which is why even though they offer you a very seductive choice of a ""pseudo-romance,"" they also give you another which most will ignore but the few who don't are those that will most likely enjoy this game and go back to it to remind themselves of what matters.

Equality is difficult. It is abstinence, it is helping others without expecting anything in return. But it is essential for preserving humans, since without it, we would just have chaos and anarchy. In that vein, I feel that the game hits the nail on the head very principally and deserves all the applause and accolades it got when it was initially released.

Naturally, the game is much shorter than the original, but I must say I'm happy with the way it turned out.
The game is quite beautiful at times, but the strict linearity left me a bit disappointed, which I guess was necessary to be able to tell the story in such an expanded manner.
The combat is quite fun too, even though I usually prefer the turn based titles. It is another successful action combat, if not to the heights of a Xenoblade Chronicles, it was still very fun.
I hope they make the next one a bit longer and more open ended.
All in all, a game I would definitely recommend.

PS - still haven't played hardmode, where I guess gear choices may matter a bit more, since the game was quite easy even on the hardest available option from the start.

I started Final Fantasy Remake Intergrade (FF7R from now on) with no experience in any other Final Fantasy title, and less than a dozen hours into the original 90's game. Coincidentally, I stopped almost exactly right where this remake ends, so I have a fresh frame of mind to analyze it. I'll approach this review from the standpoint of those who don't have nostalgia or memories connected to it. 
I worried this game wouldn't stand on its own when I learned it actually splits the original story into 3 parts (two yet to be released) and one prequel. Pretty important for a game of this price ($40 on sale)! Thankfully, the remake fleshes out the scant story from barebones to a massive 40 hour adventure, and I never felt it was either lazily contrived, departing from the original ideas, or wasting my time. FF7R is hands down the way FF7 was always meant to be played. I can see the intentions of the original staff coming to fruition 20+ years later in an exciting way.  

This is the type of RPG that tells a story instead of letting you write your own. You make very little important decisions in this game, I think about 3, and even these had to do with whether you advance a plot rather than changing it. It plays out like a 40 hour movie where you control the action but the writers control everything else. You will be watching a lot of cutscenes, a LOT of cutscenes, and for a very long time. But I would say 70% of them are spot on, 20% are welcome but you itch to jump to the action, and 10% are boring; ranging from plot-necessities to ""obviously only there to keep the game from being janky"". Thankfully, this 10% is spaced throughout the whole game, so there are almost no sections that you have no choice but just suffer with silence. 
As an avid fan of Star Wars: Knight of the Old Republic, FF7R gives me a lot of hope in what a KOTOR remake could play like. The combat is a fluid and natural mix between hitbox-response time combat like an action game and turn-based combat like a classic RPG. The trick is the ingenious ATP system, which works by having regular, real time attacks, successful blocks and patient waiting charge up a 2 part meter called ATP.  ATP is necessary for abilities, like: healing, calling down lightning/fire/ice, buffing offense or defense etc., if it's more than moving or attacking, it uses ATP. This way, FF7R benefits from the adrenaline pumping experience of a Souls-Like without sacrificing the calculated, strength vs. weakness, ability vs. counter gameplay. ""Waiting your turn"" is a real part, yet in the meantime you aren't totally helpless to the wiles of the enemy. The combat doesn't get ""old""; plentiful and varied enemy design (especially in the boss department) keeps you moving, thinking, and adapting, not just spamming buttons. Yet within a section of the story (in side quests especially), you are liable to feel mush after killing sewer rats the for the 100th time.  The original game suffered with this, too, but to a MUCH higher degree. FF7R handles this issue pretty well, yet without the complete polish of something like Jedi Fallen Order.  

The story is charming in many ways. I love how the characters branch out in tangible, rewarding ways. It's really refreshing. But often, the female character design can detract from the characters themselves. How they dress and how they behave (Tifa especially) seem pretty different. Mods solved a lot of this issue for me. After all, modest is hottest. Yet don't take me as a prude when I say the developers may have been thinking with the wrong head in some of the production decisions.

As a potential buyer, I would consider these things:
+Fantastic Steam Deck game
+Great story, like a 40 hour long Oscar Nominee
+Well worth its price in content
+Satisfying combat
+One in a Series (it's not done here!)
but also...
-This game wrapped itself up in such a nice bow by the ending I don't feel any need to go back for any post game content like achievements, collectibles et cetera. Once it's done it's pretty much done.
-Along the same lines it's not extremely re-playable, unless you're the type to re-watch your favorite movie 4x a month
-It's part of a 3 part series, and its already pretty pricey on sale. If you want the whole experience you could potentially be set back $200, albeit over the next 5 or so years. It's a large investment of time and money considering the whole 3 game FF7 Remake could take around 120+ hours to complete, not even including the prequel Crisis Core.  

All in all, I would give it an 8/10. A long game with much to come but not much to return to.",1682029318,1682029318,True,1,0,0.51754385232925415,0,True,False,False

Cons
- Real time combat has a few holes such as enemy abilities that are unblockable and supposed to show a title over the enemies head announcing which move they're using with a big red ""!"" is ironically a big red ""flag"" as this mechanic does not always occur resulting in you being caught unaware. Pretty annoying for a mechanic that is presented at the beginning of the game when teaching you how to fight to simply take time off without notice or explanation. This isn't unique to boss fights - occasionally you will encounter an enemy with for example a grapple ability that will grapple you - wordlessly - and throw you across the room without warning. You could argue that now that you're alive again - you're better - stronger - you now know about the grapple. A core gameplay mechanic working as intended would still be nice.

- On the subject of dodge - it barely works and does not feel fluid - For example - there are a few enemies that charge at you - some of them however appear to be homing with their charges and if you dodge right before they hit you - you'll discover that they will pivot 180 degrees and hit you regardless because when they designed the dodge mechanic what they really created was an ability you spam to run away. Can you eventually find the perfect timing, perhaps, will you most likely just spam roll away from them like super monkey ball and pray, most likely.

- the PC port is useless in several situations throughout the game be sure you have a controller to plug in. For example if you want to play some of the mini games, Darts being the best example - it's not impossible but you'll spend several frustrating hours aiming the darts with WASD when it easily could have been controlled by the mouse. Expect to also use A-X-Y-B at the same time for another mini game.

- tons of filler quests and random maze like maps that although not confusing do require large amounts of travel time all seemingly to afflict you with filler. They where not creative when turning the first five hours of the original final fantasy game into thirty and instead make progress feel like moving through molasses. This is not limited to the side quests which of themselves have an unintuitive tracking system that takes awhile to get used to. The main quests also give you a fair amount of busy work in order to slow you down in uninteresting ways. Sometimes the long travel time quests have their place - I can think of a few main quests where the intention was to give the player time to interact and learn about the characters in their party outside of combat. Other times you're wordlessly climbing up over and below things to no end.

Pros I guess :

- All bosses, on normal anyway, can be one shot with healing spells, spamming dodge, and only doing damage when you're certain the boss won't instantly attack you with an undodgeable ability without warning. To be honest this isn't a terrible way to play and would feel less annoying if they didn't set you up with the expectation that you could in fact dodge things based on the ""!"" warning. If you consider it more as a learning tool - like oh that ability I can't block I should avoid the boss during this phase instead of a forewarning tool as it was implied then the combat isn't terrible. Considering however that this may as well mean every ability should have the ""!"" in it's title it still feels kind of silly since realistically you'll want to avoid all damage.

- From what I've read - the characters are more fleshed out in this version - some of the characters with unfortunate ends are more relatable and you actually get to spend some time with them in the remake and regret their passing. You can forgive all of the above flaws if you loved the original story and want to experience it again with some new flavor. You may find it easier to dodge than I did or that you encounter fewer story mechanics that annoy you. The gameplay itself however from a PC RPG players perspective feels unfinished and poorly considered for a PC port. So expect to focus on the story and be overlooking a few things that might make it feel less like a loving homage to the original and more like a money grab.

- graphics are fun - world design is great - Only some parts of the world seem kind of weird and might drop your suspension of disbelief by making you hyper focus on them. Like everyone living in a shanty house except a florist who randomly has a two story house and entire canyon all to themselves. You may question what they really do that allows them to afford such prime real estate or more realistically you'll wonder what the heck a house with a yard like that is doing in this setting. Or why they travel so far to pick flowers when those same flowers are literally in front of their home. Special flowers?

- it's Final Fantasy, at the end of the day it's good to be in Midgar and experience a taste of what so many people love. However if you're new to it - maybe go play the original first as without nostalgia you may not love this game. I intend to now go try the original despite being disappointed with the remake.

Even if you prefer action combat, the flaws in the system become more apparent when you fight manually, and it seems like gameplay is designed around automatic combat. If it weren't for the classic difficulty option, I wouldn't recommend this game.

I can't recommend it to fans because it butchers the original, and I can't recommend it to folks who have never played it because they will have no idea what is going on half the time and little investment in the story.

FF7 was one of my favorite games, so I had a lot of nostalgia going into this, and I really wanted this game to be a success. I was happy to see that the production values were top notch. The game looks great, the voice work and soundtrack and excellent, and the intro got me very excited to play.

It quickly went downhill from there. They have stretched a 3-5 hour chunk of the plot from the original into a full length title, and subsequently padded with dull, pointless filler. This has really watered down the core of the story. The ending was butchered, rendering the plot pointless and confusing.

Gameplay-wise, the combat system attempts to integrate an action-type game with an ATB turn based system and thus manages to do both poorly. When dodging, rolling and attacking (and switching characters) I felt constantly interrupted by the actions available in the ATB bar and a variety of mini cutscenes. If this is an action game then LET ME PLAY THE GAME. I finally gave up and just switched to Aerith or Barrett and just held X to win each fight. Except the ATB fills slowly (especially on off characters) so you spend a lot of time waiting for your special abilities to recharge.

Overall this was a painful, dull experience with a few highlights. The good moments were all expanded sections from the original, everything else was pretty unimpressive.

I was around when the first nintendo came out, followed by the first Final Fantasy. I've followed and played every FF since then. FFVII was one of my favorites because it really added emotion to the story, the gameplay and amount of content was incredible for its time.

Most remakes suck. Especially when they first release them buggy as hell. I'm guessing this one was buggy at release. I was worried about that but its one of my favorite games so I threw the dice... so glad I did because so far I haven't had any issues with gameplay or stuttering sound or video. It has been flawless. I did set my framerate (in-game) to 90fps... although I don't think I needed to. I only did it because a friend said I should. My rig is an RTX 2060 12gb, Ryzen 7 CPU, 32gb RAM, SSD for game installs.

FFVII Remake Intergrade remains fairly true to the original story, albeit re-imagined in small ways. The cutscenes and voice acting are simply fantastic. There is an equal and balanced amount of cutscene versus player-control. I absolutely love the battle mechanics here. More real-time action than the calm 'take turns' and set each character's attack from the orginal. You can take control of any character 'at will' and push the battle however you want to. However, I rarely did that myself. The AI of the other members of your party handle things quite well on their own.

One of the best things about this game is how emotional the story is. When Shinra drops the plate on sector 7, you feel as sad and angry as the characters on screen. I laughed my ass off when Cloud had to dress up like a girl. The way they portray him during that scene is hilarious. He does NOT want to do it, but has to in order to save Tifa. It's just all so well done. Small hints of romance are peppered in via different females with Cloud being an (arguably) unwilling target. If I'm honest, the story in the original was just a little confusing sometimes. But here, the story is much more fluid and easy to understand. Everything is well explained and portrayed by the characters. To me, the story is improved on, even if there are some very slight differences. These differences make it clearer though and have more impact.

Overall, FFVII Remake Intergrade is a wonderful and great escape from life for a few hours. And believe me, most of the 15 hours I've spent so far were just within 2 days because I couldn't put it down.",1681740547,1681740547,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros
1. Story: add more gimmick so that it is not 100% the same as the original.
2. Realtime combat system. Difficult for me from the start. Once, get used to it, enjoy.
3. If you can't win the boss, restart and adjust your equipment. You can do it :)
4. Great visual XD

Cons
1. Expect to pay more on DLC(s)

TL;DR - Good game. Fun characters. Lackluster combat execution. Story pacing is good. Gameplay pacing is bad.

Pros
- You can tell there was a ton of work put into small nuances of the game, subtle animations, and classic throwbacks. All of this comes together to be a visual treat when playing the game.
- Music is good
- The story pacing itself is great - when you are reunited with some NPCs, you really get a sense of ""hey, it's been a while since I've seen them"" in a good way
- Characters are generally fun and goofy while having moments of seriousness.

Cons
- If you can only play by 1-hour sessions due to jobs, priorities, etc, you are either going to be watching cutscenes or involved in combat. The game doesn't handle balancing story and combat well and you can tell the developers struggled with bringing the high-level ideas into a cohesive experience. Essentially the segments are broken down into:
   > Large story segment with only narrative
   > Large story segment with a buffer fight
   > Free roam section where you get a batch of side quests and time to explore if you want
   > Dungeon that transitions you to the next map
- Combat doesn't know what it wants to be. Dodges do not have invincibility frames, so there is no true dodge. You are always better off guarding unless dealing with AOE ground markers. The stagger system isn't built well enough to compensate for the lack of skill slots. Over and over I found myself thinking about how much more fun I had with FF15's combat systems.",1681619901,1681619901,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm sure it was a good game for it's time but it just never grabbed me (I probably played through about half of it over 20 years ago). For reference, my first FF game was FF9 and that was the one that left a huge impact me, personally. So I went into the FF7 remake with neutral or lower than average expectations.

I bought this when it was 40% off and I'd say it's worth it at that price. It's fun and I enjoyed it until the end. It has it's typical final fantasy flaws (goofy plot points, cringe dialogue, confusing story moments, etc.), but it also excels at what final fantasy does best: Amazing graphics, cinematic story telling, epic boss battles, and fun combat. Had I paid full price for this ($90 CAD), I don't think I would have regretted the purchase either way.

There's definitely some questionable design choices with regards to their claims of making the story ""bigger"" and stretching out 1/3 of the original FF7 into one full price remake game. Some parts of this definitely felt improved, like minor characters and villains getting a lot more development and meaningful additions to the plot. But then some parts just felt dragged out like an anime filler episode. They also used the ""person falls through the floor and has to spend time catching up with the rest of the party"" WAY too often. That was pretty lazy.

Some people had issues with this PC port crashing and stuttering. In my experience, it  had the slightest stutter as I ran through towns. Never noticed any in combat. I only had crashes on one boss and some people suggested reinstalling graphics driver which seemed to get me through it. Didn't have any crashes after that. There is the odd texture glitch too but I only ever noticed it really bad in a couple areas. Most of the game ran pretty smooth and I would say performance overall was acceptable.

This game is fine for what it is and I'm looking forward to the next chapters. 8/10",1681617384,1681617384,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Final Fantasy VII Remake is a visually stunning game, which is no surprise coming from Square Enix. The story stays true to the original's overall tone while expanding on side characters like Jessie, Biggs, Wedge, and locations such as the slums, top plates, and the inner workings of Shinra properties. The attention to detail in these areas, like the captivating atmosphere of Wall Market and the emotional depth of the Avalanche team, truly enhances the experience.

The combat system has been significantly changed, shifting to action combat. While some fans may prefer the original's menu-based, turn-based gameplay, the new combat system keeps players constantly engaged in fights. Dodging, synergizing with teammates' abilities, beautiful summons (which become even better when modded for more frequent appearances), and the need for battlefield awareness all contribute to a refreshing and enjoyable experience. The game also introduces new mechanics like the stagger system, which adds a strategic layer to the battles.

However, the game is not without its flaws. Tetsuya Nomura's story direction of constantly forcing Sephiroth, fate, and destiny upon the player throughout the game feels unnecessary and intrusive. This new narrative direction undermines the pacing and tension of the original story. As someone who dislikes Nomura's storytelling style, I am looking forward to the upcoming ""Rebirth"" installment, which he has been removed from the Director's chair.

Despite these storytelling issues, Final Fantasy VII Remake remains a beautiful and engaging game that is worth playing, especially for fans of the original. The expanded character development and locations, as well as the revamped combat system, make it an unforgettable experience. Just be prepared for some unwelcome narrative changes that may affect your overall enjoyment.

I really wasn't happy about the story changes and put off playing this for a very long time. I went in expecting the worse, and was very happy to be wrong.

Pros:

1. Visually, the characters, the environment, the spells, abilities, etc. are gorgeous!!
2. Love the characters and the voice actors
3. The main story is well developed and captivating 
4. The character development is good with the materia, weapons upgrade and all to some extent. You have to make tough choices because the amount of space for materia is limited and i think it's a fun and challenging part of the game.
5. The cut-scenes are beautiful but they have some negatives too
6. Some of the mini-games are quite fun
7. The game runs well FPS wise, steady 120 fps all the time on highest settings

Cons :

1. My biggest issue is the white screen bug which happens very often, sometimes 2-3 times per fight as soon as there a ''flash'' often with the use of spells or with the natural lighting of the environment. In boss fights, it is a pain since you can miss an important dodges or guards that make you loose a combat because you just get chain stun or else afterward.  From what i saw from research to resolve it, this is a known problem that was never addressed and the only way around it is going in menu and then photo mode and resume the game.. every - single- time. For a game breaking bug it shows that the people who ported the game really do not care. This bug made me die in so many fights, it is one of the major reasons i will not finish the game.
2. It's personal to me but i hate being ''force'' to walk like at snail pace behind another character. I don't mind a little of it but this game is absolutely full of it to the extreme and it drives me crazy. Sometimes, it is for absolutely no reason, not because of dialogue, scene, etc. The game just like to slow you down for fun i guess. I'd say without exaggeration that it is about 40% of the game. Almost a walking simulator.
3. The semi cut-scenes. Lots of them are just fillers and useless. If you have to flip a switch, you will sometimes have to endure a short 10 seconds locked dialogue, snail walk speed included, about what that switch might do, even tho it's not a choice to flip it. Other times you will have a cut-scene, walk 10 meters in an area with nothing to do in it and get another cut-scene and so on. Just make one bigger cut-scene maybe? 
4. With an M&K you can't use the lock on to enemy option because for some reason is was too hard to make the camera move with the mouse movement. There's a set of key for moving character (like wasd), moving the camera has to be with the keyboard (default is ijkl) and then you gotta attack and evade with mouse, all of that at the same time. Doesn't make any sense.
5. Some of the bosses are weak to one element and if you don't have that element equipped at that moment might as well just load the last save or checkpoint and start again because you won't be able to kill them, which i think is bad design. At least you could trade an ATB gauge to change a materia or something like that
6. It is probably a development choice but I missed the classic FF grind to make your characters stronger

I'm really sad about giving this game a bad rating because i love FF games but the cons are too heavy in the balance for me. If you don't mind the first 3 cons, you will love this game.",1681375506,1681375506,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

The additions to the side character backstories was fine, achievement hunting is fun please make sure you do all side quest before proceeding into the main story!  I like that the game has several different game modes and classic. It was also nice that they did away with forced turn-based combat for the remake.I did not experience any stuttering running this game. I ALSO WAITED AS LONG AS I NEEDED TO JUST TO GET THIS GAME ON STEAM AND ANY OTHER FF GAME, NO WAY WILL I BUY IT ON EPIC LOOKING AT YOU KINGDOM HEARTS I do hope that they continue on porting any continuation and more of this franchise into steam. I do not like that this game will most likely be split into several parts, idk it seems kind of lazy and greedy; the original was open world but this is not...WELP. If you like FF its still worth playing. ♥",1681353657,1681353657,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Man do I have conflicting feelings about this game. So many things here are seriously mindblowing, you can clearly see the amount of work and passion put into this project. At the same time there are some baffling things here that just feel outdated and nonsensical.

Lets talk about the good stuff first. The presentation. Holy crap man, is this a master class in presentation. Final Fantasy 7 is an incredible setting and they really brought that alive with incredible cutscenes, music and voice acting. Cloud for example doesn't just sound great but all his lines during important moments really feel fitting for the character and the more you learn about him the more genius the little details matter here. Those kinds of details are everywhere, the entire cast gets a massive upgrade in personality, some that had barely any dialogue turning into real characters. Animations are extremely detailed and really breath life into the characters. And the world is so stunning that I multiple times just had to look and enjoy everything around me. 

Another massive improvement and thing this game does well is its UI and UX.  I can't stress how horrible the UI and UX in the original game was. If you had to swap characters it would be a nightmare to organize Materia (An equipable that gives you abilities and magic) and make sure nothing goes to waste. All of that has massively been streamlined, abilities are always clear what they do (the original would sometimes barely describe stuff), its always clear when you are about to enter a point of no return, completing side objectives is displayed clearly. Battles are smooth and clear. All of this stuff might not get noticed but it was maybe the #1 thing the original was lacking and its great to see such massive and incredible improvements to this game.

With those excellent points out of the way. Lets get into the more medium stuff.

The combat. So much here is fantastic. Characters have been given unique abilities which is much appreciated. In the original it didn't really matter which character you were using, their limit breaks were unique but for the most part Materia was the only thing that mattered. And you can swap that out easily between each member of the party. Here characters gain unique traits and abilities that really help distinguish themselves. 
 
That being said there is a lot here I also don't like. The original had a relatively normal turn based combat system with extreme amounts of flexibility. 7 Remake adds an action element to it and a lot here just doesn't feel great. Dodging attacks feels weird with a lot of enemy attacks not being properly telegraphed, the screen is incredibly zoomed in so anything behind you will catch you by surprise. You can get interrupted while casting spells which feels horrible. And the AI is horrendous, mostly just standing around blocking and attacking from time to time. Cutscenes can interupt big attacks and reset the stagger bar especially during boss fights this can be extremely frustrating with big opportunities being wasted. The AI part is maybe the worst of it all because the game HEAVILY relies on attacks to fill your ATB bar (A resource that allows you to use abilities and spells). This means that the characters you don't control end up not being able to cast a lot of spells or their abilities which is kind of boring and much worse compared to the freedom of the original game. Its just a lot more dumbed down which is sad because the originals combat was one of the most developed turn based systems out there. I wish they honestly added the Gambit system from FF 12 (a system that allows you to code how your party will interact to certain situations). 

And yes for some reason this game needed a stagger system like in final fantasy 13 and 15. This system sucks combined with the weaknesses system because it means abusing weaknesses isn't just an option, its a core element of the combat now. Those weaknesses will fill the stagger bar and if you don't have those weaknesses equiped you will end up fighting a boss for 10 minutes instead of like 2 minutes. 

The only other mediocre thing here is the port. Overall it isn't fantastic but after switching this game from DX 12 to DX 11 I noticed a big improvement and didn't notice any stutters. After that change this game ran really great for me. There are some guides that help you find out how to do that.

Now onto the stuff I REALLY disliked:

Interruptions and pacing. This has to be my #1 complaint in this game. The game is HYPER linear which overall is to be expected from the first part of Final Fantasy 7. HOWEVER what isn't excusable is the huge amounts of times I just had nothing to do. You hold forward for 2 minutes, now you have to climb a ladder for 20 seconds doing nothing, hold forward for another like 2 minutes and then face a 10 minute meaningless cutscene where the cast has to say something like: We have to make this jump, everyone ready guys ! Lets go!. This happens way too often in this game and at some point I felt like I wasn't playing a game but a movie with how little control the game ends up giving you. These issues become even more apparent when you end up trying to replay sections to get 100 %, the game gives you a chapter select and not a proper post game mode where you can just play all the post game content. This means you have to go crawl and hold forward for hours just to get to the end game content.

Story. I hate this. The original was a confusing mess but had a lot of strong points. For some reason they decided to add even more confusing things to the remake. Its very typical of the director of this game and personally I didn't want any of that extra stuff. You can really tell when the new stuff is happening and when the original game stuff is happening because the original stuff has been treated with a much higher amount of quality and passion. All the new stuff here feels like unnecessary filler and padding to turn 5 hours in the original into 30 + hours. There are even a bunch of spoilers or things teased that only happen way later in the story. If you never played Final Fantasy 7 before then the overall story beats should make sense but it really feels like it was made for those who already played and enjoyed the original. 

80€ really?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One thing that kind of fits outside of all of these points is the Yuffie DLC. Yuffie usually doesn't appear until later in the story. Here they give you perspective on a whole new part of the story that wasn't there before. And honestly this is probably the main new story part that I really enjoy. It gives you a lot more perspective on what she is doing and who she is. I like a lot of the scenes here and the ending was one of the most emotionally gripping scenes in the entire game. The post credit scene alone is also fantastic. I also REALLY enjoyed Fort condor (A mini game you play later in the original) and I love how they remade it in this game. Its really fun. The DLC is absolutely worth your time.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I might be complaining a lot but thats because this remake is extremely important for many reasons. Final Fantasy 7 is one of the most important games out there even outside of Final Fantasy. It has a long history with many fans. It introduced many to JRPG's. Its a game that deserves a lot and for that reason its hard not be overly critical of this game. That being said I do recommend this game to most players. Its fun, very polished and even with its misgivings its still a really good game. If you have never played Final Fantasy 7 I do recommend for you to play it before this, you will end up appreciating the remake a lot more and in my opinion the original still holds up in many ways.

This is a game that is near and dear to my heart. I have thoroughly played FF7R 6 times (4 times on PS4 & PS5 and twice on Steam) and have also purchased it 5 times (YES 5 TIMES). So, this review comes from hours and hours of playtime.

FF7R is one the best Final Fantasy games I have played. As someone who has also played the original FF7 on PS1 back in the day, this game is a trip of nostalgia for most but also an unforgettable journey. Whether you are an OG fan, or if you are new to the series, FF7R is one of the simpler FF games to get into that does indeed welcome new players to the franchise (difficulty options). The story telling is remarkable and the soundtrack is an absolute masterpiece. They did a fantastic job remastering classic FF7 soundtracks in a new modern way, but also holding true to the original.

When it comes to storytelling, it does a very good job of captivating you (as the player) on wanting to find out more and more as the story progresses. The game is also graphically amazing as well, especially during the CGI cutscenes. Honestly, felt like I was watching a movie with the amount of cutscenes in this game.
Combat is immersive but also fun. It is an action-style combat that utilizes an ATB (Active-Time Bar system) which makes it more like a hybrid between Action and Turn-Based. This overall made the battles very enjoyable. The Materia system (much like the original FF7) also delivers fun gameplay as it allows for a plethora of combinations to customize to your needs for any situation. 

I have for sure spoken about all the wonderful things the game has accomplished, however, I will speak about some aspects that may be turn-offs for some people looking to play. In terms of how open the world is, I would say it’s semi open-world. You can explore areas when you enter them, and some areas are quite large, but not like the scale of FFXV. This may make the game feel somewhat linear, though not completely. This other is aspect more directed to all you achievement hunters. I will say this, to achieve everything in this game, there will be A LOT of grinding required but also lot’s of back and forth (for some achievements) just as a heads up. 

I know there were many complaints when the game launched about it not being the full FF7 story (Yes, the game is only part one and ends in Midgar), and I can understand why. However, with the number of hours you already put into FF7R to just finish the game and the fantastic effort Square-Enix put into this game alone, I’m quite happy they decided to split it up into three parts. 

Overall, Final Fantasy VII Remake (DLC included) is a fantastic game that I truly believe no one can go wrong with. It is an adventure like no other that provides hours of content. I highly recommend it to anyone and I look really forward to Part 2 and Part 3.

The primary characters are interesting, the cinematics are frankly gorgeous; hell I even played with the English dub! I can't even remember the last time I even [i]considered[/i] doing that. The story is engaging and some of the set design and backgrounds are jaw dropping (I wish the camera was a bit freer to see it all). It can really give you the sense of living in these slums and having this metropolis above weighing the everyday person down. But...

The major problem is with literally everything else. The combat is mildly interesting at best and the actual level design gave me vietnam flashbacks to FFXIII. It became wholly uninteresting at points, and whilst the set dressing is awesome (I often paused to inspect all the garbage because it was ruined missle bays, or giant mechs), I found it ended up being these linear corridors that, whilst visually interesting, were barren of any meaningful gameplay, or really any meaning at all. It often felt like I was running through a tunnel to just reach the side quest or story point, it made me question what was the point of doing this at all.

And hoo boy, the side quests. The last time I got slapped this hard with filler I was watching the Naruto Fourth Ninja War. Yes, it is [i]that[/i] bad of filler. It all feels utterly pointless and derivative. None of them are meaningful, absolutely [i]none[/i] of them. It is incredibly hollow in that regard, almost impressively so.

I did them at first, I was committed to giving the game a shot; but eventually the game just wore me down. I started to ignore everything but the main quest, as you should too if you buy this game. It is the only place of substance. Honestly, it feels like the main story was this epic thing the team spent 90% of their time on, then hired a random D-tier studio to come in and fill in the remaining 10%, except that they had the directive to take that 10% and balloon it up into over 70% of the games actual content.

Is this game special? Yes, you can feel there's some magic here, but honestly, I feel like watching all the primary story cutscenes that someone edited together on YouTube is the best way to experience it; because playing this game is not the way. The boss fights are [i]extremely[/i] tedious too, it felt almost like I was playing The Division at times; hit the thing with no strategy until it falls down. And that's all of the boss fights! I even put the controller down at one point where a boss went into aerial mode and I had no range attacks, excellent combat design, guys. Guess I'll just wait until it finishes its Kingdom Hearts 3 animation and finally lands to pick up the fight again.

In many ways, this game just feels old. As if it was an RPG from the early 2010s; that's the style of gameplay and level design. It was almost kind of shocking to me, how could one of the most talked about games ever just be... this? It's very much like playing a FFXIII or a FFXV DLC, it's so weird in that sense.

On heavy sale, go for it. You might just love it, but you might also just want to push through the main story instead.",1680877270,1680877270,False,1,1,0,0,True,False,False

The FOV is so close that it makes me motion sick. 
Combat system in this sucks. It is the worst of both turn based and action based.
The enemies always will target the character you try to control, so you better not switch to a lightly armored character.
Your AI is non-existent. They are completely unable to use any abilities on there own.
They even managed to ruin the motorcycle chase. Twice I was magnetically pulled into an attack to kill me while I was maneuvering to the opposite side of said the boss mob. The next time I tried, it pulled me again and I walked away out of frustration on these controls. Now for 30+ minutes the boss mob has been unable to do any damage to my non controlled character, nor the AI that I am supposed to escort.

If you want a full game go play the original FF7. Here you just get a stretched out what used to be Disk 1 (when the game was on CDs) for the price of a what should be a fully told story.

There's a lot of padding in the dungeon design too, but without random encounters that is to be expected to bring even some amount of combat to the game.

The combat system falls a bit short compared to other action JRPGs, like Tales series. To me it feels like it would have been better to stick with purely timer based system or completely free system. This mishmash of different mechanics is just confusing and doesn't work.

Graphically it's nothing to write home about. Passable in most places, but especially texture resolution leaves a lot to be desired and especially skybox textures are at times extremely pixelated. Overall it looks like a game made for a 10-year-old console, because that's what it is. You can hang it on the lazy port too, maybe those faults would not be so noticeable at lower resolutions from viewing distances typical to TVs. 

Speaking of the port quality, most glaring fault is the lack of any meaningful graphics settings, although those should be built-in for any Unreal Engine 4 game. I also had glitchy controller inputs where my xbox one x pad buttons did not conform to the input prompts. At best the controls are unintuitive with keyboard and mouse, at worst he game is almost unplayable. For example, good luck with the darts minigame with digital keyboard inputs.

Basically the whole package is a throughly mediocre game that tries to cash in on the nostalgia for one of the greatest JRPGs ever made. If the regular price was 30€ and it went for sale it could be a good deal, but no matter how you look at it, there's just no way this game is worth 80€. Especially when this is a lazy port of a 3 years old console game made for a console of the previous generation. For holding it from PC gamers for 2 years and then another year before it was released on Steam, the price should have been seriously discounted as well. And I don't know about regular prices on PS4, but If I had paid 80€ for this, brand new on the console, I would have felt ripped off.

Overall I could almost recommend the game to a true FF7 fan that is willing to overlook the technical faults but the pricing is the piss-marinaded cherry on top of a cake with poop icing. Even considering that this game includes the yuffie dlc that was sold separately on PS4, that only adds about 3 hours of gameplay tops and adds nothing to the story.

The best parts of the story are the moments that replicate the sequences of the original game. However, they are sparse and everything else feels like shallow padding to make the game longer.  The side quests are the definition of busy work.  The game is also completely linear.  

The combat system is what really kills the experience.  It's active, yet requires constant interaction from the player because the AI cannot do anything of use with party members.  ATB bars take far too long to recharge and can only be sped up by actively attacking, which the AI won't do.  This means non controlled characters are almost useless in battles unless you micro manage them because they won't be doing regular attacks often enough to do any real damage and their ATB bars will always be so low that you can't use their abilities.  This elongates battles to the point of tedium.  Boss battles are especially bad because they regularly go out of range leaving your melee characters not being able to do anything.  Boss battles are the only battles that really require good use of your abilities too, but this will require you to constantly switch between characters spamming their basic attacks just so you can build up ATB bars.  Otherwise, characters just stand there occasionally moving and attacking.

Please play the original here on steam instead of this.  This really feels like the culmination of all the bad ideas of modern Final Fantasy in one game.

As for the port, I didn’t have any problems other than the lack of ultrawide support.  It runs fine, looks good, and with flawless widescreen you can easily enable ultrawide support into the game.

There is a lot of pros and cons, but cons first. There is a lot of bloat here. A lot of useless side quests that doesn't serve any purpose. The side quests is a task in of itself and doesn't help the player expand upon the world. I was hopeful going into this game where you could explore some of the areas within Midgar, but that doesn't really happen overall. It is just a different quest within the same areas. 

This bloat bleeds into the story in general and gives you a different experience. Without going into spoilers, the remake story comes off as being very DISNEY. I hope I am wrong with the future iterations of FF7, but this screams of a universe building for future spin offs. With all of that being said, the graphics, sound, and characters are really great. You do get a nostalgia if you played the original, and they really made the environment come out really well.

I am really happy about the action take on the gameplay as well, it feels more engaging and overall more fun, it's not difficult, even on hard mode.

It's slathered in modern AAA gaming sludge and baked in sugary, coma-inducing Tetsuya Nomura nonsense. Still, the original script that it attempts, for a while, to vaguely recreate, as well as the combat, which I think is lifted from FFXV, are essentially solid.

I don't like Tetsuya Nomura. I don't like his writing, or his character designs, or what he seems to want to accomplish with the stories he tells. His constant drive to shove cosmic-tier threats into simple stories makes everything he creates seem vapid, boring, and empty. I'm sorry for this. I know that many of you love the guy, but I think he's like the Michael Bay of Final Fantasy. I acknowledge his contribution to the original FFVII, which is basically the last of the series I'm able to take seriously, but it was very evident to me from the excruciating early-game motorcycle sequence that he had much more influence here, and increasingly so as the story strayed into sugary drivel and the worst Advent Children-tier excess that forces my brain to stop caring.

At its best, I can say that R instilled in me the wonder of exploring those fascinating pre-rendered environments that enthralled me in junior high in full 3D, and that while it told the story of a cold, rootless mercenary finding a place for himself, I was along for the ride. This is interrupted both by a ceaseless and frustrating obsession with procedural traversal animations, I suppose to hide level loading, and jarred to a halt by the game either slowing the pace at which Cloud moves for mostly arbitrary reasons, or literally pulling you away from exploration and back onto the rails of the plot.

I would still give a recommendation based on the fun I managed to have if the ending weren't so disgusting. In what I suppose to be a misguided effort to ensure that a pointless remake would not be a pointless remake, Nomura went far beyond injecting his mind-numbing brand of action into the narrative, and essentially guarantees us that in future installments, he absolutely was going to **** this up.

It's still a beautiful and engaging game, and with some indifference to the sloppy combat system, it's a well-done revitalization of a famous classic.

They have done an Incredible job of expanding upon the world of FF7 and bringing it to life and even to my surprise..making all the characters stand-out in their own way.
In turn, making the viewer actually care for them via the story..With some new additions (side quests) from the main plot, to better blend the story and character development in a more cohesive manner.

I also had worries about the new gameplay/combat mechanics as well..To completely change the turn based combat, text based dialogue, to a more 'On the Run' hack n slash style of gameplay with voice acting. 

However, the transition between the 3rd person gameplay and the use of Items, spells and ability's is extremely smooth and easy to get the hang of. While the voice actors are exactly what the fans would expect or want.

Played up until the Shinra building.

There is a dance section in the Honeybee inn when you're invited by Andrea, make sure your parents don't walk in on that one.

Everything that was in the OG Final Fantasy 7 is great. Some of the added scenes work very well too, mostly the Tifa stuff,

The Sephiroth scenes suck. All of them do. It just ruins the initial mystery of his character that original FF7 kept until you reached Nibelheim. I guess not having Sephiroth in the first game was too much to ask for Tetsuya Nomura ¯\_(ツ)_/¯, in fact it was too much to ask for Sephiroth to be out of the screen for more than 2-3 hours. You'll be seeing Sephiroth's face at points and think ""Not again"", I started getting a similar reaction with the ghosts. It's like you're enjoying a fine story that's standing on its own two legs and you can just see Nomura's hand reaching in and telling you that he's there and directing the game so stuff is gonna get convoluted and weird.

WHY show the plushy cat (Cait) during one of the most emotional scenes of the game? He shows up out of nowhere so you suddenly see a goofy cartoon cat that you know nothing of feeling dejected and sad about what's happening, instead of focusing on the characters we do know who are ziplining for their fucking lives.

The side content is nothing, mostly walking around finding stuff in town or killing a few monsters. The dialogue in these would be their only saving grace if it were good, but it's just generic throwaway lines.

A lot of the scenes and conversations added don't do much since they can't progress the story, they're trying to pad out a 6-8 hour story into a 20-30 hour one and it shows when you listen to it.

There is a lot of padding. A LOT. Here's a few examples:
- Constant wall shimmys, seriously. You will be surprised how often the game makes you shimmy. It slows you down so a 4-5 second walk turns into a 10-20 second slog. Yes, Cloud's biceps are very detailed and shiny, I've seen them two dozen times up close already, thank you.
- Small sections of the original game turned into giant ones in this, but providing more or less the same content. So what was 3-4 screens in FF7 is now this giant sprawling dungeon in Remake with almost no enemy variety and constant running through halls and into battle arenas. (I see you, 10% player drop during Aerith's first section, who the fuck came up with the hand crane puzzles?)
- Ladders everywhere.
- Some scripted battles go on for way too long, usually because of huge HP pools for bosses. You should technically come in prepared but you have no way to change materia mid-battle and you can't know a boss' weaknesses beforehand. So yeah, go and die once if you don't wanna spend 30 minutes fighting it with unprepared characters. You could also look up a guide online but having to do that is not a good show for a game like this. 
- Chests with some really inane objects thrown around on dead ends. Those precious few seconds you spend going through the hall, opening the chest, getting the item and going back to the main path add up. 

It's tiresome, it's nothing, it ruins what FF7 can provide to you as a well-crafted storytelling game so you get the big shiny headline that says your game is 40 hours long when released. I hope they move away from this in the next game and actually provide the original story with meaningful new content.",1680395130,1680395323,False,2,1,0.497925341129302979,0,True,False,False

I feel strange in not being able to recommend this game on the whole, because if I had simply stopped short of the final chapter, if someone had just taken the game away and forced me to uninstall, I would've told you that it's a no brainer. I never played the original, but the characters, the writing, the innovative combat--all of it was damn near perfect. 

Then the ending hit. If you are someone who appreciates RPG story-telling with any degree of sophistication, then you're going to have a problem with it. And if you're like me, then you're going to have a big problem with it. I never played the original, and if you haven't, let me just say that this ending is downright nonsensical. The final chapter of the game completely derails you from what you thought you were doing, and shoehorns in absurd plot points involving alternate timelines, giant space monsters, and a villain who you (as a presumed new player) have never even met or know anything about. I understand they want to do something different with the way the story will be told this time. I understand the meta-commentary behind what they did. Some of it even sounds interesting on paper. But you can't tell me the way it was done made any coherent sense at all. Characters act completely contradictory to what I'd expect from them, and the grounded nature of the story, the feeling that the world is real and unfolding in a logical way, is completely robbed from you. 

I wanted to replay this game on Hard mode after I was done. I liked it that much. I was eager and enthralled at the prospect that two more of these were going to be coming. I stayed up rewatching some of the cutscenes because I thought the game was just that damn good. And now it all feels vapid and hollow. I can't recommend the game because of how good it is, and how much it makes you believe in it, only for it to spit in the face of the trust it builds up in you with that farcical ending reminiscent of Mass Effect 3.",1680392507,1680392507,False,1,1,0.484848499298095703,0,True,False,False

The boss fights are unnecessarily long and tedious. The cut scenes have a tendency to last too long. I'm all for story driven narratives, but good lord, dial it back. I've probably seen what feels like 3 hours of cut scenes at this point.

The new fight system has a steeeeeep leaning curve, and is easily the worst part of the game (for me) at this point. I'm more than 15 hours into this game and still struggling with the fight system. Maybe it'll get better. And maybe the combat system is the new norm for this genre, I don't know, but it kinda blows. The last time I played this genre was FFX. In any case, I would have preferred the classic combat system. Not this new ""classic"" combat system which also kinda sucks. The new ""classic"" combat mode just means that offense and defense is done for you (sort of) so you can use spells, items, and abilities -- IF available. A lot of the time items, abilities, and spells are not available because a certain meter isn't full, and it us usually at the worst possible moment. Then you just die.

I really would have liked to have seen an option to switch to the vintage '97 combat system for some of the longer more tedious boss fights.

Throughout the game, the characters are developed in a way that makes them feel like real people with unique personalities and backstories. Players will find themselves invested in the fate of the characters as they progress through the story.

+ Inventive Story: This is definitely not a Remake. Its a sequel that happens to retread, expand and synthesize the best parts of the Compilation of FFVII.
+ Design: The world, the characters, especially Tifa, the various hub levels like Wall Market, are just plain gorgeous. It kinda drives home how far graphics have come since the original when you're in-game engine looks better than even Advent Children.
+ Combat: The game's battle system is a refined iteration of Final Fantasy XVs, blending tactical gameplay with face paced action that also rewards proper build preparation without the idiocy that plagued the four stooges of XV. 
+ Soundtrack: Pure perfection. Say what you will about the game remixing the same songs from the first game eight times over, each one of them is a musical tour de force that'd put any other soundtrack to shame. Standouts include the The Airbuster, the Hell House and Nighttime in the Under city, as well as newcomers like Midnight Rendezvous and Jessie's Theme. To say nothing of the in-game jukebox jazz remixes and catchy weirdness of the Turtle Songs. Uematsu turned in 100 song soundtrack for what amounts to the 1st half of disc one of the original game and it serves as a high note to herald his retirement. 
Fort Condor: Its back and its fun as ever! 

Cons:
- Linear: There is no room for exploration in this game. You pretty much go from story beat to story beat, with brief pauses in between that let you level up by beating up on mooks.
- Optimization: Being a PC port of a PS4 game it has difficulty getting the most of higher end GPUs and processors to hit consistent 120 FPS.
- Repetitive: You will have to replay the game at least twice on two difficulties, some sections thrice and grind a lot to master your materia, maximize your equipment and take on the secret bosses. The campaign itself should not take more than 20 hours on normal and the rest is plain old fashioned AP farming or repeating certain sections to pick up the odd collectible.
- Padding: A lot of sections in the game feel like needless padding. If its not bad level design, like the Drum, its characters making comically bad decisions or take needlessly long approaches to reach their goals. Which can get aggravating since you have to go through the game at least twice.
- Inconvenient: You will have to slot and reslot Materia A LOT, multiple times even through just one dungeon. That's at one dozen little balls you have to pick out of a scrolling menu with only rudimentary sorting per character! Which can take anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes depending on how OC you are about tuning your character.

Conclusion: Buy it. Play it.

The original Midgar section lasted around 4-6 hours and it got padded out in such a way that the original essence of the game feels lost. This was done so Square Enix could release the game on an episodic format and squeeze every last cent, cashing in on fan´s nostalgia. I left it half-way because of how tedious and ""not-fun"" it was to play.

Pros:
-Beautiful graphics.
-Optimized? (I´ve seen people complaining of fps drops and stutters but it run well for me atleast)
-Some fun segments that remained faithful to the original (e.g: soldiers chase after you after reactor 1)

Cons:
-Pacing and inconsistencies: The game does not care about the source material by removing any sense of urgency and stakes from the original plot. (Sepiroth is shown extremely early on the game and spoils major story events, Main characters that met their demise on the original game just keep surviving catastrophic events for no apparent reason ([spoiler]Wedge surviving an entire section of the city falling on him[/spoiler]). The main general complaint are the ""whispers"" which are some cheap narrative device that apparently ""justify"" the events occur differently and makes a nonsense argument about fighting destiny.
-Endless padding: Npcs that give you boring fetch-quests that contribute nothing to the plot (the game has at least 5 hours of quests like this. Original sections (blowing up reactor 5) are extended from lasting 20-30 minutes to 3 hours just to expand the game´s runtime. Constant detours due to the devs being lazy and not knowing how to make engaging gameplay (e.g: solar lamps on reactor 5)
-Mind-numbingly bad dialogue from most characters: most of the main cast is exempted but npcs are dull, uninspired and unmemorable

Overall the game is an insult to the source material, JRPGs (we have already seen it with FFXV that Square Enix is on a steady delcine) and the players who bought it. 4/10. Do not feed corporate greed.",1680280458,1680280458,False,48,7,0.583065569400787354,7,True,False,False

I personally loathe this game for several reasons. First let's start with the combat. There are two modes: Normal and ""Classic"". The ""Classic"" combat is just a the normal combat but it automatically pauses for you to use your ATB attacks. It's not actually like classic FF combat, it's just pretending to be. The ATB system is also extremely clunky. To fill the enter you must hit your enemies with your standard attacks, which is extremely annoying to do against any enemies that can block them, or exit from your range of attack, and when you do get to use your full commands, there is a good chance the enemy can knock you out of your move, stopping it from happening and wasting the ATB charge.

Next, the story. The game does a lot right, with giving us more backstory for characters like Jesse and Wedge, including a great chapter where we see Jesse's old home with her. But for everything right, there are multiple wrongs, with the biggest and worst thing hands down: The Plot Ghosts. These god damn things are an active mockery of established FF7 fans that just wanted the original story. They intervene whenever the characters are about to do something that would fundamentally change the plot of the original game. In universe these ghosts are never really explained, and don't even add anything to the plot either. There is a point where they are showing the characters visions of future events from the old game, but without any context, they are just nonsense to both the characters and the player if they were not previously an enfranchised player. This entire thing reeks of Nomura's writing style. Making up nonsense that doesn't actually mean anything and is never properly explained, and expecting it to have an emotional impact.

And finally: this games pulled a Metal Gear Solid 2. The demo does a bait-and-switch that edges on false advertising. It came out and was mostly everything that people wanted: a straight remake of the original game with no changes to the plot. The demo ended with the end of the bombing mission and the Mako reactor explosion. This is similar to how the demo for MGS2 was everything the fans wanted. More Snake sneaking around dealing with metal gears. However, once you pass the threshold that was the end of the demo, things immediately start to change. Just as when Raiden was introduced as the actual main protagonist of MGS2, those god damn plot ghosts start showing up, as well as cutscenes where they blatantly show off Sephiroth. Sephiroth was originally a slow boil, with his reveal being at the end of Midgar, but this game just wants to shove him down our throats constantly, ruining all the mystery.

It's just such a shame that this game makes me as angry as it does. I love the art style, I love the music and the remixes. I loved everything that happened in the story between leaving the church with Aerith up until the end of the Train Graveyard, because all of that was just a straight retelling of the original story without a single plot ghost in sight. There were moments that made me extremely happy, but all that was overshadowed by the unyielding rage that the rest caused. I hate this game.

If you're interested in playing on the Deck, I didn't play it off my Deck but streamed to it from my PC (since it could run max settings 60fps this way), and the buff + debuff icons are too small to see on Deck.  So I wouldn't recommend playing this on Deck.

Beating the base game on normal took me about 32 hours.

The game still has stutter unfortunately, but this mod fixed it for me (though keep in mind it will dramatically increase load times): https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7remake/mods/139

Install FFVIIHook and Stuttering Fix seperately rather than through the bundle, since at least the FFVIIHook included in the bundle zip was out of date when I used it.  Then copy the Engine.ini stuff over to the end of Engine.ini where you extracted FFVIIHook.  You'll also have to add ""-d3d11"" (no quotes) to the launch options of the game, under right click on the game in library - properties.

The game didn't tell me this until on a load screen very deep in the game, but pressing the touchpad on the PS5 controller during combat shows you information for enemies, so you don't have to rescan enemies you've already scanned to see their weaknesses.  I would guess the same input on an Xbox controller would be the back button, not sure about on PC.

The game also doesn't tell you that if you see the ""Menu"" button in the lower-left of the screen during a cutscene, holding that button until it confirms the selection will bring up the menu once the cutscene is over, letting you choose materia before the next battle if your characters change or whatever.

For most sidequests the game marks where all the sidequest start NPCs are on your map, and then at least marks the general area of where to go to do a sidequest.  However there is one quest during chapter 9 where you get medicine based on the level of one of your materia (which I didn't have leveled up much), and then it gives you no indication you are on a quest but you are expected to run about aimlessly looking for three sick people to use medicine on.  These people aren't marked and the game doesn't say you are on the quest so it's easy to think you aren't, but you are.  I only received 2 medicine due to the level of my materia, and there are 3 sick people, so I couldn't complete this side quest.  Also during chapter 14, the game does not mark any of the NPCs for sidequests on your map until you have found and interacted with them, so you probably want to use a guide to see how many there are if you're a completionist.  However due to being locked out of completing the chapter 9 medicine sidequest due to my materia not being high enough, I don't think I can get the all sidequest achievement this playthrough.

The port doesn't have many settings on PC, just texture, shadow, resolution and framerate (max of 120) settings.

Some of the ""walking simulator"" sections of the game move too slow, I especially dislike sections where you're climbing around on the ceiling since it feels so clunky and just wastes time between cutscenes and combat.

There is at least as much time in the game spent on cutscenes and ""walking while dialogue happens"" sections as on actual gameplay - at *least* - so if you are cutscene adverse, this game isn't for you.  You can skip most of the voice acted lines after you read them to speed things up, but there are absolutely plenty of scenes where you have to wait for all the voice acting to finish and can't skip individual lines, just a whole scene.

If using a PS5 controller (like I did), disable Steam input through the Library right click - properties - controller settings to get proper PS5 controller rumble.

Also the only difficulty-related achievement is for beating the game on hard mode which doesn't unlock until you beat it once, and all that's available on first playthrough is easy or normal.  There is also apparently a superboss locked behind hard mode (I'm not a fan of this decision), and I'm pretty sure there's an achievement for that.  You can change the difficulty whenever you want, so if you want you can start on normal then if it's too hard you can drop it down to easy without worrying about it affecting an achievement.  I left it on normal and the only fight that took me more than one attempt was a fight maybe 10 hours in in the colosseum (a forced story encounter where you can't leave to grind better materia skills or anything until after you kill this boss).

One thing that really frustrated me initially with the combat was some enemies will attack then run away, or dodge attacks frequently.  But this was alleviated when I remembered that putting Cloud into Punisher mode (triangle on PS controller) and then holding R1 (block button - and holding works, you don't have to time it) causes him to counter the first attack that hits him, which seems to also always temporarily stun an enemy so you can get attacks in.  Just a general tip.  Don't be afraid to switch characters to build up more ATB gauge and spread MP usage around.  Also even once I unlocked higher level magic (-ara, -aga), I would still use the entry spells since they were cheap and built up stagger gauges pretty good on certain enemies, and the damage on the higher skills doesn't seem to scale to exactly how much more % MP they cost.  The higher level spells also take longer to cast, and it isn't too difficult for enemies to interrupt you.",1679940135,1680054382,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

THE MUSIC:
This is one of the best music scores in any video game from the Final Fantasy series, I loved it when I was younger, I love it now. The music is so versatile it's crazy. 

THE GRAPHICS:
Finally! The developers made a big change to the graphics of this series. FFXV looks good, but damn, this game is amazing. Finally I can see the Materia on the weapons, something that was not possible on the original version of the game, also Tifa looks awesome XD. The lightning and texture quality are very good this time around. But, there are some problems too, the settings are limited for this title, so that means the performance will surely impact a lot of systems. Then there are a lot of muddy textures, and I don't know why but I always see this in FF games, there are some assets that have a lot of geometry, and there are a lot that have too little geometry. This is generally bad as it breaks the immersion of the player into the game, it looks ""fake"". This is something that I saw in every new title that was released from this series. 

THE SOUND-DESIGN:
Mostly solid work, sometimes annoying when you have your squad follow you the footsteps are a little bit too loud and repetitive, but I got used to it easily. The voices are implemented very nicely, that means there are no problems with lip-syncing.

THE GAMEPLAY:
Another solid work, this combination of old style combat, like in the original FFVII with new style of combat like in FFXV is amazing, it fits pretty well. There are some puzzles too, some are easy, some are difficult, a lot of interactions. The camera moves smoothly and no bugs encountered yet.

THE CHARACTERS:
Awesome characters, very detailed. This remains a problem of the series, the characters are a little too childish for their age (Cloud Strife 21 years old), this, again, breaks the immersion and is pretty bad overall, and sometimes they act too ""mature"" let's say, so there is not really an equilibrium to this. Some choices are a little weird too.

THE STORY:
Same story (very very good), but the devs added some ghosts, they are strange and don't know what is that about yet. 

This game is awesome (the price is justified, not so many side quests, and the story is long, if you want to complete everything, like I sometimes do with a lot of games is almost 100h), the story is very good, and the music is amazing, solid 10 for this one.",1680035039,1680035039,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Do not think that this game is just a remake... It's a whole new game based off the story of FF7. There are elements that were never in the original, and they have sprinkled enough new content in the mix to keep you engaged. There is a ton more character development in the Avalanche minion trio. There are new missions and quests that had nothing to do with the original.

Game play is somewhere between Kingdom Hearts and an action adventure game. There is no turn based fighting, everything is live action. When you pull up the battle menu it stops the fight for you to browse your menus for the spells and attacks you need. Also great if you need a break in the action for a moment.

The Graphics are amazing, and looking around Midgar in 3D and seeing everything in a non polygon or pre-rendered background is amazing. It really gives you a scale of how huge the city is supposed to be. The environments have really drawn me back into the world. The Summon Materia is crazy amazing looking, I cannot wait until you get Bahamut in the next game. 

I was a little annoyed at the game play at first and the changes in the story line... but then I found myself en-wrapped in the story line and characters again. It is a new game, but there is a string of nostalgia in there that really drew me in. The battles while it takes a bit to adjust to in this world becomes fun and engaging. While it is a challenge, I didn't wipe until fighting a tonberry... That Chef knife attack is as deadly as it ever was in the series. The music in the game has elements of the original but has been rewritten and refreshed. It is everywhere and I love that you can buy the tracks in game to play whenever you want to... If you don't like the music a jukebox is playing you can set it to your favorites.

My biggest gripe in the game is that it is almost over for me on my first play through. I knew this was basically just the first disk of the the original FF7 game... your time in Midgar... but I really don't want my time here to end... They will have the sequal as a PS5 Exclusive which really pisses me off. When Exclusives are the only thing drawing people to your hardware, you have crappy hardware. There have been some complaints about the price, but this is a full game and the the 2020s. Game prices are going up industry wide. I would call this a 30 hour play through game... which most people pay $60 for all day long. I got on sale for $40 and I am ok with the price for the amount of fun I have had... and repeat replays will just make the value better.

This game is quite a bit linear... but the beginning of FF7 was too as you were stuck in the city and very bound by events that were happening. The Open world feel did not happen until you left the city and started travelling the world. I really hope they open the scope of the game in further titles. The camera can be a pain at times when you are in tight corners or going up the stairs... but the camera is a common complaint in modern gaming. 

Overall I really recommend this game, it is like you are playing a movie. It really goes well with Advent Children, and is a positive addition to the series. I just wish the rest of the trilogy would hurry up!",1679919157,1679919157,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It feels like this could have been a Devil May Cry (*cough* Roach *cough*) game with some ATB sprinkled on top it. Far too much button mashing and running around. The story itself, I don't remember playing out like some cheesy, trope-y anime. Maybe it's the delivery of the voice acting, but even with voices off, the script doesn't have the same impact as the OG does.

The side quests are stupid filler ""fetch"" or ""kill X beast or # of X beasts"" and another indicator of the toxic gameplay mechanic in so many games in recent years, purely to stretch out more game time. If I wanted to sink game time in stupid things, it would have been doing random encounters to power-level my characters.

Not to soley shit on the game. The graphics, assuming you can run them at max settings without stuttering (I just cranked the refresh rate to 120fps in the game options, even though I have a 75Hz refresh rate) are crazy good.

Having over 1,500 hours in FFVII, the original, and owning 3 copies of the game (PSX & PC), I can honestly say they did pretty good. Having already been spoiled, nothing was really a surprise to me when it happened, but I will say that until more of the story is revealed, I can honestly say I am fairly confused about the plot beyond the original game's route. Granted Side Quests not included here, just the differences in the main story. But to be completely fair, this is like part 1 of however many they plan on releasing. I would love a true to life Gold Saucer, and possibly a bit of an online shuffler for prizes you can win, and events you can do. I always liked FF7 originals prizes, but I feel like the potential to unlock costumes, or cosmetic weapons & armor, or even unique items that change each day, week, or month could be nice. Personally, I don't like the concept of daily/weekly events to earn points for unlocking items, which I hope they don't do, but it could honestly make the game a little more fun. Granted, I could see a lot of comparison to FFXV in that regard though. They had a lot of challenges you could do in the main game that were changed every few days to a week. But, that said - If they go that route at some point, will it be accepted or rejected?That said, they can do a lot of things for the Remake without changing the story in such a way it destroys the fan-base. I personally really liked the Events on FFXV, and FFXIV that allowed you to win cool things, and even though FFVIII was the game that originally had Tetra Master, would people hate it if they added a mini-game that allowed you the collect things? I mean, I'd love to see a nice Battle Arena remake, and have special tournaments, or boss battles that come out once a week or so. Like to fight heroes, defeat powerful monsters, especially if they come in later in the game, it could help with testing the strength of the enemies and new tricks they could give them in later parts of the game.I am really looking forward to FFVII Remake Part 2, and hope it includes Gold Saucer, as that what I did for literally hundreds of hours as back when the game originally came out, being a teenager, I feel I had the best experience, as I feel it was directed more at teens, and adults. But, being one of the first of my friends to get a Gold Chocobo really brings back so many good memories. I hope to see some big things in Part 2, even if I personally didn't like Part 1 of the Remake, as I loved how much the game opened up after you left Midgar, as Midgar to me personally felt cramped in the original game.",1679852537,1679852537,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The price is too high, it's missing 3/4 of the original game, apparently all the other installments of the game will be PS exclusives, and with a release rate of 1 part every 3 years, lets be honest, they're never going to actually finish it.  So, assuming there's going to be like 3-4 or so installments of the game, and having to buy a PS5, it's going to run you the better part of $800...for a game Square will abandon before we even get to the Gold Saucer due to lack luster sales because it's too expensive, and taking too long to release.  Absolutely insane, right?  I would normally rip this thing apart, decry Square for their desperate cash grab, deride them for the string of increasingly poor games they have put out, etc. etc.  And yet...And yet...It is undeniably awesome;  just mindblowingly well done.  Nearly every texture, scene, and map is carefully laid out to exactly capture the original game, but in a totally new immersive experience.  The whole thing absolutely oozes with nostalgia.  Even the combat system has a ""classic mode"" to fix the awful pseudo hybrid action-turn based abomination FF has had for awhile now, and gets it closer to it's proper JRPG roots.  Every thing has grown up a bit; less cartooney, less slapsticky humor; it has grown with it's audience.

The first I found is the battle system. Real-time combat systems can be a lot of fun. You just have to look at DMC or Elden Ring to see that. Turn-based can also be great, as the original FF7 demonstrated. But what they've gone for here is some bastardised combination of the two, where it's real-time except you can't use magic, skills, or items until your ATB gauge fills up. And it often takes far too long to fill. The original FF7 had a perfectly good battle system, and I would have been over-the-moon if they'd kept it, but I understand they wanted to go for something different, so if they're going to go real-time then they need to commit fully to it. [hr][/hr]Battles themselves were often either far too short or far too long. Bosses were absolute HP sponges. They all had some gimmick you had to figure out to do any real damage to them (just pray you happen to have the right materia equipped in advance, because early in the game there are a lot of materia choices and not very many slots), but even after you figure out their weakness they still take far too long to defeat. Maybe I'm spoiled, given the last game I played was Persona 5 with its near-perfectly paced battles and strengths and weaknesses system, but the fun is in finding the enemy's weakness. Once you've done that, finishing them off should be super quick, not 10 minutes of gradually wearing them down. [hr][/hr]The story too was extremely padded for time. They've taken the opening 5 hours of the original FF7 and stretched it into a 30+ hour RPG, and it really shows. The game is filled with inane sidequests, right out of the big book of stereotypical RPG sidequests. I mean, you unironically get a quest to kill 4 rats at the start of the game! If that doesn't show a lack of imagination I don't know what does? I also had to laugh when the party, twice, decides to put off rescuing Aeris from horrific experimentation in the Shinra building so that they can hang around the slums and do more chores for the locals. [hr][/hr]The main story itself has been given the Kingdom Hearts treatment, i.e. overcomplicated to the point of being entirely incomprehensible. The original Final Fantasy VII had a lot going on and could be hard to follow. Now they've thrown in a whole other heap of stuff about whispers and destiny and a load of other crap that just distracts from the main action. I know the Final Fantasy VII story because I've played through the original, so I could sort of keep up. An uninitiated person hopping into this game wouldn't have a hope of keeping up. Square really needs to learn that making a plot super dense does not equal making it good. [hr][/hr]Overall it was an okay experience, but not one I'm likely to repeat. It kind of makes me feel like going back to play the original though. In fact, if they'd just put all of this effort into rereleasing the original game with all of the souped-up 3D environments, detailed character models and voice acting of the remake I think it would have been a much better use of their resources.",1679649179,1679651588,False,214,14,0.72773134708404541,0,True,False,False

Disappointing combat:

Combat system is ALMOST the best of any FF game but it's ruined by an over abundance of crowd control. Every single encounter in the game has one or more enemies that can stun lock your party members with no opportunity for recovery... you just have to wait it out and spam heal the stunned party member for what feels like an eternity. 

It feels like they came up with an incredible core concept and got lazy during implementation.

Bad writing:

The game is jam packed with hours and hours of poorly written dialog. Every character in this game is the most annoying character in the game and after a few hours you'll be pulling your hair out every time a character opens their mouth. 

Blues Clues has more interesting dialog than FFXIIR.

Completely linear (my biggest complaint):

No random encounters. No over world. No exploration. No opportunities to farm EXP, Gil, or items. No opportunities to go back and collect the items you missed in the early game. I actually quit playing after nearly 40 hours when I realized that I had missed an essential materia early on and there was no way I could go back and get it. Once it dawned on me that I could never acquire several unique items and weapons for the rest of my play through I completely lost interest.

The game is completely linear. Once you complete an area there's nothing to do but move on to the next area.  This means the amount of experience that a player will have at any given point in the game is progressively gated and the enemies you encounter are tuned with this predetermined cap in mind. You can miss items and fall behind but you can never put in work to catch back up.

This defeats the purpose of a character progression / leveling system because, as I mentioned before, your party members' level and equipment is strictly gated. You could give every character and NPC in the game fixed stats and the game would play almost exactly the same.

That being said, the story is 90% accurate to the original. One major change is the addition of these time traveling ghosts that interrupt the characters. Other than that It's basically the same classic story we all remember with additional characters, subplots, and updated game mechanics.

I wanted to talk about my gaming experience. I've put in over 300+ hours into this game on the PS5. It looks and plays great on console. On PC has some minor issues that might bother some folks. After playing a few hours I noticed frame drops and issues with visual quality. (I only seemed to notice this once I got to the sector 7 slums in chapter 3). You can play with the settings but nothing will fix the issues 100% without maybe installing some mods. I'm also playing this on the Steam Deck and I've been playing on lower settings. It's still playable so it's not to bad and didn't hinder my enjoyment of the game.

Now I want to get into the gameplay and story. This is only the Midgar portion of the story. Which only covers about 5% of the original's story but this game has A LOT to offer! All the parts of Midgar that we remember from OG are here! The original cast is back and they are the best they've ever been. New characters and dialogue were added. The city is so big and the graphics are beautiful! In the slums section of the game you can hear NPCs talking about their lives and struggles. They also update you on current events if you stop to listen to them which is cool. One of the best parts of the game is Wall Market. Depending on which conversations you have (or don't have) with certain characters can dramatically change the outcome of some quests. 
There's so much to do you couldn't finish it all in one playthrough. Side quests are also not mandatory which is nice!

Most of the scenes from OG 7 are still here.
The only scene that was censored was the hallway scene in the Shinra building which I think is kinda silly.

The music kicks butt. Not only did Square manage to add every Midgar track from OG. They improved upon them and even added some new ones which I appreciate. 

Square really went above and beyond with this one. It if goes on sale I'd recommend picking it up if you haven't already. The DLC is worth playing to so check it out!",1679594200,1679605202,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

I will honestly admit I hate the combat.
The Final Fantasy games already had WAY better systems while trying to mix RealTimeRPG and Hack-N-Slash and I don't understand why or how they ended up with this mess of a system.
I see a lot of ""it's hard"" and ""get gud"" comments but the one thing that i read, and didn't believe, was that it actually gets easier when you increase the difficulty... and it does! ~Totally lost~ but I think I have narrowed down what's wrong with the combat... At least in my opinion.
Basically the combat takes the WORST elements of RPG and Hack-N-Slash battles and combines them together.
Do you like the lengthy RPG battles? Yes! RPG battles are long and drawn out because you use that time to develop strategies and manage resources.
Do you like repetitive Hack-N-Slash battles? Yes! The reason why repetitive battles work is because grunt enemies are weak but come at you in waves and mowing through them makes you feel like a bad ass!
Would you like them mixed together? NO! You just end up in a situation where your fighting hundreds of long drawn out battles while constantly mashing the attack button over and over again just to take down the weakest of grunts.
Without the sweet satisfaction of near insta-kills with a swipe of your oversize sword or the satisfaction taking your enemy out with a well though out strategy you end up with the video game equivalent of watching paint dry.
Thank goodness for MODS!!!!!!
Just a few MODS and combat is fixed and I can enjoy the rest of the game!
The only other thing I can gripe about is the ""shadows.""
I'll try not to spoil anything but when I first saw the ""shadows"" in what I thought was a hallucination I was like ""awesome, I like what they are doing with this,"" buuuuuuuuuut then they turn out to be REAL and I was like ""okay, this is stupid.""

I feel like I gave it ever opportunity to redeem itself, but every time I tried, it just disappointed further.  And no, I'm not part of the ""oh its not like the original"" negative review crowd, I never played much of the original.  Save your money, or go buy FF12 instead.

Pros: 
- Nice graphics
- Nice battle system
- decent amount of customization

Cons: 
- only like 3 types of monsters
- horribly awful story line progression speed (the only reason I have so many hours in this game is because 90% of the story is throttled to the speed of a sloth, even the parts that are supposed to be incredibly dramatic and urgent, they just MAKE you walk, not even normal walk, like a slow motion walk)
- the characters are there, but you never really actually get to use them . . . 
- bit of a cash grab, definitely not enough content to justify the price.  
- incredibly imbalanced battle systems (how you hit them v how they hit you)
- the open world bit of the game is surprisingly linear

SPOILERS: 
okay, so about the cons.  3 types of monsters is a bit of an exaggeration, but thats how it feels.  on par with other FF games, its a staggering lack of diversity.  there's also a big lack of an ability to grind for levels and skill points because there's very few places where a decent amount of monsters actually spawn when youre able to roam.  

by far my biggest gripe is the way that they force you to go insanely painfully slow in almost every scenario.  and its not necessary, in fact in most cases it makes no sense.  when youre chasing some blob shit through the sewer because he took your key, you walk . . when the plate is falling all around you, you fucking walk, when there's plenty of space for you to just walk through a gap, they make you fucking shimmy.  the church is burning down? that fine you can walk.  its infuriating  makes absolutely no sense.  while escaping the subway, they make you shimmy like 8 times in a row purely so the characters can talk about absolutely nothing important.  the content of this game does not equal the time to completion, its about half that.  

cloud is the only consistent character.  thats not necessarily a problem, but they pretend like youre going to get to play with the other characters, giving you weapons for them and letting you develop their skills.  I know this is only part 1 and you'll probably get to play with them later, still annoying though

whole game def felt like a ""gotchya"" for those who wanted a decent remake, but it also felt like a game that was playing off the FF reputation without living up to the standards.  and like i said, if they say completion time is 33 hours, thats only because youre spending 17 hours slow motion walking and shimmying through 2 person wide gaps.  

so while the battle system feels good initially, the actual battles themselves are imbalanced.  you can dodge and run around and focus on different parts of the monster, you can open the battle menu for actions or hotkey them, its a good system.  on the other hand, a monster can just casually walk away from most of your magic attacks, making them essentially useless, same with limit breaks and guardian attacks.  you have no resistances against things like sleep, so if you get hit with a bubble, you immediately go down for what feels like 5 minutes.  there's no way to remove the AFK auto attack feature, so if you dont input a command every 2 seconds, your character will just start rushing the enemy, there's really no way to make your other characters useful without micromanaging the shit out of them via the battle menu because all they ever do is basic attacks.  your special attacks can also be immediately interrupted by any breath of air that an enemy throws your way, but there's nothing you can do to stop any of their attacks from coming.  

they kinda tease you with an ""open world"" mode, where when you complete essentially the entire story line, you can kinda run around freely for a bit, but you can literally only do like 3 sidequests and they're very boring and dry.

1. No ultra-wide support (UWHQ). 3rd party tools can workaround this, so why can't such a pricey title and big publisher and game studio not implement this in the base game? Even indie titles or other console ports support this.

2. Barely graphic options for the PC platform. Resolution, texture resolution, amount of shadows, maximum FPS set to 120 are pretty much all the options you have. Not even a way to disable motion blur in-game.

3. The game is limited to 120 FPS. My monitor can handle more, so I expect it from such a pricey title as well.

4. Slightly odd: No DLSS/FSR nor Raytracing, which is odd in these days.

I'm sure I'm not making friends with this negative review, but from an objective, technical perspective and given the price, this port is ridiculous. When you check Marvel's Spider-Man console ports, you know how excellent console ports can be.

Once again Square Enix never fails to make an amazing RPG but completely ruin the PC port. Graphics options are very limited, only letting you adjust textures and shadows. The FOV is locked really low to somewhere around 35 and TAA is FORCED with no way to toggle it except a mod which reveals the horrible checkerboard rendering they used to run the game on the PS4 but didn't fix for PC. So no matter what you're stuck with a slightly blurry image.

PC issues aside, this is a really amazing game, one of Square's best RPG's in decades, a complete remake from scratch from the PS1 original, not a remaster, this is a completely new game. The gameplay and cutscenes are very well done, fixing many of the issues from FF15, this one has much better voice acting and story flow as well as not bombarding you with side quests this time, there's only a handful at different points of the main quest you can easily do in an hour, it's the main story that fills most of those 40+ hours which is a breath of fresh air from other games that use side quests as filler.

I was very surprised to see how much this stayed true to the original game, nothing was cut out or censored, all the same themes and settings from the original game remain including the Honey Bee Inn and cross dressing scenes. One of my favorite small details is seeing your Materia slotted into your weapons, it looks exactly how I imagined it would after all these years but couldn't see in the original PS1 graphics.

This is almost a perfect game except for one truly annoying flaw besides the PC issues. I wish they just stuck to the same story from the original but Square couldn't leave well enough alone with the introduction of the ""Plot Ghosts"". They show up at random times during the story and come from an alternate timeline to ensure this games timeline stays on the same track as the original, it's really annoying and 4th wall breaking and I'm afraid it's leading up to major changes in the sequels with the wrong characters dying.

But it's still a great game, I highly recommend it. You can tell they put a ton of extra work into this full remake which wouldn't be possible in a regular remaster.",1678654159,1678894788,True,171,5,0.87929457426071167,5,True,False,False

Enough like the original to be nostalgic, but still an entirely new game with new plot twists and mechanics that all work very well. It was an amazing experience playing it, just like the original.

I thought a £70 release price was a joke so I waited for it to go on sale before I bought it. A few days into playing this I pre-ordered the prequel at full price. I will definitely be buying the next remake release on pre-order at full price as well in the hope that it will help the devs bring out more of these games.

I only have two comments really, one is that I would have liked to be able to play all of the characters from the original, one of the characters was an unplayable ally. This was a bit of a let down but it didn't bother me too much, the game is still awesome.

While the gameplay is some of the best I've seen in a JRPG, this is one of the worst story executions I've seen in a while. I've never played the original so I can't do a direct comparison, but I'm really surprised by how much staying power this game's had considering how poor the story is.

It's around 40 hours in length. There's a small narrative thread that leads you through, but they just keep piling on new characters and locations and don't spend any time developing them. There's also no resolution, it just kind of ends with no explanation. It's like a big setup that never gets anywhere.

Do yourself a favor, just play Tales of Symphonia instead. No idea why everyone's been raving about this game for the last 20 years.
__________________________________________

+ Great graphics
+ Fun combat
+ Game runs stable and smooth (Steamdeck users will need to mod the game to turn off the dynamic resolution scaling that results in a constant screen blur)

- Bad story execution with no payoff
- Weird dialogue points where characters will respond to things that haven't apparently been said to them
- The main antagonist might not actually exist, or at least he takes a loose approach to the concept of ""object permanence""
- The primary antagonist has no established motive
- Most of the characters are pretty one-sided and unlikable
- The main protagonist has no personality and they only allude to him having a backstory (while supplying no clear description)
- Boss battles are interspersed with cinematic cutscenes that abruptly halt your ultimate attacks and reset the boss' stagger bar (this was super annoying). Limit-breaks are useless on the final boss because they keep getting cut off

TLDR: Buy it on discount only if you're a fan of the original and are open to a re-imagined experience. Despite the title, this is not a Remake in the traditional sense. [b]Do not buy this game if you haven't played the original unless you 'do your homework'[/b]


FF7 Remake is a game that leans on nostalgia as much as it tries to take things in a new direction. The determining factor with whether or not you'd like this game is your general expectations. If you're anticipating a prettier version of the original game with all the same story beats and familiar characters, you will be at least somewhat satisfied. However, the game takes some liberties with the source material and you're only getting a 1/4 of the original experience content wise. The trade off is production values and a new battle system for just the Midgar portion of disk 1 of 3 instead of everything. It's simply not possible to have this level of detail for the entirety of the original experience without breaking it off into multiple games.

Some of the criticisms against the game are valid and might have made the entirety of disk 1 possible instead of just Midgar. There are moments where the game is stretched out; there are side quests that didn't need to be in the game, there are new characters and events that make the game feel more like Kingdom Hearts or the worst parts of Metal Gear Solid (specifically surreal goofy characters and cutscenes that can take an extremely long time). Without getting into spoiler territory, the final act suggests that this game is more of a re-imagining than a simple remake and that might not be a bad thing.

But when this game hits the right notes, it resembles what makes the series so great. The voice acting is easily some of the best in the series, the visual effects and graphics are incredible for a game designed to run on PS4, the environmental design brings so much depth to the original flat 3d rendered backgrounds, and the soundtrack is stellar for the most part. The battle system resembles a hybrid between Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts, which I think works perfectly fine short of some awkward instances with aerial combat.

All-in-all, if you're a fan of the original game and want to try something familiar with a twist, you might have already purchased and enjoyed this game. I still wouldn't recommend this for its full price but good for a 40% or more discount.

If you weren't a fan of the original or never played it, I'd caution you against buying it as the story hard leans on having at least some familiarity with the events of the original. Kind of an odd thing to say for a remake, but it's true.

I'll talk about the Intergrade portion in the Cons section (not to be harsh but, its relevent)

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Combat feels fast but managable
[*]Characters are true to the source material with more depth provided for side characters / Turks
[*]Summons are beautifully animated and designed, as expected (and you can fight them).
[*]20-30 hour experience with some additional post-game content (Hard mode)
[*]Some locations are absolutely incredible. Wall Market alone is an experience that surpasses the original in almost every way.
[*]If the original held a special place in your heart, some cutscenes, locations and events will resonate with you in a profound way
[/list]

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[list]
[*]The price... my god the price. Intergrade's inclusion does not justify the price point.
[*]Despite being a remake, you need to be familiar with some of the events in the first game in order to fully appreciate the direction of the story. Some events will be confusing to newcomers, and frankly, can be confusing for people who have played the original.
[*]You only get a fraction of the original experience and some sections are needlessly stretched out.
[*]Some of the minigames are uninspired
[*]You can't control one of the main characters from the first game but they appear in combat as a guest
[*]Whispers are obnoxious
[*]The last chapter, while necessary to make the game feel complete, feels like it took some of the best elements of the original and presented them out of order as a 'teaser' to the next entry. Without spelling anything out, I'm fairly certain the next entry will be the 2nd out of 3 games.
[*]Intergrade... Let's make this its own section. 
[/list]

[h1]Intergrade:[/h1]
Somehow this DLC wasn't possible on PS4 and after playing it, I know this to be a complete lie. 

There was nothing in this DLC that couldn't have been ported over to PS4. I already owned this game on PS4 and in a perfect world, I would have played the DLC there. For some reason, Square Enix has stated that the new content is not possible to play on PS4. Which content? Fort Condor? The new location? The two box destroying minigames? None of the above wouldn't have been possible on PS4. This was clearly an attempt to push console sales for the PS5 updated version or to get those who don't have a PS5 to purchase this version. If it was possible to purchase the DLC only, this wouldn't be such a bad thing. In this case you have to purchase both and even discounted, this feels anti-consumer.

Sour grapes aside, Intergrade is [b]not[/b] worth a discounted purchase. The voice acting aside from the main characters is significantly lower quality. Even characters who appear in the main game seemed to have phoned-in their Intergrade appearance. The story is not as strong overall and while there is some fun interplay between one of the Turks, the plot falls off into Kingdom Hearts territory near the end. There were opportunities to build on the tensions between Shinra and Wutai and the supposed 'war' between them but it was squandered. For better or worse, it's all about Yuffie and that's about as deep as you're going to get. 

Yuffie as a character is fun to control in combat and that's about the nicest thing I can say about the whole DLC. Fort Condor had potential but it ultimately boils down to 'rock paper scissors' and higher number. You can play about 7 games and once you have assembled a decent loadout, you run out of opponents. My only hope is that they include this for FF7 Rebirth similar to FF8's card game as it would be nice to play this with more advanced rules and loadouts. Other than that, in terms of additional Intergrade activities: you can find posters based on clues. You refer to a Key Item buried in the menu for these clues or talk to the NPC a bunch of times. If that sounds like fun to you, you might be an accountant.

Other than that, it's go through cutscenes and get to the end. It's not awful but it doesn't make me feel as if I missed out on anything important by playing through Intergrade. If anything, it cemented that Yuffie had no impact on the events of the main game and it can be safely ignored. 

Do I hope that she has more of a role in Rebirth? Definitely. It makes me wonder how they are going to explain the events of what happened at the end of Intergrade to those who haven't played it. Knowing Square Enix, they might just paywall it behind more DLC.",1678631086,1678631109,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I must admit, like you, I too own several versions of the original, but there's something about this reimagining that really speaks to me. The graphics are just stunning, I mean, you could practically take a screenshot of any part of the game and it would be fit for framing!

And don't even get me started on the characters! The voice acting is top-notch and the visual representation of each character is just spot on! I mean, they look so good, I almost feel guilty for constantly putting them in harm's way.

And let's not forget about the menu and upgrade systems! It's like the game designers went, ""Hey, let's take everything that was great about the original and make it even better!"" And they did just that! It's amazing how easy and intuitive it is to navigate through everything.

Oh, and those side quests! I mean, who needs a main quest when the side quests are this good?! They're so well-designed and entertaining that I almost forget why I'm even playing the game in the first place!

Basic combat is alright, I don't really care that it's not turn-based anymore. Playing through hard mode was an absolute chore though and I hated it. It really highlighted the flaws in the combat and the absolute atrocious AI of your party members.

The game looks great, but I some of the sky boxes look completely flat, which can completely ruin some areas.

My highlights are definitely the characters. I actually cared about them and wanted to get to know them more. The actual story isn't that special, and I think it kinda gets worse near the end, because the game obviously doesn't include all of the original story and they needed a new ending.

I really liked the hubs / settlements that you visit, they actually feel like they could be real. There are NPCs everywhere, you hear a bunch of chatter, it's great.

What's not great is the performance, it sucks, especially if you're in those hubs. It's really fun when it just tanks for no reason and you get to single digit FPS. I've tried all the different fixes all around the internet, used different mods, but nothing worked. Of course, Square also never patched the game after the release on Steam.

Overall, the positives outweigh the negatives for me and even at ~60€ I thought it was worth it (""sale"" price on release). It is however still extremely expensive, especially since it's already over two years old and even on PC it was released one year ago. I guess fans of the series or FF7 specifically already bought the game, so if you're on the fence about the game, wait for a better price, although that can take a long with Final Fantasy games.

Update: I've played the DLC and the first chapter is good, the second a waste of time. Combat with Yuffie is good. It's pretty short and included on PC anyway, so it probably won't matter to most, but in my opinion skip the DLC and just watch the final cinematic.",1669175022,1678428890,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'd heard about stuttering issues on PC, but so far, 1 hour in, and i'm not experiencing anything bad (RTX 2070). Pretty rock solid 60fps for me. We'll see how the other environments go I guess.

As for the game, It's very good. Combat is satisfying. I was very reluctant going in because I figured I'd miss the old turn based combat too much, but this system grew on me very quickly. 

The only negative thing I can say about the Intergrade upgrade so far, is that the photo mode they added has very limited camera positioning. I'm a sucker for photo modes, and I struggle trying to get a good composition with this one. You can get some incredible freeze-frames during battle, but not being able to get the camera where I want is very frustrating. 

My fondness for the original FFVII is pretty strong, as it is for most people, and there are parts in this remake that actually had me tearing up thanks to the music, nostalgia, and knowing how the story goes.",1655534234,1678001417,True,1,0,0.519394814968109131,0,True,False,False

fx-8350 cpu
gtx 1660ti graphics card
32gb ram

I really wanted to enjoy it, but the game just does not run well at all. Directx 12 stutters and freezes almost constantly. Forcing the game to run in Directx 11 fixes a lot of the stuttering but makes the graphics look blurry or smeared. Forcing resolution to the highest my graphics card would allow clears the smearing and blur but causes severe screen tearing. Forcing Vsync through graphics card settings helps with screen tearing pretty well though. Every time your screen pans over fire, lights, trains, or running water, the audio becomes immediately choppy, crackling, and stuttering. Only way i was able to play the game comfortably was by turning game sounds down to 1, voice volume to 2, and music volume to 2. The I had to turn my headset volume and computer volume to max to be able to hear anything at all. 

All of this is a huge bummer and I would suggest waiting until optimization problems have been fixed and the game goes on sale. Until then, don't rush to buy it if you're on the fence because I honestly can't enjoy the game when i have to manually remove half the sound effects and the great soundtrack.

I really do hope i can come back to enjoy this one later.",1661278560,1677727346,False,4,1,0.536423861980438232,0,True,False,False

Very pretty to look at
Largely faithful adaptation
Mostly decent Dubs but...

Cons:
Awful background character voicing, I get you can't cast A-listers for 2 line train-conductors but they're ear-bleedingly bad, the sort you'd pay to NOT volunteer at public library book readings.
A dodge/block, jumping-slashing adaptation of a beloved TURN BASED GAME, and the ""classic"" mode is either a cinematic faceroll or so bad you might as well fight normally.
Awful minigames, each worse than the other.
Anemic generically ""epic"" revamp of original banging soundtrack.
Boss battles are awful hard-counter based, so bring your enemy scan materia, find the enemy weakness, quit and reload game, change materia accordingly, repeat every fight, or have a walkthrough handy.  
Every ""twist"" and ""suprise"" is not foreshadowed, they are just plainly shows as cut-scenes.
Typically half-assed PC control port with lousy control scheme, poor support for multi-monitor, no mouse control in menus.
Slow and repetitive menu animation, esp. bad for weapon upgrade menu.
Hammy characters, original was hammy as heck too, but you can get away with it when you're using polygon chibies with speech bubbles and €%&&%@ing censorship.

Overall it's a decent game for people that want to play the story of FF7 and prefer twitch-combat/Let's plays, but for fans of the original it felt like one long ""you are old and the gameplay you liked is now just for retroclones"".

EDIT: Having nothing better to do I also finished the InterMISSION.
 in retrospect I should have done the dishes instead, more gameplay and entertainment value and less pointless cameos.

Even though my computer is able to run well most modern games like Elden Ring, this game has a lot of stuttering even at the lowest graphics. There isn't that many graphics options and I would love to be able to lower for example the shadow quality. I would totally recommend it, and whether that discourages you or not this game is not to my suprize even that anime like.

Yes, it does have a different story-line than the original FFVII, but this is an intergraded version, so things are expected to be different. 
Yes, I do this this is playable over and over again. There is so much to do to unlock all of the achievements.
Yes, I think Sephiroth is OP, but when I was streaming, my viewer said ""Look, even the music is saying 'daddy daddy daddy rough'"" so its definitely worth listening to for a good laugh.
Yes, Sephiroth is beatable, you just have to focus and parry to stagger whenever possible.

If I can do it, so can you (and I am not one to use the Dodge mechanic in a game, or to parry xD)

This game is almost as linear as FF13. There are many hidden walls and the player is often punished from attempting to deviate from the path intended by the story.

FF7 was such an immensely epic game, taking the player down such an exciting journey that spans an entire world. FF7R is very small and linear in comparison, wherein the player never leaves a single city.

In FF7 you could find hidden items in the world. They could be anywhere and you were always searching. In FF7R you'll either find a little cement trash can, a stack of obvious boxes, or a glowing materia on the ground. Nothing else.

Square came up with like three mechanics when walking around the world. One of them is squeezing through a hallway. When this happens you need to sort of guess what direction to point your joystick in to continue. Sometimes the character stops until you choose another random direction.

Combat is boring and repetitive. In FF7, if you died in combat, it felt like you weren't clever enough. In FF7R, if you die in combat, it feels like you weren't button mashing fast enough.

You never get an opportunity to choose a party. The game depends so heavily on dialog and scripted character exchanges that Square didn't want to allow arbitrary combinations. Fighting a hard boss and wish you had a healer? Too bad.

Switching characters in a battle sounds cool at first. The main issue is that off characters usually stand there without being too helpful. When you switch to a different character the enemy, especially a boss, immediately switches aggro to the active character, which really breaks immersion. Ultimately Tifa is the only fun character to play when you rush in, attack, boost strength, hit hard, and fall back.

The missions are so dull. Hey buddy, can you find the children missing around town? They also repeat. Hey buddy, can you find the missing children again? This time it's a new chapter!

If FF7 it was exciting when you found a new materia. And there were so many! In FF7R they're a lot more boring and repetitive. Do I really need another Deadly Dodge materia? It also doesn't feel nearly as rewarding to level materia up.

That can be remedied by killing the process on the Steam Deck and reloading. Aside from that...

Beautiful game. The team really managed to take what was essentially Disc 1 of FF7 and add a ton of depth to.. well, everything. Especially the side characters which didn't have much impact from the 1st time around.  You really can tell that there's an immense amount of care & time put into this. The side stories are great, and the DLC does wonders for even more details/back stories. I'm not much of a 100%'r but I enjoyed every moment of the remake. Looking forward to the next installation in the series.

A refreshing take on the classic. I'd love to write more but I'm too frustrated by the fact that the game crashes. A lot.

It varies on anything from during saving, to during movies. I'd complain about the stuttering if it happened enough before it crashes.

Developers added meaningless stuff at every location in the game, increased the storyline with pointless quests and corridors/levels on repeat over and over again in an attempt to add play time and make it feel worth the price.
It's still FFV7, the story has great moments, great graphics and not all they added was bad. There a few added moments that give extra good background stories, fun activities that add depth to some characters. The story changes are weird and I'm not sure I will like how it ends but I'm hopeful. 
If I could give a mixed rating I would. I still enjoyed it but the continued sections of running around made me want this game just to be over with and move on.
I just hope, they abandon the a lot of the pointless grind that you are forced to do and the constant ""go here flip this switch, go over there and flip that one"" over and over again.

I'd do just about anything to experience more of her story. And I STILL couldn't manage to finish this garbage heap of a game. That should tell you something (especially because I'm pretentious enough to care about things like how well characters in a video game are written). The rest of the characters, in case you were wondering, are one-dimensional and not worth mentioning.

Simply put, this game is tedious, masochistic trash. Basically, you start with the original FFVII, then take away all the worthwhile game mechanics that  ever made Final Fantasy games fun; then replace them with a big steaming pile of Souls-like mechanics (because who *doesn't* enjoy circling a boss for 20+ minutes, countering the same three attack patterns). Then top it off with beautifully rendered scenery of a landfill (no, really -- that's most of the game's visual aesthetic). And that's INTERgrade. 

Unless you truly hate yourself, have suffered massive brain damage or have $60 that you desperately need to get rid of, stay away. Stay far, far away. After playing this insult of a game, I'm going to go cleanse my palette by replaying Chrono Cross for the fifth time to try to put this horrific experience behind me and salvage some part of my childhood that Square-Enix hasn't turned into a 4K cash cow.

Seriously, Square. You literally have one job. Do better.



UPDATE: 

After reading through guides written by obsessive-compulsives that figured out the optimal equipment layouts and replaying through 1.5 hours of the game, I spent 20 minutes on a boss fight that I quit on after 20 minutes the last time I tried it. If I could drop my rating from a thumbs down to a middle finger, I would. Playing this game is masochism. 

Please, if you care about yourself as a human being, go play the port of the original FFVII instead of this abomination.

Seriously, the original FFVII was fun. This game is pain. It's an insult. In a just world, it wouldn't exist.

Aside from the rewrite of Aerith, I don't have a single positive thing I can say about this game, even after giving it a second chance. Please spend your time doing something, anything, other than playing this monstrosity.",1674854582,1676595205,False,5,1,0.447605490684509277,0,True,False,False

You need to be time that circle thing to be small as it passes by the bullseye, because good luck getting it precisely on there with 8 directions and full throttle no matter what. A problem easily fixed by using a controller, which I stubbornly refuse to do. (It's not that I don't own one. I do.)

Let me start out by saying this is the third time I have purchased the Remake on the third platform now. I'm one of the many original fans from back in the 90s and the original is my absolute favorite game of all time. Going into this remake at first was both exciting and worrying, mainly do to the changes to the story.

So on my first play through on PS4 I got to chapter 16 and dropped it, the changes to the story were too much for me at the time and felt like I couldn't accept this new take. The second time was on Epic Games Store and I started to like it better and started realizing the full scope of this vision the writers have for the world. Fast forward to today when I played through the whole main story with a much more opened mind and wow ... I'm in love. This feels more like an expansion to what has been and will always be final Fantasy VII. 

The characters are more fleshed out, the player is able to interact with the world more also see more of it and everything just feels so real and good. Its a living breathing world, at least if you ask me :D I'm so happy I didn't fully give up on the Remake and hope other fans that have, come back to it because its really a love letter to the fans of the old with many new experiences. Yes those new experiences do change the story of the original and yes, the developers should have been clear about this from the very start but!! whats here is very good. 

Overall, I can't recommend this game enough to both original fans and newcomers.

 Enjoy the journey!

My father got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 92 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my father, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my father for help and he hosted a game for me to join.

The battle system works well.Fluid while still being turned based, i say fluid because nothing completely stops like the original. The Materia System has depth, but there is no Knights of the round X Mimic here. Combining Materia feels similar but does not work or feel the same as before , but then again i'm just one POS guy. Opinions Opinions. I will say there are some fun ways to use Materia and I enjoyed learning skills from each weapon as opposed to having to level up to Omnislash and only being able to use them as a limit break. Here you can use them regularly but the trade off is that you only have one limit break move/cut scene for most of the game. The story has some heavy alterations that felt a little off, but i could see the emotional attachment they try to build, more so if you've played the original.  I could write a list of differences, and believe me there are. (Cloud in the shower with guys through a peep whole has transformed to cloud in an episode of Pose) But i feel you have to play the game to appreciate the differences. Had this game released today it would not make a Comet sized impact (see what i did there). Regardless this is a finely crafted experience that no RPG nut should pass on.

The narrative is still very good and the combat is super fun. Honestly the only reason this isn't a 10/10 is because the game pads so much time. There are 18 chapters, and pretty much up until chapter 15 you don't get much combat. Before then, you're just walking around waiting for dialogue. 
But back to the good, the game is an incredible immersive story experience. I counted only 5 pre-rendered cutscenes, that were really only noticeable because the weapons would change back to the defaults. But every other cutscene was just such a smooth transition from the real game world, because the game world really is just that beautiful. The game doesn't need pre-rendered cutscenes to look good. 
I wish there was more, the fact that it only goes up to the escape from Midgar and the story isn't the same as the original is really odd to me. I don't think it's worth $60, but I'll be buying Part 2 anyway.",1676385852,1676385852,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you are looking for a remaster of the original with beautiful graphics this is not it, if you are looking for that just play the original on steam and put some mods on, won't be nearly as beautiful but at the very least it won't trigger the purist in you.

The battle mechanics in this game at first glance seems to be fairly simple and for the most part it is, however once you start to understand each characters play style and learn the more intricate details of the battle controls the fights become fun as you zip around fights and destroy them.

Amazing graphics and sound!
Great voice acting!

Cons:
Plays like a console game on the PC.
Battle system is needlessly very complicated.

I played up to just past the first major boss. This is a very well made game that is just as much a work of art as it is a game! However, the complicated battle system caused me to stop playing for a bit out of frustration, and now I don't remember how the battle system works. I suppose I could start over and go through the instructions once more, but I'll probably get frustrated again. I can't really give a yes or no as to whether or not I recommend this game.

This may just be a * Spoiler Alert *, but the game ends right at the end of the Midgar quests. Just straight to the credits. Square did that to it's fans... With a straight face... After charging $75 bucks for ""Part 1"" I'm guessing. It's not even labeled as being mislabeled as a remake in the store. 

If Square had pulled this schtick on it's fans back in 1990, Final Fantasy would really have been the Final Fantasy. Square would have imploded right then and there.

I am so done with both. An entire lifetime of fandom down the drain. Just like that.

Having played the original on the PlayStation years ago, I remember enjoying the game, but Remake fleshes out a lot of the details - especially the supporting characters.

Because I don't have the time for multiple playthroughs, I followed IGN's walkthrough and did everything possible in a first playthrough. It required about 45 hours for me, but I'm betting a disciplined player could do it in about 30 without feeling like a speed run. I took my time. Enjoyed the sights and sounds. Ended up making several attempts at the mini games to earn the rewards, etc.

The combat changes were great. The camera and targeting system too a little getting used to. I played most frequently with keyboard and mouse. But several of the mini-games almost required a controller, for which my Xbox One controller for PC worked just fine.

Honestly, I'd forgotten what it was like to beat, or complete, a game. WIth so many ""Live Service"" games today, it was rather satisfying.

Since beating Remake and Intergrade I've loaded up Final Fantasy VII for PC and have been playing with the 7th Heaven mods. Once I complete that I'll make a review of that as well.

Pros:
- You get to see the city of Midgard and the characters modeled in beautiful detail
- Some of the scenes are really touching recreations for any fan that will blow you away

- Pointless fetch quests and filler that many times feels completely out of place (your friend just got kidnapped, this seems like a good time to help grandma across the street)
- Some character changes completely take away from what the character originally was. Especially Aerith. The whole ""pretends to be a sweet, defenseless girl, but is actually really strong and cunning and outsmarts everyone else on the team"" dynamic got completely turned on its head. She's basically a completely different person who only has Aerith's appearance and superficial characteristics.
- The story is chaotic and incoherent in many places. The writing is basically like Kingdom Hearts. Now, I'm also a fan of Kingdom Hearts and don't mind its writing, but that style of writing has no place in a FF7 remake.

In conclusion, it's a bad game, but will have a few good moments if you're willing to endure hours of filler.",1676047079,1676047079,False,2,2,0.435354679822921753,0,True,False,False

You will learn what this game truly is once you play it, but for the time being, consider it a standalone game featuring familiar scenarios.

I'm a newcomer to the Final Fantasy franchise. After hearing Dancing Mad and One-Winged Angel (which were both composed beautifully by Nobuo Uematsu), I knew I had to at least play one of them. I started with FFVII Remake, as I had already heard the premise and was intrigued by it. That being said, I don't think anyone else should start their FF journey with this game, as it depends on you knowing many parts from the original game.

Despite this, I enjoyed the experience. While challenging at points, most of the challenge was actually my fault (I didn't even know you could use upgraded spells until near the end!). The story, while slightly confusing, was enjoyable. I especially took a liking to Barret! The father-figure aspect of his character was cool to see.

Combat feels good! Turn-based combat kept me away from many RPGs for years, so seeing a more action-oriented system was great! While not perfect, I feel that the system in this game accomplishes what it sets out to do.

Overall, I'd recommend this game to people who know the original story of FFVII, but aren't obsessed with it, and can look past the differences between that game and this one.

FF7R is gorgeous, it's epic, it's emotional and has you hooked just like the original.

Looks AMAZING
Good gameplay
Narrative-driven
Fairly long (40ish hours+3-5 hours for the DLC)
Mods on Nexus to fix stuff like the summoning mechanic

Cons:

Pricetag (The DLC is too short to justify the price)
Part 1 out of 3 :(
System specs (this game doesn't do well on older hardware if you want max settings)
Way too easy until hard mode (which is NG+)

Divisive:

Bye bye open world, hello corridors and mediocre, annoying platforming!

Combat system, nothing like the original. It's either like Parasite Eve or it's like one of the newer Final Fantasy games. Your choice, can be changed in-menu.

Huge changes to the plot. No spoilers but this is a retelling of the original story. It is NOT the same!

I thoroughly enjoyed it. I recommend it

The combat system was a little bit hard to get used to at the beginning. As I didnt really have a lot of useful skills or magic at first, and normal slashes were easier to use, so I really hated the Command button at first. But later on, the command button became super useful. It slowed time down and gave me more time to decide whether to counter enemies, to slash multiple enemies, to deliver the killing blow, or to use magic or heal. I really needed it in the boss fights as it became harder and harder to just use normal slashes.

The story was intense. It was slow at the start, as I didnt really buy into the whole blowing things up to save the planet bullshit. The Eco-terrorists sounded like a Pokemon thing. But the story got better later. The antagonists became scarier and creepier and put a lot of stress on me. 

The characters were great, and i dont just mean the waifus. Almost all characters had their moments and backgrounds, and it made them more realistic (despite their almost impossibly perfect facial features). Flirty but compasssionate Aerith, shy but competant and loyal Tifa, intense but dorky and fatherly Barret, even the nice Jessie who wanted to become an actress,  they are so memorable (man I wished we saw more of Jessie) . And the villains, Hojo was so creepy and disgusting. Although Heidegger did turned out to be more stereotype, almost like a Pokemon villain. I thought he was the main villain in the earlier chapters. And heck, even the passer-bys in game are not backgrounds. They have voicelines regarding their current situations! 

And the boss fights, holy shit they were intense. Especially later on when you had to take on multiple bosses back-to-back. It was late when i had one of the fights, i finally won and i was gona save and go to sleep. Then another boss fight started. The despair! Some bosses were borderline unfair to fight. Some just kill you in one or two moves. And I admit, some boss fights I had to go online and search for tips. 

After you beat the final bosses, you get New Game Plus. I love this Chapter Select design. I almost never do NG+ because I didnt want to go through the slower introduction chapters again. But Chapter Selects let you skip it, i love it. (Although sometimes I wished that were some post game map, so that I could go back to the slums after beating the final boss) 

Bought it when it was on 43% discount. Worth every pennies. Looking forward to FFvii Rebirth. Devs'd better not kill you-know-who.

From a Ps1 one gamer, nothing made me happier than to come home from school, head over to my best friends house, and have three of us taking turns playing this game. I know it's not a multiplayer game but we were all in middle school, video games were a new luxury, and we just couldn't get enough of this game. 

Before we could get to disc 2, one of my friends passed away and we kind of forgot about the game. after some time I started saving up my allowance and doing chores to get a ps1 myself. My first video game system and game was FFVII on PS1. I ended up finishing the game by myself and it helped me get through some dark depressing times. 

So when I say that FFVII remake is a great evolution of this game, and how the core elements of the story that played an important part of my life growing up are still there, and still affect me like they did in the past, then you know I'm not exaggerating. 

The game evolved in all the right places while maintaining it's essence and greatness. The only thing I am sad about is that I have to wait for the other parts to release. I hope they keep the essence of the original alive in the future parts. IF they do, then every penny will be well spent to replay these masterpieces. 

Midgar was a very linear progression in the original. It has opened up much more in the remake. It's story feels authentic, it's areas, music, all reminiscent of the original. Characters feel like they should, Story doesn't stray much, but there are very different aspects that end up making sense in the end. And game play ended up being honestly one of the best iterations of active/turn based hybrid that it could be. My playtime may be low, but I can assure you I have hundreds of hours on the PlayStation console version.

Old school FF for me was all about story and this game heavily lacking it, it was gutted too hard to make a trilogy from it. You don't want to play it for story at all. Game don't have any relevant to story choices.

On the other hand, combat is interesting. It's very Hack&Slash oriented with a pinch of Active Time Battle, unfortunately combat starts to shine very late in game. 

The game have several modes of replayability. To make full of decent combat system.

Graphics are good, never had issues with stutters, but I have a pretty beefy pc (4k120).

Voice-over is strange, every character moans for no reason at all in both English and Japanese language. Probably someone will make 'nice' content out of it one day.

First off, there's astonishingly little actual game here. Be prepared to spend the overwhelming majority of your time doing mandatory slow-walking scripted segments as you chat with other party members, interspersed with non-interactive cutscenes and cinematics. Areas are mostly linear corridors with little-to-no exploration, and the town areas are more open but also pointless and unrewarding to explore.

Basically the whole game is just delivering a narrative on rails, and the player is not actually playing much at all.

And the combat system is really lackluster in my opinion. Some people enjoy the real-time action format in their JRPGs and some people don't, but the implementation in this game is just not good either way. The combat controls feel like a really watered-down and unresponsive ripoff of souls-like games, but where the dash is useless and the block is mostly useless outside of specific enemies you'll encounter a couple times. You just mash the attack button until your ATB meter is filled up, and then you cast a skill and go back to mashing attack.

Unlike the original where you wielded a party of three that all contributed to battle, here you have a party of three but it doesn't feel like it because only the character you're controlling ever does anything. The others are all completely useless, and barely even auto-attack. Once they slowly (very, very slowly because they're not doing anything) acquire enough ATB you can tell them to manually cast their skills, or you can switch to them to fill up their ATB faster, but it's not a fluid or fun system.

The other problem with the combat is that, if you're not someone who is familiar with this type of combat, you get no opportunity to learn it. The combat encounters are so few and far between that you never have a chance to get used to the new system. You do 1-3 combat encounters in an area and then you're in for an hour or two of slow-walking segments and cinematics before your next combat encounter. The game doesn't even give you the opportunity to practice and get passingly good with its clunky system.

If you're a huge fan of FFVII like I am, you'll probably buy the game anyway regardless of any reviews. But I still think you'd be better off trying to find like a YouTube compilation of all the cutscenes and just watching that, because this game is very painful to get through.",1675022923,1675022923,False,155,17,0.656591117382049561,11,True,False,False

The combat in this game is terrible, its either way to easy with normal enemies, or your fighting a boss and you minus will not even have control of your character because your getting stunned / grabbed / attacked from more directions than you can possibly focus on. Sure if your character gets stunned you can switch to another one (providing you have one) and than by the time the switch happens and I figure out what the character I switched to was doing and where they were, now there getting stun locked or demolished by unblockable attacks. 
Not to mention your party members are complete and udder idiots if your not controlling then, to the point they minus will not even be there cuz you have to waste your ATB to heal them because there deciding to stand in poison, or that it would be a good idea to stand in front of a mega attack.

As far as story, I can deal, most of the ret cons arnt to bad.

Well.. Let me first start by saying that the game is REALLY FUN to play; I wasn't sure in the beginning about the whole action side of it because I was looking more for the turn based classic FF experience. But it was REALLY fun to play.

BUT.

The story sucks. Dunno if it was like this in the original FF7, but the entire story here is based out of the original city. The game is more linear than Super Mario, its REALLY linear. Its not so much of a game, but a story. You actively feel like you have absolutely no input on the story, cause you don't. Not only that, but even the cinematics effectively write you out of the story. The actions of the protagonists throughout an ENTIRE game have absolutely no effect on the story, which is incredibly frustrating.

Apart from the first 2 reactor explosions that were caused by the party:
- Sector 7 gets destroyed despite the actions of the characters
- Any character whatsoever that you beat doesn't die. Even president Shinra gets killed by Sephiroth.
- The actual damage to Shinra's building, is caused by Sephiroth or off screen by Avalanche, not you.
- You seemingly rescue Aerith; however she would never have been captured if it wasn't for the protagonists.
- You sort of beat Sephiroth in the end, but you don't really, because in the story he escapes easily.

Finally, 95% of the time I was absolutely lost story wise. The game didn't explain 3/4 of the plot items it introduced, I'm still not sure what was those masked figures, where did Sephiroth or the protagonist come from and what was their relationship, what is happening on the planet, who is Zack and 100 other things. After posting this I'm off to see explanations on youtube.

Not sure if the game was made in particular for old FF7 funs; but it didn't really make much sense at all to the rest of us that haven't played the game.

Hence I can't recommend it, cause it actively made me feel like a stranger most of the time, breaking immersion. But the battle gameplay is actually really really fun.",1674931282,1674931282,False,2,2,0.502369701862335205,2,True,False,False

- You can use your skills, items when you have filled your ATB bar, you have to do basic attacks to fill your ATB bar, if there is an flying or running enemy and if you dont have ranged character in your party (because of plot) its almost impossible. (Also camera sucks)
- Sometimes when you hit enemies, they dont give a fuck and it feels like hitting a wall. But if they touch you, you immediately get staggered and if you were casting a spell, its interrupted and you just wasted your ATB.
- Dodge is completely useless, i literally cannot dodge anything, am i doing something wrong idk?

When the war of the beasts brings the end of the world
dancing goddess
descended from heaven
Spread the wings of light and darkness
Bring along the gift of blessing

Bottom of the abyss
Three Men in Search of the Goddess' Gift
But the war tore them apart
one becomes a hero
one of them became a vagabond
one person left
become a captive
even so
The minds of the three are still tangled together
Promised to solve the mystery together again
【Chapter Two】
The arrested man managed to escape
but was seriously injured
but he survived
It was saved by a woman from the enemy country
he goes incognito
Living in seclusion with women
days like that
as if happiness will last forever
but
The feeling of happiness is getting deeper
the promise of friends
make it more painful
【Chapter Three】
Intensified war
The world is heading for ruin
The arrested person gave up the happiness shared by his lover
determined to embark on a journey
With the desire to bring blessings to the world with gifts from the goddess
Also to complete the promise of friends
but
Even if there is no agreement between two people who are in love
they firmly believe that
will definitely reunite again
【Chapter Four】
You said
Karma
Dream
Glory
already lost

let go of arrows
My soul, imprisoned by revenge for a long time
The desire to be entangled by distress
if save me for redemption
Then only the king will sleep in peace

the end of the sky

i've played ports much worse than this, but i have to admit:
full price around 80 bucks and serious lack of PC specific options to tweak
some settings seems like bad craftsmanship to me.

it although seems that a lot of ppl have stuttering issues, and i had them too.
S O L U T I O N  F O R  M E:
    - go into nvidia control pannel
    - search for FF7 remake
    - set max framerate to 60
    - set vsync on
    - go ingame and choose window mode and 60 fps

another thing is 1080p gaming...
call me something like ""not a real gamer"" because i don't have an
RTX3080TI-JWST-NASA9K-ULTRA-EVENTHORIZON or what ever card.

but fact is,
it looks like TAA blurs the shit outa my frames and it doesent seems to happen
at 4K resultions.
So i personaly would apreciate some anti-aliasing options or textures wich
would suit my eyes.


The control Scheme with mouse and keyboard is kinda nice and a lot of fun if you
can get used to it. Especially the ability to look around by mouse motion is 
priceless compared to controller movement.

But why the absence of number keys?
Characters can learn a lot of Skills and Ability's, so why am i limited to 4 number keys?
Or why can't i layer my number keys with key combinations like Alt+NumKey?
That would be an major improvement in addition to this glorious mixture of 
action- and turn based combat.

Despite these things mentioned above,
this is a goddamn good and fun game deployed by square, even if it feels like it wasn't
fully developed to it's full potential on PC systems.

You will want to throw your controller at the TV every time you have to squeeze through a tight corridor, or all the sudden you lose control of your character for useless exposition, or you are forced to pull a lever, or you are forced to move three feet after a cutscene to launch into another cutscene. By the end of the game, you will want to skip cutscenes just to avoid having to hear Barret's voice, over-exaggerated anime grunts, and dubious storytelling. 

A lot of it is a serious insult to the intelligence of the player.

The good stuff:
The game plays well except some stutters when entering new areas, which is normal for a UE4 game. The artstyle, graphics and overall visual aspects of the game are amazing. Especially the particle effects. The character development feels okay for the first game of a trilogy. Also, the soundtrack is great. 

The bad:
The pacing is atrocious, the side quests are bad and boring with some exceptions. The particle effects, although pretty, are way over the top sometimes. For example, you hit a human enemy with your sword and for some reason you summon a crazy amount of particles that I can not justify, it is just pure eye candy and serve no purpose.
Your character has to go through all these ""actions"" like squeezing through a wall or crouching under a fallen building etc. This happens way too often and takes away from the overall okay experience. What is even more annoying however, is those little ""minigames"" or detours you have to take everytime you try to do ANYTHING in the game.

Want to open a door? Nope, locked, go search for the key. Oh you almost found the key? Nope, get ambussed. You finally got the key? Sewer rodent steals it and you have to chase it. Oh you have surrounded it with a party of 4 people? Nope, it somehow got away and you chase it again. Oh and in the end, it is not even a key so you are not done yet. This happens wayyyy too often and becomes very, very, very predictable and tiring.

The combat is interesting, but flawed. It attempts to convert into an action combat system, while meshing in RPG command selections in the middle. In early game, it will not feel all that bad. Your basic attacks is often enough to take care of most enemies.

However, it won't be long until you realize just how important ATB and enemy elemental weaknesses are. If you have a sliver of a health in combat, but have no ATB to spend... well, you're just stuck running around, hoping to generate enough to FINALLY heal yourself. On the other hand, if you do not have an elemental weakness of an enemy, ha, good luck. It'll take maybe 10 times as long to defeat it. Compounding this, is the limited amount of materia slots, which is basically your primary way of accessing spells. 

As such, the combat will feel very wonky midgame, where your basic attacks don't do much, but you also don't really have the materia slots or all elemental spells to deal with every situation. Frankly, it can be miserable. This is often not an issue in the endgame.

Now, for the bad part: Replayability, or the lack thereof. Since remake part is literally only the midgar section of the original FF7, backtracking is pretty much a non-option UNTIL you finish it, where you can then use chapter select... but of course, this pales in comparison to most RPGs, where you can just walk back to the area. Also, once you completed the game's story... well, it's hard to recommend revisiting it to continue playing. All you'll just be grinding for is exp, some miscellaneous stuff that isn't really a big deal, etc. It's not like there is a bunch of optional content aside from some.... battle simulcra, and even that is very limited.",1674378062,1674378062,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've heard the victory track and battle music so many times and always thought it was good stuff, but hearing the entire ost with a full orchestra was just amazing. I honestly think it may be one of my favorite scores for a game. The real time combat feels fluid, bouncing between characters is handled extremely well and all of them contribute to the party equally, I haven't felt a certain character is more powerful than the other, it's completely up to the player to make sure his party members are up to snuff. The visuals are good by itself but I'd suggest getting ReShade, I don't have a problem with the graphics but I did feel it needed a little more color and contrast. Certain areas of the game can feel pretty bland or washed out.

I'm nearly done with the game, but FF7R has definitely shot up as one of my all-time favorites among all FF titles. I must stress that while it's not the same as the original whether we're talking in terms of mechanics or even artistic direction, it would be very disingenuous to claim that FF7R does not do the OG justice. It doesn't matter if you view the remake as a stealth sequel or some other iteration. What matters is that as a fan of the Final Fantasy world, FF7R delivers additional context to Midgar and the planet it rests on to help fans paint a more complete picture of the series and its beloved characters. To appreciate one unlocks the Materia to further appreciate the other.

Visually speaking, this is a stunning FF title. There are a ton of opportunities to take beautiful screenshots (both landscapes and characters/effects). Relative to how PSX FF games were back then, FF7R does a great job of minimizing the use of FMVs and maintaining immersion by expertly blending overworld and skippable cutscenes. I genuinely found myself taking extra long at various points in the game just to look for a beautiful photo mode shot.

The soundtrack in this game is something else! Not only does it brilliantly set the mood throughout the game, but it also offers jams for a diverse group of listeners! It is a given that the base game has a lot of wonderful tracks, but that short stint playing INTERmission really showcased a broad range of aesthetically pleasing music throughout multiple genres! Kame kame kame kame dooraku!!!

I only played this game with Japanese voices, but as per usual Square Enix brought a great cast of veteran VAs. Weiss' iconic voice actor (Jouji Nakata—a legend from titles such as Code Geass, Fairy Tail, and the Fate series) will never get old. FF7R's lineup of VAs is truly top-notch and adds a depth of quality to the characters we have long imagined prior to the days of this remake. They managed to portray how lovingly goofy Barret, Yuffie, and Aerith can be! As an example, the player can really feel Barret's fear of heights as his voice sounds like it's leaving his soul! Aerith's VA in particular did a great job of translating her playfully smug personality during her initial banter with Cloud. Overall this was one of the most satisfying additional bits of context that I can really appreciate from FF7R. Great job!

In FF13, I personally disliked the stagger mechanic. I thought the concept was cool but executed in a less-than-exciting manner. I haven't encountered much of that mechanic since, but it is my opinion that FF7R delivered a much-improved version of the system. The fights don't drag out even on hard mode and it's nice to see that this remains true even when you play a more defensive playstyle in combination with the stagger mechanic. It's not a souls game, but it delivers a happy medium between action and the original.

Really happy I picked this up over the winter sale! The game is a gift to FF7 fans. Considering the amount of effort put into this game, from the beautiful world all the way to the faithful yet different re-exploration of the beloved series, it is worth the price. It's coming in 3 parts and the uninformed would wrongly assume that this has ""less content"", but they would be wrong. It takes a tremendous amount of effort and resources to translate the original story into a more modern medium. In the end, FF7 fans are getting a larger product in terms of content (this game takes at least 75+ hours to 100%) which I happily welcome. As I approach the tail end of my platinum run, I look forward in excitement for the rest of the trilogy! I sincerely hope SE can maintain this level of quality until the end.",1672550558,1674362041,True,30,2,0.684451818466186523,4,True,False,False

However, I can say that this is one of the most enjoyable Final Fantasy games that I have played, Story and character development are excellent, and as with most of the later FF games, the graphics are awesome.

This is not an open world game, but neither is it completely linear. There is no crafting, but there is weapon and skill development, through special equippable items called ""materia"". Inventory management, a common problem area in RPG's, is well done, 

I experienced no crashes or significant bugs.

My only serious complaint is that, towards the end of the main game, there is a mandatory vehicle chase and battle that is extremely difficult, even in easy mode. If I had not had access to someone who was able to get me past this point, I would not have been able to complete the game. It is particularly annoying in that the chase itself adds nothing to the story, and is completely unnecessary, This sort of action component has no place in the main line of an RPG, where the story is the main object of playing the game. Quite a few people have complained about this, and it's a shame that the developers have not seen fit to do anything about it.

It's a little frustrating that this is only the first part of the original FF 7 story, but I understand that the remake is a massive effort, and it makes sense to do it in stages, so that we can start enjoying it earlier, and the developers can get the money to continue the work.

While there are things to really like about this game.   The Japanese do not have a word for pacing.  Most of it is the most bland filler i can imagine.  I am fighting the story to get to the combat. What was a maybe 5 hour journey has been stretched to the point of watering the whole experience down.  The head thinks he's clever by mocking people who want a faithful remake, just shows contempt for the fans of the original.  Frankly, it's gross. It ruins the message of loss, identity, and sacrifice that the original centered around.  The whole point of a remake, or remaster.  Is to render the original moot.  This does the opposite.  Stop wasting the players time by making them squeeze between boxes. You are just padding the time of the game. Stop forcing me to sit through lame puzzles. I am looking at you robot arms.  

I really can't recommend it so far. maybe it will get better at the end. but i am 20-30 hours in and i feel like i have seen the best.  The music is awesome, great remixes. Eh. skip it until it's on sale
updates since finishing the game

What in the absolute hell.  This was a wild disappointment, and something that drags on for far too long.  Boring side quests, waste your time level design.  red  13 is a guest party member. A great tagline for this game, ""This kingdom hearts got in my final fantasy, this final fantasy got into my kingdom hearts"" Who asked for this?  Why an i fighting a shadow monster? it doesn't need to be here. It ruins the tone and pacing of the game.  

This game has fun combat, but it is  overshadowed by everything else.  It makes you walk as much as possible.  it takes control away as much as possible. It adds in scenes for no reason that no one needed. It really does just take those opening hours that are supposed to hook you for the rest of the game, and just pull and stretch it as thin as possible.  
If you loved the original. 
This was made and not made for you.  Buy if you like, but after the dlc stuff.  I am probably not going to play anymore, and i won't be buying the next one",1673567876,1674027151,False,2,3,0.485881984233856201,0,True,False,False

Some PSA. FFVII was never an open world game until disc 3 so I have no idea why people complain about this part 1 being linear instead of open. It has the same amount of freedom as the OG Midgar. Midgar sucked anyway in the OG and remake made the Midgar part a masterpiece. Kitase and his jolly team really made something FRESH. If this would be a 1:1 remake to the original it wouldn't be that good. 

They really SPICED up the story by adding fresh new elements that you will notice if you have played the original. Do you need to play the OG to play this? I say definetly not. This was made for the fans and also the new generation of FF players. This can be your first experience to the story or the second experience. It feels nostalgic for me who has completed the OG many many times but when I play the remake it feels totally new, fresh and still that good amount of nostalgia. You CAN still play the OG if you want, if you're gonna do that on PC you can pick up some good mod projects for that too to make it look more not blocky. 

There are some complaints from me tho. Problem with FFVII has been that Square-Enix really milked it with the Compilation of FFVII stuff back in the 2000s. There's the Advent Children movie, Crisis Core, few anime OVAs and Dirge of Cerberus. If you want a fresh new experience and want to go in blind I just suggest you skip Crisis Core and go straight for FFVII Remake. Do not look in the direction of Dirge of Cerberus, the movie or the animes as these will spoil the lore of the whole FFVII universe. Crisis Core is a mixed case since it pretty much is a huge spoiler to one of the biggest FFVII plot twists lul. 

Enough talking about the FFVII world. I'll just list the good stuff quick.

Pros:

- Music is 100/10, no doubt about it. It is the best soundtrack I have ever heard.

- Graphics are freaking stunning and with the HD project mod you will notice even better results

- Story, already pointed out many things. It's a completely new experience for everyone. OG or fresh.

- Voice acting! I love both English and Japanese. I prefer the Japanese one tho since it contains the same actors from the Advent Children movie that came out in 2005. That doesn't mean English it's bad, no way. Barret is a freaking chad in the EN version. This is totally pick your poison. If you're gonna pick Japanese just download the faithful subs mod from Nexus. They localized and translated some stuff totally stupid.

- Gameplay. You can play with the new controls that are actually top notch or use the in my opiniong very boring classic settings where you just sit and watch ATB bar fill up while your party auto attacks. Ofc, new controls win.

- Animations. Bruh did they really use great motion capture actors here, holy heck. 

My only cons will be about the PC port. Graphics options are VERY limited and if you want to beef it up you're gonna have to mod this. The HD project mod on Nexus is 54gb and if your PC can handle then pick it up. That will pump the game install almost to 150gb tho so be prepared for that. Some stuttering can be nocited when transfering from cutscenes to the game but this also can be fixed on Nexus. 

Pre-rendered cutscenes and in-game pre-rendered (which are only a few) are totally noticeable on PC version compared to the PS4/PS5. It's pretty immersion breaking when from suddenly crips and beautiful graphics the cutscene switches to a pre-rendered UE4 footage that has lower bitrate, FPS and you can notice the resolution change. I mean gameplay is 60-120 fps then suddenly drops to 30 fps. Crisis Core Reunion suffers from this too. This isn't the case on the console versions.

Can't think of anything else anymore. It's my favorite game and I'm currently completing the PC version to 100% also and loving every minute of it. This is in my top 5 games ever made.

I don't want to search for anymore missing kids. I don't want to search for stupid birds. I don't want to search for cats. I don't want to find 100 nirn root. I don't want to play slow walking simulator or shimmy through tiny gaps in walls that take 20 seconds. Holy god. 

The strength of the story of this game had me so stoked that I snagged a couple other FF games on sale. I am not even going to bother with them, or with finishing FF7 Remake. Why in god's name do developers put these boring quests in games. Like, who is really sitting down and writing these and being like, ""people are going to love squat simulator."" SQUAT SIMULATOR.

Great game for any Final Fantasy Fan. the Atb combat system took a little getting used to but overall i think it is a welcome change. the only real issues i have are that the combat can get a little repetitive as with some of the music tracks. ive also heard rumors that the next 2 parts will be a playstation exclusive so thats kind of a bummer as well",1673724292,1673724292,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The formula has changed in ARPG and inevitably, it will not please fans of the first iteration of the game. For my part, I found the graphics just sublime whether on PC or even on Steam Deck (yes it runs on it, incredible huh!), the cutscenes are insane, the music on top, and the game offers the luxury of allowing players to choose between Japanese, English, and even French dubbing (which is rare)! The game time is more than correct with a good forty hours and 3 to 4 hours for the Intermission DLC. If you like to reach 100%, you will have to redo the game. I am writing this review after having finished the game and the DLC (I am not looking to reach 100%)
Take into account that this is only part of the original work and that Square Enix intends to release a sequel to this FFVII remake in two other parts between 2023/2024 and that it will be necessary to go back to the checkout given the work provided , because we go far beyond the framework of the simple ""remaster"" or the ""lazy"" remake which has been in fashion lately with publishers (hello Rickstar Games and its GTA trilogy!!! Hoping that they will not do the same stupidity for Max and his pain, we cross fingers). In any case, for my part, it's a big YES (and if you come across it on sale, it's even better).

Why does every character grunt, moan, or do some weird out of place sounds in dialogue? 
Music score is like a 7/10 - ok at times, pretty good other times.
Graphics look some times really freaking good with proper HDR display but some textures are total garbage lol. You'll see them all the time. Polygon count seems to be kind of low for 2020 game when this was first released. Combat is basically you smashing attack button until you can do a special attack once and then repeat. Basic enemies take way too long to take out. Some bosses have bullcrap non-blockable attacks and instakill blows which was just complete trash gameplay design and almost made me quit this AWFUL game. Maps are the most linear maps I have seen in years! Again when you die to some bosses, you have to watch 2-5 minute long cutscenes again and you can't skip them.

Anything good? Lighting is nice, graphics look nice most of the time, animations are incredible, menu system and UI is awesome. No bugs, no stuttering on a full AMD system Ryzen 3600 + RX 6800. Voices are well acted.

The bad: Map design, writing, fill content, endless fetch side quests, weird use of flat textures, endless cutscenes, button smashing combat system with enemies having way too much health, the game is 1/3 the original game and ""push a button and we'll do this long as* animation to do something basic"".

[b]PROS[/b]

- The story, for the most part, is faithful to the original, and is very well told through the use of excellent voice-acting and soundtrack. Most of the storyline additions were great – giving further character development to certain characters, while others changed the plot quite substantially, giving fans of the original game something “new” to look forward to. 

- The graphics are breathtaking. In particular, the in-game character models look just as good as the ones used in real-time generated cutscenes, and it’s not just how they look - it’s how they are animated too. The way they animated facial and body expressions makes it feel like they are real characters you can actually empathise with. 

 - The combat is genuinely fun. The game combines real-time action with ATB combat. It is simple to learn, yet never gets stale. The materia system enables your character to have different builds, giving the game more depth and replayability. In addition, the boss-fights themselves feel very rewarding to overcome as each boss requires a different approach to battle due to their unique abilities, strengths and weaknesses.

[b]NEUTRAL[/b]

-  The PC port has very limited settings. There is no option for anti-aliasing, motion blur, depth of field, field of view, etc… The game pretty much only allows you to change the texture & shadow resolution and the render distance for NPCs. On the highest setting this game will [I]only[/I] look as good as the PS5 version (which is still ridiculously good), although it does play better due to its higher frame-rate. 

- The keyboard and mouse controls are serviceable for the most part of the game. The only time they feel horrible is during certain mini-games such as the bike-riding and dancing sections of the game. 

[b]CONS[/b]

- The pacing can be slow at times. It doesn’t help that there are certain sections of the game where your character is forced to move slowly, especially when walking on ledges or crawling through tight alleyways. 

- The game suffers from shader compilation stutters like most UE4 titles. This occurs at the beginning of each new area or chapter you transition to. The stutter becomes less frequent as you play the game more and build up cache. Regardless, there’s no excuse to not having those shaders be precompiled. 

[u][b]OVERALL[/b][/u]

In conclusion, FFVII Remake is a great RPG for both new and original fans of the game. While the PC port could be better, you'll soon find yourself overlooking this as you become lost and immerse in the story and setting of this game.",1673508444,1673518322,True,58,1,0.83057856559753418,0,True,False,False

Every weird enemy which made no sense in the original game but were never questioned were there. Even the ones who would have definitely been forgivable for not being in the game! How much sense does fighting a freaking ..... make ???? I LOVED it.

The characters are immensely more developed than in the original game yet are still true to the original game. It brings so much more life to the world. And the game still has these funny moments.

I don't understand the complaints. ""The midgar part has just been stretched so much"".... yeah? That's great! We can live more things inside. It would be bad if some soulless content had been added to fill it, but that's not the case... with a few exceptions (chapter 17 😐). Complaints about sidequests, there are so few of them that I don't even understand how one can complain. I hate useless sidequests in games as well but they're not a huge timesink... and in any case... they allow to fight more!

Holy hell is fighting fun in this. It never gets old. Each character has a widly different gameplay. It's so smooth switching from one to the other. Playing well is so much rewarded! Bosses are a huge challenge and not just some high hp enemy, yet it never feels unfair. I was always happy to fight. And the customization with materias. Fighting alone makes this game worth it. It is SO. MUCH. FUN. I cannot stress this enough.

And the soundtrack! How can I not talk about the soundtrack. I had tears just listening to the main menu theme when launching the game. I had to take it in. The revisited musics are phenomenal, each time I listened to one, goosebumps. When jenova reaches low life.... literal chills. What a masterpiece.

The ending of the game is divisive as well... I for one loved it. Eager to see what's next. Maybe I'll be disappointed. Maybe not. We'll see what they do with it, but I'm happy they went with this.

Yuffie DLC is awesome as well. I didn't really care about Yuffie in the original. This DLC gave her so much character!

Only negative point of this game are the motorcycle (yeah seriously it was bad... and it wasted a potential boss fight) and the 9 dresses achievement 😴.

Definitely recommand for any fan of the original game. For people who haven't played it... well you will lose the huge fanservice aspect and some references... but the game is still great I think. And the fighting alone probably makes this game worth it in any case.

PS: SE don't do that stupid deal with Epic again, thanks. I won't buy your game over there even if I love it. Don't make fans wait due to some corporate greed. That's what Shinra would do.",1673471068,1673471068,True,23,2,0.665927767753601074,0,True,False,False

It play better than PS4 version for sure HRD still buggy but help improve image.
120 frame are smooth.
But some cut scene and cg are stuttering, It not bother gameplay but you can tell the graphic engine are outdated.

This is my 3rd play through. First on PC.
Somehow I think gameplay is better than what I remember on PS4.

But that where the good point end.

Gameplay kinda er...meh. SE need something new all late FF using this recipe, you build stagger bar with enemy weak point before you can do real dmg. 
Was it bad? maybe not, but it boringgg. It rob you off creative way to play the game, If you dont use right element or right skill you will met with bullet sponges Boss.
Some character are meh to play that mean game balance was kinda bad.

And the worst part of all .....story. Shit man I wait 20 years for this?
FF 7 was never about good story for me. Yes there many plot hole but the coolness of each character and the secret in vast world make it a good game.
So if they want to improve the OG. They just need to change story or make it more realism.
And they did! BUT......In a worsen fucking way. Now we got Kingdom Hearth Super Nomurasih Fucking Delusion. Fighting with Fate?Eco terrorist ? WTF man it all more childish than OG??
Also the writing.....mehhhhh. Who ever wrote Aerith and Barret line should get their brain check. They trying hard to make it poem but it doesnt make any fucking sense, It just cringe.

Also the world .....WAIT there no world here, It only linear path way from start till the end with only few minor secrets.Mehhhhhh.

Oh the music.....wow cant tell how many youtuber talking about this game music.
I gotta say music is not my styles but I not gonna judge. 
The problem is it  fucking loud by default setting everything every scene pumping up the sound that make you feel excite but it so messy feel like you dont know what you want to focus. I need to use vocal boost  to hear what character  say.

The journey of Cloud, Tifa, Barret, Aerith, Red, Wedge, Biggs and Jesse is an amazing one and not to be missed.

This is my first FF game and I had clue about how these games would be, just knew that it would be a JRPG. Man I was blown away, I can see the effort in the craft that they have made. And I can understand why FF7 was such a big phenomenon in the 90s. The story is deep and hard hitting. One of the best stories I've ever experienced, GOAT Tier. That being said, the new game did deviate from the original but it was an honest effort and there's no compromise in quality. Every character has their own traits and they are unique and strong.

Coming to the gameplay, you have dance offs, bike chase, arena based battles venuma, hack and slash combat, also including tactical strategic combat venuma, multiple characters control venuma. Don't even ask me how is this possible. They packed everything into a linear story, it blends so well and it's fcking amazing.

The boss design and combat mechanics are the best part of the game. Each boss is unique and it's no simple button mashing. You have to analyze the weaknesses and strengths and play accordingly. You will definitely switch between characters to fight the bosses. 

You have normal weapon combat( each of the 4 combat characters come with different type of combat sword, gun, melee and magic), then you have unique abilities according to your combat type, you have spells, you have summons and finally a limit attack, which is like powered attack. I won't explain further because it will seem more complicated but I can promise you that the game implements it seamlessly and you would get a hang of it very soon.

It won the best music at the game awards, that is self explanatory. God tier music. Visually the game looks stunning apart from some goofy NPCs.

It's not a perfect game. There are cons. Side quests are flat and one dimensional 90% of the time, but you will play all the side quests because of the good rewards and you can't access those side quests if you move on to next part of the game. It is a JRPG, so you will have the anime tropes among the characters throughout, it worked well for me actually because I'm an anime fan but not everyone would like it. Traversing locations might be a bit annoying. The game is a bit stretched close to 40 hours. 30 hours would've been perfect length. I found the character Barret to be a bit annoying, story wise.",1673366965,1673366965,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Mediocre textures.  Truncated-yet-drawn-out story where you're wading through piles of rubble for 30 hours while people ask you to do incredibly boring and/or opaque side-quests.

The lighting is good though.  Combat is okay.  And Red XIII is still the good boi.

This is probably my favorite game of all time, probably tied with the original, even though it is just the first part of the full story. I know people complain about the game not being the whole thing but the original game had 3 discs as well because of the crazy size the game was, and this isn't a faithful remake, which I know is another complaint, but I'm all here for it. The story is nostalgic but feels fresh, and they did amazing with the English voice acting (except for you Zack, sorry). If you just play through it, it could take up to 30 hours, but if you're a completion-ist, there is well over 80 hours in this game, first play through alone, not even mentioning replaying the game in the crazy hard difficulty. I have like 15 hours in the game right now, but honestly I will probably have the highest playtime of any review ever in the future just because I love the game so much. And the Yuffie DLC (you kinda just get it no matter what if you get it on steam now) is very fun and I love the Fort Condor game (they changed it from the original and now it feels very much like Clash Royale). I will 100% recommend this for everyone, the only thing I'm scared for is how will the new parts work, will I continue my progress where I am now? Do I start at level 50? If there are three parts is the level cap over 100? Stuff like that. Either way, the price is worth the content you get, especially if you take advantage of all the content.

Final Fantasy VII Remake is the first of a - probably - three parts project by Square Enix. Originally thought to be a mere graphic update of the famous Final Fantasy VII (1997), this videogame is a true remake released in 2020 for PS4 and 2021 for PS5 and PC of its predecessor. This part covers the first 10 hours (or less) from the first CD-ROM of the original game, from the assault to Makor Reactor N°1 to the escape from Midgard. However, this part has been expanded by the developers and so Final Fantasy VII Remake is a 30 hours long game divided into 18 different chapters. As the 1997 edition, this remake maintains the railroad structures.

The differences between Final Fantasy VII Remake and Final Fantasy VII are various. The turn-based gameplay and the random encounters have been abandoned 20 years ago and now the game is more similar to an action rpg. However, the ATB bar is still present: it is reserved for using characters skills, magic and items while attacking or defending from mobs does not require ATB. In addition, while the 1997 version had only one difficult, this Remake offers to players five solutions: Easy, Easy (Classic), Normal, Normal (Classic) and Hard, where players cannot use Items and enemies are more powerful. New is the weapons update system, where player can upgrade their weapons by using skill points, while ability points for materia are still presents. Players can also save their data everywhere. 

The possibilities offered by new technologies have given to producers the idea of going deeper with the worldbuilding: e.g. an entire chapter is dedicated to the relationship between Cloud, Jessie, Biggs and Wedge and - after about 25 years - players can know the backgrounds of these three characters; Midgar is no more only the location of the story but a crowdy lively metropolis where citizen reacts in different ways to the attacks made by Avelanche; the main characters are more believable and tridimensional than before.

The plot of this remake is quite identical to the original one. In general, due to the fact the story of Final Fantasy VII is well known, the producers have decided to anticipate a few relevant points. However, some addition to the plot has been done by the authors. The objective of developers was to find a solution to the mess they have done with Crisis Core, Advent Children and Dirge of Cerberus: some of the ideas developed in these three games needed to be linked together in order to mend all the plot holes created in these 25 years. Obviously, graphics and music are terrific as always. 

INTERmission is a four hours adventure set in Midgard with the ninja Yuffie Kisaragi. She has to steal some materia from Shinra with his fellow and the help of Avelanche. The adventure take place between Reactor 5 and Sector 7 events. It is thanks to this story that Square has brought some aspects from Crisis Core and Dirge of Cerberus into Final Fantasy VII. Interesting is the Sinergy Battle System with which the characters can give life to different combos. In addition, the combat style of Yuffie is fast-paced.

Even if I was sceptical about this remake for the various changes made by Square Enix, I've to admit that I haven't enjoyed myself so much since Final Fantasy XII. Obviously, it is an expansive game but you can save about 50% during the various Steam Sale. 

For your information, I've played without any problem this game on a Nvidia 1050 2GB VRAM, so the official requirement of a 3GB VRAM is not correct.",1673227362,1673227362,True,1,0,0.509803950786590576,0,True,False,False

-When you're exploring, any time you interact with something, your character does so slowly. Want to hit some crates to get some goods? Prepare to watch Cloud unsheath his sword, swing, and then be locked into an animation of him slowly putting the sword back onto his back, with no way to cancel it, even if you just want to swing twice. 
-When going through areas, there is a lot of ""additional content"" that is just meandering without purpose. Halls that loop back on themselves, lots of climbing and running, with lots of slow unskippable animations thrown in there. 
-The game tells me I'm on something like ""Chapter 8"", but in terms of actual story I'd say I'm just starting chapter 2. Honestly the places they declare a chapter finished and a new one started are any time anything remotely changes, seemingly just to give the illusion of content. 
-At the time of this review it says I have 14 hrs of gameplay, but I'd say I've done probably 4 hours of actual content. The rest has been seemingly intentionally janky fluff, probably to pad ""content"" numbers.

A couple other annoyances:
-The visual effects when fighting are so bright it actually hurts my eyes. I've tried with the brightness maxed, and the brightness all the way down (brightness maxed is easiest on the eyes, min is worst btw) but the effects are still so many times brighter than anything else on the screen it's like being flashbanged, and this happens every.single.time. a sword is swung, not to mention the other effects. Where's the option to lower them? I've had to change from SDR to HDR (which washes everything out) just to make combat playable.
-The price. I got it 40% off and it was still a little over $50 CAD. If it was half that price I wouldn't be giving it a hard time like this and would enjoy the trip down memory lane, but at that cost I expect more from a game than just a template for updated hentai.",1673129729,1673129729,False,7,4,0.543963432312011719,0,True,False,False

•	I am only in 5 hours but those have been more satisfying than all of FF 12-15 combined. 

•	The battlesystem may be absolutely horrible compared to classic FF games but the presentation is absolute bliss so is the writing and characters.

 I can't say much for the story because I haven't played FFVII in almost 20 years. But this has the classic uplifting atmosphere and lighthearted moments interspersed with a more serious tone. But I just can’t get over the stellar sound, music and writing as well as the pacing. If this had a decent battle system, it might already be one of my favorite games of all time. But I know a little to early to say that so I will surely write some more once I am done. 

As a side note, the subtitles for the Japanese version are pretty bad as well. As a Japanese speaker I have to say that the English translation is pretty bad sometimes and does not really bode well for the identity of the characters as they are intended. Then again, the English voice work is stellar as well. I just stick to Japanese though.

So far as negatives are concerned:

- Lots of content that feels like filler (e.g. simple but lengthy and tedious puzzles, dull and inane fetch-questing sidequests, long cut scenes/dialogue with sunimportant side characters).

- gameplay loop takes ages to get going (see above point about annoyingly placed and lengthy pointless cut scenes)

- combat often feels unbalanced until you regularly have three characters in your party (which won't happen consistently until well over half way)

Positives

- combat is fun and challenging (see above caveat about party size)

- once the narrative really starts and the pointless fetch-questing dies down the story is engaging and compelling

- good character work done to establish the main characters

- Dynamic resolution disabler

Those three alleviate - but not entirely eliminate - the #stutterStruggle that can be pretty bad in the unmodded version of this game.

Also, this was a pet peeve of mine that existed in the PS5 version as well was that in the later chapters there'll be a sunlamp just kinda ... floating in the sky in the Midgar skybox at night.

Okay still with me? Good so FF7R is an interesting one for me because it's a bit of a hybrid game and I honestly hate those usually, you only need to look as far as the SAO games after hollow fragment in particular to see my disdain for them as they make the game not work well, you see FF7R is a mix of an action game and JRPG but in a literal sense, despite giving you a dodge button which can let you avoid very specific attacks, 8/10 times you will take a hit, don't feel bad if you do get hit as there are no iframes and the tracking on some attacks is insane meaning it was intended and in fact the devs took this into consideration on damages and that's why it actually works as a hybrid unlike the prior series mentioned, you can freely melee attack which builds your ATB meter which let's you use powerful special moves, spells and items among other things and those are your damage dealer moves for sure, some are even handy in other ways dood.

You have weapons for each character in which you can learn moves from and upgrade to have certain effects, more damage and each have their own use which is super interesting, especially for Barret of all people but I won't spoil what specifically, materia is materia, for newbies they basically give you spells, resistances at times, straight up buffs and unique linked materia effects of sorts which improve the materia or gives it a special effect dood.

Visuals of the game are super great, to the point I wish I had a rig to do it justice but such is life, even down to the combat which looks super flashy and cool, that said combat is a weird one, the game has many an enemy or boss that's significantly more difficult than other bosses and enemies and usually for rather annoying reasons, it doesn't kill the game but it sure does kill a bit of the joy when you struggle on an enemy or boss for a kinda silly reason, for example despite being an awesome fight the final boss was actually one of the easier enemies I've had to fight in the game, which isn't a bad thing, it was still tough but ya know it's just weird dood.

The game has a lot of quests and mini-games to it that really add to it, I will say that I hate Jules (not really but you'll see why) and leave it at that XD but typically they are great mini-games that are done well and fun to play around with, there's a heckload of things to do in the game like that which lead to unique fights and equipment and materia you're gonna want for sure, the music during all of these things makes the game as a whole a super good time with some outstanding remix's, others I prefer the originals too but it's always gonna be like that sometimes in these cases dood.

Summons are done really reaaaally well in this, like in the history of FF games they've had some...interesting uses, expensive spells, randomly activating or the worst I remember them joining you in combat but taking your other members away and leaving you extremely vulnerable but here they fight with all your party, you use all of your characters ATB's to use it's skills which is nice as the summoner may have used all theirs just to summon them in the first place, I think it's certainly the direction they should go in the future of the series as it finally both makes them stand out but also be truly useful dood.

Each character is unique to play as with their own sets of skills and abilities, I will say it feels like Tifa's was severely jipped though as hers requires using an ATB charge just to improve it but at that point you may as well just use a skill, it also is easy to miss with it anyways so it's a bit of a bad time sadly, the others all have great unique abilities for their fighting styles dood.

Enemy designs/redesigns look great and that in particular for bosses is crazy awesome, that said there are issues with bosses, they really went all in for the visual flair and I highly appreciate that to a degree but there was many a time that I either staggered them (A mechanic in this where you fill a meter and they go down and get dealt extra damage) and they basically went into a cutscene due to the damage and recovered from it, I get why but also you may as well just take the stagger off at that point, I never got to make use of it outside of bosses intended to be dood.

Okay final words, hopefully didn't forget anything but FF7R was a game with a little bit of a rough start but ultimately a really good game, is it the original game with improved visuals we all wanted? sadly no but luckily it is also more than that, it very much is it's own game and there's more to it story wise than you know unless you spoiled yourself that is, to an extent that I am excited for the next one, that said I do worry what they will do for the next one, they already did so much in this that it feels like a complete game, on top of that will they be restarting players from level 1 with no materia in the next one or just add more? It's a worrying question but hopefully they can pull it off for another two games! thanks for reading dood ^-^7",1673091086,1673091086,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Even after returning years later to discover that my memories of the game were far more visually detailed than the chunky colored blobs that were appearing on screen, it still brought back all the nostalgia that made it something special as a kid. I can firmly say that this remake, despite the various alterations they’ve made to the original story, still brought back that feeling of nostalgia. The music alone is enough to do it. Nostalgia aside, what they’ve done here is nothing short of amazing. Tetsuya Nomura discovered a way to effectively rewrite this story into somewhat of a sequel. Using the concept of multiple timelines and allowing specific characters to appear to retain some level of a conscious understanding of what took place in the original game, he’s woven an enhanced story that not only mirrors Final Fantasy VII but allows the player to know when the story is deviating from the original timeline through the emergence of “whispers” of fate. This tactic provides longstanding players a chance to encounter new plot twists while managing to provide new players a reason to go experience the PS1 classic just to see how they connect. All of this with the addition of incredible graphical fidelity, a superior orchestral soundtrack and an action-based combat system and you’ve got yourself a hell of a great start to what’s been introduced as a trilogy. Can’t wait to play part two, Rebirth, when it finally releases. If you’ve ever enjoyed an RPG, this won’t disappoint. And if you can’t get enough, note that there’s a full expansion with this release as well as an additional Hard Mode that’ll rock your socks off. Secret bosses, extra content and more.

As a kid in about 5th grade (I am an adult now), I was a fan of kingdom hearts, and I had a great interest in final fantasy by extension, but I would never play the final fantasy games besides Dissidia and eventually FFXV as I did not like turn based games back then. However, I LOVED final fantasy advent children and always had a dream of having a ""playable"" advent children style of final fantasy 7 game.

Well, needless to say, my dream came true when this game was announced, and now that I am actually playing it, it is even more like advent children than I thought it would be which is all I could have ever asked for. Everything about it screams advent children and I wouldn't have it any other way.

 I am a little disappointed that the game was broken up into parts, but as I played a bit of the original FF7 a few months ago, I do appreciate the extra fleshing out of some of the characters in this game, and I think, as long as the other parts are kept to this same standard, I believe this was probably the best way to treat such an iconic game.",1672888169,1672888169,True,1,0,0.515151500701904297,0,True,False,False

There were definitely some frustrating parts of the game. The writing sometimes either suffered from a bad translation or was just poorly done. It wasn't constantly bad, but it stood out when it was. The pacing was also a little wonky in places. The game constantly has you slowly crawling through narrow corridors or ducking under things and walking slowly. I imagine this happens to ""hide"" the load times between different areas but it was very annoying. 

Graphically, the game is wonderful to look at. There is so much attention to detail going on in the environment. 

The music is great, but also sometimes annoying. As you travel around the world there are vendors/machines playing music from jukeboxes. This jukebox music and the BGM overlap and sound absolutely awful and can be very grating. Outside of the jukebox overlap I liked pretty much every track in the game. A lot of remixed music of the original game is used.

The only thing about the game I flat out disliked as a whole was the combat system. About half way through the game I had to swap the difficulty to easy because I couldn't take it anymore. It is not a hard game but the combat drags on with almost every encounter being some variation of an enemy you already fought just with more HP. The combat just wasn't rewarding enough to justify spending any more time getting good at it.

A few things to watch out for before buying, just to set the right expectation: this isn't a ""hack and slash"" and it plays surprisingly similar to other turn-based games. It has a lot of JRPG/anime clichés. It's pretty linear, except for a few ""open world"" chapters where you can do a lot of side quests. There are many filler quests compared to the original game, but the storytelling is still excellent, and these parts never feel like a chore.

My main issues with this remake are the super-padded content and the ending. It stretches original game's initial 5 hours into a 30-hour epic, where it's possible to grind your party up to level 50. There are definitely stretches of gameplay that go on for long enough to get annoying. This is especially noticeable around the midpoint, where your party is supposedly rushing to deliver very important information, yet the game treats it without any urgency.
Also, it all ends in a final showdown that is FAR too insane and unnecessary this early in the story.",1672841232,1672841232,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

Pros:
Great graphics 
More story background and character development

Cons:
Horrible UI
NPCs cheat during battle
Guard doesn't guard very well
ATB gauge is broken. Won't let you use the items or spells you have when you want.

Final Fantasy 7 was a game I couldn't put the controller down (for real) and would play 12 hours straight and not even care. This remake has me going for days not wanting to play because it's SOOOO BORING! On top of that, the new way to play that isn't turn based is shit. I have to wait or swing my sword for about 5 seconds before I can do anything else. Where's the fun? Where's the strategy? Where's the desire to keep playing? Not here.

The fundamental aspect that breaks this game is the ATB gauge. It won't let you use any items or spells unless it's full (and it fills up REALLY slow) and that makes playing the game broken, IMO. If I have MP, but can't use my spells or items, then what's the point?

I've played with Aerith for a bit and so far, this game is a 4/10. Very disappointed with the remake.",1672809379,1672809379,False,10,3,0.460373848676681519,3,True,False,False

Remake brings it to life on another level, so much detail in parts of the story that didn't were so important back then, that makes them alive.

Overall a great game that didn't failed to give me hours of fun and new content. I have yet to try Intergrade chapters!

Pros:
-Great story that is not a direct copy of the OG (possibility to actually reexperience the story as something new)
-Astonishing battle system
-Beautiful graphics for the most part
-Great rhythm accompnied by a beautiful soundtrack based on the OG

Cons
-Some dull moments, staling quests.

I had been avoiding the franchise as a whole for quite a while thinking RPGs were not for the likes of me and seeing how FF7R was on sale, I decided to give it a go and let me tell you I never expected the story and the characters to be so mindblowingly good. 
The writers made a fantastic job making you feel like you're really a part of Cloud's gang. I loved every single interaction with all the characters including the villains. Some story parts were totally unexpected and funny which ended up adding more weight to the more serious ones when the writers decided to slap you in the face with some serious drama. I particularly enjoyed the balance between the gameplay and the cinematics. I did read some comments about the last two chapters being tedious as they give you no room to breathe between all the fighting and the cinematics but I beg to differ. All the action definitely helped build the tension needed to reach the climax of the story. And oh boy, what a grand finale! I seriously can not wrap my head around the idea FF7R is only 1/3rd of the original game. I wonder what Square Enix will give us next that will surpass the stellar battle against Sephiroth. 
Also, kudos to the composer for making such a memorable and epic soundtrack. There is no denying Nobuo Uematsu is a master in his field. His work made this adventure all the more impactful!

Now, unto Yuffie's sidestory... I haven't played it yet so I will update this review once I've completed it. 

All in all, I'd recommend FF7R to anyone who likes action-packed stories with memorable characters!",1672712766,1672712766,True,2,0,0.535452306270599365,0,True,False,False

Square cares more about flash and flare than substance and weight. The game looks stunning, however the experience is some of the most un-interactive crap I've played since... well, FF14. Graphically, the world appears amazing, but it's all just puddle deep! 

But there is one thing that completely ruins the game. The combat.

Dear God this combat engine is awful! What's wrong with the old turn-based system? Instead, we get some horribly messy system where you run around in circles spamming the attack button while your teammates stand still tanking hit after hit, not contributing to the fight at all. I couldn't even get out of the first reactor mission without spamming potions. As soon as I used one, I'd have to use another one because the combat in this game is SO F*XKING AWFUL!

You can't even SEE what's going on you're running around trying to dodge abilities that doesn't work! The camera is like it belongs in a Sega Saturn game, focused on Cloud's ass the entire time while you're trying desperately to stay alive. They turned FF7's original turn-based combat into a chaotic mess! WTF is ""punisher mode""?! WHO CARES?! STAND THE FUCK STILL AND FIGHT! Why didn't these morons just make a God of War clone?! Why didn't Square just make another crappy FF7 animated movie?!

Gone is the satisfaction of pulling of a clean critical attack. How can you be expected to navigate menus and cast spells while you're GETTING YOUR ASS KICKED BY THE WORLD'S SHITTIEST ""REAL-TIME"" COMBAT SYSTEM?! Holy SHIT is the game terrible. You don't even get to PLAY! Every 15 seconds game control is taken away while you passively watch the game play itself. OVER AND OVER. It's like morons just see the shiny graphics and big tits and care for little else.

It's normal to have missable side quests, it's annoying when every side quest in missable.

Crashes: The game seems to crash most when interacting with benches to rest, using vending machines, and after cut scenes from what I've observed.

Steam Deck: It's real bad on the deck. No native screen resolution supported, character models look blurry while the world comes in crisp. It was distracting and I only lasted like the first hour on my steam deck. It's way better on pc proper in terms of graphics. It was running stable 50 frames tho at 720p so not too bad. Crisis core runs better overall on the deck than this one.",1672335004,1672494307,False,10,5,0.571824073791503906,0,True,False,False

-Very nice 3D remodeling, Tifa particularly.
- Nice remix soundtracks from the original.

Cons
-Story is heavily dragged and extended from the original Disk 1. added ALOT of side activities to extend the playtime and dramatic scenes to slow down the pace of the story progression.
- Linear Map, as bad as FF13.
- Enemy encountering is a joke. (Chrono trigger style but failed to live up due to linear map design)
- Almost all the bosses have multiple phases to fight and come with cut-scenes(why?). By the time their stagger meter is filled often enough they will enter to next phase and reset the stagger meter.
- Puzzle-solving is also a joke, they reminded me of old resident evil from the 90's era.
You'll be dealing with more resident evil puzzles, narrow passages, and BOXES!!! than encountering battles.

I wouldn't call this one a remake of FF7, but rather a spin-off or a tribute to the original.",1672136550,1672465678,False,4,1,0.474423348903656006,0,True,False,False

Really not happy with all the foul language because I am a father and I think they used ""SH IT"" one time in the original and now its used in about every cut scene but I loved the original and so far this has been good, Almost too heavy on the cut scenes, it's like can we go now. Long pauses and attempts to have emotional content. 

The battle system is amazing and no longer the load screen, 5 second fight, load screen again. There is almost no zoning either. Fighting is very real and interactive, you can toggle between characters or let the AI control them and it dosnt do a half bad job. Once you get good, you are constantly switching and doing awesome combos with your team. You can interrupt enemy abilities and they can to you too. It is very strategic. Blocking is very useful but dodging hardly does anything except move you around a little faster. I guess its just really hard to dodge things correctly. 

Summons leave you a bit underwhelmed, you summon Shiva or something and you have to use your attack points to have them do anything other than auto attacks. It really is just two or 3 direct damage cast by the end of it. Only have 4 so far so maybe it well get better. 

Graphics are great and if you change your materia or primary weapon you can see it new weapon and the materia in the weapon.

-Fun game play, action RPG and each character feels unique.
-Great graphics (pretty par for the course with Square Enix.
-Excellent voice acting. 
-Materia system works well with the new game play style.
-Weapon customization is nice and keeps weapons from becoming obsolete as you can find times when using one weapon over another can be beneficial. 
-The banter between the characters just walking around just makes me smile.
-Music is nice! Catchy remixes of the original soundtrack (which is awesome) And there are a few new pieces that aren't shabby either.

 CONS 
-Story of the original is changed for the worse. (destiny ghost things are the worst thing ever.)
-SO MUCH FILLER! True the game is as long as a full AAA title. (despite being only a small part of the overall story of FF7) The game follows a pattern where you have a  story section then enter a ""hub area"" with side quests that are VERY basic. (go here kill X of these monsters etc) 
-Pacing problems. The story sometimes slows/stops compared to the original game, the story can get very captivating and then change focus so hard that it can feel like a chore to get back to the good parts.
-Though the main cast/monster models look amazing. The NPC's look like randomly generated characters from ""Elder Scrolls: Oblivion"" and sometimes look as if they don't even belong in the same game.
-Maps are just a series of corridors most of the time. No real sense of exploration.

In summary, FF7:Remake is okay, but defiantly play the original game first. Yes the graphics are somewhat hard to look at, but the story/characters still hold up well to this day. The changes made in this version are like a ""parallel universe"" version of the story, SE is defiantly going to change much MUCH more of the story going on, so defiantly play the original first to get the the most from this game.

Negative review just to balance the scores, but I'd give it a 5.5/10.
It has some seriously glaring flaws, and a lot of the gameplay really comes off as an after thought.

The first point is the movement. When you compare this game to XV, it's very rigid. If you walk into a fence, he keeps walking, in XV he would animate a stop, his body would twist when you turn around and his feet stay planted. It's very well done, this game feels old. There isn't a lot of variety in the animations. If you turn around twisting the stick, he just runs in a circle, which looks really unnatural. Also, the terrain is just flat. It's ladders, stairs and flat surfaces. It reminds me a lot more of XIII in level design, it's a big step back from XV. The game also feels a bit lifeless, at least compared to XV again. The banter between characters isn't there, or isn't as noticeable. The combat also feels like it's built from two completely different components. The X-attack, Y-special stance seems like it was the main direction they were going for, but they later on tacked in the A-menu system and materia to mimic the classic gameplay. 

The character designs are also a bit inconsistent, I just find Tifa looks like a cartoon, she was clearly reworked based on feedback, while Jessie looks like a real person. The voice acting, or more so the localization, is just awful. Some parts aren't bad, but big characters (like Sephiroth) are a huge disappointment. A lot of weird gasping and humm huhhing everywhere also that just comes off as a bad dub. It's like watching Speed Racer and comparing it to something modern, like Demon Slayer. The dub feels 10 years old, like a remaster of a Japanese only title released on modern consoles...

The question really is, why does this game feel so dated, especially compared to XV? And I think I know the answer. This is a remaster, like Type-0 or Crisis Core. It is a lot closer is design to an action combat version of XIII then anything similar to XV, and when you really compare them dollar for dollar, this game is way behind in quality and attention to detail.

So what is this game? Here's how I would describe it. A dead PS3 project that was poorly reviewed by beta testers, which had the graphics updated for modern consoles, the combat system updated to address complaints, the character designs updated to address complaints, the game stretched to address complaints, and probably the equipment and items tweaked to better reflect the original, to address complaints.

Are these game breaking? Not really. It's a playable game.

Is it better than XV? No, it's not a better game than XV. I'd say it's better than XIII, but it's far more inline with XIII's overall game design (look at Cloud's crossdress, bit of a dated throwback, no?). It was clearly built around the same time, but the ""retro"" combat was added to please old fans. 

Is it worth the asking price? No, not even close. This is a remaster of a dead project from 10+ years ago, and it clearly shows. I wouldn't be surprised if the majority of the dubbing was done half a decade or more ago. Square Enix just continues to fail at putting a Final Fantasy title into a 3D action RPG. Chairs don't fall over when you bump into them, you can't search every crate, you can't knock bottles off the table, you can't talk to everyone, papers don't fall over when you run by, side quests are just map markers and to-do lists, kill this, fetch that..., there's no combat grind, the whole combat system is just too easy and everything feels pointless, but the boss fights are too complicated. If you do the side quests, you are too powerful. 

I don't recommend it really. However, I am a bit optimistic that part 2 and 3 are much more modern in design and hopefully feel a bit more alive. If they are just rushed sequals using the same engine and game design, I'd probably wait for a sale on all 3 in the distant future.",1672340899,1672340899,False,5,1,0.379711151123046875,0,True,False,False

This is my second game in the Final Fantasy series, I started with Crisis Core Reunion and then jumped straight to FF7 Remake. My gosh this game does everything right. This is one of the most, if not the most, cinematic video game I have ever played. It just feels like im playing a movie.

The biggest issue with FFXV for me was the length of the story is too short and also the combat was kinda crappy! However, This game fixes all the issues above. Yes, I do know both games are built with different engines and different teams. I have never played the original FF7 but this game is no doubt a masterpiece! 

Cutscenes: 
Some of the cutscenes kept me wondering whether it was a pre-rendered or real-time rendering. And yes, we are finally at the point where we begin to fail to differentiate a real-time rendering that looks like a pre-render cut scene!

Combat:
I'm not sure what they call this new mechanic but basically, it's a mixture of Turn-based + Real-time combat. Imagine FFXV's wait mode but a more refined version!

Skill tree/Upgrade Weapons:
Instead of having a character skill tree, you can now upgrade the weapon using the SP(basically XP). There is no need to grind the shit like some Ubisoft game just to upgrade to the best stats. The unequipped weapons will always get the same amount of SP every time you get some. Therefore, you can always equip another weapon even if you only want to test it out. Also, each weapon has its unique ability after using it a few times, the character itself will obtain the ability and you can use it even if you decided to switch to another weapon

Game levels: 7/10
I would say the game is a linear + semi-open world. For me, it doesn't matter whether it is an open world as long as the side quests and storyline is good enough. 

Storyline: 8/10
Not gonna leave any spoilers here, but the story is a decent one. The pace is okay! The visuals of some characters/bosses are just so good. 

Graphics: 10/10
Music: 10/10 

Last but not least, SE is very irresponsible when they made this PC port. Dynamic resolution made the graphic/Frame rate crappy AF if you don't have a decent GPU. I had to disable it using the mod. Otherwise, this game is great! PS: cannot wait to play rebirth

This seems to correct that it felt like a full game it does not feel like they cut it in 3 since so much has been expand on from the original with still keeping all the key nostalgic moment you would want.

It manages to basically re-tell the FF7 Midgar story mostly according to script up to a point but done so much better then the original though that an unforgattable classic on its own.

Really playing hte original is also worth doing...

If you really wanna be chronoligical about it do crisic core first, then FF7 then FF7 remake then maybe dirge of cerberous if we get that on steam then maybbe integrade.. though those are really parallell i think.. i think integrade may come before dirge of cerberous  and likely that will spill into FF7 rebirth.>

things are happening across all these games and its all a continous narrative though only Sephiroth and Genova are aware of the original timeline

its also pretty good if your totally new to the game... just know things came before but your seeing it from the main character point of view which is also a fine perspective... you may not get some of the deeper lore hinted at in flashes but neither would the confused cast of characters your playing so your viewing thing from their POV which is also fine

After hours of sinking into this story and enjoying the updated turn-based fast action gameplay, its an glorious adventure. The team at Square Enix has one a fabulous job for animation, cinematic, character models, and sound. It's worth giving a try for new or old fans of FFVII. 

I never finished the original game, since my 3rd disc was scratched up. This expands in great detail about support characters, which I didn't see a reason why. They had very little impact on me and the characters, even Cloud was written not to care when they were in distress. I appreciate the cut scenes and animation, but there no need for a backstory for support characters when you have multiple Mains.

Mini-games are alright. Some I can do without, like the crane game which was very slow and pointless. If you plan on playing this game once, try the mini games when you can, because theres no reason to return afterwards.

From what i hear that won't be in rebirth so its fine.

All in all a nice remake for die-hard FF fans as well as a good intro to the jrpg series for newcomers.

Fortunately it was made in UE4 so you simply have to download the input.dll mod along with the engine.ini and edit the engine mod. Once you crack that, the game looks stunning. 

As far as the rest of the game? Other than a few weird cringe additions, the game was absolutely fantastic. The score was amazing. I loved the combat and I loved the story. 

Personally, I had never beaten a Final Fantasy Game until I beat FFXV this summer. I beat this game today and I enjoyed every minute of it. I'm currently attempting to go through my list of games to beat before I buy another game but I think I'll keep this installed. I know some purists were disappointed with the liberties taken with this game. I played FF7 when I was 16 or 17 and I just couldn't get into it back then. I know the story is considered a GOAT story but it just wasn't for me. I loved FF10 but again, I just couldn't finish it. I also owned FF13 on PS3. Again, couldn't finish it. I now have it on PC and I'm thinking about attempting to beat it here. 

Anyway, if you're a purist, this game may disappoint you. If you're newcomer or if you're a purist that is comfortable with *change, this is an incredible game. Especially if you're okay with going in and editing a few system files to get the most out of your PC. 

Be advised: This game is virtually unplayable without modding it. The game notoriously stutters due to dynamic resolution. Once you go into the .ini file, you can turn that setting off. I do not know why it was included to begin with, TBH. However, This is what I think defines PC Gaming. The ability to go in and mod/edit the heck out of something until it's up to our standards. Once you acclimate yourself with the .ini file commands (CVars), this game becomes one of the best looking games on the market. 

To edit the engine.ini file, you need to install the file and install the input .dll file. Here is a link to nexus mods:

The gameplay is quite enjoyable and I found it has captured the original story quite well considering the change in battle gameplay and the different play style (over the shoulder camera).

I feel that the full price they are asking is a little much considering the 30-40 hours of gameplay on offer here especially considering ultrawide monitors are becoming more and more common and the mouse and keyboard controls seem a little half-baked.

Midgar is beautifal. A lot of great cinematic experience. Plenty of classic cheesy segments. You probably won't laugh but they are enough to make you go ""What? Cloud is doing that?""
This game wants to tell you a story. It does so through slow segments that involve a lot of walking and speaking with your companions. I'd say about half of the game here is more of an  ""action narrative"". You'll spend less time in combat and more time experiencing the world.

Since they made quite bold changes to the story with this game so the upcoming sequels will be quite different.

I am refunding the game. The reason is because the vibe of the game effectively boils Cloud down into a selfish, effeminate diva. The game revolves around him, and so the game has a weird vibe. It's as simple as that.

The soundtrack is incredible. The graphics are incredible. The environments are incredible. Fighting system works great. I'm sure the rest of the game is really something.

When I saw the trailer for the game a year ago, I got the same exact vibe from the trailer, and I'd hoped they managed to fix this... awkward quirk or vibe. 

Unfortunately, it's still there and it's *too strong*!!! Cloud's awkward, effeminate and selfish energy, and the cinematics revolving around it, ruins the entire thing. And that's that.

The reality is in the original FF7, he held his own a lot better, like he didn't have to ignore Barrett to deal with him, but rather he was strong enough in heart to do so.

SPOILER FREE

Graphics are 7/7
Character models are touchable with their crisp cloth textures and hair details
animations are smooth and AAA from for everything besides some NPC side quest dialogue 
Environments are wonderfully adapted with a modern color and light. Midgar is beautiful.


Characters 5/7
The main cast is solid. It's not too ""anime"" and they talk like actual people for the most part.
Cloud is a good protag. Decent setup for his mysterious past.
Tifa is the kind childhood friend
Barrett is the passionate macho leader.
Aerith is the innocent girl trying to a hide a mystery.
(Haven't played DLC)

Gameplay 4/7
It's not ""style over substance"" but the game will never really challenge you mechanically if you just choose to mash. The depth comes from killing enemies efficiently and conserving resources. But the game is pretty generous with potions and money so it's possible to drink your way thru most fights.

The style is chef's kiss though. Smacking enemies with big moves FEELS GOOD. Cloud in particular has big stick energy. Very flashy with beautiful particle effects. Stellar sound design makes magic and metal sing.

Level design and exploration has whispers of FF13. Very linear progression. Most of the time it's a hallway with occasional side paths with a chest. However FF7R does a way better job disguises its hallways. There is minor puzzle solving and ""We gotta unlock door."" 

They breakup the hallways with towns. Small areas with side jobs to kill mobs and help out townsfolk. 
They do a good-job breaking up the norm. The quests themselves are simple but fleshed out decently with that final fantasy touch. 


Story 5/7
A modern FF story done right.

My Likes

Beautiful Graphics and lovely textures for face and hair
Moves at a good pace
Not too many side quests
Characters are sweet and lovable
Fighting on easy(classic) is really managable for me, loved the combat and system for levelling up weapons and materia.
Lovely ending..really cant wait for next installment

My Dislikes

The price, for €80 very expensive considering this is only part of the whole original game.
Locations are all  in tunnels, cities and dark places
Puzzles-Hate Puzzles
Quick time events- Hate QTE's now Im an oldie with slow reflexes
Lack of customisation-absolutely NO visual customisation choices
Lack of choices-no meaningful choices or options in game, follow the path set
Awful driving a motorbike and fighting sequences..


Doesnt feel like an RPG but is a beautiful and compelling game, just not one that ticks ALL my boxes. For this reason I wouldnt  recommend it for €80, I think they are pushing it a bit there. I think get it on sale, its definitely worth 50-60 euro.",1672017530,1672017530,True,2,0,0.545743286609649658,0,True,False,False

The soundtrack leaves you in awe. The story and world building is solid. Most of the characters are lovable including ones that were sub-characters in OG. Jessie's an adorable Cloud simp and I would pay her to kick me in the ribs. Wedge is comic relief yet still competent at his job. Biggs is Charlie Sheen. The game makes countless nods to the original which mostly fit very well. There are plenty of smaller detail things to make old players go ""Oh, I remember that"" in places it makes sense such as 7th Heaven details, or certain smaller things in the slums. However, there is one very annoying exception: Barret's rough-and-tumble, ready to throw hands at the drop of a hat but always focused on work. When he sings ""Victory Fanfare"", I just- no. Stop. When he does it multiple other times, lord god no please stop.

Although minor, it does still have some flaws that hold it back from me calling it perfect.
-About 1/3 of the game is gameplay which, honestly is kinda boring most of the time when you're fighting generic enemies. Every enemy has a trick to melting it which is revealed by a materia you get very early. Once you discover the trick, standard combat becomes mindless. However, bosses are excellent fun. A perfect example of fewer, better fights are more fun. Fighting dozens of generic mooks in waves is boring as hell. Fighting the Crab Warden? Hell yeah.
Another 1/3 is beautifully detailed cutscenes. No complaint about them, but settle in for some long ones.
Unfortunately, the last 1/3 is shameless padding: long walking sequences while an NPC dumps exposition. It's obvious that this is just here to inflate your play-time counter so people think the game is longer than it actually is. Also, everyone knows that squeezing through a tight space is just disguising a loading screen, Square. Can you pack any more in please?
- Roche is simply annoying. I'm hoping that he becomes important to the story before long so that he isn't just some intern's self-insert. So far, I'm convinced he's a very unwelcome addition.
- Characters will spoonfeed you ""hints"" to the point of annoyance. In a section where you're looking for a cat, you can hear it meow as a hint to the player that it is nearby. In case you don't get this, Tifa will say ""Did you hear that meow? I think the cat is nearby"" not just once. She will continue saying it every time the cat meows every few seconds until you find it. There's another part where you're supposed to find graffiti tags to lead you through a tunnel. Barret and Tifa tell Cloud to find the tag and go the way that it is pointing. They will tell you this again every time you find a new one in the perfectly linear tunnel where there is only one place where you can go the wrong way, and they will tell you that you're going the wrong way if you take it, very annoyingly, when all I'm trying to do is see if there are any hidden chests or items off the beaten path.
- Some things don't make sense in universe such as materia being valuable and highly visible to you yet other people just casually leave them on train seats and don't care. There are other times when you're running somewhere urgently because someone is in danger but you're welcome to take a nap on a park bench to replenish your HP/MP. Go ahead, take a power nap. Jessie and Biggs are fine, probably, hopefully, maybe.
- Because Cloud is default party leader, I find myself just playing him and not the other characters. I wish that I could set someone else as party leader so that I would switch to them at the beginning of combat rather than having to switch manually every fight.
- Materia no longer births when maxed out.
- There is a ""gift box"" section under the ""System"" section on the in-game menu with free items that I didn't know about. Had I been told of this, I wouldn't have bought extra accessories from the store and wasted money.

All in all, I'm going to love playing through it, but I don't think it'll be one that I come back to several times like OG. Fantastic game but grab it on a sale for $50 instead of full price.",1672003858,1672003858,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you want to play a game that uses the same names but only vaguely resembles the original i guess this game is for you.  The camera tracking makes sections of the game virtually unplayable.  The way the AI tries to take over for you usually taking the worse possible action for the moment doesn't help either.  Neither does making all of the keyboard controls for only the left hand with no common sense as to key layout(maybe it would be more playable with a gamepad).  I stuck with it to the final battle.  It was not worth it.  No airship/exploring the world, no chocobo breeding/racing, no cosmo canyon or different areas to explore(beyond the starting city) or anything else that made the first game so much fun.

The good: Graphics, sound, and art are all excellent. The glaring texture problems from the original release have been thankfully fixed. 

The combat is also great. Square has finally figured out how to modernize JRPG combat, the ATB system and hot swapping characters is a lot of fun combining engaging strategic elements with action gameplay.

The Bad: The writing.  It's at its best when it is directly adapting and expanding on things from the original. However, the changes to the narrative are beyond sloppy and this is not an adaptation, it is a sequel with fan-fiction level writing.  Nomura seems to confuse complex themes with needlessly convoluted nonsense as if a story will gain a deeper meaning if he just adds enough things that barely make sense (see: all of Kingdom Hearts). Not to mention how much filler there is to make this game ~40 hours long. 

There are other things that just don't work with this adaptation, like Cloud strutting around after a terrorist attack dressed like a solider with a 7 ft sword strapped to him and nobody noticing. In the original, lack of detail let your mind fill in the blanks with things like this, here things just blatantly don't mesh together.

 The dungeon/level design also sucks, primarily consisting of long, occasionally branching corridors with some brain dead ""puzzles"" occasionally thrown in. Exploration is also limited and not particularly rewarding. The environments themselves are hit or miss, some of the town areas look great while other parts of the game drag on and on in monotonous locations like the junkyard or sewer areas. The latter half of the game becomes an absolute slog, going through boring locations and backtracking. 
Side quests are almost all complete filler garbage. There are some fun optional bosses, which is the only decent side content. 

Midgar is such an iconic location and I was excited for the opportunity to explore a modern re-imagining of the setting. There was an opportunity here to really expand the world with a level of detail previously unachievable. Jesse's story additions are a good example of what the game could have used much more of: character driven sub-plots in previously unseen locations. Unfortunately, Square dropped the ball with a linear experience and sloppy narrative changes that undermine rather than expand on the original.

The appeal relies heavily on nostalgia, and I can't deny seeing iconic scenes and locations with modern graphics is still pretty cool. The combat is pretty great and almost enough to carry the game. But the overall package is ass, and the game becomes a chore sooner rather than later. A missed opportunity.",1671574697,1671997598,False,1,1,0,1,True,False,False

the music, omg the music, it's all remixed and livelier sounding, while the original ost is good this kind of modernizes it all and it makes me hope a younger generation will be able to enjoy the arrangements. especially the one with dub step. first time hearing it after knowing the original, didn't see it coming and then when it happened, was already in the middle  of a battle focusing on what to do and then all of a sudden, obsessed with getting our due recompense! 

the mini games from the original are intact, except the addition of a destroy box game, makes for good practice. 

bahamut was a pain to get but i'm happy it was the hardest boss. tho now i'm wondering if all that is gonna carry over or not to the new sequel whenever that decides to come out. 

this is one of the few games ever i've paid for more than once to get, it's that worth it in my opinion. 

for the people that gripe about the story in the remake and how it deviates from the original, i don't feel their views make any sense. the plot changes fall more in line with what happens in the ff7 advent children 2005 movie.

the game isn't finished, i wish it was, there is certainly no other game i look forward to being able to finish than this one. 

i don't like putting spoilers in my reviews. it's pretty crazy to not like the story or what they did to flesh out the side characters even more. i see what square did, learning from all the previous games they did and putting it all together to do this one.

That said, this port is a beta release. Too few pc settings available to tailor the experience to your systems capabilities. No options to enable/disable settings that have been standard in all PC games for decades. Wanna remap run for your keyboard? Nope. Wanna turn on/off Vsync? Nope. Turn off DSR? Nope. Uncap FPS? Nope. 4k? Nope.

On top of the lackluster settings options, the game runs terribly on most systems due to horribly optimized engine settings which often require playing on low settings on a RTX 3080 Ti and it STILL STUTTERS!

What's truly sad is that many of the issues seem to be the result of the DRM. Meaning that only the people who pay for the game get the crappy experience.

I've played this on PS4, PS5, and 2 different PCs. I own no less than 4 copies of this game and I choose to play none of those because Square Enix has decided to handicap their own work with terrible decisions that punish only their legitimate customers.

I'll be seriously considering whether or not I buy the next title based on whether they continue to insert horrible Denuvo DRM crippling the experience for paying customers.

If there's one thing I want the developers to take from this it's this, Denuvo makes your game worse, punishing your paying customers and teaching them that they can save $70 and have a better experience by NOT buying your product?

The work and passion put into it shows within the first 10 minutes. I highly recommend this game. I am not a big Final Fantasy fan. The only FF game I've played besides this is the FF4 remake on DS. But, I've had an interest in the series for awhile. I got this knowing that the PS5 version is well regarded, with a few complaints about the change in story. And, I also got it knowing about the various PC port issues. So far I've had no issues with the PC port, and I am extremely happy with the purchase. It has extremely high production value, and it shows everywhere. 

I thought I knew the story of FF7 somewhat, but actually experiencing it is a whole different thing. The dialogue is well written, and the story is engaging. The voice acting is great, and not corny or forced, except with a few NPC characters. All of the main characters are voiced well and animated great. Compared to something like Fall Out or The Outer Worlds, the mouth movement and facial animations are superb. You can sense the emotions of the characters, and they don't feel flat. I wasn't expecting this at all, and I am so pleasantly surprised.  It even made me laugh a few times! The conversations are legitimately funny, and remind me of the humor in Paper Mario and Mario & Luigi games. Any game that can make me crack a smile gets a big thumbs up.


I wasn't expecting this to to run on my PC, since the GPU is not great (Nvidia T600), but it actually runs super well on low settings.  My CPU is 'AMD Ryzen Threadripper 1950X' and I have 128 GB of DDR4 RAM, so that helps. There aren't that many graphics settings to tweak, unless you want to do things the hard way. But, just by setting the few options offered to low, the game ran at a consistent 60 FPS. I played for 3 hours straight and only saw one minor graphical glitch. I had NO crashes either. After all I had heard about this being a rushed port, I am shocked with how well it ran.  I was worried because I'd heard how this was a bad PS5 port, but I've played way way worse. I am so happy that it runs this well, I thinking it'd not run at all! I've had issues running Elden Ring at a constant 60 FPS, but somehow this game ran great.

The complaints about the port as a whole are valid, with there not being many PC graphics settings and some things feeling cheap in terms of textures. However, after playing for 5 hours, I don't have any complaints. As long as it runs good, looks good, and is fun, I'm satisfied.

I am blown away how amazing this game looks, even on low graphics settings. I've also played Resident Evil Village and Elden Ring this year, and I'd say out of these 3, this game has the cleanest/most distinct art style and is the most visually stunning. When you are in the Slums early on and look up, it's breathtaking. 

I feel this game does a really good job of mixing the present day world with crazy fantasy elements. Somehow, it works, and it feels very well thought out. The way people talk about things in the game like bomb threats feels very realistic. 

Yes, it may be expensive, but I believe it's well worth it, at this point. I am currently at Chapter 5, and found it hard to stop playing. I got the game for $40 on sale, and for the production value offered (great story, combat, cutscenes), that is well worth it, and so would $60. However, anything above $60 is going past the point of it being worth it.

I do have some gripes, like with combat feeling extremely easy for the few 1-2 hours, making it hard to get a hang of all the abilities. By the time you want to use a spell, chances are the enemy is already dead. But, now in Chapter 5, I've realized it quickly ramps up, and that is with me upgrading things at every chance. I am playing on the hardest difficulty available out of the gate (Normal), and I've heard the Hard mode you unlock after beating the game is much more challenging. 

I am far away from beating the game, but from what I have played, I can say it's worth it. The joy I've gotten out of playing it so far has already made the $40 for it justified.",1671845954,1671846176,True,1,0,0.500457227230072021,0,True,False,False

I'm genuinely baffled the score is so high.  If this is your first entry into FF7, there are several references to the original that will most likely leave you confused (unless you consult a wiki or one of the many videos praising the original game). Seriously, play the original if you're determined check this one out. You'll understand why people don't like this. 

Story: 4/10. It's called a ""Remake"" but it's more of a disgraceful semi-sequel (multiple acknowledgments to the original game). This is akin to a poorly written sub-amateur fan-fiction where the writer wanted their favorite characters of the original story to live and ignore the impact they had in the original. There are new characters for this but ultimately they weren't interesting enough to catch my attention or even care about their addition. It is baffling that this will kickstart a trilogy and a mobile spin-off.

Gameplay:  6/10. The battle system is just dull. You have regular and ""Classic"" modes. ""Classic"" doesn't mean what you think it means...it literally just plays itself and you enter a command when the ATB segment fills... However, if you play the mediocre action mode, that for some reason people are hailing as great, but your control of Cloud is as stiff as his hair. SE should have looked at more competent action games to model the gameplay. 

Pacing: 4/10. Horrible. Just horrible. Everything is stretched out and padded to absurd degrees. Maybe it's my knowledge of the original that is unable to separate from whatever this is supposed to be and prevents me from having even a ""meh"" experience. A few examples: The opening sequence is about an hour long (OG: about 15 mins), going from Aerith's house to Wall Market takes about 45 mins (OG: IT WAS 3 FREAKING SCREENS THAT TOOK 3 MINUTES INCLUDING THE RANDOM BATTLES). The entire game is about 30+ hours and it only covers Midgar (OG: Midgar is about the first 4 hours, 2.5-3 if you know what you're doing)

Graphics and Sound: 9/10. This is the one thing there's not really anything to complain about. It looks and sounds amazing. Some of the script is a little cringe inducing but overall graphics, music, sound design, etc are top notch as you would expect. 

Performance: This is where my opinion yet again takes a dive. I'm not one of these types where if a game drops a single frame I start beating my chest and flinging feces about the room. What does happen is typically during cutscenes where stuttering and frame drops into single-to-teen digits. Settings are bare-bones. You'll see more options and competence from the likes of Sony and Microsoft.

Overall: I'd give it a 5/10. SE manages to deceive much of their audience by calling this a remake (of which it is most definitely not). In order to fix the performance issues I would have to mod the game which I refuse to do since it's SE's job to fix their mistakes. 

I'll mostly likely refund this purchase but i'll never get back the time I wasted on giving this garbage another shot (played on ps4 launch). It's not any better on PC.",1671840782,1671840782,False,1,2,0.474796265363693237,0,True,False,False

I played it before on the PS4, and while it was also great, being able to play it with higher FPS and Mods is just an objectively better experience. On top of that, the Intermission DLC is a great add-on.

The combat in the game is very fluid, has a pretty low floor and a very high ceiling. If you put in the time, you can do disgusting things (like stun locking Bahamut on hard-mode, or getting a no-hit on Weiss), but you are still able to play the game just fine without having to get a PHD in the combat mechanics.

Yuffie is an awesome character, both her personality, design and combat are just great. The Intermission DLC fixed one of the biggest issues with base Remake (the aerial combat) and it gives me a lot of hope of the future of this series.

The music is still awesome, the visuals are amazing (bar some poorly rendered backgrounds, like in Chapter 15), the characters look absolutely STUNNING. The changes to the original FF VII are add a fairly good spice and some questions to the future, instead of being a beat by beat remake where people like me, who played the original dozens of time, could tell exactly what was going to happen all the time.

There are some padding in some chapters (especially the ones with loads of side-quests, like 14), but even some of the padding was great and added a lot of charm to some characters from the original that did not get to shine (like Jessie's chapter).

All in all, absolutely fantastic. The base game was already a 10/10 for me on the PS4, but the DLC really adds to it, so a 11/10 for me.",1655469765,1671821054,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The plot at the end there did not make any sense at all, I suppose they wanted it to be an extra convoluted mess or something. Oh, and show off Sephiroth obviously, who now somehow needlessly pops up everywhere. He's more annoying than ominous in this game. With the mess it is, I'm surprised they didn't try to cram in Yuffie, Vincent and Caith somewhere in Midgard too.
If you like the original, you'd probably hate what they did with the story too.
Only thing they did well, was give the 3 side characters Jessie, Biggs and Wedge a little more depth.

The voice acting was done quite well. I've heard plenty worse in other weebgames.

The combat system is nice enough, it seems more dynamic. But it also has a few issues here'n there.
With this game's ATB system you basically need to spam attacks to fill up a skill bar. However AI companions either seem to lack aggression, or simply don't get as much ATB points as the player controlled character. Also using your companions' skills is tedious; they just blast their skill on the spot if you use command, regardless of being in or out of attack range. So you constantly need to switch over to move them in place, then use their skill and switch back to main. 
The stagger system is a bit tricky to figure out, for all the damn tutorials they throw at you, they don't quite explain it well. 
Blocking and dodging is either a bit too slow, or just random in it's effectiveness. 
But what was seriously annoying was the damn cutscenes in the last battle, while in combat, no way to skip it. 
In fact, that entire combat sequence at the end was terrible, it takes a damn hour to get through, while it's several fights in a row, but you stay in combat in between running over to the next spot.

Also the Colosseum was terrible. They did it exactly wrong, the story fights were kinda tedious, but the optional fights were absolute weaksauce. This stuff should've been the other way around, especially if they reward new limit breaks. The optional battles are supposed to be the challenges.

Some of the minigames had some really weird control schemes, at least with keyboard&mouse. 


While the game has its moments, overall I'm disappointed with what I got.

When I heard about the release of the FF7 Remake and some of the creative decisions being made, I was very skeptical about whether or not this would be a good game. For those new to the story, this iteration of the game covers what only took about 6-8 hours in the first ""disc"" of the original (it may shock some of the younger generations to know console games sometimes spanned more than one disc before Blu-Rays - hell, some might not even remember having to buy games on a cartridge or disc), which was not even close to 10% of the content of the overall game. So I was left to wonder, was this being made as an actual full game or another shameless cash grab like FF15 that literally requires the purchase of DLC to make any sense?

It's a little of both, but it's actually a great stand alone game, and in reality covers a lot more than the original escape from Midgar.

I will attempt to keep the review relatively spoiler free, so I'm going to refer to a few events rather vaguely that will resonate only with people who played the original (and know most of the story anyway) or already finished this one and have curiosities about how it compared to the original. But the secret of expanding what was just a simple prologue of the game comes mostly from front loading details of the story that you didn't learn until later, adding a few plot devices that didn't originally exist, drastically lengthen some of the right segments of the original, and toughen up a few of the previously existing mini-games.

The spoilers in this paragraph are light, but will still be blocked out for people who only want to see for themselves. Edited portions of the game include - [spoiler] much of what you learn in Nibelheim was introduced throughout the final chapters, including the existence of Jenova. Major plot points ending the first disc and beginning the second are seen in visions but not expressly stated (a minor shock, as they do quickly show a pretty major later spoiler). The voices of the Ancients heard by Aerith take on a full new role visible to everyone as the Whispers (the one plot point that I found confusing and actually a bit detracting). The members of Avalanche all have a lot more personality and development (I was never entirely sure Jessie was a woman, much less a hottie), and have one extra mission including an extra popular mini-game. Many of the transitions between sectors feel less burdened since this game doesn't do random encounter battles, but the boss fights are all longer now that they're action based. Zack is introduced a LOT earlier (but not fully explained). You actually fight Sephiroth. They added side quest ""contracts"" that actually make Cloud feel like a mercenary. [/spoiler]

All of this adds up to a richer, fuller, and more coherent story overall so for the most part I really liked what was brought into the game with the exception of the Whispers.

When I was told that the game play resembled that of FF15 I was initially very concerned, but I think this is what 15 should have looked like. Instead of only one relevant character in Noctis and then 3 boy band filler characters, each one is designed with a different niche and all four are very fun to play in combat. Tifa was my favorite as a rapid hit brawler, but Barret was just as fun with an elemental matching enemy weakness on his weapon. Aerith comes out as much more than just damsel in distress with not only more personality but a compliment of abilities that make her magic attacks devastating. And Cloud feels like he was made for an action game, with the game play actually enhancing the feel of him as a SOLDIER.

Midgar took our breath away in '97 as the scale of a city went from awkwardly ""bigger on the inside"" pixel representations from previous Final Fantasy games to being shown as a full metropolis, yet still felt claustrophobic once you stepped out of the city. Now in the remake, it is bigger and more authentic than ever. The flow of the original lended itself well to ""on the rails"" chapter style game play anyway, so keeping that model in the remake turned out to be ok. I just hope that they open up the world whenever they release the next chapter.

The technical aspects of the game were fine, although with an RTX 2060 it was odd that I had flawless game play - high graphics - up until a near end chapter that didn't seem quite as graphics intensive with a bit of stuttering, which resolved once I started the next one. Battle targeting can be a bit of a pain although I didn't fully explore alternative settings to see if I could fix it.

Those with righteous RPG FOMO have little to fear as if you miss any steal-able unique weapons or gear from bosses or precious materia, you will be able to chapter select after you beat the game and clean up, with an added bonus of a harder difficulty that is just the right amount of punishing without being ridiculous. Summon materia feels a bit nerfed, as you are no longer able to summon in every fight on a whim and the roster felt highly reduced, but the trade-off is that they are almost certain to turn the tide when you have the right one come out for the right battle. Your limit gauges also do not persist from fight to fight, but again they can turn the tide when used in the right fight at the right time (they can also completely whiff, so timing is critical).

I had mentioned that I do see a bit of predatory monetization in this game, as I don't think it's a coincidence they added INTERMISSION or are remaking Crisis Core before releasing the next part of this game. However, I must bring up 15 again and remind fans of the series that this is a story obviously complete in its telling. Every detail from the bombing of the reactor until the exodus from Midgar is there, and then some, without making you feel lost in the middle. This is in stark contrast to FF15 with the break away from open world, a singular spotlight on a main character with the most forgettable backup trio ever written, crystal sleep for several years, and surprise baddie with a rich backstory that was entirely unwritten until you purchased the rest of the story you originally paid full price for. I have not yet played INTERMISSION and will not play Crisis Core, but it seems that they will supplement the story being told, not complete it.

Wrapping up a review that is almost as long as the game itself, this Remake does so much more than rekindle interest in an over 20 year old game for old fans and a younger generation. It very much feels like this is the story that they meant to tell, in the atmosphere fully imagined in which to tell it, with controls more authentic with which to drive it. As someone who for a long time has been telling 7 fanboys that FF6 was far better, I was extremely impressed by this one and might even buy the conclusion at full price.",1671659754,1671659754,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

FF's have always been a huge part of my life as a gamer, and even a huge part of my teenage years.
This game is a brilliant and beautiful return to the way RPGs used to be with an incredible and artistic reimagining of this game in the modern graphical design and beauty.
If this is what Square can do with FF's from now on it will return my faith in them as a company.

I HIGHLY suggest getting this and loving this. It bring back everything that made this game one of the best ever made, with visuals that finally do it justice.
This is the way FF7 should be played in todays age, and its done exquisitely, It is epic. Boss fights are incredible, and the story is even more detailed and riveting than it was before.
Definitely get this, and enjoy a modern remake done right, of a game that defined the closure of the old school RPG era.

Well before anything, know that this game is incomplete so if it's your first time around FF7, skip this & start with the original FF7 then if you like it & want to see a movie of an alternative timeline, waste your money here. I insist on this, know that this game is INCOMPLETE & the price tag will only give you the first big chapter of the original FF7.... 

So let's start, first know that this game is INCOMPLETE, this is NOT 'Final Fantasy VII Remake' but 'Midgar Return', why even call this a remake is beyond me.
It's only the first 20-30% of the original game but instead of being a RPG it's a movie-RPG, which mean you'll get to watch a lot of stuff with nothing to do, poor content & easier than any game made by Square ever.
Total playtime of 17 hours split into 15 hours Main Story + 2 hours DLC (20 hours + 4 hours if you're slacking) to complete a 100% normal mode (achievement + unlocking hardmode).

The combat system is pure garbage, just keep 'dodge/block > attack > ATB > repeat' & who care about the rest? There's almost no weapon choice & too much armor.... 
The universe of the game turn around 'Midgar' but you'll feel like playing FFXIII all over again (except there's nothing comparing to Gran Pulse), the same type of tunnels/empty arena & gameplay, all you can do is go forward, there's nothing else to do except if you reach a 'townzone' (only 3) where you can do a few quest in the zone you already visited (you even got a free teleport after completing a quest back to the townzone to stay on the 'always forward' treat).
After a few chapter you'll notice that you're not playing FF7 but an alternate timeline of FF7 in which Aerith knows everything about the old one(wtf?).

In any case this game is an incomplete bait which'll make you pay more games to complete.... it shouldn't even be called 'Final Fantasy' like every other spin-off, so if you're a fan on the franchise, you've been warned.

In fairness I would had loved the original game with those graphics & a real combat system, not this bullshit, even the FF13 trilogy had a better combat system in each of them (but imagine the 3 combat system of that trilogy reunited into a single game, here you go: FF7Remake).

Well at least I can watch an overpriced movie of an alternative timeline of Final Fantasy VII with new graphic even tough this game is nothing more than a meme. Not worth the 50€ at all.",1664146408,1671376644,False,3,1,0.364942997694015503,0,True,False,False

[b]Overview[/b] 
A remake shouldn't exist in order to negate all previous canon. [spoiler]The final boss has you literally destroying your childhood gaming experience. You, end up wiping out your own childhood past. That's ""messed up"".[/spoiler]

[b]The Good[/b] 
-The game did an excellent job on the character models
-The ""quality"" of the music/sounds, and the level designers paid a lot of attention to details. 
-It was fun to walk around a 3D version of Midgar (sector 7...etc). Some aspects of the Shinra Tower were fun to see as well. 
-The photo mode worked great and I had more fun taking pictures/screenshots than I did playing the actual game. 
-I liked how the materia looked and changed in the weapons that you equipped. 
-The combat was fluid and all of the playable characters were fun to use. Nothing really wrong with the combat system except for one artistic thing...
-Voice acting was great on the main characters, and also filler characters around town
-Barret was hilarious (probably the best part of the game)

[b]The Bad[/b]
-The game didn't give players what they really wanted. Players wanted a remake but with better combat/graphics. We did not ask to have the whole story-line messed up.
-The game exists to destroy all canon (ending of crisis core up through advent children).
-The game lost much of its charm because of artistic decisions. For example: it lost some of the warmth that the settings had. The whole Elmyra/Aerith flashback (my fav part of the original ff7) just didn't hit nearly as hard. Not nearly as emotional. They changed that part of the story for the worse and changed the dialogue as well. It ...along with other story moments felt very superficial.
-Much of the game felt like bad ""filler episodes"" from a tv show/anime.
-Side quests were tedious and ...torturous. 
-Playing the game started to feel like a job
-While the music was of high quality, the tunes were changed and accompaniment on a lot of songs was ruined. Many songs just didn't sound great; such as cost de la sol for example.
-There is an overall ""mood/feel"" that you get when you watch a movie, read a book, play a game. The mood just didn't ""hit"" right.
-The pacing was ruined time and time again. You'd go from an awesome fluid battle to having to tip toe through a narrow passage. You might be in the middle of an intense chase scene but then have to stop and turn down a side hall to make sure you didn't miss a chest.
-the multitude of breakables and chests to pick up actually broke the pacing of the game
-Last hour of the game felt like a big expositional/confusing-storyline BARF
-[spoiler]Some of the coolest aspects of the original FF7 were changed for the worse. Why didn't Barrett shoot at the rubble in anger? The whole scene with Cloud and the gang getting imprisoned was removed. The president of Shinra just...vanished? And tied to all of that...[/spoiler]
-The combat was too flashy with much of the attacks so the special attacks didn't feel ""special""...because everything looked pretty special. (most of the time)
-[spoiler]When characters die then the game has more ""weight"". This feeling was lost in the remake.[/spoiler]
-[spoiler]The entire feel and aspect of Sephiroth was ruined. 
--In the original FF7 you didn't see Sephiroth much. He was much more  like a monster from a horror movie in which the ""creature"" isn't shown until much later. Thus, the entire mood/ambiance and feel of what made Sephiroth ""Sephiroth"" was ruined/destroyed in the remake. No dead bodies in the halls, no sword in the president's back. It was just... lame [/spoiler]
-Flashbacks and Flash-forwards only added confusion to the storytelling

[b]Conclusion[/b]
-I understand that the world created by the original Final Fantasy 7 is awesome. It is one of my favorite IPs. When they made the decision to change the story / negate the original storyline, then what it feels like is: [b]The original characters/setting are preserved only to make more money off of the Final Fantasy 7 intellectual property[/b]. This is a slap in the face to many who enjoyed FF7 as a child. This game existed to destroy our childhood memories.

No thank you.

I hope the sequel makes ruining the original story worth it.",1671339351,1671339916,False,14,1,0.505667209625244141,1,True,False,False

I did 8 hours in one sitting - very rare for me (I did a similar number on Valkyrie Elysium yesterday - I loved that too, for very different reasons; the beauty is in the simplicity & slick, fun combat with little upgrades & new powers to keep it really fun albeit in a manner that isn't generally too taxing -sometimes you just kind of want to switch off & not think too much).

The game is phenomenal, beautiful from bening to end, every place you go is breathtaking, i'm not sure how Square make a game this good looking, but it's really amazing how beautiful the game is, gameplay is actually okay, nothing too good nor horrible. For those hardcore fans, you will love it no matter what happens, for those like me, if you enjoy a adventure with some phenomenal boss fights you will for sure love this game!

There are a few things that i did not enjoy, like the VA in English, way too much moaning and cringe dialoges, some characters are way too extra, but not in a good way. Square Enix needs to CHILL with the light effects in FF games, way too much particles going around way too much lasers and flashy attacks, why there are sparks flying if i'm hitting a human being??? I had to stop playing a couple of times because of headaches.

The camera sometimes is not great and the fact that the game LOVES taking the controls from you does not help. The game is pretty linear but it's great I just wish Square would let go of my hand during the game, and stop with the unnecessary cutscenes all the time. There are cutscenes that are like 5 sec of the character opening a door. I mean... why?

But all these problems pays off in the end, the last chapter of the game is like perfect, 100% perfect! Made me forgert all these problems that I had during the 30h gameplay!

*slow clap* So this is what we've been waiting for. Really?

This game has ISSUES, and it tells of that story throughout the game. The often MMO-like fetch/kill quests are insanely boring when you have such an interesting world that could be explored instead. We are presented with small and often lifeless dioramas that represent the fantastical world of FF7. Each town is [strike]lovingly[/strike] linearly crafted into corridors upon corridors. The town music... lacks immersion at times.

And then you run out of content. Huh? With how linear it's been going, it should have been relatively easy to have more, right? What a strange way to deliver content these days. And speaking of delivering content, there is no forgiveness for treating PC players as second class. I have refunded the game because I have already played it, don't support how PC players were treated, and think the asking price is insane for what we got (and how long PC players had to wait to get it).

It's crazy that this is the best they can come up with. We're not talking about a new franchise, but a very well-established and insanely popular one. The original literally CEMENTED Square-Enix in place as a AAA developer for all time (and space), so it's too bad that a few chefs somehow managed to spoil the entire dish even though they were already using a legendary and award-winning recipe.

How do you even **** it up this badly? I don't even know. Does it make sense that you are tasked to venture out into the (limited and bland) wastes to complete quests when you could be doing them in one of the coolest cities in RPG history instead? Does it make sense that there are extremely high flying enemies that make their chosen combat system feel super janky and frustrating? How about giving the remake the green light to strip out the living and breathing world that the original PSX version was able to portray, replacing it for lifeless dioramas? There are so many cool ideas that the remake could have used to move the story along, but instead we revert back to FF13's corridor-based system. None of this makes sense, but I can tell you what does: They chose to make a quick buck off of a legendary brand.

During its development hell, Square did mention the necessity to cut elements of the game to make producing it manageable... but that does not make it okay to do a half-***ed job in the elements that we do get to play. It's so half-***ed that even the minigames feel off! It's not that the mechanics used in them are too old to be used in the 2020s, but rather the overall feel of each one feels scuffed. Like eating food from a microwave. That kind of feeling. But I suppose that's how it should be, considering the entire game feels like you never left the train ride. Just one long corridor to explore... Until you reach the point where they're charging you to get into the next several train cars. And you'll wait while they get everything ready because SURELY it'll be worth it. Right PC players? The defacto biggest gaming faction? Surely no one would be stupid enough to **** with you, right?

Ultimately, you'll have to play the original to understand how big of a game FF7 was at its release, compared to its competitors. This title should be enjoyed for what it is, a mediocre episodic ""cash grab"" with some weird immersion breaks in the story that completely ruin the pacing. But SURELY they'll do the franchise justice with the next few episodes, right? This one was just a test, and now they can make the next episode way better! And they definitely won't use any excuse to delay the PC version on release... Oh yeah, they'll definitely avoid ****ing with the biggest gaming faction this time... SURELY...

It's surprising to see even the biggest names in Square-Enix allowing this to happen, given that they felt passing on this project to a new generation wouldn't feel right. Completely understandable... except now it's probably better to let the new generation make things right. The ones who grew up with the game won't be so out of touch like you suits were... of that much I'm absolutely certain.

FF7 Remake is one of the biggest disappointments simply due to missed opportunities and the excessive amount of cutting corners. It is simply unfathomable on how anyone in charge could have okay'ed this mess... unless it was, of course, to milk their die-hard fan base once more.",1663383974,1671290380,False,8,4,0.534323811531066895,0,True,False,False

I really thought I wouldn't be able to play this game on my gtx1060 gaming laptop because my ff15 was a stutter machine. But my hands itched and bought it on sale. To my surprise, this game is smoother than ff15 on my laptop. ofc, I played it on low graphics setting, but my laptop managed it at 1080p, except for the chapter with chopper sounds. I read that the sound of the helicopters really drops the framerate.

I really enjoyed the game wooot! Normal mode is on the harder side tbh. I'm not used to action RPG, but I also read others finding the normal mode kinda hard. Easy is better if you just want to enjoy the game. Normal if you plan to play it on hard mode later on.

Gameplay is good. I think SE really nailed the action+turn based medley in FF7R. The combat is really enjoyable. Sometimes tho, I feel like there's few enemies to battle on and the chapters are focused on travelling and cutscenes rather than having monsters on the way. Sidequests are more okay than recent FFs. I miss puzzle sidequests in final fantasy but the sidequests in ff7R are better than the typical ""hunts"" sidequest in recent final fantasies.

Level design still has the hallway formula. It was supposed to be forgivable because the aesthetics are done well and because there are open areas in the game, but I feel like the stages have very few secrets to uncover. All chests are easy to find and no spots to explore where it would lead. Locked areas will be unlocked via sidequests that are easy to find. But on the contrary it makes the game more focused and streamlined.

Story-wise, should I say this is a ""full game""? Having played FF7 before, playing ff7R sometimes feel like the story is really short and that chapters were just prolonged a lot to extend the story. But all the additions are very welcome, like expanding the characters. From a standpoint of person who hasn't played the OG, maybe the story will still feel complete.

Character design. I don't know who in SE modeled Aerith's face, but that employee deserves a spot in heaven. OMG Aerith is so pretty I think her model was the best model I've seen on a game ever. Plus Briana White is 100% perfection, like she was born to voice Aerith. huhuhuhu

Do I recommend this game? Strong YES! Full price? It will feel a lot worth it if you pay the sale price. But I won't argue if others would find the original price just right, because this is game is overall very good.",1671282405,1671282405,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False
