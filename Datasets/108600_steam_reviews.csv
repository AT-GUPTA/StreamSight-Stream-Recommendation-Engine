Insanely realistic and filled with details, super addictive gameplay, a massive map. Even though there isn't really a goal to do except surviving; there is so many things to do. Only unfortunate part about this game is that developer team is very small and the game has been in early access for around 10 years now, I wish it didn't progress so slow developer-wise but what can you do. Definitely recommended.

Update 2024: This was originally a positive review, but i'm turning this into a negative one now. Here is my reason. This game's build 41 was released in 2021. It has been THREE YEARS since the update was released and the game did not get updated since that. Build 42 was supposed to be small QoL updates and small steps into the NPCs being added to the game. Imagine how long the build 43 would take them, 5 years? 10 more years? This game is clearly abandoned, not being worked on, the money they made isn't being invested back in the game at all. Developers are lazy and don't give a f*ck about the game. I have lost my hope on this game. It gets too dull after a while on it's current state. This was a good experience whatsoever.

It is the best zombie survival game I have ever played but I do not think I can recommend it right now. This game has a lot of potential, but it needs more work.

I love the concept and the gameplay of this game. It is the most immersive and realistic zombie survival game I have ever played. It can keep you hooked for hours as you explore, scavenge, craft, and fight. However, the game also has some major flaws that prevent me from recommending it at the moment. The main issue is the lack of end game content and variety. The game becomes repetitive and boring after a while, unless you create your own challenges and goals. The game needs more features and events to keep the player engaged and motivated.

Another problem is the slow and questionable development. The developers seem to focus on minor and irrelevant aspects, such as primitive survival mechanics, instead of addressing the core issues and demands of the community. The most anticipated feature, the NPCs, has been delayed for too long and there is no clear roadmap or timeline for its release.

look at how many hours i have in this game. its a lot. Its a fun ass game, but its MAJOR issue right now is the development team. I frankly don't know what the fuck they're doing, but they made almost 100 million dollars and are still moving at a snails pace. they are clearly not reinvesting into the development of this game (10 years is an actual joke)

updates take literal years to come out. I remember back in 2021 when build 41 was released. It is now 2024.

I understand game development is difficult, but this is a new tier of laziness. Yes you can get mods to add new content, but the game's code is horribly written so good luck getting them all to work.

Using mods: very well worked mods, visual mods are great, map mods are usually extremely well-worked, perks and such are also well-oriented, download enough mods you become Superman! in which the only thing that can harm you is depression :( 


Playing with friends: I can't say anything forwardly good about it since I invited them to play we played once and they lost interest in the game, probably because I couldn't explain the game well to them and when we played it was for an hour when they died for the first 45 minutes cause I put in the wrong settings and included sprinters. Word of Advice, to play with friends start it off extremely easily and build up from there especially if they are novices.

You're not a invincible bad ass with plot armor who can seemingly survive anything thrown against them. I'm not saying those games are bad. They don't really focus on the weight of the fact that the world has ended, and you must now survive the ever loving hell that is the apocalypse through what you have left. 

Games like Left 4 Dead aren't so much about trying to survive everyday life. They are more focused on killing hordes of the infected and reaching an end goal. Cod Zombies, the opposite end of the spectrum, is killing hordes of zombies but with no end goal for the player except death. Like I said before, these games aren't bad, and I have loved them all throughout my childhood. 

But the difference between those games and Project Zomboid is that you aren't the characters from Left 4 Dead, and you aren't the characters from Cod Zombies who have sustained thousands of zombies without so much of blinking an eye. You are just an everyday person who one day woke up to the end of the world. Now, with the prior knowledge of everyday life before you, you must use this knowledge to better survive against the undead. 

Loot doesn't come easy. Guns are a death wish. Zombies are dangerous no matter how fast or slow they are, and one day YOU WILL DIE. Death is inevitable in this game, and Project Zomboid doesn't shy away from it. It embraces that fact. It doesn't matter the hours you have on this game or not. Death is certain in this apocalypse. The only thing we can do is delay the inevitable...",1708536528,1708536528,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It never feels fair, even though every death is technically avoidable, because the game chooses what you mean by one of it's most vital button prompts, and it is only usually correct, which is not even close to good enough when you're inches from death. This detracts significantly from your ability to control the situation and makes it play a little bit like a rage game.

For an example, imagine you are fighting too many zombies right now, like a good number that you could just barely handle if your guy did what you wanted him to. You're unarmed and don't have any skills, but the situation is very well survivable and you have a reasonable strategy. You will push them to the ground as they approach, see if you can jab them with a pen in the process, but get them on the ground and then stomp one of them at least once when they're all down.

You shove by pressing space (keep that in mind), or whatever button you have bound, and there's a reasonable chance (but no guarantee) that this pushes the zombie over. You then stomp them to kill them (again, no guarantee this works immediately). The reason this controls like a rage game is because the stomp button is also space, but bindings can't fix this because they are literally the same action, they can not be bound separately, and shoving takes precedence not when you're looking at a standing zombie, but whenever a standing zombie is nearby, even a good few feet behind you or off to the side (I'm not exactly certain, please excuse a little imprecision about the technical details, I have only lost maybe 12 runs this way).

This is the exact point where the game transitions from intense moment to complete nonsense which robs you of another character. A zombie is on the ground, another is approaching from the opposite side of you, and you've just turned to the latter zombie in order to gauge it's distance before your next move. You turn around to face the vulnerable zombie, but not all the way, only so far that the stomp will connect. You press the stomp button and. . . and you shove out at open air.

Not at the approaching zombie, and also not at the zombie on the floor. This couldn't have benefited you, and it's not what you were trying to do. This wasn't a wrong decision on your part; you did all you could do by pressing the stomp button. The **STOMP SLASH SHOVE** button. During your retarded flailing, the zombie approaching closes massive distance, and the one on the ground is already getting up (your chance is gone by a wide margin, there is no recovery).

You will continue to fight ineffectively, mimicking this pattern, until someone gets a bite in as the horde inevitably grows from noise throughout the painfully, infuriatingly dragged out conflict. This is pervasive because the game reserves the right to interpret what you mean by the button press, literally not allowing you to make the distinction yourself, but it is always more wrong than you are about what you're trying to do. I can not recommend the game exclusively because the space button performs two very different and mutually exclusive functions at the most critical times in gameplay, and does not allow you to make the distinction yourself, all-too-often ending your run in completely avoidable situations.",1708477633,1708477633,False,0,1,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True

There's no goal other than survival, and you get to choose how you accomplish that.

You can build a fort inside a mall, drive across the state as a nomad, or live a quiet life at home eating your cabbage. There's so much depth while the game itself remains very easy to get into. Not only is the map big and full of towns (which are in turn full of buildings and zombies to explore and fight), there's tons of items, vehicles, and weapons to collect and use, and you can customize your character and the game settings quite extensively. All these tools in the sandbox allow you to play whatever zombie game/movie/media you want. You can go for something slow burn or you can choose to go in guns blazing. If something happens to be missing or you just want [i] more [/i] then there's tons of great mods that you can easily install from the workshop.

That being said, I mostly play custom sandbox.  Playing singleplayer is depressing af (until Indie Stone adds NPCs) but multiplayer is where it's at.  I've probably had some of the wackiest moments with me and the boys in PZ multiplayer.  Coupled with the great modding community?  You're in for a real treat.

Another review down here noted that instead of acting as some sort of enhanced, superpowered entity, you are playing as a regular individual who is stressed-out, panicking, hungry, and tired. You get various advantages to choose from, which must be offset by disadvantages, so that your character ends up being thoroughly balanced. The game mechanics itself may seem simple at first, with the process of killing a zombie not requiring much skill, but there is a fair bit of survival instinct that must be employed if you wish to avoid alerting all the zombies in the area and being quickly overwhelmed.

The survival portion is huge and forces you to stay constantly aware of multiple factors at a time. Breaking into a window can result in broken glass that cuts you, and if that cut goes untreated, can become infected and develop into something much more dangerous. Food can replenish your hunger but stale food can adversely affect your happiness levels. Failing to clean up blood after killing zombies can attract more zombies and result in a horde, and so on. Ultimately, this game is worth the shot as it isn't particularly pricey and its multifaceted nature can keep you up for long periods, especially when playing with friends.",1708387981,1708387981,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,True

I wanted to play this game for a couple of years before buying it and I'm so happy I did. The ability to learn how to use all the systems in the game and enjoy roleplaying appeals to me so much. I would love to see the multiplayer options being improved in the coming years as the UI to access it isn't all that user friendly and the downloading countless mods to try a new server can get pretty boring.

Major Issues:
1. For some fucked up reason modded game saves randomly load without any mods, no warning no anything  and the run is ruined as anything mod related is suddenly deleted/randomized and saved for good measure.
2. You can randomly fall thru roofs,
3. Backing away from a horde close and  along a wall can get you stuck in one place if you are too close to the wall.

Minor issues:
Sometimes you get the animation where you are bitten and the bite is not there. I think the opposite can also happen where you have a bite out of nowhere, but I'm not sure, happened only once, might be just missing it.
Cupboards can overlay in corners

Extra information. you can use mods for playing and it multiplies the addiction you‚Äôll have to this game, you can LITERALLY add everything you can imagine to this game, so if you get bored by playing the content of the vanilla game, you can add community content and you‚Äôll never want to stand up from your chair and go play outside with the other kids that will make you bullying for being a project zomboid addicted, then, your parents are gonna throw you out from your house and make you find a job, your life is gonna be trash because playing project zomboid for hours, your gf is gonna abandon you for another guy because you didn‚Äôt pay attention to her because you were playing project zomboid day and night without stopping and then you‚Äôll want to get her back again but she‚Äôs gonna say to you that you‚Äôre just trash and you‚Äôll enter in a depression where the only thing you‚Äôre gonna want is to finish all the pain that you‚Äôre feeling and then you‚Äôre going to start working on yourself and when you start thinking that everything is okay you‚Äôll be working on your computer and then you‚Äôll see project zomboid, and you‚Äôre gonna say ‚Äúwhy not to play again‚Äù that will be your worst mistake, your wife is gonna dump you up, she will break your heart into pieces because your addiction to project zomboid is gonna make you ignore everything, she will take you to judgment and because you‚Äôre a looser that just know how to play project zomboid she is gonna win the custody of the kids, you will miss Samuel and Carlos but she won‚Äôt let you see them, then you‚Äôll ask your parents for money because Maria left you without anything and they will tell you that they would be so happy if you‚Äôve never been born, Maria please let me see the child again, they are my kids too, I won‚Äôt play that game again I promise, I just wanna be around you again",1708316516,1708316516,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

You're meant to die, over and over until you learn your character limits, the gameplay mechanics, and environmental factors that keep you alive and safe.  Don't let the simple looking graphics fool you.  The world is enormous and the map, homes and points of interest are painstakingly detailed.

My best advice for new players that quickly get overwhelmed, start your next game in ""sandbox"" mode, and scale down the difficulty while you learn the ins & outs.  Its your sandbox to decide what is fun and what isn't.

Yet, on the other hand, small UI and gameplay features take me out of the game as strongly as its best features suck me in. 

Long story short, Steam could really use a mixed recommendation between ""yes"" and ""no.""

My main issues rely on combat, with melee being a bit finicky at times, though isn't something which is too hard to adapt to. Guns are another issue, however, which are darn near unplayable without high skills and/or mods. I feel that the movement penalty is a bit harsh at times, and that close quarters gunplay is far more inaccurate than it should be regardless of skill. I can understand it from a balance perspective, but it's still annoying.

My last issue lies with the moodles, most of which I love but some feel really intrusive and out of place. Depression and boredom just feel kinda stupid considering the circumstances, like I have far bigger issues than to be bored. Panic also annoys me, as it often pops up when I as a player feel none, breaking my sense of immersion. It's hard to line these up with how a player feels, but having them feel so out of place is a genuine annoyance, especially considering they debuff my character.

As I said, I love the game and will continue playing it, but its hard to recommend for others when considerable modding and configuration may need to be done to compensate for some of the flawed mechanics.",1707778521,1708275176,False,3,3,0.483171701431274414,0,True,False,True

Project Zomboid isn't just a game; it's an immersive journey into the heart of survival horror. From the moment you step into its post-apocalyptic world, every decision matters. The atmosphere is tense, the stakes are high, and the undead hordes are relentless.

What sets Project Zomboid apart is its unforgiving realism. You're not a superhero here; you're an ordinary person trying to survive against insurmountable odds. Every action, from scavenging for supplies to fortifying your hideout, requires careful planning and resource management. One wrong move, and it could be your last.

The game's sandbox nature means that no two playthroughs are ever the same. Whether you're hunkering down in a remote farmhouse or braving the streets of a zombie-infested city, every decision you make shapes your story. And with the addition of multiplayer, you can team up with friends to increase your chances of survival or betray them in the pursuit of your own goals.

But perhaps the most impressive aspect of Project Zomboid is its commitment to realism. The game doesn't hold your hand or pull any punches. You'll need to contend with hunger, thirst, sickness, and mental health issues, all while fending off the undead and other survivors. It's a brutal, unforgiving world, but one that rewards ingenuity and perseverance.

In conclusion, Project Zomboid is a true survival horror masterpiece. With its deep gameplay, immersive atmosphere, and relentless challenge, it's a must-play for any fan of the genre. Just remember: in the world of Project Zomboid, death is always just around the corner.",1643215270,1708248238,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

You are going to die. Each death is a lesson learned. You must be careful with every decision.

When you die, you lose that character- stats and all- and start anew. However, the world/map is persistent. You start over in the same map from a random location. Your new character can stumble upon your old base and supplies- even your old characters groaning-zombie body.

There is a mode in this game where you can customize absolutely every aspect of your experience. If you like The Walking Dead and slow moving zombies (but numerous), customize the game and zombies to resemble that universe. If you like 28 Days Later where the zombies come at you full sprint, customize the game and zombies to resemble that universe. 
In this way, between customization and realism this is easily the greatest z-game ever made.

The absolute freedom you have in setting up a base anywhere is rather neat. 53 hours in and I haven't made it past day 10...

I love the experience of looting neighborhoods, scavenging restaurants, grocery stores in all the freedom you have to literally do whatever you want. I think my favorite thing is that you can change almost any setting to make the experience you want to have. I have the zombies being shamblers only, the infection only spreading through bites and it can still be overwhelming at times. The learning curve is rather steep but when you learn, you can really feel an actual difference in your skill. It might take a few deaths, but eventually you will be capable on handling more than 1 zombie at once. 

I tend to start over entirely when I die, taking what I learned from my past life to hopefully last longer. I am currently in a multiplayer server with a buddy and it is the most fun I have had in a game in a long while. I love how incredibly dangerous everything is. I still play fully vanilla and honestly need to try mods; however, I genuinely enjoy the vanilla experience. 

I have seen that the devs are VERY slow to release updates but I am going to have a little faith in them. What this game is right now is nothing short of brilliant, artistic, and an absolute blast.

Best and different zombie survival game there is now. 
Still having fun - while waiting for updates.

- Survive for a while.
- Get lost into a forest.
- Eat worms and other delicacies.
- Find a house. Survive for a night.
- Try to find your HQ house.
- Found HQ behind couple of trees near the temporary house - around 100 meters away.
- Enjoy some scarce water from the toilet.
- Get suddenly cocky.
- Decide not to go to forest - decide to go to loot town next day.
- Do not bother look out from the window.
- Walk into arms of horde, which surrounded your HQ last night - and die.
- Good game.",1629907543,1708094665,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

This game is not just a survival horror; it's a crash course in post-apocalyptic life management, with a minor in carpentry and a specialization in culinary arts (because who doesn't want to master the art of making a stir-fry during a zombie apocalypse?).

From the get-go, Project Zomboid sets the tone: ""This is how you died."" Well, excuse me for my optimism, but after my 47th death, I began to think of it more as ""This is how you learned to barricade a window with a fridge."" The game's commitment to realism is admirable, if not slightly concerning. Ever wanted to learn how to disinfect a rag with whiskey? Project Zomboid has got you covered. Need to figure out how to hotwire a car while being chased by a horde of the undead? There's a skill book for that.

The game's open-world, combined with its intricate crafting and building systems, makes for an experience where every playthrough feels unique. One day you're a fisherman, living off the land and sea, peacefully coexisting with nature. The next, you're a katana-wielding, bear-trap-laying madman, screaming into the night as you're overrun by zombies because you forgot to turn off the oven.

But it's not just about surviving the zombies; it's about surviving boredom, loneliness, and the gradual decline of your character's mental health. The game's depth in simulating life (or what's left of it) post-apocalypse is both its charm and its curse. Watching your character develop a fear of the dark because you made them read too many books at night without a light is both hilarious and heartbreakingly realistic.

Project Zomboid teaches you valuable lessons, like how not to get attached to anything, especially your base, your supplies, or, well, your life. It's a constant reminder that no matter how fortified your fortress is, it only takes one overlooked back window for your cozy safehouse to turn into an all-you-can-eat buffet for zombies.

In conclusion, Project Zomboid is a masterclass in survival horror, blending meticulous detail with dark humor. It's a game where your most memorable moments will come from the smallest victories and the silliest deaths. Whether it's accidentally drinking bleach instead of water or heroically dying while trying to save your crops from a horde, Project Zomboid is a game that keeps on giving. 10/10, would accidentally set myself on fire trying to cook a rat again.",1708081469,1708081469,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Nearly every number within the game is customisable, and the player is thrown into a story of how they die. But they can survive, farm, build, mod and customise all the events of that story. Very replayable, because it is so open ended that you set your goals. The style and the little humorous details bring a sort of arcade feel to an otherwise very depressing, brutal and bleak characters life, making slaying undead a good bit of fun. 

Game is STILL in early access, so the only problem (personally) is that the game isn't quite finished yet!

You can find yourself doing almost anything you'd imagine doing in the real world.
Playing alone can get boring, but with people it is all the hype.
There is so much you can do, such as you can build and barricade your own base,
you can unite with people to go on scaveging runs, fight zombies & create epic stories,
roleplay, auto-service vehicles & challenge yourself with different restrictions to your gameplay, as you can arrange your playthrough just the way you would like to, and not to mention all of the other many, many things you can do in this wonderful game such as cook, tailor, collect, forage & fish. It is the most realistic zombie game i have ever played, and truly my all-time favorite. With this huge, vast open map, there is basically infinite replayability. All of these mods... They just make the experience even better.
in conclusion, i would totally recommend this game for anybody interested in the most realistic and most fun, open zombie survival experience.",1677320884,1707931125,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

You can get in any building you see in this massive open world. You can loot every cabinet, and every surface. Build so many structures and plant so many things to help you survive. If you die, you can find the spot you set up and start all over again.

I understand if this game feels unforgiving at first. Though the more you play the better you will get at everything. You will eventually be able to take on larger and larger hoards of zombies. smash through them with cars (If you have the keys, or gas or I assume with enough skill the ability to hotwire). 

This game takes so much into consideration. If you smash a window it will make noise and alert zombies. If you climb in through that window you will get cut if you don't clear the glass. You get tired if you don't rest. You will get hungry if you don't eat, and if you are munched on by the hoard, you will come back to life as just one more zombie you will have to deal with.

There aren't currently any goals or missions in this game except survive and kill as many zombies as you can in one life. I think I survived for over a day and only killed a max of 21 zombies in that time. However, I play super aggressively and tend to stumble on enemies and don't rest enough.

Almost anything can become a weapon. Got a pen? Guess what, you can stab zombies with it. You can also use it to mark your map. It's not the best weapon, its not mightier than a sword in this instance. You can however, finds loads of different weapons that are more effective and need to be maintained to function over time, but be warned... GUNS attract LOTS of zombies.  

Like I said. Get this game. YOU WILL LOVE IT! YOU WILL HATE IT! But more than anything, YOU WILL DIE. It just depends on when and how.

I will start by saying that I like the aesthetic of a retro 90s style. It is very appealing and takes me back to the time of AoE 1 and 2.

I find that the hunger system is a bit janky, as your character will become hunger every five minutes, and thirsty every ten minutes.

Playing on controller feels like a chore, rather than, an enjoyable experience (yes I am playing it on PC, but through my 4K TV, so I cannot focus on the TV while fiddling with the keyboard).

I've been a big fan for a long time, but sadly, I cannot recommend this game. 

Why? 

Because its built on a throne of lies. 

What are the lies? 

That this is the most amazing immersive zombie survival game on the market. 

I'll keep it short and simple:

The early game is 10/10. 
All the people who review this, giving this positive reviews, are people who have only played the early game. 

They haven't reached the mid-end game, where there is LITERALLY NOTHING TO DO. 

LITERALLY, it becomes ""Sit around and grow crops and do nothing simulator"". 

The sycophantic community that supports this game, are people that haven't played the game long enough to understand the *severe lack of mid-end game content*. 

They started off so strong and you could tell the passion was there when they started. But it seems like moneys just rusted the gears of progress and they just don't care anymore and they're just throwing in some token effort to create the illusion that this game is still getting worked on when in reality its not getting the love it deserves.

When I first bought this game, I didn't mind that this was a fact, I understood, its early access and that more features would surely come in due time. 

That was 11+ years ago. 

What have they added since then thats been significant?

Two things: Vehicles and... multiplayer, which the VAST MAJORITY of players do not even care for. 

I made these complaints, after 11 years of supporting this game, in the forums. 

The main mod, Mad Dan, decided that my criticisms were verboten, and banned me from the forums because I was ""asking for it"". 

Cool story dude, is what what you say about sexual abuse survivors too? 

All I did was give *very fair criticism* of the state of the game after 11 years. 

And that is enough to get you banned if you dare tell the mods ""You do it for free"". 

Try Cataclysm: Bright Nights, which is completely free and is everything zomboid was trying to be and do better, and has now, after 11 years, failed miserably at except with the graphics part.

Catalysm is superior in every way if you're willing to look past the graphics and turned based nature.

Edit: As it turns out, I'm not the only person whose been banned from the forums for criticizing the game. 

Other people have messaged me after reading this review to tell me the same fate happened to them when they asked questions and criticized the game. 

As it turns out, the community does not like it when you point out the flaws of this game, and will screech and ree at you for doing so until Mad Dan decides you are now voted off the island. 

Stay away from this toxic and sad community unless its to troll them about ""11 years and still no NPC's.""

Edit 2:

Lets turn this into a speed run to see how long it takes to get you banned by pointing it out. 
That's about as much fun as you can have once the glow of early game zomboid wears off.

Here's a list of things you can do to get banned from the forums-

How to speed run getting banned from Project Zomboid:

Talk/ask about future builds.

Point out the fact there is no mid-end game content. 

Point out the fact that hardly anyone plays this game for the multiplayer and that the multiplayer is poorly done and that mods break it. 

Point out the modding community is the only thing keeping this game alive.

Point out the hundreds of mods that make the game significantly better that are still lore friendly that have basically been given the devs for free which they refuse to implement.

Point out that NPC's are the #1 requested feature for the last 11 years and they still haven't implemented them.

Point out that the mods for NPC's kill your FPS because there is no optimised framework that allows for NPC's.

Point out that most of the skills are useless. (When will you ever use first aid? Hint: You don't.)

Point out there is only one skill that matters and thats the ability to hotwire cars and you've pretty much hit ""end game"" if you can do this since cars are OP and you can basically live out of them. 

Once you get banned from the forums, you can still continue to message MadDan on the subject you got banned on if you go to the bottom which allows for comments that go straight to MadDan now and remind him that he does it for free.

This game for me is one of the best or if not the best zombie games out there. When I first heard of this game it was from a french friend that barely spoke any english and I bought it to play with him, I play it with him for a while rage quit like a little baby and dont touch it for months.
Then I eventually was scrolling through my steam library looking for a game to play and decided to play it and let me tell you this game will hook you in and you cant get out.

The gameplay in this game is the best out of all the other zombie games I played and thats saying a lot since ive been in the zombie game scene for a while and have played many of them and this one specifically has stuck out for me as the ultimate jack of all trades one. Everything from the weather, combat, building, and hell even grinding for skills is just fucking fun.

I really find this game enhanced when you start to implement mods in your playthroughs it just adds lots of more gameplay possibilities to the game to a already chock full game, some mods make the game way harder than it should be and for a masochist like me it really makes the game fresh such as one mod that makes the fog toxic.

Some people put this game down for the grapics and I really dont agree with it, I think the graphics simply improve the game because its a decently indepth game by itself, take rimworld for example, that game has a injury system but the injurys or bandages dont show on the modles even though its 2d but it does in zomboid. And I really find that the graphics are friendly for lower end PC users that have problems running higher end games

The gameplay loop is almost limitless due to character builds in multiplayer, since in character creation you have to balance positive and negative traits it adds a new depth of difficulty to this already pretty hard game.

The multiplayer in this game is what really hooked me in and kept me playing, the interactions with other players wheather it be surviving or riddling someone else with bullets its always fun no matter the day, combined with the nice community that will help you out with the game its just all in all friendly.

Difficulty in this game to describe it the best i can is easy to learn hard to master, Newer players will have a hard time understanding PVP and it can take over 500 or 1000 hours to fully master but oh so its ever worth it, The other mechanics is also pretty easy to learn for a begginer such as first aid and bandaging wounds, its just slap a bandaid on it or if its a deep wound just stich it up.

I would say the atmosphere in this game is also excellent, in my own personnel experiance I havent seen much zombie games set in kentucky, and at first i didnt like it when i first started but I love it now, when you enhance the game with map mods it gets even better such as map mods like ""Raven creek"" or ""Eeerie county"" You can really mod the hell out of this game to make it for you, Want to make it into a stalker type survival simulator? you can do that!, want to have a 10 years later survival story with over grown buildings? you can do that aswell. 

This game is truely limitless and even if you dont think you would like this game I beg you to give it a chance because you wont regret it and you will love it, and well if you dont you can flay me alive in my steam comments for all i care and I will still stick by my word that this is the best zombie survival game out there.

It's pixelated, and at times quite bueatiful. However, it has it's fair share of bugs, which is to be expected from a game like this, but none are game breaking or anything like that. But I have to say, I have NEVER been this into a zombie game before, which is shocking becuase I adore zombie games.  Now To start the Pros and Cons:

Pros: The game is incredibly immersive, with one huge overworld. While there are multiple starting points, they are all on the same map. The base building is quite enteraining, if not a little confusing. It took me a few playthroughs to understand it in full, but once you get it, it's really rewarding to build up your base. And if thats not enough, it has multiplayer servers, some of which are simply for roleplay. It's crafting system is diverse, and its zombie AI is quite good.

Cons: It's very much a ""niche"" game, something enjoyed in small bursts usually. It is also buggy at times, but that is to be expected from a game that is constantly being updated, and who's creators are decicated to the project. Just be warned though, there IS a learning curve with this game, and it can be difficult at times. Also the combat can be a bit.. wonky.

All that being said, I feel compelled to give this game a 7/10. It's an incredible game, and worth your time and money.


***MASSIVE UPDATE, writing this nearly 7 years later.

This game is a 11/10 now, the best zombie game I have ever played and ever will play. I don't just recommend it, you *need* this game. Do you like the sims? Do you like the walking dead?

In this game you can play solo and experience what it is like to be the sole survivor of a zombie apocalypse knowing that no one is coming to save you and that you will have to find a way to provide for your nutritional needs, or you can play with your friends to form groups and increase your chances of survival. 

This game has a little bit of everything for whatever type of play you want.
-Want to be a mechanic? Take parts off a car and repair them with your metalworking skill or find other cars to part out.
-Want to build bases? You can level up your carpentry and make post apocalyptic bases or design the house of your dreams that you cant afford in real life. 
-Want to be a vagabond? Find a car with a key/ hot-wire one and roam town to town gathering what you need to survive.

I will admit that the game has a steep learning curve and that when I first played I stopped after dying 3 times with-in the first 2 hours but if you are struggling you can take a break and watch some tips and tricks videos on YouTube and get back in that saddle ready to go.

You'll eventually die to nonsense even if you're a good player, such as doors on a car not shutting but there is no animation to warn you *shakes fist at sky*.

So ultimately the game is a test of how long you can be alone. While there is multiplayer, that format has issues which can be just as challenging to get over as the loneliness in single player such as desync (screen will turn black and freeze until things load) and zombie count limitations.

When you decide to buy or not buy this game, completely ignore any promises from the developers on what is coming ""soon."" There is no soon, as they have decided to take as long as they want to develop their game. That is their prerogative, but as a consumer you should be informed on what that means. They have been promising animals and npcs for 10 years. TEN YEARS. The title of the game is ""project"" for a reason and it is never going to leave early access. NEVER. I've lost confidence in the studio's ability to ever be able to overhaul their existing code (imagine working on the same code for over a decade and NOT having it become spaghetti). Just on the basis that every UI in the game is different it should be obvious to everyone they don't have a solid code base.

So if you want to challenge yourself for a few hundred hours solo or forever in modded multiplayer, know that these have their limitations and there is no update coming from the developers in a realistic time period to address those issues. Play the game for what it is today with its faults, or don't. Just don't fall for the upcoming content unless you plan on watching your grandchildren play some day from a rocking chair.",1707661178,1707661333,True,1,0,0.511111140251159668,0,True,False,True

Most survival games that I've played, even ones with consistent elements of danger, have felt like chore simulators. Project Zomboid's implementation of survival mechanics is something else entirely, however. The slow shamblers of Romero films, which Zomboid's default settings are based on, are the ultimate persistence hunters. Here, the survival aspects enhance this. They aren't just a chore. They're what makes the game worth coming back to.

The game has an incredible number of customization options, and that's before taking user created mods into consideration. 

It's also incredibly in depth. Let me give you an example:
My current character is living out of his car - The back seats are filled with canned food, ammunition for his guns, books on survival basics and more. Last night he pulled into what I thought was a middle of nowhere gas station on the back roads of Kentucky. It was getting late, he needed to refill his water bottles, refuel his car, and maybe find something to eat in the gas station before finding somewhere to get some sleep. There was one or two zombies lurking outside the station, but - no biggie, I figured he'd just quickly pop them with his rifle and be on his way. Shouldn't be too many out there.

If I'd driven just a little bit further down the road, I'd have seen the larger parking lot of a nearby diner, the street that turned into a tightly packed cul-de-sac. Two shots rang out, the gas station's pumps began to hum to life as he started refueling his car... And a horde lurched around the fence into view. He hopped in his car and sped off, dead limbs catching in the wheel well and nearly grinding them to a halt. One of the headlights went out from the impact, the other had a dead bulb from before he ever found the car. The sun was setting, it was getting dark, and speeding off down the road he slammed into a tree.

The engine won't turn over now, his wrist is broken - so even if he's a crack shot with a rifle it won't be much use for him. He's got one bottle of water left, and nothing he might need to start repairing his engine. It's going to be a long walk back to town in the morning, a town I know now is swarming with zombies, and just in the hopes of finding some basic supplies alongside, hopefully, a wrench, a book on mechanics, and maybe a vhs tape that will cover the basics of car repair.

There are other survival games out there. I've tried a lot of them, even if survival games aren't my bag - because I've been looking for the authentic zombie apocalypse experience. None of them come close to the kind of considerations and decision making that come up in Project Zomboid.
Is it worth 20$? Definitely. Honestly, even in early access I think it's already well worth more.",1707621555,1707621555,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

If you don't enjoy learning and getting better through innumerable times of starting over and retrying, this game is not for you. You will struggle. You will die. You will be rewarded knowledge through each death. Sometimes the same death, but you may learn a different thing.

If you are used to using a controller, this game is going to be hard, but it is worth the slog of dying over and over to finally survive a day, then two days, and eventually maybe even a week.

What would you do in the zombie apocalypse? Many survival games try to let you answer this question, but they often end up so restrictive. Even in an open world, there‚Äôs a certain way to survive that the game will lead you towards.

The mechanics in those games feel so unsubtle, and there are normally one or two main systems everything else revolves around that you have to engage with.

Project Zomboid, with it‚Äôs sheer volume and depth of systems, avoids this railroading. It‚Äôs actually jarring when you first start playing, because you‚Äôre approaching it like it‚Äôs a video game. You leave your house expecting to find a gun right away like every other game.

You expect the game to throw you a bone, you expect that railroad to appear and lead you to the primary few mechanics that is the focus of the game.

And expecting this, you‚Äôre going to die. And it‚Äôs going to feel weird. What did I do wrong? Where are the mechanics? What I‚Äôm I supposed to do?

What would you do in the zombie apocalypse?

Draw your curtains. Take inventory of what you have in your house. Take peeks out the window or watch the news for information. Start thinking about food and water. Make a plan.

Stop treating this game like it‚Äôs a game, and you‚Äôll hit your stride.

And the modding community, man. I can play this game vanilla and completely modded and have an amazing and unique experience every time.

Tried playing and def think a lot of people would say ... this is how i died  ""the funky movement system"". The w key being an ""up"" key instead of forward and the s key being a ""down"" key instead of backwards is archaic and was when the game was created I can't even remember the last game I played with it.  Using the left/right keys in conjunction with the up/down doesn't actually move you the way it should. I could probably get used to it after many many hours of play but since if u play 2 hrs u can't get a refund I stopped after running the tutorial and just trying 2 starts (the first house was surrounded by zombies even though I was in the build mode). I might give it a try again sometime in the future when I have the patience to unlearn the ingrained movement learned though years of MMO's but cant recommend it right now.

I have continued to watch numerous how to videos and still think I will give it a try again when I have the time to try and unlearn years of normal game movement However one of the vids I recently saw had an item discovered that I realized it was the first time I had ever seen someone score that item.  the lack of the item in every house clearly shows the developers have no clue of the basics of life in the USA .... since the devs website says they are in London not having this item in every house would be like setting the Knox event in the UK and no houses have any...... tea.... What is the item you say ..... well you can find peanut butter, mayo, jelly, butter, cheese galore and tons of Beef but to change up a well known Wendy's commercial

""Wheres the Bread""

Not only would bread get you to stretch many of the above food products but just think of the noodle happiness bonuses from a nice grilled cheese sandwich.

Another item that shows the devs lack of knowledge is TV .... in 1993 when the Knox event takes place it should be noted that ""At the start of 1993, 98 percent of American households owned at least one TV set, with 64 percent owning two or more"" yet you will find house after house in game w/o a TV.",1698896182,1707451165,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True

-Best to play with other people (as there are no NPC yet), join a friendly pve server if your new, most players are very helpful getting you up to speed.

After letting pot brew, so to speak, Project Zomboid has grown into a beautifully in-depth game that you'll likely not see in any other game. Whilst many games will allow you to ""weave your own story"", PZ does this in such a unique and punishing way. I've never played a game before where my every decision can sometimes mean the difference between life an death. What you eat, what you wear, where you go, how you get there and what you do all lead into a narrative of your vs nature vs zombies. Eat the wrong food, enter the wrong building and your game could be doomed. You traits add strengths and weakness, but your decisions are ultimate the key to survival. Whilst the zombies might be the threat, bad decision making is ultimately what will kill you.

Los muertos caminaban entre los vivos, y la sociedad colaps√≥ en cuesti√≥n de semanas. T√∫, un superviviente valiente, te encontrabas en la ciudad de Muldraugh, tratando desesperadamente de mantenerte con vida en medio del apocalipsis zombi.

Tu refugio era una modesta casa en las afueras de la ciudad, donde hab√≠as logrado fortificar las ventanas y las puertas lo mejor que pudiste. Los d√≠as se suced√≠an en una rutina interminable de b√∫squeda de suministros, enfrentamientos con zombis y noches ansiosas esperando que el amanecer trajera un poco de seguridad moment√°nea.

Un d√≠a, mientras explorabas una tienda abandonada en busca de comida, encontraste un diario entre los restos de la civilizaci√≥n perdida. Al hojear sus p√°ginas, te diste cuenta de que era tu diario personal de hace m√°s de 20 a√±os. Las palabras escritas a mano te recordaban los momentos antes del brote zombi, las personas que hab√≠as perdido y los sacrificios que hab√≠as hecho para sobrevivir.

La revelaci√≥n fue abrumadora. Te diste cuenta de que el diario estaba lleno de recuerdos que hab√≠as olvidado, eventos traum√°ticos que hab√≠an quedado enterrados en lo m√°s profundo de tu mente para protegerte de la tristeza abrumadora. Con l√°grimas en los ojos, continuaste leyendo, y descubriste que, seg√∫n las √∫ltimas p√°ginas, hab√≠as decidido regresar a tu hogar original para enfrentar tu destino.

Siguiendo las pistas dejadas en tu propio diario, regresaste a la casa donde una vez viviste antes del brote. La estructura estaba desgastada, las tablas en las ventanas ahora eran viejas y carcomidas. Al entrar, el hedor inconfundible del deterioro llenaba el aire. Entre los escombros y los restos de muebles desmoronados, encontraste una puerta cerrada con fuerza.

Con temor en el coraz√≥n, abriste la puerta y te encontraste contigo mismo, pero no en el estado que recordabas. Yac√≠as en una cama, los huesos y la piel descompuestos, vestido con la ropa que llevabas cuando todo se desmoron√≥. Era tu cad√°ver, una versi√≥n de ti mismo que nunca esperaste encontrar.

La tristeza te envolvi√≥ mientras enfrentabas la realidad de tu propio destino. Hab√≠as vuelto a casa para descubrir que la √∫ltima p√°gina de tu diario no contaba con detalle c√≥mo morir√≠as. Sentiste una mezcla de nostalgia y angustia al ver tu propio cad√°ver, recordando los momentos felices que una vez viviste en esa casa antes de que el mundo se sumiera en la oscuridad.

Te quedaste all√≠, en silencio, lamentando lo que una vez fuiste y lo que hab√≠as perdido. El juego de Project Zomboid hab√≠a conservado no solo la lucha por la supervivencia, sino tambi√©n la tragedia personal de encontrarte cara a cara con tu propio final.",1695381224,1707129522,True,0,0,0,0,True,True,True

it seems they only want to deal with CMD and CMD is just something as a group we are not interested in its just something that we have moved away form sense its no longer a necessity for steam server hosting.

steam offers the server hosting tool set option and provides it to developer replace the CMD stuff so players do not have to type in commands in a dos interface all player has to do is hit install tool set and launch and your good to go, it is just a nice update to how hosting works with steam big improvement and its shame that its seems to be getting dropped for support by developer. 

sense reply is not to use it any more by developer.

sure might not be issue for every one but as we get older it gets harder remember all cmd stuff for all games some of us are in our 40 to 60s we have a guy who is 68 and its just to hard for him remember all that cmd typing stuff so download and install and play just works easier for him.

I wrote a review about 7 Days to Die saying that the reason I love that game is because I like to daydream about what I would do if the shit hit the fan, looking at stores and places and thinking ""yeah I could reinforce that wall, put some crop plots there"" and this game does exactly that!  

With the ability to create a character and to do almost what you would be able to do in the real world, this game takes it up to the next level when it comes to immersion.  Sneaking around zombies, luring them into a garage with an egg timer and then slamming the garage door shut so you can loot the house.  Breaking into an ambulance and turning the siren on to attract a horde from a building you wanna loot.  The list goes on and on.

With some game/server settings you can turn off loot and zombie re-spawn meaning EVERYTHING in the game will be finite and the the dead stay dead.

Long story short, if you want a simulation of the end of the world. Buy this game!",1707049878,1707049878,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

the grind is more enjoyable with recovery journal mod, makes grinding xp better.

In Project Zomboid, you'll learn valuable life skills like foraging for food, crafting makeshift weapons, and running for your life like there's no tomorrow - because, well, there might not be. Forget about fancy superpowers; your main superpower here is not becoming a zombie's next meal.

The game's tagline should be ""Expect the Unexpected."" Just when you think you've found a safe place to rest, a zombie horde crashes your party. And let's not even get started on the joys of accidentally setting yourself on fire while cooking a meal. It's the little surprises that keep you on your toes, right?

If you think surviving alone is tough, try teaming up with friends. Suddenly, your survival strategy goes from ""sneak around quietly"" to ""who can make the most noise and attract the most zombies?"" It's like a sitcom, but with more groaning and less laughter.

Project Zomboid is a refreshing take on the zombie apocalypse genre. It's equal parts challenging and hilarious, and it'll make you rethink your zombie survival plan (you did have one, right?). So, grab your baseball bat, stock up on canned beans, and get ready to laugh, cry, and possibly scream a little, because the undead are coming, and they're not here for a friendly chat.",1706942591,1706942591,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I dislike that it remains hidden behind the defense of Early Access, but that's not -entirely- the developer's fault. Devs are still updating regularly and I commend them for that. Steam doesn't have a classification for 'Perpetual Development'. I don't think Early Access is the solution. The game is 'done' enough to be released. I don't think waiting for the devs to pass away is a good measure of when to end Early Access.

Zomboid basically a super-granule version of The Sims with zombies. Is the game worth playing? Yes. Is it difficult with a steep learning curve? Yeah, fine. You know you were signing up for that, so whatever.

Okay, so why the downvote?

There's an 'Extra Credits' Youtube episode (back when it was good) called ""Depth vs Complexity"", which outlines design philosophy of how many working parts a game has (complexity) versus how those mechanics meaningfully affect your gameplay (depth). I'm introducing third variable into this equation that I'll name ""Elegance"", or how accessible the mechanics are to meaningfully affect your gameplay. Elegance often ends up being the effective ratio of Complexity/Depth; complex, inelegant games stop being accessible, and thus player engagement falls off as the granularity turns into a hamster wheel/skinner box.

Example: In this game, it has dropdown menus over canned food items that allows you to open the cans, but what actually happens the game will search your vicinity for a nearby can opener, then place the can in your inventory so you can handle it, pick it up, open the can, and the place the can opener BACK where you got so you don't lug it around needlessly. This is an elegant mechanic! It has a lot of working mechanics unseen to the player, which we we ultimately don't care about; we wanted the damn can opened. Now it's open, and the interaction felt natural (and elegant), although the can should probably say ""needs a can opener."" to make things even more straightforward.

-This game is complex. Maybe not Europa Universalus, but complex.
-This game is also... fairly deep. It's no Terraria, but it has multiple levels of divergent strategy and progress breakpoints (when you game progress allows you to access enough returns to move forward.
-This game is NOT elegant on the whole. I spend too much time looking at wikis for basic mechanics. 

As I age, I find myself less and less concerned about complexity and more concerned with depth+elegance. my frail hands strain under the burden of needless, repetitive clicks. I'm running out of them, and eventually I will have none left; such is life. How I spend those clicks is important to me. This game may is working its way towards elegance, but its lacking enough that I'm not enthusiastic to give it an upvote.

I think the biggest issues is that there's a lack of design talent. No offense, Devs, but you haven't figure out how to combine resting with sitting on a couch while reading a book. You can't burn broken stick weapons. dozens of simple item interactions such as attaching a utensil to a stick have been listed crafting recipes, needlessly cluttering the crafting panels. Most of these item interactions could be relegated to tooltips. The foraging panel could be consolidated into a single button/keystroke that looks like an eye, instead we get a clunky panel that takes up precious screen space, where screen space is the bread and butter required to navigate the game's extremely punitive ""get bit once and die"" premise. There's thousands of these itemized issues that makes a player go ""WTF were they thinking?"" The entire experience doesn't feel ""lived in"". It sometimes get glimpses of it, but it doesn't happen often enough. I feel like large portions of this could be addressed simply by slowing down the passage of time, but the devs seem insistent that walking down the street take an hour.

It's honestly kinda laughable sometimes. It seems like this game was built to do a bunch of very specific simulation things, and focus on granularity has caused the devs to, ya know, forget they were developing a game? Or maybe they don't know how, small development teams sometimes get caught up in their own design habits; it's easy to get lost in programming weeds.

Why is the systemic functions of this game so stilted and messy? We have games with very elegant crafting system. How did the devs take so few lessons from games like Valheim, Subnautica, Terraria, Stardew? Hell, STATE OF DECAY. This game is close! It's SO close!

Devs, take a BEAT. In EVERY ACTION a player takes! What is IMPORTANT?

Better yet, what's fun? The game is relatively lifeless in content; it lacks a soul. I know the devs axed story mode and maybe they had good reasons for that (I didn't play it), but this game would be so much more interesting with NPCs, factions, trade hubs. This game seems to have a strict adherence for zombie apocalypse realism, but has completely neglected that statement is an oxymoron. I spend more time acting as a doordash deliverer than I do exploring the world, and for the most part, there's not that much to discover. Game-reward-player-who-good-at-find/manage-junk-with-more-junk.

And NO, don't tell me to go download mods, make a GAME. Take a queue from Neo Scavenger and it's living world. Shouldn't I find ""The Lab"" or ""the Lair?"" shouldn't I have events that exceed an annoying helicopter (who's sole purpose is to wreck my first run)? I hope someday they add something like that, because as it is currently, the game forces you to either be enamored with it indefinitely or part on bad terms. When I die, I just feel shitty and like I've wasted my time. In my opinion, that's myopic in scope, if not a flat-out design mistake.

That all being said, they've pulled in top modders as Dev, and that's actually super good faith (and rare) development. But devs, please! Stop relying on modders to make your game make sense. Work on making an interface that feels as natural as a player intent. When given the choice between more options and clear options, choose the latter. Only expand the features of your game if elegance is the result of that added complexity. Push those features towards game content, rather than a perfectly simulated 1990 earth. If you're worried about them being disruptive to your current pacing, place these events far away from spawn zones so players can engage with them on their own terms.

Lastly (less importantly because mods can get around it), the developers have insistent that this game be played in ironman mode only. I can't condone this. The era of accessibility only through 'git good' in a f***ing single player game, a BUILDER no less, is silly. The game has an auto-save feature, you the player are just not allowed to control it. Is losing a 60-hour playthrough to an RNG sounding like fun to you? No? Then don't buy this game.

Devs, all you have to do is make ironman mode optional. Do that, this becomes an upvote. The only people who think that this bad design choice is 'better content' are elitist a**holes, and the rest are lost sales. I'm okay with you losing sales over this. Let us play the damn game the way we want (there is a mod where you can save your character but not your game. I don't consider this to be a comparable implementation to an ironman option).

To prospective buyers: If the above statement DOESN'T bug you, the game is ready to go and worth your time. You can modify the game liberally to your playstyle. The first 12 hours of play is going to be you tearing your hair out. It's supposed to be like that. Read some guides and try again.

Keeping the player-base informed with weekly updates on how their next major update is coming along is a wonderful thing and more developers should do it.

The gameplay is a teeny bit clunky, BUT that's kinda inevitable with any isometric mouse+keyboard game. Using a controller for movement+combat and using the mouse for going through menus works best!

Final note: do not play this game with the expectation of ""winning"" there is no ending, the undead hordes (who are fully customizeable i might add!) will eventually rip you to shreds, its just a matter of how long you can hold out. through my many playthroughs, ive lasted anywhere between 2 minutes and 8 hours(8 in game days)

Gameplay 9/10
Soundtrack/Sound Design Shit my pants/10
Graphics 4/10(Can't really get too worked up over it since this is a very small team)

The first thing that hits you is just how detailed and immersive the world feels. You're thrown into Knox County with nothing but your wits to survive the zombie apocalypse, and boy, does it get intense. Every little choice feels like it has weight, from deciding whether to raid a nearby house for supplies to figuring out if you should rest now or push on a little further.

The game's realism is something else. You have to manage everything - hunger, sleep, even your character's mental health. It's not just about killing zombies; it's about surviving in the truest sense. Need to eat? Better learn to forage or farm. Got a wound? Hope you've found some medical supplies or know basic first aid. It's this depth that makes every playthrough feel unique and thrilling.

Crafting and base-building are a whole other level of fun. You can barricade yourself in an existing building, or if you're feeling ambitious, start building your own fortress from scratch. The sense of achievement when you've set up a safe, functional base is unmatched. And let's not forget the zombies. They're not your typical dumb, slow-moving horde. They're unpredictable, and the game's AI ensures that you can never let your guard down. One moment you're scavenging in peace, the next you're sprinting for your life because you made too much noise.

The game also has a dynamic weather system and a day-night cycle that affects gameplay. Rain can mask your noise, making it easier to move stealthily, but it can also lead to illness if you're not careful. The cycle of day and night affects visibility and zombie behavior, adding another layer to the already complex strategy of survival.

But what truly makes ""Project Zomboid"" stand out is the community and the developers' engagement with it. The game has been shaped and improved over time with feedback from players, and the mod support is fantastic. The community has created mods that add everything from new items and mechanics to entirely new maps.

In short, ""Project Zomboid"" is an incredible survival game that challenges you in ways few other games do. It's not just about making it through the night or killing zombies; it's about creating a sustainable way of life in a world that's out to get you. With its deep gameplay mechanics, challenging realism, and supportive community, it's a game that keeps you coming back for more, eager to face whatever it throws at you next. Whether you're a die-hard fan of survival games or someone looking for a deep, engaging gaming experience, ""Project Zomboid"" is a must-play.",1705786590,1706821875,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,True

Project Zomboid is an open-world isometric survival horror video game in development by British and Canadian independent developer The Indie Stone. The game is set in a post-apocalyptic, zombie-infested world in the 1990s where the player is challenged to survive for as long as possible before inevitably dying.

        [th]Description[/th]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]üíæGraphics[/td]
        [td]The graphics are really unique for a survival game (well for me). A top down view really got me hesitant on buying it, but I deeply enjoyed it! It plays so well in this perspective. The graphics are pretty good too. It will age really well in the future. Not much to say in the graphics department. It has an indie vibe and I like it. The graphics are pleasant and have amazing lighting with more improvements in the future.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]üéÆGameplay[/td]
        [td]I played many zombie survival games in my time, but none felt as real as project zomboid. There are no special infected like Left 4 Dead, there is no action packed story, and the world is based in a real location. Basically you make your own story. How would you survive the end of the world? This game captures that pretty well. You start off by creating your own character. There are positive and negative traits you can pick to make your character feel truly unique. It‚Äôs an incredible system that works perfectly for this game. You can farm in this game, you can be a cop that has amazing shooting skills and bravery. You can basically role play this game. There are some flaws though. For example base building needs an overhaul. There is not much you can do in terms of building. You can design your place really well, and add a ton of character to it. But like you can‚Äôt make rooftops, or watch towers for example. The base building needs a lot of work. The foundation is there, but I feel like they can do so much more in this area (which I‚Äôm sure they will in later updates). So your best bet is to find an existing house or building and build up on that with the limited tool they provide at the moment. There are no NPCs or animals yet, but they are currently working on them which is amazing news. This is the Dark Souls of survival games in my opinion. Winter is cruel to you, in the later stages it can get really challenging as food spoils and water and power shuts off. The zombies are challenging as well. One bit will end you, and if you are unlucky a laceration from a zombie or scratch can even infect you. Be careful out there if you play this and don‚Äôt underestimate the dead.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]üé≠Multiplayer[/td]
        [td]The multiplayer runs so well and is super easy to get going. You can have many players on your server as well. The more RAM you have, the better it will run so just be cautious. I never stress tested the player count. I had up to 5 players and had no problem with my setup. You can make a server with 100+ mods and as long as they have the mods too, I had zero issues with it in my 400+ hours on this game (mostly on multiplayer).[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]üïõPlaytime[/td]
        [td]This game has a high play time. I don‚Äôt really get into survival games and I put around 500 hours into this game. The modding community makes this game breathe. This is such a hardcore survival and sometimes can feel really relaxing. The playstyles are infinite. You can make your own story and get so immersed. If you have friends that always wanted a zombie survival game that actually felt realistic, you will put so much time here![/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]üéßSound[/td]
        [td]Sound is so important in this game. Turn off the music (I personally hate it), and just immerse yourself into the world. Audio is so well done in this game. You have to pay attention to the zombies and hear where they may be, all from the bushes, branches being snapped, alarms going off, etc. If you don‚Äôt pay attention, you will get bit and die. Also your own audio is important. Be careful of alarms of watches, car alarms, house alarms, etc. They can be deadly. You can shout if needed to distract the zombies to save your friend, or even shoot a gun to distract them. Guns can even be a lifesaver and life ender (if that‚Äôs a word). Guns can bring in so many zombies. The sound design is just so in depth and incredible, and so well designed.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]‚ùóBugs‚ùó[/td]
        [td]The multiplayer can be a little buggy. The driving can be glitchy at high speeds at the moment. Luckily the devs are facing a lot of multiplayer issues (since the multiplayer is kinda new to the game). Besides that I haven‚Äôt really noticed any major bugs on my playthroughs. Just the driving can be kinda buggy at times.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]üîÖPerformance[/td]
        [td]The optimization is pretty good but it still can use some work I feel. Luckily the developers are already on that. The animations are pretty good and the lighting is really impressive! One bad thing is the lag in multiplayer while driving. Now they are on a fix for this but just thought I‚Äôd let you know about it. It‚Äôs not game breaking, just annoying especially with the stutters at high speeds. [/td]

        [td]üîóConclusion[/td]
        [td]Project Zomboid has a Walking Dead vibe to it (I thought I‚Äôd never say that about a game). It captures a zombie apocalypse so well. I don‚Äôt really get into survival games, but this one really got me hooked. The modding community is absolutely insane. You can see the passion behind this game, and I don‚Äôt see it slowing down anytime soon.[/td]

It is highly immersive, has a very real and compelling zombie narrative which can be further improved with mods of course that not only change the way the game can be played but it has a especially given the game a fresh take with the quality of life content it provides.

Secondly it is a super hardcore experience even if sandbox settings are tweaked to be easier, Because of the perma-Death you feel like every action has consequences like in real life.
even after my 200 plus hours ive still been learning new things/mechanics in the game.
I have died many times but recently my play styles have changed and id have to say that the base building is satisfying.
Literally any item can be placed in the world that is picked up to make bases etc really feel alive and at home for your character.

Thirdly Death in the game is only the beginning......For example you can pick up from where you left off as a new character with the draw back being that you lose all skills acquired from your previous character.
If you liked to be highly immersed in a Zombie apocalypse then this is the game for you.
If you want to hate life and yourself tweak settings in sand box to give the desired out come but with that said i recommend playing the game first in its intended way so you can truly appreciate the progression of your character and most of all yourself as the player.

Lastly its like you are the director of a movie and your character is the protagonist thats destined to die, even from over confidents or from becoming to complacent.
i could go on and on about the pros and cons but as it stands the many pros of this game is overpowering in comparison to the cons so i cant recommend this game enough.
with the Multiplayer its another story though, id definitely play with some friends or join the many communities available.
its the most awful thing to see your best friends or your character whos been alive for over a week if you make it that far die from turning in to the undead then having to either kill or run from them.

 (PS) Using the betas sections on the game will give you a bunch of different game versions.If i was you playing on the build 41_78_7 is the way to go, well at least until the build 42 comes out anyway.

Mods keep this game very alive. However, I cannot go over some very serious issues that the devs seem to not want to go over.


*PUSHING ANIMATION GOES THROUGH ZOMBIES.
*ZOIDS SPAWN RIGHT OUTSIDE YOUR HOUSE, NOT EVEN 10M AWAY; (I've had this even with respawning off)
*ATROCIOUS SOUND ATTRACTING ZOMBIES.
*IF YOU MISS HITTING DOWN A ZOID, BE SURE THAT HIS CRAWL ATTACK WILL PUSH YOU DOWN. THEN YOU WILL GET STUNCLOCK.
(because when you get attacked by someone on the back you don't have the intuition to simply run, but to wait for the animation to stop and then run; VERY VERY REALISTIC)
*YOUR GUN SHOT LITERALLY CAN HIT A ZOMBIE AND DO 0 DAMAGE.
*YOUR GUN SHOT WILL DO LESS DAMAGE IF YOU ARE DAMAGED ON YOUR HAND
(because bullet speed are affected by the scratch on my hand; VERY REALISTIC)
*YOU CAN STAY NEAR A WINDOW AND A CRAWLER JUMPING THROUGH THE WINDOW ATTACKS YOU IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND STILL HITS YOU.
HIT YOU IN THE FUCKING SHOULDER. WHILE HE IS ON THE GROUND.
*YOU WILL SHOOT POINTBLANK A ZOMBIE RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU AND YOU WILL STILL MISS WITH A SHOTGUN
*IF A CRAWLER IS TRYING TO BITE YOU AND YOU WALK BEHIND HIM YOU WILL STILL GET BITTEN AND STUNLOCKED BY IT. WHILE YOU ARE BEHIND HIS BITING ANIMATION. (very rery realistic!)
*IF A ZOID JUMPS OVER A FENCE AND THEN CRAWL ATTACKS YOU AND IN FRONT OF HIM IS ANOTHER FENCE, HE WILL STILL ATTACK YOU, EVEN THOUGH THERE IS A SOLID BLOCK THAT SHOULD BLOCK HIS HITBOX!( VERY FUCKING REALISTIC )
*YOU WILL SEE SPRINTERS THAT LITERALLY WALK NORMALLY FOR SECONDS AND THEN TURN YOUR BACK LITERALLY WAKE UP THAT ZOID TURNED INTO A SPRINTER AND BIT YOU FROM THE BACK

Except without the permanent upgrades that rogue-like games typically have. So think Rogue Legacy (without the permanent upgrades you get after dying) with zombie themed survival elements. 

My issue is your character has to have weaknesses to balance out their strengths, which you pick at character creation. You might pick them to be better at fitness and melee weapons, but you'll have to counter that with a negative trait, such as slow reader, or something else (you get to pick these). 

I picked slow reader for mine, which makes reading books take longer. When trying to read a book in the game (which is how you level your skills), the little bar didn't move at all. I sat there and waited for a good solid minute. Not even a single dot worth of progress, so I stopped. This feels too punishing - that I basically can't read any books, so I can never advance any skill on this character. Not without sitting and waiting for who knows how long, anyway. But it's going to take so long, it's essentially become useless to try.

With some of these things essentially locked out for your character, that's a part of the game you won't get to experience. At least not for that ""run"". While that's fine, I guess, if that's the style of game you're going for, I simply don't enjoy that style of game play in survival crafting games. To me, the point of survival crafting games are to slowly build your character & base up over time. Not constantly start a new run every couple of days.

Don't get me wrong, I enjoy rogue-like games from time to time, but I usually know what to expect going into it. I didn't expect that with Project Zomboid, however. And, I think it could work as a rogue-like, if it just implemented permanent upgrades like most other rogue-likes.

But I just can't recommend this game, because the game play mechanics don't match the genre (in my opinion). Still, some might enjoy these things, I just personally do not. If I want to play a rogue-like, I will play a rogue-like. If I want to play a zombie survival crafting game, I will play something else.",1706556862,1706556862,False,0,1,0.451745361089706421,0,True,False,True

Don't let the isometric 3D graphics put you off, the depth of this experience is excellent and will keep you invested for many, many hours of freedom and exploration.

Very good mod support, very active community.  You can tailor your zombie survival experience exactly how you want it to be and the game progresses through the seasons over time.

Unfortunately I'm still warning most players to not put any money into this game for how the development team has put off core mechanics (promised years ago,) and the still fractured state of online connectivity. You know, when you can't physically drive faster than 30? Or your lag gets you killed because zombies ignore base game settings and grab/lunge/hold you through walls. 
This game SHOULD be fantastic but it has SO FAR to go. 
It's been so long though, that this fan is just about done. 
P.S The Discord mods will also ban you if you point out any of these issues in their Discord, BUYER BEWARE.

Update 2023: Game still horribly buggy and zero updates have come out to address it. Only the promise of VISUALS...?
Also, they will BAN you from the community chat for calling any of this out in forums, again buyer beware!
Update: 01/2024: Booted up for some checkin' out- zero updates (it's now been years,)  all previous connectivity issues and visual bugs are still very present. Funny update, all discussion updates are locked with zero comments by mods for how many people call out the lack up updates.

at a certain point, every setting is adjustable. number of zombies, amount of food, when electricity and water shut off and how far into the apocalypse you are (also lots and lots of mods). figure out what is survivable and go from there. don't discourage yourself with iron man runs right off the bat.

very worth noting that every game begins with:

you like to spend 10 hours grinding a

dark to find the exit to the room have
you said yes sure or ye bruv shout out
to the brits out there look no further
than project zomboid project zomboid is 
the newest old latest trip and fall
simulator constructed as a service to
raise your blood pressure and induce
aneurysms a game where guns are useless
air horns and frying pans reign is the
supreme tools for zombie genocide you
play as a kentuckian who's you must
craft yourself going through the arduous
process of deciding what will go into
your twitter bio and what will define
your character as a survivor in the
brave new world this is a game where you
can do everything or do nothing and
equally accomplish the same main mission
of the game however a free tip for the
aspiring chad is to avoid running when
you're exhausted or you will trip and
die which is the most bitch-made way to
die in this game
not that i would not that i would know
anything about that now join me as i
talk about this version of minecraft
made for fully grown masochists that
will get you so addicted that you will
stop eating drinking and sleeping in
real life so that you can do all those
things in game instead character creation in this game is
essentially just choosing how mentally
ill you want your character to be in
order to get and you will then reinvest
these points into choosing just how much
of a flawless sigma male you want
yourself to be but i'm getting ahead of
myself before you do any of that you
must choose an occupation i almost
exclusively play burglar an engineer
praying boy and don't worry if you don't
it's okay you know it's not a crime to be a fucking imbecile moving back to the
trait screen it's all about trade-offs
if you want to be the big strong man
then unfortunately you have to become an
italian and if you want any other
redeeming qualities on top of that then
it's time you decide just how high you
value the ability to read in my eyes
there are three goated ailments being
deaf being claustrophobic and being
agoraphobic death is a given surprise  everything is quiet until a
jump scare plays at maximum volume then
there's being claustrophobic which means
you are afraid of germans and being
indoors specifically being in the doors
of small houses where the poor people
live when in warehouses or mansions all
of a sudden they aren't claustrophobic
anymore exposing that they are really
just elitists that hate poor people and
then there's being a gamer that upon
going outside and touching the grass
will quickly devolve into a full-scale
panic choosing the reasons for why you
despise yourself is quite hard so at
first you will likely air to the side of
caution by only choosing a few good and
a few bad however play for the next 20
hours and you'll soon be saying
i was just reading through the reddit
and i've got a real nice meta build

then i can finally have the ab traits to
live long enough to level my mechanic
skills and finally get a car if you're
not ready for that level of commitment
then get off this battle bus and go spin
up a random character random characters
can be just as fun as custom characters
because it's a completely randomly
generated story every time allow me to
give you a quick example they once gave
me a gymnast doctor who loved the great
outdoors fishing hunting but also being
out of shape smoking and being a weak
made a male after two hours of being
alive he stopped in at a motel six to
rest his lungs but upon leaving a horde
of zombies tripped him and he fell to
the ground and was torn lim from limb he
lived to chad life and he died at chad
death six hours in and inspiration for
youth everywhere a statue will be
constructed in his honor when the new
world comes to life combat in this game captures the
brutality that you would see in famous
zombie movies sometimes you might get a
clean one-hit kill if you're moodle-free
but as your mental health declines
you'll have to multiply the hits to kill
by like 10 because mental ailments and
exhaustion can turn a fine blade into a
balloon sword and you'd be lucky if you
could even give a zombie a haircut with
this shit not to mention these situations bathe
the room in blood and you may kill the
zombie however what are the untold
effects that this will have on your mind
you're definitely developing a hard case
of ps4d in the future anyways there are
two situations for combat that you'll
find yourself in you're either fighting
a couple of zombies or you're fighting
every single zombie there is luckily if
it's only one zombie you can pretty
easily just tip them over and give him
the old whip but if it's all the zombies
the council advises you to run as far
away as humanly possible and then run a
little further because the house you
just tried to break in is protected by
an adt house alarm you should have
checked the lawn first and although
there is a chance that you can take out
a solid group of zombies when paired
with the right weapon there are more
chances that you will die if you hurt
your foot you will die if you trip you
will die and if you're fortunate you'll
live long enough to see the top right of
your screen light up like a fucking christmas tree and your swings will have
the speed and punching power of a
geriatric athlete with joint pain
leading you to waddle for your life as a
horde of zombies are six inches off of
your back desperately reaching for your
cheeks so the next time the council
tells you to run from the horde you run
from the horde now let's dive deeper
into the good stuff the weapons of micro
destruction so to speak starting with melee shovels are the best
hybrid since god created the hyundai
elantra it's an eco-friendly solution
that can both kill zombies and bury them
immediately after simply put this shit is BEAST  then we have the sledgehammer
the sledgehammer is the best thing since
god breathed the shovel nothing exhausts
you completely like the sledgehammer and
nothing can cave in a skull like the
ford sledgehammer you've seen this thing
around before in hit games like tom
clancer's pride 7 paradise the greatest
fbs game of all time according to ign
and the performance here today doesn't
disappoint either cave in a skull then
knock down some walls or garage doors
and shit just to demonstrate your
masculinity in front of the zombies you
know what ester sledgehammer for
president finally for melee weapons we
have the frying pan this is the best
thing since god breathed the
sledgehammer you can cook with it you
can kill with it and you can pray with
it sun tzu always said he uses the
frying pan to defeat his enemies and now
so can you for the low price of 5.99
now let's talk about guns in this game i won't be giving a top 3 guns watch mojo
list because almost every gun in the
vanilla game belongs in the trash i only
like one gun and that's the shotgun this
shotgun is the only gun in this game
that actually understands the assignment
and does what it is told to do i point i
shoot the zombies die simple as that now
try to do that again with a pistol or a
rifle or a magnum you can't not unless
you were so specked into aiming that you
look down the site and see the fucking 
future because you are a dead eye and a
prophet and if you are i bet you can't
tell me the numbers on the front of your
mom's credit card and the three special
digits on the back hahahaha that wasn't a question you better start
talking all right anyways i'll i'll
spare your ears from the five-minute
rant i just cut out about how bad
pistols 
now clothes wear as many coats and shirts as your
mortal soul will allow you to wear the health and staying alive aspects of
this game are incredibly realistic as i
can now take up a pill addiction and
maintain my alcoholism",1706416445,1706416445,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,True

Original review posted at 12 hours of playtime.

Hi, yes, I got past the helicopter, yes I survived the power and water turning off, yes I used cars and guns, yes I went to the wikis, and subreddits, and no I haven't played with mods or multiplayer.

This is all from the solo experience in survival, builder, and sandbox modes. Mods don't come installed with 
the vanilla game, so I don't care about how much better they make the game.

That being said...

This is probably the most frustrating sim game that has ever existed. People will praise it for its ""realistic"" and ""innovative"" mechanics, its ""subtle"" story-telling and addictive gameplay loop...when in actuality it just means putting a loading bar on every single action in the game and having you watch your character slowly, or quickly die . 

Drink water: loading bar.
Eat food: loading bar.
Use item: loading bar. 
Move item: loading bar. 
Grab item from inside a bag: Loading bar to unpack the item, and another loading bar to equip the item. 

Was it a gun that you were grabbing from inside your backpack?

Well, I hope earlier in the day you went through the 20 individually segmented loading bars to load the mag, then went through the additional loading bar to insert the mag into the gun, and then put the gun on your back, because now you have to do 21 individual loading bars to get through while a mob of zombies spawns on top of your character even though you just came from the very same direction and nothing was there.

And even if all these actions were instant, it still wouldn't make this Sims 3 version of 7 Days to Die more enjoyable.

You spawn in, and the zombies are immediately on you.

Need weapons?

Gotta fight 10 Zombies bare handed.

Exhausted?

Enjoy going from 2 hits to kill a zombie - to 8. Against a horde of 10+.

Decided not to fight and run instead?

Enjoy aggroing every zombie that was in a home because apparently zombies get to grow eyes all over their heads, and sneaking means nothing!

Need protective gear?

Most veteran player will tell you ""just don't take damage"" as if that's actual advice to be taken seriously in anything other than a bullet-hell. But you can still get what you can, just don't catch heat stroke from all the layers you're wearing.

Got a scratch or got bitten anyways because a fucking ninja zombie spawned out of nowhere with no visual or auditory indication whatsoever?

Congratulations, you may now a dead man walking. Have fun finding out in the next 3 days (Unless you got bit THEN YOU'RE 100% FUCKED LOL HAHAHA XDDDDDDzZzzZzzz.)

Why?

Because the devs want zombification to 100% be the reason you die! It's not enough to just get overwhelmed by the infinite hordes that come after you DAY AND NIGHT while you're exploring, who cares that you have an entire system based around injuries where massive chunks of health are removed from the various devastating concussions, mangled limbs, and hemorrhaging lacerations no, no,NO... ANY contact with the dead runs the risk of infecting you. Sure they have an ENTIRE SYSTEM DEDICATED TO TREATING PLAYER WOUNDS, but FUCK IT! DIE YOU DUMMY! LOL! YOU GOT SCRATCHED ON YOUR LEFT PINKY 3 DAYS AGO!!!! OOOOOPS!!!!!

 So have fun making DOZENS of characters that KEEP dying because... who would ACTUALLY want to explore the massive map we made in a SANDBOX? Right? YOU DON'T ACTUALLY WANT TO DEVELOP YOUR CHARACTER WITH RPG MECHANICS IN OUR GAME DID YOU???? TOOOO BAAAAAAAAAAD!!!!!

And don't tell me that this is all for the sake of the realism, or the atmosphere, this kind of bs isn't part of any story, or to keep experiences fresh, it's for the purpose of being a massive waste time.

I'm not gonna give any leeway to a game on its ""realism"" if I can't even sit in a chair while I read a book or watch tv. Let alone not being able to do both at the same time.

Editor's Note (@ 33hrs.): I have now played with some help from a friend I made while streaming a new playthrough of the game. Thank you EN for teaching me about all the inventory management tips, moodle advice, skill progression help, and for explaining all the little obscure quality of life features that I would have never figured out on my own! I still really think that this game would benefit form an advanced tutorial, or even having multiple tutorials that explain all the features that are in the game. There are countless people that all have some variation of ""I have been playing for around 100+ hours and never knew that you could (insert feature that is never explained here)"".

Well about the game, its not for everybody if you didn't think in this game (where to find supplies, how to manage the ""Zomboids"", if you playing in MP manage the community, ect.) the game will punish you and hit you hard like a train. 

Charge the ""Zombodis"" have impact in the game (they are really good trackers in vanilla you will not lose them off simply). 

Traits have hard impact in your run and it feels you are not a hero and you are just ordinary person who was lucky.

With traits come where you been employed (Cook, Police officer, Farmer, Lumberjack, Doctor, ect.) gave you head start in skills and boost but you don't know everything in that profession you need to still search for books and magazines and train the skills.

Yea there are no NPC's (there is mod in workshop for that) and no quests for now (how long we didn't know) but i like it ,this is how to survive and you are making your own quests.

About weapons that's another story, i mean yea there are lots of melee weapons but not so much firearms ( only 3 or 4 i don't know, i didn't play vanilla long time) no upgrades for firearms.

Graphics, are sufficient for this type of game.

The whole spirit of ""This is how you died"" shows what Zomboid is all about. You are not winning. The best thing that may happen is you don't die. There is one goal; Survive, as long as possible, if possible.
And with that comes the only bad thing about this game: over time i've seen more and more of my friends getting bored by surviving as they found their own playstyle, wich worked. Worked too well, so they didn't care about surviving anymore as it was ""too easy"". The challenge to make goals, reach something etc. has vanished and with that the reason to play on did too.
One way to encourage to keep playing, is to set goals, step by step, and write them down, so you have something ""physically"" reminding you whats milestones you can get, and already got.
With that in mind, I am looking forward to Build 42, as i think the new systems will help smoothen out the endgame curve a little.
Right now, the game is one of my favourites. Especially with mods its replayability is near infinite, with friends, the possibilites are infinite. 
The Sandbox makes the game the way you want it to be, with all its settings, you can learn the game, and create scenarios as you wish.
About the game itself, i don't care about the graphics. Zomboid does a unspeakable great job in detail work, the clouds in the sky, the reflection in the car windows, the sounds and the games OST, the different systems (Now, Foraging, Health, and especially the moodles; Later, probably fishing as well), they all make the game as beautifull as it is.
Nothing will ever top the feeling of playing in a group, while listening to some chill tunes, and working in or on a base and just enjoying the game.
Combining Zomboid and a good friend group increases its potential exponentially as everything is hilarious, when your friend mistakes a tree for your buddy who's already in the car.

Pro's:
- Supports many playstyles
- Many mods
- Easy multiplayer (without the need of dedicated servers)
- Sandbox mode
- Detailed systems
- Teaching the basics

Con's:
- Multiplayer (servers behaving funny sometimes)
- Endgame state is boring/repetitive
- Pretty hard for beginners to pick up

All in all, this game is a 9,4/10.
Great game, even greater potential.

It's got all the hallmarks of a survival semi-rpg.
[list]
[*] Character traits, skills, customisation.
[*] Looting, crafting, building, farming.
[*] A whole bunch of melee and ranged weapons.
[*] An interesting take on free-form cooking.
[*] Somewhat realistic world and ""survival"" mechanics like health, medical, environment, weather, seasons.
[/list]

Expansive modding potential and community.  There's a shit-ton of mods for all sorts of things.

It's been in development a long time.  But it's in [b]active[/b] development, which is important.  So it's just a matter of time for certain features - but how long is too long to wait?

Other good things in my opinion:
[list]
[*] No arbitrary time-based tower-defence-like hordes or waves in the ""normal"" game mode.  There's challenge maps for some of that kind of gameplay, as well as mods.  Instead, if a horde is after you, it's because they were attracted and not because it's day 7 or something and that's the game.

[*] No ""special"" zombies spitting acid or throwing cars.  Just regular shuffling (or sprinting) zombies.  The danger comes in the fact that there's fucking heaps of them, and it doesn't take much to take you out of the game.
[/list]

But it's not without flaws.
[*] [b]As of this[/b], it has no NPCs.  Single-player is kind of ""lonely"".  Except NPCs have always been on the cards and will be coming in future builds - it's just a matter of time.

[*] It's a sandbox in that in-game objectives are not explicit or specific.  It's basically ""try not to die"", or maybe ""die in a magnificent fashion"".  Whatever you set out to do is up to you, but not backed by anything in-game.

[*] [b]As of this[/b], end-game is arguably non-existent.  Despite the game telling you ""There was no hope of survival, this is how you died""; once you know what you're doing and are equipped, have a vehicle, a base, whatever, you've kind of beaten it.  You [i]have[/i] survived.  Boredom probably ends the game for you at that point, unless maybe you decide then to set out to clear towns and kill every zombie, sooner or later getting bitten.  The developers have plans to address end-game so we'll see.

[*] The UX/UI will not be to everyone's taste.

[*] The level of detail/complexity to some aspects won't be to everyone's taste.

Although I believe it's wonderfully crafted, the one glaring flaw is by far the lack of a goal or end-game state for which to aim. Without speaking at length, if you're not a fan of games without a clear-cut story, or even general sandbox end-game goal, like Minecraft, then I wouldn't consider this something worth your time. Certainly, if you get bored often with those types of games, I would stay clear.

Notwithstanding that fact, a great group of friends, and a few mods, can make the experience much more enduring, as despite being a single-player lover, I've always found that my friends and I can naturally form a goal. This modding community's love and passion for the game, along with the support from the developers for that passion, will keep this game going long after it's completed.

By far, this is the greatest zombie survival game that I've ever played - add NPCs and quests (it doesn't have to be a main story), and it could be the greatest survival game ever made.

But it gets better you can find a weapon kill the hordes and then survive in this Zombie Survival Game and thats what makes this game so great.

While the graphics may look crappy, the game is so detailed and realistic.

Its your typical zombie apocalypse survival open world, the way its supposed to be.
The mechanics of this game are stupidly real, making it one of the hardest game to play.

but once you learnt how things work, it becomes so addicting that you'll forget to eat or sleep in real life.

I recommend watching alot of youtube videos about it before buying it since it is not for everyone.

If youre looking for a zombie shooter, this is not your game. 1 bullet fired will mean your doom if you dont have 10,000 more to kill the zombies you attracted with the first one.

The only gripe I have with zomboid is it's somewhat stale late game but that can be fixed with a few mods.

after 50+ hours, I've learned a few things: 

First, don't get too attached to a character. The opening screen warns us and I've come to realize the truth of the statement: This is how you die. I've died to groups of Zs. I've died of infection. I've died from a single bite after being distracted IRL. Death is a constant companion in this game, and it's just a matter of time before your medical professional meets the same fate as her patients.

Second, take it slow. sure you can rush through, load up on weapons and go on a killing spree, but you miss out on what makes this game unique: the characters themselves. your lumberjack shouldn't be shoving ice cream in his face through the visor of a motorcycle helmet. taking the time to remove gear when you get home from a zombie killing and looting spree gives your characters life.

Third and finally, while this game is fun solo, it's even more so with friends. I just started playing with my sister's fiance, and having someone to watch your back and talk to throughout the zombie apocalypse adds just the right amount of additional hope to suck you in further. 

The modding community is top notch, adding quality of life improvements and just an insane amount of additional vehicles, gear, and even special zombies. there's something special about finally being able to move the furniture without having to break it down, or even just being able to see the corpses you move, or the generator you pick up.

TLDR; this game is fantastic and I recommend you give it a shot.",1706242966,1706272291,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I played it for maybe 2 hours, lost about 5 different characters and decided that I hated it. It wasn't until I had came back a month later after watching a few videos about the game. I booted up zomboid with a few select mods that I had also heard were good. 

My character was Alfonzo Fulhmer. Alfonzo stayed inside of his starter house for a week. He was a underweight, keen hearing fast learner. He was a carpenter before the outbreak. He learnt alot about the world he was living in while looking out his dust stained windows. A few more days went by as i sent Alfonzo out to his neighbor's houses to collect food and necessities. I didn't know what to grab so I made him haul everything. Down to each red dinner plate and blue pen. My house was boarded up, window curtains drawn and Alfonzo sat alone in his home. In the small town of rosewood was where he resided. his quaint little home in a world of chaos. He lived a boring life, Alfonzo grew depressed and each action he took seemed like a lifetime. (I didn't know how to speed up time) I had sent Alfonzo on a trip further then he had gone before. To get to the gas station. I wanted him to get a car so that future adventures wouldn't be so difficult.

The helicopter came 12 days after he had been sculpted from the character creator screen. He was outside walking down alleys and side roads when he heard the low rumbling of the news helicopter. Alfonzo sprinted home hoping that he would be fast enough to hide. He thought he was safe until the unending waves of the undead surrounded his small bungalow. He sat alone in his bathroom hoping for them to leave but the helicopter continued to circle. The banging grew louder as the dead had broken into his home. He stayed silent but no avail. the wave pushed past each other and barreled towards the door Alfonzo was hiding behind. He died alone in agony, I sat watching hopeless and desperate for the help that hadn't come. Alfonzo was dead and what remains of him wanders the streets of Rosewood.

Im going to tell you my adventure playing Project Zomboid.  I want to say first off I love the idea of playing a game in the open world full of zombies.  You can do a ton of little things from bandaging your wounds to deconstructing furniture.  The difficullty in the game is what kind of scared me but then i kind of understood why.  It was to catch the interest of players getting addicted to the game to play one more day.  

Now here are some of  the things i didn't like about the game.  The tutorial was bad and it  basicallly put you to your death at the end of it and you  don't learn from it and you just die.  In the tutorial, I was tasked to press a few buttons but i had no explanation on all the classes you could play in the game like trying to be a carpenter or a farmer or a cook or a trapper and so on.  The items were kind of clunky too because you want to get things in and out of your inventory as much as possible, so i could drop certain amount of items on the ground and not all of them.

Now for the ugly part of the game, i almost don't want to talk about it because it was so bad.  The community of this multiplayer game is horrendously toxic.  I am a complete new player to the game and I'm trying to seek ways to get help. almost no one has the patience to help me from the beginning to the end without being chill about it.  I went on discord and YouTube to try to learn the game but it turns out all of them are jerks who want to play their game their own little way.  The players say I can play  on my own and learn on my own but the game by design is easier with more people so i try to at least play with one other person.  The first duo partner i had to play long term basically summarized as this ;we weren't meant to play together because i got mad at all the little things and blocked me on discord; and the person said we should never play with eachother again and that person recommended that i should be able to find someone else to play with on a day to day basis who will teach me the game. To be honest, this is what turned me away from the game because I know nothing about the game and the next person  will be the same problem and i noticed the players on discord weren't getting along with others for this reason or another, so why would they help me.  If you are trying to reach out to people in this game, you won't get far and so now I am rating this a thumbs down for me for the experience that i had to go through in this game as a newbie to the game.

I played Baulder's Gate 3 in their discord and I tried to find a long term player to play with and everything went well between us until something came up. that something was his girl friend complaining about how he was spending so much time playing with me, so I stopped messaging him because i felt bad about the situation of doing the things we planned on doing together.  Baulder's Gate 3 has the same problem as this game but not as bad as this game is in multiplayer mode.

To fix the community problem,   I would simply say put up chat windows in the game for things that a new player would be looking for. For example, You can go to a new to the game chat box  or  just a chat and chill box  or join these servers if you're new to the game.

Sure, there are times when playing solo gets a tad dull sometimes, but the modding community has a ton of cool stuff to spice things up.

Zombies just absolutely overwhelm just about every single road on the map, which makes playing this game even more dull than it already is - dull because it's predictable. For a game that prides itself on realism, almost every single house or street - even the ones that are rural -  are just filled to the brim with zombies. It doesn't make sense. Why is a country house in the middle of the woods filled with 20 zombies?

The ""profession"" that you pick at the start makes practically no difference. The perks you pick have no impact. You spawn almost immediately surrounded by 21837192 zombies so every playthrough is exactly the same: spawn, go somewhere rural, and then spend 20-40 minutes trying to find a house in the middle of nowhere, find nothing, restart. 

This game punishes you for trying to do anything even remotely enjoyable. Want to check if this car is broken? Too bad, there's 48919 zombies surrounding it. Want to check this prison for weapons? Too bad, all the doors are locked and there's no way in. Want to check this house for food? No, you get nothing, and here's 12 zombies to chase you out. I get it, it's supposed to be rough, but we shouldn't be just breaking the natural cycle to make the game difficult. If zombies are out here, supposedly looking for food, why are the stood staring at this car in the middle of some rural plain? Why are they camping out in someone rural house bedroom? It doesn't make sense that they'd be surviving like this.

Your character constantly complains about food, sweat, pain etc. He's the most hypochondriac character/person/thing I've ever seen. Slight dampness and he complains like he's being physically tortured. Run for more than 2 seconds and he cries even more. His carrying capacity is 12lbs for some reason, and carrying an extra 1lb makes your legs break. Again, I thought this game was going for realism. I get it, they're game developers, they're not exactly going to be the strongest people, but they do know the average man can lift a decent weight right?

Guns, when you find them, are fun but absolutely useless. The in-game menus are basic, yet convoluted and obnoxiously difficult to use. Bags, or any type of carrying container that isn't the best bag in the world, are just completely pointless. The time it takes to pick them up, and arrange your stuff into it, basically negates the 0%-20% encumbrance bonus you get.

Everything about this game irritates me, can you tell? It just feels like everything I'd want to do in a real world situation, is possible in this game, but only if you're open to accepting some unrealistic ""debuff"" for it.",1704435417,1706074576,False,2,0,0.47757256031036377,0,True,False,True

UPDATING MY REVIEW

I am still addicted to this game. I patiently await Build 42. Played with mods for a long time and recently went back to vanilla (with just a few QoL mods) and it is still so much fun. I figured going back to vanilla until B42 comes out that way when it hits I am not ""losing"" all of this content I use with mods, and it feels more like I am getting new stuff again! 

But my god this game is great! 10/10

Also - I respect that the Devs have a normal work flow and don't over push themselves. They work at their own pace and don't burn themselves out! The culture in the gaming industry has forced devs to work inhumane hours and the end result is just better when you have passionate devs like these guys with a good work to life ratio on their end! As much as I anticipate B42, I am happy waiting!",1658541766,1706060329,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Then again, everytime I played with friends and family, there's always that survival charm and I fall in love with game again. Now that cars are in vanilla, I'm totally recommending this game. Get it while it's still not pricey. It's worth the money now.

UPDATE at 2186 play hours

Need I say more? This game has so much crafting going on. Mods make it even more awesome. Want to play with a PUG? Go to their server lists. Solo? Sure! Play with friends? It's got it all. Add/remove any mods for flavor. It's like a full course meal and you get to pick everything up to dessert. 2186 hours of play well spent.",1528116697,1706058848,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I‚Äôll keep it simple and straight to the point this is a frustratingly fun game for a couple hours of play then gets old quickly. The game needs a lot of work with UI, and game play mechanics, but it‚Äôs on the way to somewhere great. At this early access price point it‚Äôs a nice buy, place on the shelf and age like fine wine type of game. Bonus points to the Devs for constantly updating as well.

         In Project Zomboid, you have to do more than just fight zombies. You need to eat, drink, and stay healthy. It's like a big puzzle where you have to figure out how to survive each day. This makes the game more exciting because every choice you make matters. It's not just about fighting ‚Äì it's about being smart to stay alive.
         What's really neat is that Project Zomboid lets you create your own story. The game changes based on the choices you make. You can explore different places and face different challenges every time you play. It's like writing your own adventure where you're the hero, yet you're not. At any moment you could be mauled by devious little creatures known as the Zomboids. One bite and your dead.
          The world in Project Zomboid is like a real place. There are cities, countryside, and everything in between. The game pays attention to small details like day turning into night, different weather, and how things decay over time. It feels like a living, breathing world that you get to explore.
         It's not just a game, it changes who you are, and I love Project Zomboid for it.",1690328322,1706043910,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I just looted 4 crowbars in the warehouses south west of Muldraugh (day 3). Everything was running smoothly when the character just decided to stop defending himself against 3 Z. 9 Strength 9 Fitness 2 long blunt, no debufs except depressed. Thats annoying. It might be because I play on streaming service but regardless. If this harmless situation can get you killed like that its just retarded. They should add a savegame feature whenever you sleep. The RNG is just terrible.
I played on Apocalypse in single player.

Its not even a competitive game, so why they completely omitted savegame options is beyond me.

If you dont have a job and look to kill time while also getting frustrated permanently this game is for you. Gameplay is great, unfortunately you will hardly get so see most of the game unless you are willing to put up with its bullshit. I am not. Suit yourselves.

Edit: I did some testing to put some numbers to the review. Starting with nimble 3 (600%xp) + fast learner trait (x1.3xp) 20 points in nimble take you 5 real life minutes of strafing in combat stance. This is the fastest you can get as of 20220210. This means to outpace z in combat stance it takes you 5250 points from there. Which translates to TWENTYTWO (22) REAL LIFE HOURS of you doing nothing but uninterrupted strafing in combat stance. This means if you start your game and you also pick wakeful (-30% sleep required) you spend the first 29 ingame days to get to nimble lvl6 (outpacing z). Of these 29 days you spend 22 strafing and 7 sleeping. If this doesnt sound like a waste of time to you nothing will.

Edit: if you want to know why I added so many played hours since the negative review - I have changed systems and am now able to access the savegames and back them up manually, like everyone else. Fix your game devs.",1675459736,1705941373,False,2,0,0.418888062238693237,0,True,False,True

We lost our best truck and trailer in multiplayer because I desynched into oblivion. Why am I growing radishes and tomatoes which require refrigeration for  storage when dried beans and lentils exist as a food product already? Why aren't I able to grow those? Why is rain water tainted? Why is it magically potable when plumbed from rain barrels to a sink or tub? It's slow doing any significant construction because carrying 5 planks annihilates your body.

I also dislike zombie things. Really. I have never played a zombie game or watched a zombie movie that was particularly interesting to me. Just not my thing.

All that said, Zomboid has quickly become one of my favorite games. However you want to play an apocalyptic zombie survival game is up to you. Want to have tons of loot and focus on infrastructure to survive? Want lots of cars to chop so you can convoy across the city grabbing everything and anything of value? Want to play light and lean and sneak on foot? Want to focus on farming off in the middle of nowhere? Slow dumb hordes? Fast and nasty little groups who won't quit chasing you? It's all up to you. Add ample workshop content to that equation and the world is your oyster.

If this game piques your interest at all, I'd say the only caveat to consider is whether you think a little bit of jank/balance/WIP type situation will bother you at all. If not, I highly recommend it.",1705862911,1705862911,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

""This game might as well be called Paraplegic Simulator.
You get endlessly chases by zombies with no avail, all of the guns have the power and accuracy of a NERF Dart Blaster, the UI is AIDS and every time I think I'm getting somewhere the game has the need to use the power of god himself to strike me down by spawning 5 quadrillion zombies in a move that makes it feel like a Boomer just blew up on you.
One time I spawned in a Police Station and got a bunch of guns and loot only for one single minuscule zombie to enter the building. Now, this seems like a normal encounter, right? No, because in this game your character's aim is to that of a disabled zebra wearing a bald cap. You could empty an entire magazine aiming directly at something and still none of your shots could connect.
This game is great if you love getting kicked in the balls, since that's what I wish I've done instead of buying this dumpster fire."" - jackstonOHB0Y DEC 28 2023",1705773894,1705773894,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

But even still, love it so much that I occasionally play it again and again. Felt so realistic and fun to roam each maps scavenging to survive, while some swarming of ghoulish hordes lurking around making things challenging enough.

Okay, so there is an extremely steep learning curve and you can become a zombie grinding machine if you pick a specific weapon type. The best traits for this are fast learner and/or the specific occupation that gives a bonus to that type of weapon. Your best bet is to go-for broke right away and look for your weapon.

Want a hard-core, unforgiving experience? It can do that too. What about building a economy and profiting? Very monopoly man of you, but yes. Want to make friendships and experience heartbreak? Too many times I remember that...  WHO'S CUTTING ONIONS AGAIN?

I have a love hate relationship with this game, on one hand it's commitment to realism is admirable and makes it a very challenging game which in my opinion is a good thing ... to an extent. It's commitment to realism almost makes the game unplayable at times. Have you ever wondered what would happen if you were in a zombie apocalypse? You'd die. That's it. Videos on Youtube will portray it as a challenging  yet fun and rewarding playthrough, as if it is a roguelike and things get easier with each new survivor. But that is simply not true, I have sunk a good 20 hours and countless survivors into this game and I feel as though I am getting no better at the game. The game has copious amounts of Bullshit in it like spawning in houses currently infested with zombies. Not being able to grab items left by the survivors of your previous playthroughs. Zombies that always magically know where you are even if your sneaking around, and avoiding there sight lines and above all else a difficulty that makes the game realistic, but one of the most soul crushing annoying games of all time. The only reason I keep going back to it is in a futile attempt to prove the game wrong and say ""No, fuck you. I can beat you."" But there is no beating project zomboid, I find myself less in a manner of rage quitting and more in a manner of staring at my computer screen as I spawn in a fully infested house, and thinking ""I hate this. Why am I spending my freetime on this? On an instant death simulator."" Project Zomboid also forces you to do what I like to call virtual chores. Like reading that takes forever to build your skills, that takes far too long. I'm not against this in theory, but the game seems to want you to just stay in your house. Because realistically that's what you would do. But what the fuck is the fun in that? My virtual character is not the only one who is bored by it. But it's more ""fun"" then dying for instantly. In conclusion if Project Zomboid implemented more balance into the game I think it would be fun, perhaps making the occupations matter a bit more? Or perhaps doing a better job at allowing each death to further overall progress in some way but as is. This game is as dreadful as the apocalypse it presents. Maybe I just need to sink a bit more time into it, but as is, this game has taken an ungodly amount of energy out of me and I absolutely do not recommend this game.",1705644700,1705644700,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Gameplay Mechanics:

Project Zomboid's gameplay mechanics are a testament to its commitment to realism and player immersion. The survival elements are finely tuned, demanding strategic thinking and resource management. The day-night cycle, seasons, and weather conditions all play pivotal roles in shaping the gameplay experience.

The game's extensive skill system allows players to customize their characters with a wide range of abilities, from carpentry and cooking to medical skills. Each skill level attained feels like a hard-earned achievement, contributing to the sense of progression and growth within the game. The integration of skills into the overall survival narrative is seamless, making every learned skill a valuable asset in the struggle for survival.

The intricacies of combat in Project Zomboid add a layer of realism seldom seen in other games. Melee combat requires precision and timing, and firearms come with their own set of challenges, including attracting more undead with the noise generated. This attention to detail extends to the damage system, where injuries affect movement and overall capabilities, adding another layer of complexity to survival scenarios.

Narrative Depth:

While Project Zomboid may not have a traditional linear narrative, its emergent storytelling is a marvel. The narrative unfolds dynamically based on player choices, creating unique and personal stories for each player. The abandoned homes, remnants of the world that once was, serve as silent witnesses to the apocalypse, allowing players to piece together the events that led to the current state of affairs.

The absence of a traditional plotline is not a drawback; rather, it enhances the game's replayability as each playthrough brings new challenges and narratives. The interactions with non-playable characters (NPCs) further contribute to the narrative depth. These characters, with their own stories and struggles, add a human element to the post-apocalyptic world, making it feel lived-in and authentic.

Community Impact:

Project Zomboid's community has played a crucial role in its ongoing success. The game's development has been shaped by player feedback, with the developers actively engaging with the community to implement features, address issues, and refine the overall gaming experience. The modding community, in particular, has flourished, creating a plethora of user-generated content that expands and enhances the game in various ways.

The sense of community extends to multiplayer gameplay, where players collaborate or compete in a shared world. The dynamic interactions between players, from forming alliances to engaging in PvP encounters, create a living, breathing ecosystem within the game. This player-driven aspect of Project Zomboid adds an extra layer of unpredictability and excitement to the overall experience.

Technical Aspects:

From a technical standpoint, Project Zomboid stands out for its stability and performance. The isometric perspective, while serving the gameplay, also ensures that the game runs smoothly on a wide range of hardware configurations. The optimization allows players to immerse themselves fully in the post-apocalyptic world without being hindered by technical issues.

Regular updates and patches demonstrate the developers' commitment to refining and polishing the game. The inclusion of new features, improvements, and bug fixes showcases the ongoing dedication to delivering a high-quality gaming experience.

Innovation and Influence:

Project Zomboid's innovative approach to survival gaming has had a notable influence on the gaming industry. It has inspired other developers to explore realistic survival mechanics and emergent storytelling. The game's success as an indie title has demonstrated the viability of niche genres and the importance of player engagement in the development process.

In conclusion, Project Zomboid is more than just a game; it's a dynamic and ever-evolving experience that continues to captivate players. Its commitment to realism, extensive gameplay mechanics, emergent storytelling, community engagement, and technical prowess make it a standout title in the world of indie gaming. As players continue to shape their narratives within the post-apocalyptic sandbox, Project Zomboid remains a testament to the limitless possibilities of immersive gaming experiences. thank you for reading this  review

If that's what you are saying and seeing this your in the right place.

Okay so the game isn't a looker but that isn't where the game shine. What makes this game great is how in depth it is, If you think it you can probably find a way to do it. That's how I would explain this game. This game has a great way to customize settings to how you want to play it. you can make it relaxing like sims or hard core to where its a souls like zombie game. There is so much detail in this game as an example, Break w window with your bare hands you risk getting cut, so break it with a tool, Climb through the broken glass frame you risk getting cut so use a tool to remove broken glass from the frame. Climb through and step on broken glass and now a zombie heard you and your going back the way you came in either running for your life or wait for the zombie to fall out the window so you can smack it while its down. That is just scratching the surface.

The game does have mod support and there is a wide range of mods to customise the game how you want to experience it and best of all do it with a friend. Its a great price for what you are getting if you love zombie games give it a shot and see how long you would actually last with your wits.

Project Zomboid is what you would expect.  A holdover from the era of one life to live survival crafting with all of the pros and cons that the genre brings with it, made somewhat worse by the fiddly controls, but with more depth than I was expecting.  Just as an example, you have 4 starting maps to choose from, any one of which is large enough to play an entire game out on, except it turns out these starting locations are all part of one giant map and only a tiny portion of the cities and towns and rural areas in the game.

The tie-breaker for me between recommending this or not is how configurable the game is.  There's always a lot of tough decisions to make in game design about different mechanics that are going to appeal to different types of players.  Some people like the grind, some don't.  Some people want a run and gun, some people want to hide and build.  Well this kinda gets around that by giving you tons of customization options if you want to use them.  

The default settings are brutal realism, and realistically, 99.99% of people in a zombie apocalypse are going to die right away, otherwise it wouldn't be an apocalypse.  Realistically, guns are too loud to be practical, building fortifications is also noisy, learning a skill takes months of practice, the game is a lot more about patience, hiding, holing up and waiting for the right time to move.  It's not Left 4 Dead.  Well, unless you want to be.  You can achieve the Left 4 Dead experience by fiddling with the game configuration options the right way.  I definitely learned the appeal of this hyper realistic gamestyle but I still really don't like the grind, so I turned up XP gains, but on the other hand there are some ways to get a bunch of XP early on that I find cheesy, so I just don't use them.  It means I'm a bit behind at the beginning but then the later game doesn't drag as much.  I actually have a few different presets depending on whether I feel like a more ponderous game, or something that's got more of a Don't Starve pacing, or if I just want a run and gun splatfest.  You could even just turn zombies off and play it as a weird ""Sims but post-apocalypse"" if you wanted.

Especially at the beginning, I would tone down a lot of the brutal realism until you get your sealegs, I've even seen the dev pop into a few threads to mention that.",1705539394,1705539394,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,True

[h2]Impressions:[/h2]
Welcome to Project Zomboid, where the undead roam, your supplies dwindle faster than your optimism, and survival is about as likely as finding a unicorn in a zombie-infested forest. This game turns the zombie apocalypse into a dark comedy, with your character stumbling through the chaos like a mix between a ninja and a slapstick comedian.

[h2]What I liked:[/h2]
‚óºÔ∏è [b]Realism with a Side of Humor:[/b] Project Zomboid takes the zombie survival genre to a whole new level of realism. From crafting makeshift weapons to scavenging for canned beans, every action feels like a desperate bid for survival. Yet, the game manages to inject humor into the bleakness, turning even the direst situations into moments of absurdity.
‚óºÔ∏è [b]Dynamic World:[/b] The world of Project Zomboid evolves in real-time, and it doesn't care if you're ready for it. Seasons change, electricity fails, and your favorite safehouse might just become the next zombie hot spot. The dynamic nature of the world keeps you on your toes, ensuring that boredom is a luxury you can't afford.
‚óºÔ∏è [b]Character Customization:[/b] Forget about playing as a generic survivor; Project Zomboid lets you create a character with quirks, traits, and skills. Whether you're a master chef with a talent for carpentry or an unlucky soul who's allergic to pretty much everything, the customization adds a layer of personality to your struggle for survival.

[h2]What I didn't like:[/h2]
‚óºÔ∏è [b]Steep Learning Curve:[/b] Surviving in Project Zomboid is no cakewalk, and the learning curve is steeper than a mountain of zombie corpses. From managing your character's needs to navigating the intricacies of crafting, expect a few (hundred) deaths before you become a seasoned apocalypse pro. Trial, error, and zombie bites are your teachers.
‚óºÔ∏è [b]Graphics That Won't Win Awards:[/b] If you're expecting cutting-edge graphics that could rival Hollywood CGI, you're in for a disappointment. Project Zomboid's visuals are more retro than a disco ball at a zombie prom. The charm lies in the gameplay, not the eye candy.
‚óºÔ∏è [b]Solo Can Feel Lonely:[/b] While the game supports multiplayer, solo survival can sometimes feel like a lonely affair. The absence of human interaction, especially in a world overrun by the undead, can make you yearn for a virtual companion or two. Zombies are great and all, but a chat now and then wouldn't hurt.

[h2]Conclusion:[/h2]
Project Zomboid isn't just a game; it's a hilarious descent into the madness of survival. Its realistic mechanics, dynamic world, and character customization make it a gem in the zombie apocalypse genre. Yes, the learning curve is steep, the graphics are more retro than a '90s sitcom, and solo play can feel a bit desolate. However, if you're ready to embrace the chaos, laugh in the face of impending doom, and die a few (hundred) times, Project Zomboid is the zombie-filled sandbox where your survival story unfolds like a tragicomedy in the ruins of civilization.

In this game you learn how to herd and then walk your pet zombies around town.

There are some other things you can do in the game but the emphasis is walking, I'm serious.... the game tells you not to run because it attracts other zombies.... but it's a lie, even when you walk, the zombie from across the state will see you and join your custom built herd. Or if you are lucky (and you are 100% of the time) the game will spawn endless zomboids right in front and all around you as you walk. To add to your glorious herd.

Lol

OK ok, it true this game is greatly loved by the developer, a hardcore survival sim with insane attention to detail. { i.e, if you dont eat right you will lose/gain weight.} and so on. My boi sais its like sims but I think its got WAY more detail.

Finally, if I ever get the honor of meeting the developer in person.... I will wait till they are  relaxed, at ease, and completely distracted..... I will then proceed to kick them in the groin as hard as my little human body will muster, Ill try to lift the sorry soul right off the ground.... and they know why, and they know its well deserved

At times, I was so immersed in the world, that I would enter a similar mindset to my character. No game, (Other than Celeste) has done that for me. Combine Project Zomboids simplicity with its in-depth mechanics, and you got a game that is easy to pick up, but hard to put down. Not to mention the atmosphere of abandoned 1990s Kentucky, it looks normal for the first few days, but everything is off. Doors left open, houses barricaded, food left on countertops. Not to mention watching it all decay and get silent in real time, which is again improved by its amazing sound design. You jump at every window scrape, every off rhythm knock. After a few days, the only sound is you and the horde surrounding you. Speaking of sound, Project Zomboid has many ""Events"" that happen, such as gunshots in the distance, screams, and news choppers following you around, bringing the undead closer. (If you like those events, check out expanded helicopter events!) The dev team is also quite responsive and active, informing players about updates and things happening in the community via blog-like posts. The game is also incredibly easy to mod, with many mods adjusting major things, such as adding more cars, guns, mechanics, or even cities to visit!

TLDR: Project Zomboid is amazing, very immersive, good mod support, gave me depression.

It is there over 10 years. The graphics side is not the top notch one and there is practically zero story to follow at the first sight.

On the other hand. Graphics fits and you will not take it account after a while. It is fully up to you what the story will be. The very basic premise is there: there is no chance to survival, this is story about you and how you died.

You will try to survive for a day, week, month... and you will die most stupid ways you can imagine. Are you too loud and aggro too many, hungry, zombies? Set up your generator inside and suffocate because its exhausts? Starvation, dehydration, laceration, malnutrition, poisoning, exploding microwave, falling from highrise, real life fatigue, infection from untended wounds, cold weather, hot weather, fever... 

And then, you will find yourself surviving for x-th month in a row, with so nicely fortified base, with loads of food, self sufficient farm and sustainable source of water only to die again on something totally stupid. 

Please not, one can get bored playing single player after a while, especially if you are not RolePlaying type of player who could set his own game-goals. But there is also multiplayer where whole game gets absolutely different feeling. Plus there are some mods. And I mean SOME (a lot) mods you will subscribe to and after a while you will almost forget that they are not part of vanilla game. Ten, fifty and even maybe hundreds of mods available around can modify your experience and give you much more what you can do in this game.

Sure, Project Zomboid have its flaws, it is far from ideal, a lot of stuff is unfinished and without mods it can feel a bit empty, but it is a great zombie themed game.

While there are pros and cons to this game still being in active development, the strong modding community makes up for whatever the game lacks, and that isn't much. The game offers several game modes and challenges with a sandbox feature that lets you adjust just about every aspect of the game. Would you like your zeds to be slow moving husks that you can one shot? You got it. Would you rather they be juggernaut sprinters that instakill you? Done. Is there not enough resources to scavenge? Maybe you think there's actually too much to find and things should be more scarce. You can change that too.
With friends, the chaos can be a lot of fun. There's nothing quite like hurriedly trying to exit a building full of zeds only to trip over your buddy and be devoured. The seeds of distrust that sow themselves when one of your party is injured and you can no longer trust that he isn't infected and could turn at any moment.
I'd highly recommend giving this game a shot. Spawn, survive, die. Spawn again, survive longer, die again. Repeat. I love it. So much in fact, that I actually took the time to write my first ever review for a game.",1705420105,1705420105,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

As a huge zombie nerd, Project Zomboid has taken over my limited gaming time as of late.

Is it the leading contender for realistic graphics? No. However, it‚Äôs design gives you exactly what you need to enjoy your experience. It‚Äôs not busy, everything you see (and don‚Äôt) is essential. The audio is a big aspect as well. You can only let out a little yelp when a zombie jump scares you through a window so many times before you question how tough you really are.

A few aspects I really enjoy that I feel add to the experience is:
- You can‚Äôt tell the time until you scavenge a watch, either in a house or on a body
- The weather has lasting effects. Strip down if you‚Äôre planning on running in the sun, wouldn‚Äôt want to overheat and slow down‚Ä¶ Stay in the rain too long and you might catch a cold. Make sure you have tissue on you if this is the case‚Ä¶
- Your characters past matters! Were they a Ranger before the apocalypse? Perfect, you‚Äôre much better at traversing the trees and foraging for useful treasures. Were they a criminal? That‚Äôs cool too! Now you‚Äôre able to hot wire vehicles and proficiently sneak past those pesky undead.
- Strategy is the name of the game. If you plan on keeping a save for a while, you‚Äôre best to keep away from those bodies, even if they‚Äôre crawling through the windows. The skills you develop matter, so I suggest reading a carpentry book or two, and getting some wood over that opening‚Ä¶

The crafting system is intuitive, you‚Äôve got no shortage of options for weapons and base building, shoot, make a starry and have some cake if you‚Äôre feeling up to it! However, it takes a while of playing, dying, and messing around to get the hang of it. If you‚Äôre impatient or unwilling to adapt, you‚Äôll struggle big time. 

The support of the community is still pretty strong, the devs are still constantly in communication and releasing content, fixes, etc. 

Even if you‚Äôre not big on mods, here‚Äôs a list of one‚Äôs I find elevate your experience:
- Better Sorting by ChobitsCrazy
- Rugged Recipes by Afterworlds
- Gun Stock Attack: Remaster by SportXAI
- Map Symbol Size Slider by capsgry
- Draw On The Map - Free Hand Drawing by Notloc
- M-13‚Äôs Reading Tweaks by General M-13
- Moar Can Openers by NoctisFalco

-we build a town, out in the woods. 
-we manage to make peace with the goblin, because i gave him 50 bottles of bourbon.
-due to a zombie respawn issue, the whole town of rosewood was overrun very badly.
-town was destroyed by a horde
-me and the goblin team to kill many zombies
-our car breaks down at the town
-we flee on foot, me using a shotgun, him a DB
-he runs out of ammo first, choosing to use a pistol next
-i run out of ammo, so i pull the magnum from earlier.
-I kill lots, but the magnum runs out.
-I pull out a machete, from a looting run
-I rip and tear lots
-the goblin runs out of pistol ammo, and uses a baseball bat.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand‚Äîthe hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed‚Äîthe hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1640975867,1705318069,True,0,0,0.439574986696243286,0,True,False,True

Despite the undead delights of Project Zomboid, there are a couple of stumbling blocks in this otherwise flawless apocalypse. First and foremost, attempting to configure a multiplayer dedicated server is like trying to decipher a treasure map written in a language only zombies understand. The process could use a serious injection of user-friendliness. I find myself grappling with server settings more than I do with the undead, longing for a smoother experience when trying to enjoy the game with my fellow survivors. A little less server configuration frustration would undoubtedly go a long way in enhancing the multiplayer escapades. Secondly... still no human NPCs!

On the sunnier side of the apocalypse, Project Zomboid stands tall as one of the gaming gems that has won my undead heart. It's not just a game; it's my digital haven in the midst of chaos. From the constant thrill of survival to the joy of crafting and customization, each moment is a testament to the game's ability to turn the grim into the amusing. In a world overrun by zombies, who knew building your own fortress could be so satisfying?

The addictiveness of Project Zomboid is almost unfair. Time flies faster than my in-game character sprinting from a hungry horde, and the game's relentless pursuit of fun keeps me hooked. Multiplayer mode adds a delightful twist, turning the survival roller coaster into a team effort. Crafting in this game is an art form, and the customization options are a post-apocalyptic dream come true. The development team deserves a virtual high-five for their continuous efforts in keeping the game fresh, and the modding community adds a layer of customization that feels like Christmas morning in the apocalypse. Project Zomboid isn't just a game; it's a digital playground for those who find joy in surviving, thriving, and occasionally fending off zombies with a crafted, spiked baseball bat. It's a journey I willingly embark on, knowing that my next undead encounter is just around the corner, waiting to test my survival skills once again.",1705313291,1705313291,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

You start out, go outside, die. You start out, look around your house, try to fight a zombie, die. Find a crappy weapon, scuffle with some zombies, get bit, die. You find a weapon, and some food. you learn the ropes a bit, walk out of your house, try to hot wire a car, die. Do this again, die. For about 30 hours of playtime, you are stuck in a loop of surviving for maybe a few days, and dying. Thought you would be the main character in a zombie armageddon? Maybe after 180,452,745,44.26 something deaths.

Some pros I personally love about the game is the amount of stuff you can interact with, and change. About the whole world, you can just rip apart and build something new on top of, but zombies can and will destroy it when they find you. One thing Im extremely fascinated with is that there is not a singular house or area you cannot enter. Every door has a room. A special design, different tools, different intricate stories. Zombies, that by themselves are easily killable, but when they clump up, theres a chance you will be torn apart. You do not instantly turn, leaving you 2-3 days to find out what to do, maybe drive to louisville, do some sightseeing? Use your remaining strength to scavenge without much risk, because your pretty much dead already? Or you can run into a herd, and end it in a painful way for your character. Or, lock yourself in a room, and chug bleach  till you eventually die. Then, you make a new character. With its own talents, appearence, house, etc. You go and find your old body, pick all of its stuff up, and continue. You may die several times, and then, you will get a character that you will stick with, and survive for the rest of your playthrough. You can build an ""inpenetrable"" fortress, but when you hear those helicopter blades whirring in the sky, say your prayers, because every zombie in louisville, rosewood, west point, and riverside heard that, and they WILL come for you. Once you survive it, you will be done. You are left with the task of living out your days, with the constant passive threat of zombies. Welp, thats it!



































Personally, I love the customizaion and general detail in this game. There are many ups and downs to this game, and one i see on these reviews the most is repetitive gameplay. There is not much of an objective once you have a base, just sit and wait to die. NPC's would be a great upgrade, or objectives. The game is very easy to get rich on, but theres a lot of road blocks. Firstly, its a steep learning curve. I never quite get to the long term stage out of pure boredom. The games great, but I never get a character over a month life-span. If your first starting out, I strongly reccomend sandbox or builder mode and learn the ropes. Then, when it gets boring, add mods! I stopped at 67 hours of playtime due to boredom, and now im at 113 hours. Mods at  a bit more meaning to the game.

Survival Mechanics Hunger and thirst, her constant foes, Yet she braved the trials, as the hunger grows. Managing her character's every need, In this virtual world, where her spirit was freed.

Base Building Fortifying walls, a fortress she raised, A shelter from chaos, where her soul blazed. Traps and defenses, against the zombie horde, In this virtual haven, her strength soared.

Exploration Through houses and stores, she dared to roam, In search of supplies, she made her home. Venturing into the unknown, her spirit unbound, Project Zomboid's world, her playground.

However, this game is based off of micromanagement with a control scheme akin to that of total war (Considering the amount of individual controls there are for different actions). This game is not about winning so don't get mad when you die. Yes, this game has some bugs, but in my over 300 hour playtime, the few I have encountered have mostly been because of mods. The game is not finished yet. The dev team is quite small so major updates are few and far between. There is no end goal (yet) aside from the ones you decide to put upon yourself. This game is a realism survival sim with an emphasis on properly managing the resources at your disposal. Mistakes can be made that WILL end your playthrough. The game is not about making you happy, it is about making you struggle. In spite of all of the perceived flaws i have previously mention in the review, I cannot recommend this game more (Partially because of the masochistic pleasure you get from building you character then losing all you progress). This game has numerous features that I have never seen in any other game. The modding community is one of the best communities on steam (imo) simular to that of rimworld. The game focuses itself on you to make you struggle to survive and the main focus of the game is getting yourself out of sticky situations. IF YOU DO NOT TAKE RISKS IN THIS GAME YOU WILL NOT HAVE FUN. Leaving negative reviews under this game is ignorant if you have under 100 hours (I have 300 and still have new experiences in this game every time I play). So overall, if this doesn't sound like something you would like, go play something else. P.S.  If you are feeling bored of your playthrough of PZ I highly recommend a mod called 10 years later. <3 ",1653921906,1705183796,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,True

It's been almost 13 years (march 2011) since the development began, and 10 years since it was first released on Steam, and it really doesn't feel like it.

People have been waiting for more than 2 years for the next build (namely build 42), and it does not feel like it's gonna be released in the next week, as we don't even have an ETA.

No NPCs (build 43... I'll die of old age before I see it released), no hunting... Imagine buying an Early Access game to support development, only to discover that it's gonna be your kids who will enjoy the finished game (if it ever gets finished).

The game (allegedly) generated 108 million dollars in 10 years (that's 10 millions per year, mind you), it makes sense that they make it last as long as they can... At the expense of players who HAVE to rely on the modders to get a more acceptable game to play with.

I have had this game since like forever, and it doesn't feel like any progress has been made (it has, but it's eminently negligible given the enormous time span), and I feel scammed.

So, no, I cannot recommend buying this game until NPCs and quests and things like that have been added to the game, and it probably won't be until year 2027 or something.",1705175465,1705175592,False,468,51,0.697337210178375244,0,True,False,True

Seriously, get this game. It's cruel, punishing, and has a massive learning curve. But when you mess with the insane amount of settings to tailor the experience to yourself, and start to get things right, it is so damn satisfying. It's honestly one of my favourite games and definitely the best thing I played last year.

Personally I find this game very good, because you can really get immersed into the zombie apocalypse theme. The game itself has some ''problems'' which can be annoying but many quality of life mods fix these and it's pretty easy to install them and use them so game feels less complicated at times.

I am currently loving the game and the online community on most servers I tried are really nice, it's one of those games where you can relax but then still get your heart racing because you misjudged the situation and get totally owned by zombies. The game itself is not easy, has a decent learning curve but when you get a hang of it, which you can really fast if you search around on youtube for guides you will have a lot of fun. If you have friends that can play with you I can see sinking at least 500+ hours.

There's plenty of option to tweak for setting up the world to your playing style, so you can make it way harder or much more forgiving.
Keep in mind a large portion of the game play is highly akin to The Sims, in the sense that you're constantly taking care of your characters needs.

I initially didn't think I'd like this game, and quite frankly I was shocked to find I did, I didn't choose to buy but was asked to by a friend of mine. It's definitely one of those games that can hold you for a long time if you set your goals right, can't play it without grabbing half of the mod workshop, but I love modding games so that might just be me. (I've literally never played this game vanilla and don't plan to.)

You can adjust the zombies to be traditional Romero zombies, or fast 28 days later zombies. There's even a mode for to have zombies sprint at night (or day) and shuffle during the day (or night) for a I am Legend vibe. It can even be a decent farming simulator if you turn zombies off.

- Friendly Community with thousands of recommended mods

- Realistic Game UI and Game Function

- Hard at the beginning which keeps you intrigued

- Once you understand the basics, its just pure personal game-style

- Vast range of skills which you can personalize at the character creation before spawning in

I would continue writing without hesitation about this game.
If you have the chance to buy Project zomboid, do it. The choice will not be regretted.

Its the end of the world and you are presumably the last man standing in whatever town you choose. Like, do you really fault them that you'd need to study a million hours, deal with water shutting off, or just be unlucky enough to pull into a house with 30 zomboids? That's just a real scenario.


Even if you die alot and think you're doing ass, it almost becomes the point of the game. Rolling the dice and watching sims die. Maybe quickly. Maybe after a crazy week long grind. Regardless, its those tense moments that the game shines. That and watching your dumb character in jorts and a wifebeater get mopped.

If you really are just super turned off to that kind of experience, there ARE settings you can mess with. With the right settings you can pretty much have just a ""a sort of stop watch"" sims 1 remake. Would really like to see more put towards that actually. It'd be neat having a pre apocolypse life simulator and then the option to click back to when SHTF

There is permadeath in the sense that the character is permanently lost when dying, but you can create a new character in the same world. You lose all stats from the previous character though, which is a big deal, and therefore I usually just start over.

Play 'easy mode' first, and gradually ramp up the difficulty, and that has been my experience so far. It's just... fun! 

Every now and again I've also gone mod-hunting and added a new mod or two and now I'm easily in the hundreds of mods. It's just... Little fixes for little issues or gameplay changes that are fun or neat or give a better taste then the default game that still needs time to bake...

Playing a role of sorts can also be pretty fun for imagining what your character might do given their situation and what not. Put limits, challenges, w/e. It's got a lot of replayability when you try to focus a certain kind of gameplay style for a specific character until death or 'success.' The youtuber community also does a decent job of selling the stories the game can tell, which makes it even easier to be invested in the game via that method. (Got me interested, then a sale happened I couldn't control myself and bought it. xP)

Before I've known what happened I've already got 203 hours in the game... Just. BAM. Time sink. I've only done 3 characters so far, but I'm enjoying the process so far. There is just so much you can tweak about the gameplay to make it challenging or not challenging in certain ways - so if you find a mechanic or gameplay aspect to be unpleasant you can likely change it or mod it to fit your needs.

For a little gameplay context: My first character I played unmodded. I kinda just stuck it out in one town and was gradually getting a nice base set up in the very house I started in. Gradually upping my skills, my stats, my growing dragon-hoard of resources through frequent looting and killing the local zombies... (I've turned zombie respawning off since I felt that made the game more real/fun to me and kept it off.) Then the helicopter event happened... and since I had lots of ammo and I felt pretty confident about fighting the zombies up to this point and the local area should have been... relatively clear, I decided to take it on. It worked out pretty well for a good 10 minutes.... but the zombies kept coming, and they didn't stop coming... I got my shotgun out and started blasting... I thought surely the swarms would peter out a bit after blasting the hoards for a while... but... more kept coming. and before I knew it, my character was getting exhausted, their obese fat ass huffing and puffing and running around and shooting haphazardly and before I knew it... I was caught, and dragged down to be devoured. AAH! First defeat: I was too cocky.

...So I rolled up character #2... After a very heavy modding spree. This time I picked a bit of a remote area and set up my home base and cleared the zombies out of a much larger area in case of future helicopter events. Worked out great! I was doing super well and gradually becoming OP and shit... except I died by dismantling a stairway underneath me that I had built on the outside of my house and fell to my death. Ooph. TBF, I had fallen once already so I was in bad shape before hand but... yeah. That one kinda sucked. Second defeat... Incautious stupidity.

Third character! ... Uh. Well, I couldn't find a nice place to set up a base (I was too picky...) So I ended up camping out in a school bus with an interior from the RV Interior mod. I was doing pretty solid for the resources I'd gathered and was peaking a lot faster thanks to certain advantages. Character was ripped~ ... But I got greedy. I thought I could handle the amped up zombie swarms I'd set to spawn, and for the most part I had been right. Except... my character was getting not exhausted, but actually sleepy-tired, plus I had my bags full of loot from my latest haul and I didn't want to drop it all... and ran into a swarm of zombies that had migrated into the area right next to my van... I tried to get in the van but was cut off by a zombie... tried to back away while fighting them off, but my character was rapidly getting exhausted from all the loot they were carrying + tiredness so their dmg output sunk down so fast... and soon the zombies converged on them despite their still surprisingly effective blows and caught them, I tried to run one more time, but they grabbed and dragged her down... devoured! ... My third defeat. To Greed.

... I'm planning on rolling up my fourth character with a world full of intact cars and plenty of fuel... and the speed demon trait. I'm going to run over so many zombies. 

Anyway, uh... I hope you enjoyed the brief tangent. I recommend this game. A lot. Have fun~!",1704866583,1704866583,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

This game, in my opinion, is a hyper realistic zombie survival sandbox with a lot of interesting systems that works pretty well together and I would say that it has more complex game mechanics than most survival game out there.

Pros: 
- Custom configurations for the sandbox world to fit the needs of each player and make the game have the infinite replayability.
- Different modes are available to choose like single player, self hosting peer to peer server, dedicated server and especially support local split screen co-op, which works pretty well with Steam Remote Play Together.
- A huge map to explore, each place offers a different loot spawn distribution, as well as different aesthetic reflected on building and furniture style. More portion of the map is added each major patch and the devs are also planning to make a pseudo-infinite map where the edges of the map are filled with unexplored nature wild land, instead of abrupt dark border.
- The world feels real and alive with a lot of systems that goes hand in hand, like weather and time of the day that affects fishing and foraging, zombies thickly spawn within the big city, gunshots or helicopters that lure away the zombies, etc.
- Progression system or leveling system, although is a pain to go through, it seems reasonable enough to not feel like a chore or a factor just to extend the playtime and replace the main experience.
- This game has one of the most active modding community, with a lot of brilliant ideas to transform the game into a different experience, whether it is addition to game mechanics, QoL, or new map location.
- On the developer side, they are super active on continuing on with new features and stick to their roadmap. Although the updates are slow and very infrequent, they always make sure to keep players up to date with their bi-weekly Thursdoid blog to show the progress and they have always delivered quality updates in the past.

Cons:
- Multiplayer was reworked to be much better than before, but it still feels a bit of a desync from time to time.
- Zombies even with the most difficult configuration can be easy to predict, which would make the game easier the more you play.
- Building system is available, but there are still a few amount of bugs that players have to work around.
- No official server hosted by the developers.
- Although a tutorial is available, there aren't any real directions for new players. There are a lot of system that has a lot of impact on a playthrough, but never was mentioned or explained to, though it makes sense that this is not their main priority at the moment.",1587350755,1704838897,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

It's packed with so many intricate concepts and it only continues to get better. If you're looking for a game where there's realistic survival aspects like eating, drinking, mood regulation, weather effects, building, crafting, enormous maps with thousands of places to loot or to turn into a base, skills to level up, skills like fishing, mechanics (yes you can work on cars and drive them), carpentry, farming, metalworking, first aid, weapon skills like blunt weapons and bladed weapons, cooking, etc. Then this game is definitely one for you! It is a steep learning curve but I think it's well worth it! For $20, you should give it a shot.

There are some things I wish they would add like some NPCS here and there, like traders or survivors passing by the area or potential NPC raiders or animals for farming and hunting but I did hear that that may be in the works somewhere.

Project Zomboid is overpriced, badly balanced, makes its systems annoying to manage basic gameplay, and difficult to enjoy.  Provided good / bad Trait misinformation is worse than nothing at all, melee and ranged combat is janky and never improves, the car system is more punishing than rewarding, farming / fishing is tacked on with 0 gameplay elements, and the inventory management is objectively bad and reminds me of games from 25 years ago.  You literally spend the majority of your time weighing your boredom with grinding skills against risk of dying in shitty combat mechanics.  Then there are rAnDoM eVEnTs that basically frenzy zombies and force you indoors for even more boring non-gameplay--or you can try to just keep playing and then be forced to start all over when a group of 25 zombies swarms you.  

THAT SAID:  if you feel like being generous with your time, you can visit the vast mod community that makes this game worth playing.  There's a mod for just about everything under the sun, from making inventory management tolerable, cars that have variety, weapons that don't feel useless (combat will stay fundamentally awkward), food and fishing mods that make the game less of a completely unfun chore after the power and water go off.  There is tremendous depth to this game in terms of replayability and gameplay, but you need to go to third party mod developers to find it.

The people collecting money for this game have plainly been doing little more than milking lukewarm updates for a steady paycheck for over a decade.  They boast ""free updates"" but the updates are overwhelmingly garbage that nobody needs or wants and does nothing for creating a zombie game.  The next big mod is supposed to be ""farm animals"", in one of the most obvious failures of prioritization and time management.  The developers do not use or allude to any project map.

There are no NPCs, dogs (despite ubiquitous doghouses), zombie dogs, vehicles other than cars, zombie animals, animals in general, special types of zombies, really the game lacks anything interesting that would shake up gameplay. I still found it kind of absorbing for a while but eventually discovered that on default settings the entire world is swarming with an endless tide of eagle-eyed and bat-eared undead, especially, for some strange reason, in the middle of small-population rural satellite towns and the deep forest.

Also, for some reason my character takes half an hour in real time to find a stick and a rock in the forest with which to craft a stone axe. I can't say that I recommend this game.

A few points:
1. Even though the game doesn't explain anything to you (except a couple of vital tips in a tutorial), the core mechanics are rather basic, which makes the game a bit stale once you clock ~200 hours in it (even with all those challenges). That is until you decide to install 150 mods, that will turn a game about hitting zombies with a crowbar and collecting rainwater into a full-scale Factorio/Silent Hill/Stardew Valley-type of product. The mods create a whole new experience and there's literally anything you could think of. From cars to the ability to shit your pants (literally). Maps, vehicles, new mechanics, clothes, weapons, you name it. PZ also allows you to change sandbox options. If you want every single zombie to carry a gun with ammo, every single car to have keys in the ignition with a full tank and don't want zombies on the map whatsoever, you can do it.
2.  The game gets updates rarely. And it could be a big issue, but the amount of mods the community releases weekly negates it. The developers are planning to release build 42 sometime this year, though.
3. Multiplayer sometimes is a pain in the ass. If you are planning to jump on your private server with your friends, get ready for lags and disconnects. Worth mentioning though that I tried to play on HEAVILY modded private servers, so there's the chance that you will not have the issues I had.
4. The game works the same way Mount and Blade works, more or less. It doesn't try to entertain you, you have to do it yourself and set your own goals. The game also doesn't have any sort of finale (your death is what you can call a 'finale'). 
But this aspect could be changed with mods.  

Overall, it is probably the best zombie survival game out there. The next update should be immense and the only thing I'm afraid of is the amount of mods I will have to delete/update after the release.",1704761311,1704761311,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

BUT due to the very nature of the game I'm finding it stressful, and the aching of my body from being constantly on edge while playing is difficult to tolerate.  What I'm saying is that the game is causing me physical pain. 

As such I would only recommend it to specifically those who enjoy survival horror and / or roguelike games.  Anyone who gets invested in their characters or progress in games would probably do well to give this a miss... as well as anyone easily disheartened by failure.   This is a game that can bring about enjoyment, pain and depression in equal measure. 
It is also worth noting that while this has controller support, it is kinda bad...  and playing Mouse & WASD causes me severe RSI, which just added to the overall physical discomfort. 

Plus despite my opinion of this game generally being a pained positive, I will note that the EULA and general tone the game takes towards the player is a little too sarcastic and antagonistic.   Just because you're bigging up the ""everyone dies eventually"" angle is no reason to be mocking about it.

This game has been around and around. Revisiting the game years on, I keep thinking, 'WTF, this hasn't been fixed yet??'... For example: 1) Grinding 2 months in game just to die to a zombie bite while stuck in an animation while climbing through a window across a table... stupid. 2) Grinding 2 months in game to accidentally auto climb over a wall you're not even facing to have your face eaten by Z's on the other side... dumb. 3) Vehicles can be really annoying, getting stuck on bushes in tall grass, etc. not shifting to the next gear and actually slowing down for no reason... WTF... 4) Right clicking to cook and being shown a massive list of ingredients that goes off the page with little numbers that make no sense... Come on. JUST FIX THIS STUFF.

I'm okay with permadeath, it makes this game super intense, which I love. But, you gotta make the combat super slick to have a fighting chance... which, 10 years into this game's development... it's not super slick, it's kinda' just OK... 

Will revisit again in a couple of months when I forget how frustrating it is to die while stuck in an animation...

At first i struggled. A lot. I still do but something just keeps bringing me back. 
Maybe its the fact that the developers provided consistent updates, it's a labour of love and it shows. Perhaps its the curiosity of how I will next succumb to a death. 

I've taken the time to make different settings based on different zombie lore. 
Realism being somewhat close to real time with only walking zombies that have little to no sense of direction or smell. No re-spawning gives me the feeling that i'm genuinely alone in the world. 
The point being, you can dictate the play, the world is yours.

I haven't even mention the skills and crafting yet and believe me when I say I have went these 60 hours with barely any focus on them. Partly because I don't normally survive long enough to work on them but ultimately because its fun anyway. There's also multiplayer and a multitude of mods which only add to the depth.

The first time you play this game you will not make it through the first night but keep in mind that the game itself is too complete, it has many mechanics that will make you stay playing a whole afternoon, trying not to die and finding some things to increase your level of skill, it's not just about looting and shooting zombies, no matter what. In the end you will die, the game takes care of warning you before starting and you think: ""I can win this game"" and believe me you can't, at some point you will make a mistake and you will die from the infection. or a horde of zombies that you didn't expect.
In fact it's quite fun and even more so if you play with friends, you can even make your own rules, change the activity of the zombies or how difficult it is to find loot.

The only people who don't think so are autistic to the point where doing taxes would be equal to the same fun as Zomboid. I actually enjoy the difficulty and I don't shy away from difficult games. But a lot of mechanics don't have any micro aspect of the game that is fun and repeatable. The difficulty is all in the macro where it doesn't matter the end game and It's the RPG equivalent of Spongebob and Patrick sitting in the box of ""Imagination"". 

Essentially, the game is well put together from an RPG stat-based game. One of the best on the market right now. But taking out skill input and barely any end game makes the game a snooze-fest. If you want the alcohol version of video games, play zomboid.

But if you want to know, what I don't like about the game inside the game excluding my personal preferences (I have more hours on another account), I'd say the skill system is pretty bad. To have so many that take so much grinding in a non-perpetual system that is tedious to say the least is not necessarily fun.  Things like carpentry take forever to level up and the lvl 10 rewards of getting there is pretty lame. I also don't see the purpose for many of the skills themselves, especially when you can pick up furniture. The games interface as well is actually piss poor for something that has been in development for 10 years. 

I personally think the no-hand holding, and non-easy mode intuitiveness is of course what someone people like that gives this game positive reviews. But I would personally say that, there is a right and a wrong way of making a game like this difficult and unforgiving, and the philosophy behind how they thought it should be today, is not what I would agree with. It's personally really sad that this type of bare-bones, realistic, ""simulation"" type zomboid survival game is great but malnourished within the gaming industry. So I kinda blame the industry for not having something better than zomboid and we have to wait years for another attempt at this type of game. But if you enjoy games that are hard without actually making you physically exert yourself and enjoy arbitrary stats and prep resource management, you'd have a field day.",1698868129,1704666100,False,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,True

The more I play and learn, the more I realize how little I have experienced. It just astounds me how much can be accomplished with every piece of loot I come across. From fixing your vehicle, building animal traps, fixing a broken melee/range weapon, or ingredients for cooking. There seems to always be many uses to any object you can pick up. I really enjoy all of the sandbox settings available. Especially all of the Zombie lore and Advanced zombies settings. I can easily see myself gaining 1000 hours still getting excited when I start a new game. All of these settings in my arsenal makes this game play ever changing. If you find yourself feeling bored playing, well, just start new and create new zeds that sprint! Maybe you only want them active at night. Maaaaybe you want them to migrate in massive hordes. Turn of the zombie re-spawn, and try to secure a town. Honestly if you get bored it's because you don't allow yourself to tread blindly into the unknown. This game is built for you to die, and you will MANY times. Thankfully PZ gives you the option to start a new character in the same timeline, or you can start a whole new game. So if you had a good run with a character and you aren't ready to let go of all the loot. Just create a new character and go enjoy all your shiny. Lastly, traits. I was a bit skeptical at first, but they have grown on me. It's not just buffs/debuffs. They add details to a life before the apocalypse started. Allowing you to form a life story for the character you create. Then you die. 

It's hard for me to have a dislike for PZ. There isn't anything I would want changed that can't be done by mods. I believe Project Zomboid is top star. I'll have sand in all the creases from playing this game.",1704656934,1704657208,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

First, the game is very well made. The graphics are just good enough that they don't hold back the game play and the loot management is done right. You spawn into a world (either a vanilla world or you create a sandbox world with your own parameters), and then you survive in a zombie infested town. Find a weapon, learn to fight small groups of zeds, find a car, establish a suitable base, find a generator and a source of gas, and survive (cook, grow food, improve your skills and fitness, etc.) 

Project Zomboid feels good to play: the combat (after a slight learning curve) is tough, but fair, the amount of things you can loot is extremely varied, and the map is huge (and keeps getting bigger). Whether single player or multiplayer, the amount of content here is staggering (and a bit overwhelming on a first play-through). 

The game also offers a lot in the way of base building. The carpentry and metal working skills allow you to bolster a preexisting structure, or simply build and entire structure from scratch. You can build walls and windows, plumb a sink to rain collector barrels for fresh water, grow and cook your own food, and trap animals for meat. 

This game also has a great modding community. There are mods for almost anything you can think of. Anything from small quality of life mods, to huge game changing mods that add new vehicles, new weapons, and some even adding game objectives.

The only thing I'm slightly dissatisfied with is the endgame, which can feel a little boring once you've established a functioning base and have good weapons. The devs do plan on adding more late game content for build 42 (animal husbandry, masonry, machining, blacksmithing, so I'm sure the endgame will be a lot more interesting with these implementations.

Project Zomboid is a game for someone with an imagination that enjoys a challenge. It's a game I keep coming back to for its tense atmosphere, it's engaging world and its great community. For anyone interested in this game, I would suggest starting in sandbox mode, enabling multi-hit (so your weapons can hit multiple zeds, and turning off zombie respawns, as this can become tedious if you're struggling with the combat.)

Enjoy this great game.",1704611351,1704611351,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

PZ is my favorite game, and I'm always happy to tell people about it! Don't let the Sims 1 graphics fool you: this is a cleverly made experience in being a normal person -- not a superhero -- in the zombie apocalypse. The difficulty is customizable, even before the expanded options of mods. 

A mysterious illness broke out on July 1st, 1993. The radio said everyone in Kentucky should quarantine and go to ground. 8 days later, you emerge, your stores of food exhausted. You find that your entire city has been turned into the <s>walking</s> shambling dead. You are alone.

The musical score beautifully compensates for the dated graphics, giving such a pull into the atmosphere that you can feel truly immersed, even if you usually don't go for isometric views. This game IS a beautiful time-sink. Give it a go.

If you like the concept of a zom-poc game, give PZ a go. If you like Dwarf Fortress*, Rimworld, or Kenshi: also give PZ a shot. If you don't know or care but you're somehow reading this, give this game a shot.

If you're on the fence, and you have a friend with the game, use Steam's Remote Play option to try before you buy..

The bad thing is performance. I find it difficult to wrap my head around how a 2D game from 2013 can be that lag when there are too many zombies around. My PC handles other AA Games quite quickly, but It suffers in this one.",1704565355,1704565355,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Beds do not have sheets on them 90% of the time. Why? Because you can use sheets to cover windows. It would make the game too easy if you had enough bedsheets, so the game starves you of them. Never mind that there is no realistic reason for them missing.

Kitchens filled to the brim with cans are almost always missing a can opener. This is because the game needs you to go from house to house to risk being killed, never mind it's completely unexplainable otherwise.

Public places festering with zeds... while all doors and windows are closed. Is there a story here, like a survivor let 20 zombies enter, then closed all the doors and then let themselves be killed? Is that a frequent occurrence Knox Country?

The investigative instinct of zombies matches the one of Vince Gilligan's characters. If they could browse the internet, they would find your location through your IP address and pay you a visit. A lot of times I would break line of sight in crouch mode for a minute and they would still be on the chase.

All these things, plus melee combat (the core of this game) being reductive and clunky just destroy my immersion.

""You can customize your game how you want though"", yes, I did, and the only thing I realized is that everything is extremely slow, boring and uninviting. Dying was the only thing that kept me from noticing that before. Everything, from reading books to building, is just watching bars fill slowly(even at max speed). This game needs to kill you over and over to keep you from noticing you are bored.

Beating all the odds stacked against you is the only engagement you're gonna have. The game knows it, hence the ""this is how you died"" at the start: you cannot avoid your fate, only postpone it. If it was possible for you to win, if there was a cure against zombification even in the form of amputating an arm bitten by a zombie, the game would just be tedious.

tl;dr: this game is immersion-breaking, boring at best and needlessly frustrating at its worst. Terrible, one-dimensional combat. You can do an infinite amount of things, and they are all equally uninviting. Not for me.",1704553914,1704553914,False,1,0,0.470661014318466187,0,True,False,True

It had something of a rocky ride in those early years, with the game being leaked and, an infamous story at the time, the theft of two laptops containing a bunch of code which hadn't been backed up: Developers The Indie Stone would, rather winningly, go on to give an industry talk titled 'How (Not) To Make a Game'.

It now looks like Indie Stone will need to write another presentation: How to turn your passion project into a viral hit ten-and-a-half years after release. While everyone else was scoffing turkey and leftovers, Project Zomboid's player numbers have been going through the roof. The cause is a major update that pretty much overhauls the game from the ground-up.

It can't be over-emphasised how much Build 41 improved Project Zomboid. Among many other things it introduced a new animation and movement system, vastly improved multiplayer functionality, a new city, a new combat system, a bunch of new systems for things like injuries and foraging, and too many other things to list. It almost feels like the developer could have just stuck a 2 on the end and sold this as the sequel.

The rise in players coincides with the build's release: in November 2021 it averaged around 7,000 daily players, a highly respectable figure for an indie game anyway, but from early December the player numbers start to go through the roof. Zomboid had never broken five figures before but on December 9 the test branch of this new update was released and it smashed through.
