The game has some issues with cut-scenes, but while actually fighting and going through levels, I had no stuttering of any kind. Only cut-scene had framerate issues and that was near the end of the game.

The Combat: Instantly superior to Nioh 2. Timed dodging that effects all enemies, not just humans, leaving them open to attacks is outstanding. This has to be the most fair Team Ninja game I have ever played in terms of combat. Being able to dodge through spells, even reflect some is incredibly pleasing. If Nioh 2 had this type of dodge, I'd be super thrilled.

Weapons no longer have stances, all weapons are fast, even the heavy ones. This a better change from Nioh 2, as I would ignore heavy stance for being too slow. You can go through most of the game as a physical build only. I used Wood element at 60 for Hp, 20 each in Metal and Earth elements, so I could use magic, but only really used lightning weapon enchantment.

As a heads up, the 2nd to last boss, is the cheap boss so far to me. It constantly floats around the arena, and seems to ignore all status ailments as it never had lightning/Poison build-up icons appears. It hardly uses red special attacks, making its stamina bar go up to do fatal blows extremely time consuming. Because it floats throughout the fight, short ranged weapons like the Cestus, make it also difficult to damage the boss physically. This is by far the longest fight in the game. I am sure if you like multiple play styles, there's a better way to do the fight.

Level Maps can be annoying, as there is no fast travel between points on the same map. So gathering collectibles is tedious. Upside, once you complete a map, all shortcuts stay unlocked, so gathering what you might have missed isn't too painful. The game could use maps since it's not one big map, not sure why that's not included.

Main hub village is garbage, straight annoying, it's small plateaus connected by small vines, constantly able to fall off them into the abyss. whoever made this village, who hurt you so? 

The story, is meh, it's a dynasty warriors story. Only annoyance was Hong Jing, the English voice actress breathes and grunts excessively. She's considerably louder than everyone else, as if she has the recording mic against her mouth.

The DLC 3 Upheaval of Jingxiang has completely broken content for me. After finishing the first mission of the DLC (Cut-scene finished) the game crashed and I can no longer play the save as every time i click continue game the game goes into loading screen and crash again!.

So far I have tried the following

- Restart / Re-install games
- Click load game and select the save rather than continue game.
- Install latest GPU driver
- Adjusted graphic setting including - Change window/full screen modes, Turn on/off HDR, Change resolutions and Turn on/ff V-sync.
- Use backup saves from my own and other players' to REPLAY this mission!!!
- Skip the cut-scene

Non of them works!!! Guaranteed crash after the first mission and broken save after that.

I can't believe the dev rushed to release a complete edition without addressing these game broken issues! 

Bought season pass and waited months just for this!

 I strongly recommend not to buy any Team Ninja PC port.

Might refund. Not sure. Willing to wait for a patch. God knows how long that'll take.

Very fun game when it works though. Although annoying when you parry and the character dodges instead. You have to be very careful with your inputs. Not a big fan of the forced A.I. either.

There is a certain chance of the game crashing when playing animations.

Indubitably, the combat system is jolly good, fast paced and the boss fights are very entertaining, just like combats in Anime. 
There is a wide selection of weapons to choose from, although not all of them are based on the historical design of the Later Han Dynasty, there are some from pre-Qin rea, some from Song, Ming and Qing dynasties, at least they are different from each other.

(Also, small little future edit, I'm a bit salty they added a baseline Complete Edition as kind of a 'F-you' to early backers (or impatient gamers buying this on potential and copium)- great for future owners, but shows how poor the game performed.)

This game is hard and easy. The more simplistic approach to combat means veteran gamers can easily best its systems, but makes every boss fight (and certain demon enemies) a brick wall for more casual players. Combat is compromised of basic attacks combined with 6 martial arts skills you can weave into your combos alongside 8 potential spells (hugely improved over its launch version). Not to mention the lightning pace of combat itself combined with particles splashing, exploding, and vomiting everywhere.

If you were holding off from Wo Long because Nioh 2 combat > Wo Long, rest easy knowing that is not particularly true anymore!

The level design (and art design to a small degree) in this game, is complete @$$. It really feels like some of the worse parts of Nioh 1. I can't tell you the amount of times I got astoundingly confused or turned around because war-torn China looks like a disgusting mess of red glowy vines and unremarkable burning structures.

Many would say, you don't play a Team Ninja game for its story or writing, and they'd be partially right, but, this game can't stop throwing historical figures and events at you without much player context. Yeah, Nioh 1&2 did the same, but there was some pacing in between introducing up to three historically important characters per session. Without knowledge of Chinese history, [strike]the writing and narrative is terrible. They make terrible use of the context of their timeline. [/strike] you'd just be strung along a random wave of events with some sense of plot. I can't judge how bad the writing is because I don't understand the cultural complications that are happening and the importance or non-importance of everything really.

The sounds are chunky and nice but the soundtrack is completely forgettable. I won't blame the voice actors for the bad English dub but it's not good; my brother walked in on me during a cutscene and he said it reminded him of those parody-like dubs old Chinese movies got.

The non-English dubs are pretty good though.

One good positive is that the animation quality has vastly improved since Nioh 2, but you can't really appreciate it since its at 200% animation speed.

The loot is.. overwhelming. Veteran players will say, use the auto-sell/salvage to your advantage, and they're right, but then there's still like hundreds of stats to account for, ""Damage against Spirit"" - ""Spirit Sustainability"" - ""Divine Beast Gain %"" etc. etc.

[strike]All in all, I think it's an ""O.K."" game, but I expected much more from this studio especially with their portfolio. 6.9/10[/strike] [b]Wo Long is fine, it's fine.

There is no easy way to change input on controller, so if you don't like the input they have chosen, you have 2 options.

1. Keep playing till you get used to it

2. change the input throught the steam input.

The problem with nr. 2 is that the ui-prompts will not change according to this and actually makes it a lot more confusing than if it was as is. There is also no way to do this, as this game as any other game made after like 2010, do not store the assets locally. There is also, as of now, no mod (something like IGP for dark souls) that allows you to change this.

Also the combat. Against bosses, the fighting and parrying actually feel pretty nice, but against normal enemies and non-boss encounters it is not satisfying at all, it does not feel like you are actually the one fighting, and this is not due to the partner you travel with, but rather the fact that all the enemies have no personality, they barely display their attacks, which just makes it feel like you are hitting parry randomly. You might say that i just suck, but i have finished every fromSoft souls game and have never experienced this boring of a fighting system. And concidering that bosses are just like 5% of the game, and the rest is searching different areas, figthing enemies, leveling up and supposedly ""getting better"", I can't justify the fighting mechanic just for the bosses. 

Also the game is really dark. Not dark as in the story, but rather the lighting. When fighting certain bosses or fighting through certain areas, you can't even see what they are doing. even playing in a totally dark room with high brightness setting.

As mentioned earlier, due to the fighting mechanic most of the time being boring and unpredictable, you never feel like you are getting better. in a well made souls like, you have to feel like you are getting better after a certain curve and you understand how the game can unvelop, as this is the best part of these games. However, even after winning against many bosses, progressing through the story for a good while and traversing multiple areas, I still felt like I was a beginner and hadn't even grasped the system yet. Thus it sealed the deal for me to not continue with the game. 

I Went in this game not expecting a fromsoft title, but rather it's own style of game, cause if I expect a fromsoft title from every ""Souls-like"", then I will never enjoy the genre, just the company. This has been no problem in other non-fromsoft ""souls like"", cause i enjoy the difficulty and the bosses, but this one just didn't do it for me, and really is not worth the 59$ price tag. If you didn't quite like the normal souls-like formula and you are more into hack-n-slash's you might enjoy this one more than me at least.",1707304316,1707304316,False,9,1,0.498470962047576904,0,True,False,False

My verdict remains the same though and I do not recommend this game.

While most of the technical issues have been fixed, the core aspects of the game are still very flawed.

The combat is heavily simplified compared to Team Ninja's other games like Nioh or Strangers of Paradise, making it less engaging.

At the same time, there as over-reliance on the game's parry mechanic, which is enforced to an extreme in some of the boss fights, especially the DLC boss fights which often force you into perfect parrying a long combo chain for a very small opening to get in a hit. It made me feel like playing a really long Quicktime Event and that's just not very enjoyable. These Boss fights also dragged on for way to long, heavily overstaying their welcome.

While the game has an audience, there are just to many flaws in the finer details for me to call it ""good"" and it is not surprising at all that the number of active players post-release has significantly dropped behind other similar games of the Souls-like Genre.

The overall Mixed Reviews and the Negative Reviews for the DLC's are, unfortunately, all very justified.

There's to many flaws in Wo Long as a whole, ranging from less interesting combat, an over-reliance on the parry mechanic and poor Boss balancing (especially in the DLC Bosses) for Wo Long to achieve greatness.

While some people will enjoy Wo Long, most people will not.",1677897312,1706938318,False,161,12,0.624181807041168213,0,True,False,False

[b] Played on: [/b]
PC (970 GTX GPU. 8gb DDR3 RAM, i7 4770K CPU) at medium settings capped at 60fps via in-game settings
Steam Deck (LCD 256GB model) at low settings capped at 40fps via steam deck settings

[b] Stats at the time of this review: [/b]
Level 377
Dual Sword build, light armour 
Water Primary stat, Fire secondary stat


[b] Pre-release: [/b]
Leading up to the release of Wo-Long, I was looking forward to what they were doing with Wo Long. I had got to play it at a public event and liked what I saw in pre-release footage. The Three Kingdoms setting made me want to plan out a sort of ‘Lu Xun’ build with dual swords. However, the first hurdle came with the launch of the demo on Steam.

The demo was not optimised (or appeared to be not optimised) as I tried on my 2 setups, achieving no greater than 30fps regardless of what settings I changed. I hoped to see this improved on launch to at least have a smooth experience as the combat required it.

[b] Launch: [/b]
Although minor performance improvements had been made (I could get 40 fps on PC consistently) the Steam Deck still had troubles, leading to challenges in those first hours of play. The general traversal of each level was enjoyable, but any large mobs / bosses (particularly those with flashy effects) would tank the framerate and make it difficult to react to enemies, leading to some frustrating deaths. It basically meant that the Steam Deck was out of service for bosses, as I particularly experienced at the somewhat half-way point of the campaign with Lu Bu. I continued to go through the campaign with my Lu Xun wannabe, getting to grips with combat, martial arts, spells, divine beasts, and companions with a similar feeling - enjoying the mechanics that had been created for this game, but being frustrated by performance. I completed the campaign, finished off the achievements, and held off on new game+ until some of the performance issues were fixed. In that respect, I didn’t return to the game until 8 months later when a cheap deal of the DLCs was in the Winter sale.

[b] 2nd Time round - better experience: [/b]
Between those 8 months, some improvements had been made to the performance and the DLCs had come out so it was a good time to try it out again. This experience was thankfully better being able to maintain more consistent frame rates and frame pacing as I noted at the beginning. With that, I started going through the NG+ ranks and was able to start enjoying this game without those issues getting in the way. I started to get into the same rhythm as I experienced with Nioh 1 + 2 - going through missions, gearing up, levelling, and making slight tweaks to my build to meet the foe I was next facing. I understood the spirit system better, which takes a conventional stamina system and makes it similar to that of Sekiro managing the balance between defence and offensive manoeuvres. I took better advantage of the morale system, which determines how much strength (or weakness) you have against enemies. Missing critical attacks (the red glowing attacks that are needed to be parried otherwise you take high damage and loose morale) was less common now due to the performance improvement and more down to my own reading of the fights. Sure, I still had bosses I got frustrated by (Zhange Liao, and Taishi Ci come to mind) but nothing that a bit of prep, rethinking, and rebuilding couldn’t resolve. 

[b] End game: Thousand Mile Journey and Grace [/b]
I got to NG+4 then started to properly plan out my build with the Graces (end-game set bonuses) ready to start the Thousand Mile Journey (End-game dungeon). I had gotten to the end of the dungeons in Nioh 1 and 2 and was looking to see how they would differ in Wo Long, and I'm happy with what they did here. Choosing your path, going for specific buffs to help you along your journey and building up new ways to improve your character with level cap increases and upgrade material was fun. Personally, I think it’s done better than Nioh 1 + 2 in this respect, but knowing that TMJ goes on for up to 10,000 dungeons seems a bit excessive. At the point of this review, I'm at 101 and happy with what I've done. 
With Graces, I think there is room for improvement as it has been quite the challenge to get things set up how I would like them to be. You do have a certain level of control, being able to increase drop rate of equipped gear items through gear gem enhancements (a system I do prefer over Nioh 2), but this doesn’t apply to trinkets or stratagems (the latter being an end-game equipable double-edged buff). This ends up creating a run of ‘hopeful grinding’ which can get somewhat dull. I would have preferred Team Ninja to follow the example from Nioh 2, having ‘grace lists’ for multiples of certain floors meaning you could plan ahead in that respect. Throughout my playtime, I’ve never really got trinkets that fully align with my build which is annoying.

[b] Final thoughts: [/b]
If it wasn’t for the performance issues at launch, I believe myself and others would have had a much better experience with Wo Long and it would be thought of more positively. The combat is enjoyable and the levels have a good cadence that don’t overstay their welcome. It has that replayability with the NG+s but those with experience with Nioh 1 + 2 may get frustrated with the challenges to fully create the build you want. Now that the complete edition is released, I believe it’s a good offer of a game that many people would enjoy, even those who had a bad experience on launch.

Luckily they patched this particular issue since I started playing, and apart from the technical issues you might be experiencing on your end, this is a great game worthy of applause.

It's focus seems to be on a Sekiro style deflecting system that your either gonna love or hate. I for my part fell in love with it in the formentioned game and couldn't be happier with the implementation here, This is the first soulslike I actually felt the combat towards the endgame needed the additionall challanges presented as an option, since I was steamrolling most encounters and bosses first try.

I can honestly say I would love the game if not for the technical issues that plague it and I have mostly been spared from. There was only one level where the framerate dropped to an unenjoyable level and I had actual issues since the patch that actually made it possible for me to play the game.

If your computer can handle it and your up for a parry heavy game that is less focused on your weapons moveset then it's weapon arts compared to Nioh, I am sure you will love this game as much as I do.

I rewrote it once after the release of DLC2 when I felt the game had significantly improved, and am rewriting it now after getting every achievement from both the base game and all three DLCs. The update cycle for the game has ended and it is now feature-complete, making it the most definitive version of Wo Long that there probably ever will be.

It's been a long road to get here, but I think Wo Long stands up pretty well against Team Ninja's prior releases, especially the so-often compared Nioh 2. Outliers in difficulty have been reigned in and players have been given the option to make the game more challenging for themselves by tweaking modifiers to their game, adding the granularity of difficulty that Team Ninja games excel with. The game is fun, varied, and visceral, moreso now than it was at launch or during the update cycle. I personally feel that a few martial arts and weapons could use a little bit of love, but the breadth and volume of playstyles available means that I don't feel like I'm missing out on too much. The extensive endgame, the Thousand-Mile Journey, offers probably the greatest volume of content out of any Team Ninja game, at the expense of some of the quality and depth that something like Nioh 2's Underworld offered. Regardless, the New Game+ Cycles of the main story and DLCs (five total playthroughs of about 30 hours of missions) with remixed enemy placements and an ever-climbing loot progression is more than enough content for the price.

Performance is significantly improved. The game now pre-caches shaders on launch, which has vastly improved the stability and fluidity of the experience for me. I can only hope that people who were put off by this game's awful infancy return at some point to see how amazing and fun it has become.

If you give it a try, remember to embrace using wizardry ASAP (the game trickles in wizardries to you over the first many hours, arguably a little too slowly as they are so important, but once you have them all builds are viable).

If you want incredibly kinetic, movement-focused 3d action combat (and experiencing that is worth some rough edges), or you really like the Three Kingdoms stories (not specifically from Dynasty Warriors even though they are both Koei Tecmo games so there are many character likenesses, which is a nice treat for fans of DW), then I highly recommend playing this game, even if you don't take it all the way to end-game. If you are looking for another Team Ninja game with a massive amount of end-game replayability, this game falls short of the mark a little, due to the incredible repetitiveness of the Thousand Mile Journey combined with janky multiplayer support, but I still hold this game near and dear to my heart and will probably occasionally continue playing it just to experience the thrills of combat for a while.

This game would benefit SO MUCH from a proper functionality expansion to the multiplayer: searchable co-op lobbies and drop-in/drop-out support (like in Strangers of Paradise, for example?), proper PVP arenas + dueling, and a more careful approach to balancing PVP. The PVP experience in this game with two people playing together for fun, e.g. in a voice chat and intentionally dueling with reasonably matched equipment, is some of the most fun I've had with PVP in any game and gives me a true ""fighting game but in 3d"" feel when it comes to how the duels are fought. Players have a large but not infinite number of options, the 5 virtues are intuitive (once you get used to them); playing off of strengths and weaknesses respective of which virtue you are combating gives a big advantage, and positioning and timing are super tight. Unfortunately, this is slightly let down by netcode and difficulty in initiating that experience to begin with, but when you have a good connection with a friend, this game is magical.

I really hope Team Ninja makes Wo Long 2, continues their (IMO excellent, but please use the Chinese voice acting!!!) retelling of Three Kingdoms stories, and seriously introspects on and listens to the community about their approach to multiplayer. It will be that much closer to my perfect action game.

There have been a few performance / stability / bugfix patches since the last DLC which returned the game to working pretty well for me for the most part, but it is not perfect. I have also played a few hundred hours on PS5 and the stability is substantially better on PS5, but I prefer playing via Steam on a 1440p 21:9 monitor (the game looks incredible in ultrawide). Just remember your return window and try it out!

---

Edit: December 2023, the last DLC has released and a pile of performance issues have returned with it. I have crashed a few times, fallen through the floor, and clipped out of bounds all without trying... the added content itself has been wonderful, but I now, again, have to disclaim above the statement I make below that the PC version is indeed still a hot mess performance wise. I will update again if they do ever fix the issues for me, though it seems even then to be very specific PC dependent.

---

This is one of my favorite games, another reviewer nailed it when they described it as a playable Wuxia movie (with a little elemental wizardry), and I think it's one of the best action games out there, period. The steam reviews don't paint a great picture right now, though, and after reading through a whole bunch of them I decided I should just throw this review up here even though I don't want to write a more complete review until the release of the final DLC (Team Ninja games tend to truly flesh themselves out with each major update, sometimes game-changingly). I guess we'll see if I do ever come back and write more.

I am writing this specifically to address the elephant in the room; performance. At launch, this game had some severe performance issues, jittery animations, tons of slowdown, poor load times, could barely maintain 60 FPS, and crashed frequently. This is a real shame, but I find it much more a mark against Koei Tecmo as a publisher trying to get this game out to market too quickly than any sort of indictment of the developers. I know game development is not free, but this one needed more time in development, or a reimagined release cycle (perhaps leveraging an early access with active community involvement?) no matter if it cost more up front. The poor state of the game at release is, I believe, a large part of why this game has mixed reviews.

With the second DLC, I can finally say that this game is running correctly, and I have smooth 120fps+ gameplay at 3440x1440. It's not perfect; since the update I've still had at least one crash, and my load times running Windows are still substantially longer than on Linux, but I think the vast majority of the performance issues at launch are now solved. It even runs (albeit, barely holding 30fps with pretty noticeable resolution downscaling) on the Steam Deck, though I would not necessarily recommend this to players who only have a Steam Deck.

Editor note: I only played the main story, all the side quests and the 3 DLCs, I did not do New Game +.

Story: It was ok, it's crafted in the same mold as Nioh 2 where you get involved in historical battles, but with supernatural elements. It just that I was never really into the Romance of the Three Kingdoms or this did a bad job, because I did not care about anyone or anything. For comparison, I did care more about the character in both Nioh games.

Graphics: It's pretty good, I think this is what it does best, looking very good.

Gameplay: For some reason everything aside from health is connect to one gauge and I mean everything, deflecting, casting magic, attacking, etc. Its a shame that it sucks here. You can not spam block or spam magic otherwise your posture will brake easily. So, battles just turned to me mostly powering up my weapon with some magic, breaking the enemy stance, and then rinse and repeat if possible. The one cool thing about the combat is the weapon arts, they look very cool and they also have 2 Lies of P weapons in the game! 

Difficulty: There were only two instances that I would say the game has absurd difficulty and I think I know the reason why to. They were one of the the 2nd DLC that could uses ice element on his weapons which punishes you if you get the deflection time wrong and lose health and the last boss of DLC 3 who could uses all the elements, so either your suffering from a status effect the entire fight or your dead. These were the only times I had to change my armor to beat their nonsense.

I could forgive all of the problems if it wasn't for this,

Performance: The game would be fine, if it didn't crash or freeze every 6 hours of my 46 hour playtime! This games been out for nearly a year and it's still having issues.

It combines exhilarating combat with the rich, immersive world of Three Kingdoms. The blend of historical and mythical elements creates a unique experience, and the challenging gameplay keeps you engaged. The graphics and sound design are top-notch, adding to the overall atmosphere. 

It also will leave anyone that's not familiar with the ROTK story befuddled as to what's going on. The game's interwoven story isn't that interesting outside of the historical context. The game's level design is more confusing than well done, and the content pales in comparison to Nioh's offerings. It's also very poorly optimized, and the DLC offerings are insulting.

It's okay, not completely terrible but also not fun.

The Story: It was okay, basically a dark souls Dynasty Warriors. It's not the full Romance of the Three kingdom, I would say it's like 1/5 of the Three Kingdom era. The DLC story is basically ""what you did in between"" the base story, recruiting/meeting allies that wasn't included in the base game, so they're pretty short, like three main stage and three side stages.

The Combat: I dislike the combat. There's one bar and on one side is a ""spirit"" bar which is basically a posture bar from Sekiro, along with it is an advantage bar, so in combat you have to balance the two and deflecting increases advantage bar. However, the issue I have is the spirit bar. Everything you do increases the posture bar: weapon skills, magic, deflecting, and dodging, so you're constantly near posture break. The posture break a problem with larger enemies and bosses because they don't stagger, so a single side-swipe will put you into posture break because you had to use your abilities to do significant damage, so your posture bar is already full.

The enemies are terrible, they all have swipe attacks that are more than two hits. I understand you're supposed to deflect every attack, but when every enemy just swings their arms wildly, it's not fun, because they just constantly waste your resources. What I dislike the most, is the critical attacks (the red attacks), mainly from bosses, because they have one, one-shot critical attack and if you miss that single one, even if you're doing great, you're going to have to start over and sometimes it's not your fault, the timing is terrible or the hit boxes are off.

The Moral System: This sucks, if your morale is lower than the enemies, you're at a disadvantage in terms of damage, so you have to farm mobs or look for flags to increase your morale. Your morale drops if you get hit by a red attack or if you die, so if you haven't found all the flags in the mission, you're going to have to farm mobs or else you'll be at an advantage in combat.

Gear: It sucks in this game. Whoever thought that taking out crafting in this game is an idiot! Their previous game, Nioh had crafting. Without crafting, you're constantly farming for gear and even with higher drop rate and priority drop rate and even drop priority (equipped gear), it's an extremely long grind. Their solution to higher drop rate is by having you nerf yourself to increase Luck by either: lowing your max health, lowering your damage(magic/skill), increasing posture build-up, lower potion recovery, increase of negative debuff time on you, or all of them. I did almost all of them, yes it made the game harder, but it doesn't mean it made it fun and the drop rates were still terrible.

The Reinforcement system was cool, fighting along story characters, but Elden Ring did summons better.

Again, I wouldn't recommend this game. If you like gear and builds, play Nioh or Nioh 2, they have a better system, gear, and combat. For deflecting/parrying, play Sekiro or Lies of P, it's done better in them.",1705390906,1705390906,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

- great character creator!
- fantastic animations of attacks!
- deflecting mechanic is top notch!
- tons of weapon types (heavy, mid, fast paced, even whips!)
- plenty of possibilities for builds (u can be borderline Scorpion from MK!)

- unfortunately it crashes... still. After nearly a year since release. Based on forums - it's not just my rig.
- online is a bit empty or when u get summoned - it's usually something like second map... which will result in a quick finish.
- not much stuff to buy for those accolides points (DO NOT BUY MASTER CRAFTSMAN HAMMER!!! It does not upgrade your blacksmith...)

Team Ninja has always been known for making games with engaging and interesting combat, regardless of whether or not the game overall is very good. Wo Long is a departure from this and offers nothing exciting for fans of either action games, RPGs, or even fans of the Three Kingdoms setting.

The combat primarily revolves around two things: Parrying and spirit depletion. If you are hit, you lose spirit. If you hit someone else, you gain spirit. The more spirit you have, the more you can deplete your enemy's spirit with a spirit attack. Deplete the enemy's spirit to do a fatal blow on them. 

Again.

And again.

And again.

And again. 

Try and remember the combat in Sekiro. You'll say it's mostly parrying too, and that's true. However, the red symbol attacks add an extra layer: These are either more tricky to parry or can't be parried at all. Depending on the enemy's attack, you either use a mikiri counter, jump and stomp on the enemy, or just dodge out of the way. There's also the lightning attacks that required you to jump and other magic attacks that could not be parried, etc.. My point: You had multiple things you needed to consider.

In Wo Long, the objectively best course of action is to simply parry everything. Parry the physical attacks, parry the magic, even parry the screams. It becomes repetitive extremely quickly. If you're not parrying, you're just spamming light attack against the smaller enemies as there is no stamina to keep track of.

Even the character customization I found to be boring. In Nioh 1 and 2 there was so many different kinds of armour sets and weapons. Creating your own look was like a fun puzzle. The lack of equipment variety in Wo Long is... shocking.

Its still not the best optimized game in the world, but I did upgrade to a 3080 a few months back, and I haven't had any drops under 60fps in 4k. In some zones, I sit around 90-97 fps in 4k, in other zones it'll suddenly fluctuate from 97 down to low 70s, and back up depending on where the camera is facing. I'll probably end up locking it at a solid 60fps. Why? Because everything that your character does is tied to the FPS, and if you are trying to time a precise movement and the fps suddenly drops, you can miss pretty badly. Had it happen to me when I was jumping over a ledge that I've never missed, suddenly Logitech decided it wanted to install an update in the background, and my jump was cut well short.

The English Voice actors are terrible. They can't pronounce the Chinese names very well, they take awkward pauses, and they randomly accentuate the weirdest parts of words. Anyways, the Japanese voice actors and the Chinese voice actors crush it. I play with Chinese because it sounds weird to hear Japanese or English in a Ancient Chinese Mythology setting.

So, why would I recommend this game? Lets be real, most of us are going to skip the cutscenes because we are here for the Sekiro-like parry system, the difficult bosses, and the character builds. The game is obnoxiously hard at first until you get into the swing of things when it comes to controls. But once you get it down, you start doing kung fu. Its gameplay loop is downright fun. Is it ""The greatest souls game of all time?"" No. Everything outside of fighting stuff is mediocre. Its a pretty game, but isn't well optimized. It has some jank and convoluted systems. If you are looking for some fun, I can honestly recommend this game. If you don't have a great pc and refuse to play any game on anything less than max settings (theres so many of you out there running modern games on gtx 980s expecting games to run at 60fps with full raytracing and beyond max settings), I would steer clear.

I love that you can play the game with a deflection or a dodge build and they both feel amazing. Also, the character creation is on point - basically the same one as Nioh.  

I will say that the co-op was absolutely broken when it first came out to where it was unplayable. After a couple months they fixed some of it and then my partner and I capped the frame rate to like 60 because we learned that fixed other issues in the game (which sucks that we had to do that when our PCs can handle much higher).

First of all, I like most of Team Ninja's output since Ninja Gaiden on xbox and this is no exception,  even if Nioh is superior, that doesn't mean this is a bad game. I feel like most of the negative reviews are from 3 camps, that I will address to give my point of view on the game at the same time: 

- The ones expecting the next nioh and are not open to changes. To be fair is a new franchise I feel that is a great opportunity to try different things. (although about the loot system changes, yeah I agree that it required further analysis)

- Those expecting a soulslike; This is the least souls like of recent Team Ninja games (even less than Stranger of paradise) and I don't mean it as if that is something bad, I mentioned ninja gaiden before because to me it feels more like that series at times; I like that it has its own flavor, even if doesn't succeed at everything, there are too many games copying dark souls still as it is.
 
- And those that played the last boss of the final DLC... XD; yeah difficulty is all over the place, on one side the main campaign is a cakewalk, only on NG+ I started to feel that nioh difficulty. And on the other, those -mostly negative- on all the DLCs is only people complaining about the jump on difficulty, content-wise the DLCs are way better that Stranger of Paradise's ones, so they are still worth it in my opinion, even if they make for an uneven and salt inducing experience.

Some highlights

+ The visuals.
+ Since the pre-shader compilation step they added, my fps have been a solid 60fps -But got some crashes still.
= If you want more difficulty on the first run don't raise your morale and vice-versa.

While I was so angry before that I refunded the game, I returned about a year(?) later and found the game running buttery smooth at max settings. I'm really glad they fixed the stuttering. Without performance issues in mind, I gave the game another shot.

Wo Long is doing some different things to solve some flaws in the soulslike design. For at least a decade, the best way to clear through levels has been to ignore the enemies, run past them, kill the boss and find some exploitable enemy to farm. Although people critique the morale system for being weird and unintuitive -- I have to insist that this is an excellent innovation, because the morale system rewards you for fully exploring every level. 

What morale does is, basically, as you parry / kill enemies without being hit and explore checkpoints throughout any level, it rewards you by making you all-around stronger. Not by a huge amount- but enemies with a bigger morale level than you are bad news. Usually you want to explore the level more before taking on big morale enemies, but actually, sometimes you feel like having a challenge and killing enemies you aren't ""supposed"" to kill yet is a genuine thrill in this game.

Speaking of parrying, it feels GOOD and you can parry almost anything. You can even parry fireballs and deflect projectiles back at enemies. When you get good at Wo Long, you feel like a Kung Fu Jedi master absolutely embarrassing your enemies by turning everything they do against them. I cannot emphasize enough how fun it is to parry in this game, and how much better it is than in typical Souls games. 

You don't -have to- parry though, despite how it seems. Wizardry is a huge and great part of the game. I picked Poison magic and for enemies I just couldn't get the parry timing on, or for huge enemies beyond my morale, I really could just kill them from afar with spells. Magic in Wo Long is varied, gained as you level instead of from crappy subquests, and combos into itself. Just watch some Wo Long magic builds on Youtube, text won't do it justice. 

I think a Bloodborne fan would enjoy Wo Long more than a Souls fan, because Combat is really fast-paced and it is nothing special at all for you to be fighting three enemies at once slipping in hits between chain parries, followed up by big spells and critical attacks. This is not a game you play while you are sleepy, and if you are sleepy, Wo Long will wake you up quickly. 

This is a lot better than the new Lords of the Fallen too because of all the options you're given. You can summon NPCs who are actually quite useful and can be given an attack order, or you can summon players. Although the stat and equipment mechanics are different from anything else (Wo Long uses the diablo loot system, just like Nioh) I found I had the best time when I didn't pay too much attention and just went full poison, then put on equipment with bonuses for spellcasting. Most builds I see do a similar thing -- just don't overthink it, pick a stat and a playstyle you like, then just use whatever you find that helps your build. 

Throwing weapons and archery are great in this game. Ammo is limited- as it should be- and honestly, I'm hard to please, but I feel like everything in Wo Long is really well balanced. The levels aren't too long, nothing is too easy, and as for the hard parts of the game you have a lot of resources and options to choose from to solve your problems. I feel like my creativity is rewarded more in Wo Long than in any soulslike or nioh games. That, and I'm really happy with Wo Long's magic system.

I haven't even started on PvP yet, which looks fantastic too. This game is a good buy even without a sale.

Old Review: I played Nioh 1 & 2, and all the Souls games including Demon's Souls and Bloodborne: Team Ninja makes good games. Wo Long is probably a good game. What parts of it I did play, they were fun. However... this game runs poorly even on performance mode- on an overclocked 6700XT Red Devil! This GPU is well above spec and should be crushing this game. However, I notice that during cutscenes and whenever it loads something into the game, Wo Long lags horribly. It can even happen randomly during combat -- which, in a game centric on parries and deflections, is rather crushing. This game needs tremendous optimization and hurts to run because of the constant stutters even on high-end hardware.",1681002282,1704145045,True,0,0,0.440819531679153442,0,True,False,False

First things first: I know that some people have performance issues with this game. I personally never had any issues after I updated my graphics card driver, and my graphics card is ""only"" a 3060 Ti. Unfortunately, I think that for people that have had those issues, they've generally popped up far enough into the game that it was too late to refund. That *sucks*. But if your computer doesn't have issues with it, which I can attest is true for at least some people, then it's a good game.

This leads into my second point: this is not Nioh 3. And it's not Dark Souls. There's similarities for sure, but there's also a lot of differences.

I think the biggest thing that separates Wo Long from Nioh is that whereas most games in the genre design parrying to be very difficult and super-rewarding, in Wo Long it's a lot easier to do but also a lot less overpowered.

In Dark Souls and Nioh, you mostly use dodge rolls to avoid big attacks. In Wo Long, you instead have a ""deflect"" button, which is a much shorter animation where your character sidesteps and tries to deflect an attack. Any time you successfully deflect, there's a sort of ""clashing blades"" flash to show that you did it successfully, and you regain some Spirit (which is Wo Long's version of Stamina). There's also a separate block button which you can hold down-- blocking attacks consumes spirit. Enemies have certain attacks where they glow red, and these can be deflected but not blocked.

The other big difference is that your Spirit/stamina bar works a little differently. In Dark Souls, attacking, dodging, blocking, and parrying all use stamina. In Wo Long, your basic attacks and successful deflects actually restore Spirit, and then you have heavy attacks, spells, and weapon special attacks that spend it. Your spirit bar also has sort of an ""overcharge"" mechanic-- it will somewhat slowly refill/decay to the midway point, but you can overcharge it up to full by hitting enemies or deflecting, and heavy attacks will spend any overcharged amount to deal extra damage.

This ends up making combat feel a lot more in your face and constant. In Dark Souls, you'll carefully back out to refill stamina in between attacks because you can't keep going. In Wo Long, you can keep deflecting as long as your timing is right and stay right in the thick of things.

The game does have less customization and less systems than Nioh, but there's still a lot of different weapon types, armor sets, and builds to experiment with. Personally, I liked it more because Nioh's complexity felt more like a distraction at times, but other people might feel differently.

Really, though, I'd just suggest that people give this a try if it sounds like something they might enjoy. It's different from Koei Tecmo's other games, and you'll be disappointed if you were expecting something just like those, but it also innovates and does some cool stuff of its own.",1704139569,1704139569,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

People who are complaining about performance/crashes and other bugs probably don't know what it was when it got released. I played this on day one on Game Pass and it was a broken mess. Massive frame rate dips, random slow downs and crashes, horrible controls you pick your poison, all of this on top of a game designed to work with good reflexes is a recipe of frustration.

I gave up on it after playing first 3 - 4 areas and never looked back. Today I bought it on Steam at a sale price and decided to give it another go because I can easily say that behind all of the issues I mentioned above there is a great game waiting to make you enjoy and I am pleased to report that majority of the issues I faced on day one are gone, the game runs silky smooth and I haven't faced a crash in my 4 hours play but I am not counting that out yet. 

One of the biggest areas where they improved are the controls, call me whatever you like but I play these games with Mouse and Keyboard and KB/M support was a total disaster on launch, they have a fixed all of that and while I won't say that it feels like it's designed for KB/M, it does feel like it has good support for KB/M now.

Speaking past that, this is a unique fusion of Nioh games and Sekiro while not being as difficult as Sekiro. The challenge and difficulty is still very much there but I can say that it's a lot more accessible than Sekiro due to having access to multiple classes, weapons, a whole ton of abilities and companions who are usually decent in distracting the bosses away from you.

Combat is fast paced like Nioh and doesn't rely on separate bars like Stamina and Mana instead it's simplified into one bar called spirit bar and this bar is like your currency to perform actions. The reason I call it currency is because it can be either spent and earned for example actions like special attacks cost you spirit while actions like deflecting incoming attacks gain the spirit, your goal is to manage your spirit bar in such a way that you don't run out (spend all) of it otherwise you will be posture broken resulting in your character running out of breath and not being able to perform any action for short duration of time leaving you open to attacks. The more spirit you earn the more special actions you can perform without running out quickly.

Overall this mechanic is more relaxed than managing your Stamina and makes the combat more action oriented such that sometimes you don't even have to watch your spirit bar unless you're fighting a boss or difficult enemy.

Like Nioh games Wo Long offers a lot of other weapons like Bows, Dual Swords, Spears and even throwing knives. It also offers you special abilities like summoning a mystical creature to assist you in battle with some serious damage to the enemy or buffs to your character and companions around.

The game also offers several gear pieces that look cool and detailed along with standard Souls like stats like defence, physical resistance, elemental resistances, weight and more. You can also earn your companion's armor by developing strong bond with them.

Graphics wise this game looks okay, like majority of Souls games it won't drop your jaw on floor when it comes to graphics but it looks decent and better than some Souls games. Sound design is also okay but I feel like a lot of stuff has been recycled from Nioh games.

The world design offers a lot of varied locations to explore and enjoy along with several unique enemies that can be both fun to fight or extremely frustrating to defeat. Like majority of Souls games the story is not a strong point of Wo Long but it does at least offers some story featuring historical characters in a fictional world during the fall of Han Dynasty.

Character design looks cool, I am a big fan of Asian characters and this game doesn't disappoint in that area. Along with rich and beautiful looking NPCs and companions you can also make your own character beautiful using the expensive character creator and unlike majority of Western games, the female characters don't shy from looking beautiful in this game, thank you Japanese developers.

All and all Wo Long Fallen Dynasty is an underrated Souls like game that deserves praise. Unfortunately it was marred by technical issues and glitches that stopped it from becoming an excellent game but I think devs have fixed a lot of issues from what I experienced on day one and therefore I think this deserves a chance.

Almost a year in and they still didn't figure out the screen flashing, performance issue, model texture flickering every second. In fact, it seems they made it worse. A weird fix for the flashing issue is: If you start the game in Full-Screen mode, switch to borderless once the flicker starts. If you start in Borderless, switch to Full-Screen. 2 stages (Hulao and Meiwu) are downright unplayable due to the framerate drop and slowdown. Now the mission I'm currently playing constantly crashes the game. I haven't any issue playing games with way better graphics.
Gameplay? Mediocre at best. Comparing deflecting in this game to Sekiro is like comparing one of those frozen food in a convenient store to a Michelin-star restaurant dinner. People are right: Nioh 2 is way better than whatever this thing is. If you think Nioh 2 is mediocre (like me), then this game belongs in the gutter; don't even touch it. You'll spend more time fighting with the Graphics settings and the camera than the enemies themselves (yes, whatever camera issues they have in Nioh 1 & 2 are still here!!!! You'll get a headache from all the spinning, jerking around, now with added flash bang and flickering textures. Let's hope healthcare is free in your country, because you'll need to see a doctor after this). Bought it on sale and still feel robbed.

Admittedly the game had a ton of flaws and problems on launch, but after playing it again I can happily say the game feels much much better to play. Spells aren't locked behind Morale anymore, all weapons/spells/abilities were given range/damage/cast time buffs. Parry window was buffed and feels smoother. Loot drops were buffed and rarities were increased. Stats on all gear were buffed. They're still pretty tiny, but not nearly as bad as before. Bosses feel more balanced in the main game, tho there's still a few that are randomly way more difficult than others. I've heard the DLC is rough when it comes to bosses, but I haven't tried the DLC yet. The DLC weapons are really fun though, and I've noticed they've given special quirks to each weapon type as well. For example, dual blades have a ""perfect parry"" that gives extra spirit gauge if you parry at the perfect time. If you parry normally, you get the normal amount. Spears now apply vulnerability and shred armor which is great for tanky enemies. The whip can go into an enraged form that changes all of it's abilities, and the fists have Greased Lightning so they get faster and generate more gauge the more you punch the enemy. There's also ki blasts, so my inner dragonball z fan was satisfied. Anyways, all in all I'd say that while I thought this game was pretty mediocre for a Team Ninja game on launch, it's wayyyy bettter now and I'm having a lot more fun than ever. It's like they realized the game is meant to be fun/satisfying and unlocked a lot of the terrible limits that they had before. I still can't believe I'm able to use my spells at the beginning of the levels instead of having to wait until my Morale rank is 12+ which basically took 80% of the mission duration to do.

First, the good things. Wo Long has hands down one of the best combat systems out there. That's not an exaggeration. Team Ninja did a very smart thing with the spirit gauge. To make you gain spirit with normal attacks and successful deflects, the game removes the usual down time where you have to wait for stamina/ki/spirit to come back. The Nioh games dealt with this problem with ki pulses and anima, but in Wo Long it feels even more fluid. You are constantly making choices in combat about how to gain spirit with attacks and deflects, or how to use your spirit for spells and martial arts. It's one of the most engaging back and forth combat I've played.

Deflection is also a very strong combat mechanic. It offers a tool that can deal with any situation. No more being chased around in the Depth by human bosses in Nioh 2, or being insta-killed by Waterfowl Dance. You can always deflect. There is an argument that it's too powerful, and an opposite argument that to provide challenges, the game overtuned dlc bosses. I would say this, the balance is not always perfect. But I'd rather have deflect as a tool that I can master, than having to face situations where my only options are to run away or die.

On that note, the game also has some of the best boss fights, especially human bosses. I don't want to spoil anything but there are at least three bosses in this game, that I would rank above all Nioh bosses and most of the Souls games' bosses. At its best, Wo Long is probably only gonna lose to Dark Souls 3 in this regard. (Haven't played Bloodborne so no comment on that. Will it ever be ported to PC?) Even the more bullshit dlc bosses are very fun to fight, if/when you learn to fight them with proper tools (spells and martial arts that can hard counter them). 

Another thing I find surprisingly good is how the game treated its source materials, the Three Kingdoms period. Not the novel, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, nor the more famous (to the Western audience at least) Dynasty Warriors games, but the actual history. The game mixed both real history events and the novelized version, changed some key characters (Lu Bu, for example) and added in fantasy elements. Somehow it created a new version of the time period that is fresh, but still somewhat true. Characterization of Cao Cao, Sun Jian and several other major historical figures are very nuanced, better than a lot of stereotypical adaptations of the same source material. The game actually prompted me to really get into that time period. And the more I learned, the more I could see and appreciate all the threads and thinking process behind the choices Team Ninja made with the story. Is it perfect story telling? Is it easily accessible to players with no knowledge of that particular historical period? No. But the story and setting do have a strong inner logic.

I'm singing praises after praises over the game. But it does have big flaws.

First, the PC optimization was and is still somewhat poor. It got better after patches, but never silky smooth. And on top of that keyboard and mouse controls were broken at release.

The game is shorter than the Nioh games. It suffers a bit with enemy variety. Content-wise I would put it around 80% of Nioh, which is not bad, as Nioh games are 10/10 masterpieces. But people felt shortchanged.

The game has a very uneven look. Technically the graphics are not bad actually. I have no idea why people say it looks like PS3 games. If you look closely at textures and models, they are high quality. And all assets (weapons and clothing, etc.) are done with care and proper knowledge. What the game actually lacks is good overall art direction. Each map has an overpowering color filter, and most maps are covered in ugly veins everywhere. Whatever is good in the graphics is buried underneath. So sadly as a whole the game looks unimpressive.

I mentioned at the beginning that these flaws were almost perfectly aligned with the target audience - the Chinese market. Take the following paragraphs with as many grains of salt as you wish. These are from my personal experiences and from reading comments online.

Wo Long generated quite a buzz before release in China. Three Kingdoms is one of the most famous and exciting time period in Chinese history. And Team Ninja had a great reputation. But the majority of the Chinese gamers play on PC, unlike the rest of the world. (This was caused by a lot of factors too complicated to discuss here.) You simply could not mess up your PC port if you want good responses from this market.

A huge disadvantage Wo Long had was the comparison to Nioh 2. Nioh 2 was released on PC with all three dlcs. Nioh 2 was also built on top of Nioh 1, cannibalizing most of its assets. For a lot of Nioh 2 players on PC, we encountered it as a whole package. But it didn't get there in a vacuum. Wo Long at release certainly felt very bare-bone if you put it side by side to Nioh 2 complete edition. This feeling of being shortchanged can be very persistent. Wo Long got many quality updates and balances since then, but it's hard to overcome this particular feeling. I would also say players tend to be more critical and unforgiving when the economy is not great, and games feel more expensive.

Another weird thing is the story. Most people in China are actually more familiar with the novel, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, rather than the history. In the novel the Shu aligned characters (Liu Bei, Guan Yu, etc.) are the definitive protagonists, while the Wei, Wu and other characters are side ones. Wo Long paid a lot of attention at treating all three factions with equal attention, and aligned a lot of its story to real history instead of the novel. This actually created some dissonance to players only familiar with the novel.

Personally, I've waited for all the game's content to come out before making a final judgement. In my own opinion, the game as a whole deserves a 9, even just for its fantastic combat system. But I also enjoyed its story and even certain parts of its graphics. It's not perfect and not a masterpiece, but I'm glad it got created. Wo Long opens the possibility for a better sequel that would focus on the meatiest part of the historical period, with even better systems and more variety, like how much of a giant leap Nioh 2 was compared to Nioh 1. But even without a sequel, the game can stand on its own. You get to hang out with your favorite Three Kingdoms warriors, that alone is cool.

Some suggestions to make the game more enjoyable:
Do not treat deflect like parry from Souls games. Use deflect like how you use dodge in Souls games. It's a fundamental damage mitigation, not a high risk high reward move.
Try to incorporate martial arts and wizardry spells into your actions sooner rather than later. Both add so much to the complexity of the combat system.
To get rid of the ""oiliness"", turn on ambient occlusion. It makes a huge difference to make skin textures look natural. It barely impacts framerates.
If certain part of the map tanks your framerate, rest at a flag and quit to main menu will fix it most of the time. I think either during zone transition or when the game generates a NPC invader, the game doesn't dump the memory properly afterwards. Quit to main menu forces the memory to reset and the game will run smooth again.

The moment to moment combat is pretty fun, if a little repetitive. Combat boils down to parrying enemy attacks and punishing their openings, so that you can build up your Posture gauge. With a full posture gauge, you can unleash a devastating heavy attack the decreases the enemy's max posture. If you break the enemy's posture, you can do a critical strike for massive damage. 

Sound familiar? This game is Team Ninja's take on Sekiro's nearly flawless gameplay loop. And honestly, they nearly nailed it! Wo Long is absolutely worth playing if you like the Nioh games and/or Sekiro. However, there are some extremely notable flaws.

The performance of this game is pretty solid now, but on launch it was unplayable for anyone not running a NASA computer. Certain visual effects still grind my FPS down from 120 to single digits. It's not often, but it has gotten me killed during boss fights where it's prone to happening. 

Wo Long features a unique ""morale system."" Basically, if you kill enemies and pull off critical strikes it raises your morale level. This determines how much damage enemies deal to you, and honestly I don't know if it affects anything else. It never feels like I do less damage if say, I have 0 morale and the enemy has 20. Seemingly the only difference is that you're more vulnerable to damage. This is fine on your first playthrough, where you're heavily encouraged to explore to find battle and marking flags which raise your minimum morale. However, on NG+ it doesn't carry over your flags as far as I can tell, so if you want to speed through NG+ you'll be EXTREMELY prone to getting one-shot. 

The music is pretty good, and the game can be very pretty in places, though visibility is certainly an issue. The camera is pretty janky and the brightness can get EXTREMELY dark even if you crank up the settings. 

Overall, this game is very very good for a first playthrough, though I wouldn't necessarily recommend the DLC or NG+ if you didn't absolutely love your time during said first playthrough.",1703278921,1703278921,True,3,0,0.536585390567779541,0,True,False,False

The newest game from Team Ninja, one would think it's just Chinese Nioh, but it's actually not comparable at all, since it's a completely different genre : taking inspiration from Sekiro instead of the Souls games.. but with just enough Souls mechanics to still be enjoyable (unlike Sekiro)

Indeed, its gameplay design has been heavily simplified, with magic made mostly useless since it only lasts a few seconds and has virtually no effect anyway, as well as no more weapon or skill trees, and even the leveling system has been streamlined : instead of leveling individual stats, you level five elements (or rather, you put everything into one single element if you want to be even remotely viable) that theyselves level a few select (mostly useless) stats.  That would normally be a very bad thing, but the game's focus on heavily parry & counter focused, fast-paced and movement based combat (it IS based on Chinese martial arts movies, after all) means that stats and fancy moves and techniques just.. don't matter when the game is all about skills and timing

I really preferred Nioh 2 (especially the story, since Wo Long's is pretty asinine, even for a ""Soulslike"" game), but this game is still charming and really fun to play, and I'm looking forward to trying out the DLC when it comes out (especially since the price tag was pretty hefty for the game's length, although there's at least some replayability)!

EDIT : Now that all of the DLC have been released, I figured I'd give the game another go.  Well, they fixed all of the performance issues, I can now run the game on the highest settings and not have a single stutter.  Although they seem to have severely nerfed pretty much everything, since the game is easy as piss now and even bosses die within seconds.. and somehow they introduced a new gamebreaking bug that causes the game to freeze relatively often (roughly once every two hours in my experience), which causes you to lose cutscenes and have to restart the game each time

While some may hate it, there are others who can appreciate it. I would be first in line to welcome a Nioh 3, but I can recognise Wo Long for what it is and not what people expected it to be. It is a Chinese martial arts game telling the story of the Three Kingdoms but with the unique Team Ninja spin on it. Its interesting and it is also fun if you play by the rules the game gives to you. 

The mechanic that you must learn is to parry, luckily the game is incredibly forgiving with the parry system, different weapons also giving even larger parry windows, the very first tutorial boss I'd say is probably designed to teach you how to parry. It is a very simple boss to defeat if you use the parry system. I speak from experience having lost a number of times until I actually tried to understand what the game was telling me to do. As someone who has been afraid of parrying in other souls-like games I was at first hesitant to try it, but do so and you will be rewarded. The battles will open up to you in a new dimension and you will possibly see what the ""vision of combat"" is regarding Wo Long. 

I've even taken to like parrying now and have opted to employ it in more souls-like games. So Wo Long has taught me something new and I've added another skillset to my gameplay.

If you enjoy that sort of thing then give Wo Long a try, don't let the opinions of others sway you. A game can be good even if it is not well received. For my part I did enjoy it, and while not perfectly executed, I would like to see how Team Ninja would develop Wo Long if they don't abandon the IP.

Many people will call it the Sekiro of TeamNinja. While that is partially correct, whereas Sekiro was a perfect masterpiece, Wo Long is a close cousin to it. The game has multiple environments, but the general structure of the levels is the same. The game is pretty responsive with its dodging and parrying mechanics. Enemy attacks (except a few) are telegraphed enough to give you time to react.

The Morale system is a new touch to the souls-borne genre. Players are incentivized to keep up aggression while being mindful of critical attacks. Late game spells are, well, a bit too overpowered. I played most of the game with a water build and boy did i one-shot most elite enemies.

Another beautiful concept is that of free respec and battle-sets. Up against a tough enemy that counters your build? No problem, just switch to a different one just for that fight. While i mostly played with a water build while having a backup fire build for earth-type bosses, the ideal way to play would be having a main build and having a substitute build that counters your counter. For example, my primary build was water. so my substitute build should have been wood (wood counters earth, which counters water). But any boss is beatable with any build.

Boss fights are not much of a challenge for the most part. other than 3-4 bosses, you can get through most them in the first try. The memorable ones, on the other hand, are classics that you are gonna relive in your head quite a few times.

Now the cons. The game crashed about a dozen times in my close to 60-hour playthrough; that's one every 5 hours. The jumps are sometimes a bit messy. And the enemy's detection is next to zero. You can literally hold block and walk alongside a boss and he won't notice you. You can get a critical on almost every single enemy or snipe them from afar. Multi-parries are a bit iffy at times. And the graphics is not too impressive. Finally, the side-quests (not the sub-missions) are absolutely poop. It gives you a reward that is extremely generic and you have no need of.

But Nioh 2, which is a 3 year older game, surpasses Wo Long in every single way. I mean, it's really bad when the playable character has a running animation that looks like it comes from the PS1/PS2 era. Foliage has ZERO collision physics. Lighting and shadowing are FAR worse than what's present in Nioh 2. I mean, it's quite difficult to believe this game is their latest product. I don't know what happened in their development process this time around, but this is a shameful product from the devs who made one of the best Action RPGs of all time. Maybe COVID affected production of the game; who knows.

Either way, if you really love Nioh and Nioh 2, I wouldn't recommend this game because it'll just upset you at every turn with how low quality this entire game is. But, if this game goes on sale and you don't mind the low quality and just want an action game to play, then sure, it's your money.

I don't really have any positives to give, which I feel bad about, but that's that.",1701612097,1701612097,False,36,3,0.510644733905792236,0,True,False,False

Just give up and play Nioh 2 :((

Now, with everything set to low + fsr2 ultra performmance (the game become pixel graphics), it can run at 60fps, but sometime drop to ~30fps, frequent stutters and low motion almost time.
Great job, devs!

Update review for v1.03:
They fixed the stupid mouse control, but the camera movement with the mouse is not as smooth as it is with the controller (you can try the demo version to experience it for yourself). Therefore, I will keep waiting for performance updates before recommending this game.

Initial review:
With 12 hours of playtime (including the demo version) on my GTX 1050Ti  laptop, I can say that this game is good and very enjoyable. But yes, it is poorly optimized for PC, with the stupidest mouse control I have ever seen.

In regards of performance issues. Well, they're certainly there. One moment I'm getting a solid 60 fps then, when I move into a new area. My frames just up and leave. I get like 26 to 30. I am playing the game on standard settings. So not the highest, nor the lowest. Sometimes a simple game restart does not fix these performance issues either.

Fortunately they do eventually go away. I don't know how but a computer restart might help with the performance issues. Although, I should not have to do this. For more information on the performance issues. I am running this on Linux Proton on a RTX 3080.

If you have gamepass and can play it there (i did), then sure, play through the basegame and see if you like it. 
I was told the game gets better with the DLCs but if i have to play a game for 30-50 hours before it gets good, then it has some serious issues. 

The setting is servicable and the fights can be anjoyable but there are so many questionable decisions. The moral system, the fact that heavy attacks/ magic, dodging and getting hit all fill the same meter and end up stunning you for a good two seconds if filled and getting attacked is making the fights annoying and lackluster instead of fluid and cinematic. 

The boss fights are super hit and miss, some were fun, some absolutely terrible, most were forgettable. The difficulty was all over the place so some bosses required some actual investment and timing while others hardly put up a fight.

🕹️ Gameplay: Like trying to ride a unicycle on a tightrope over a pit of lava - exhilarating but you might lose your eyebrows in the process.

Let's break it down:

    Controls: Remember your first time trying to use chopsticks? That's me, every time I try to navigate this game. I feel like I'm playing Twister with my fingers.

    Jumping Mechanics: Ever seen a kangaroo on a trampoline? Neither have I, but I imagine it's akin to my character's attempt at leaping. It's like gravity had a few too many and decided to mess with me.

    Enemy Interaction: Picture this - a ninja mid-kick, frozen in the air, contemplating life choices. That's the enemies for you. They defy physics more than a cartoon cat running off a cliff.

    Boss Designs: These bosses are like that one overdressed person at a casual brunch. Over-the-top, eye-catching, and makes you question your life choices.

    Beauty: This game is so pretty it could make a grown man weep. I'm not crying, you're crying!

    Difficulty: If 'Sekiro' is a spicy habanero and 'Fallen Order' is a mild salsa, this game is the mystery taco - looks safe, but you might need a bucket of water.

    Dungeon Levels: It's like a box of chocolates in a haunted house - you never know what you're gonna get, but you're pretty sure it's going to scare the pants off you.

    Boss Encounters: It's a rollercoaster of emotions. One minute I'm on top of the world, the next I'm Googling ""How to defeat [insert impossible boss name here]"" while questioning my life choices.

    For the Noobs: If you're like me and have the gaming skills of a potato, fear not! This game is more forgiving than your grandma when you accidentally break her favorite vase.

🌟 Overall: It's not perfect, but it's like a thrilling book you can't put down - even if sometimes you want to throw it against the wall. If you're ready to laugh, cry, and possibly hurl your controller across the room in a fit of joyous rage, this is your game.

Verdict: Highly recommend, especially if you enjoy puzzles like ""Why did I do this to myself?"" 10/10 would get defeated by the first boss again.

👍 Like if you agree, share if you cried, and award if you too have been personally victimized by gravity in this game.",1700661101,1700661101,True,14,7,0.602831423282623291,0,True,False,False

If you are a Nioh chad enjoyer you will probably like this one, tho Nioh 2 is still the goat. In terms of gameplay, i find wo long actually pretty fun. The parrying system is great and combat feels super fluid. 

Some issues i want to adress:

Performance: well, there are defo some problems. It often crashes during the end of some cinematics and on some loading screens. It may happen in a cutscene after defeating a boss and that could be pretty painful.  There are no crashes while playing, it actually plays quite nicely.
Also, there is this same issue that Nioh 2 had, where if you cap the fps at 120 you may experience this slow-mo bug. At 60 it runs smoothly. -

Now more into the game. 
I don´t want to hear any of you complaining about difficulty. It´s probably the easiest game i played of these kind. Not even joking, i 1 shotted pretty much all bosses alone. I had some issues with the 1st one of course, because i needed to get used to the parrying system. And one more mid game that was a bit challenging. After that it´s all really straightforward.

I think the story is mid, it wasn´t as emotional as previous games. So not much to talk about there.

Combat, as i said before, pretty fun and fluid. However one thing i´d like to say is that divine beasts (the equivalent of nioh yokai tranformation) are super bad. Like i didn´t use them at all sometimes. 
There is magic. Attacking spells are not very good imo, but there are a few buffs that are pretty nice.

So all in all. i´d recommend Wo Long to those that really enjoy nioh games. For the rest, well, maybe wait for a sale or wait for some future patches to fix a bit some performance issues.

I still wouldn't recommend this game as some one who beat it in 2 days of casual play time. It's painfully easy.

I held off writing a review mainly because I hoped they would at least remedy the abysmal ""martial arts"" system if nothing else but a year later this game is the single biggest disappointment I have ever felt for a game. 

I didn't come in this with expectations of Nioh 3, I did buy this game expecting good combat however..... because that is what Team Ninja is known for. 

Sadly this games combat is a mix of supremely watered down Nioh combat, and extremely watered down Sekiro parries that combines in to a weak over all combat experiences with weapons that feel largely the same, spammy parries, and short visually uninteresting combos that would have felt dull in 2005.

In short there is a reason why this game has less then half the player base of Nioh 2 despite being significantly newer... it is sadly just not a good game from a design standpoint. Sadly you cannot salvage a game whose core combat system is SO badly designed.

Nioh 2 had problems at launch and it slowly became the game it is today, but it had a fundamentally stronger foundation to build on. 
When you create a game with combat this 1 dimensional and it doesn't work, you can't fix it. 

Team Ninja should hurry up and cut their losses and move on to another project on this one. They excel at making faced paced, complex combat systems that reward multiple skills.

Game ran poorly on PC at launch and is now serviceable, but never should had the problem in the first place when it looks the way it does. The overall red scheme of the demons in this game looks ugly and obscures a lot of enemy attacks, unblockables and visual clarity of the game. The new grounded realistic style of the game does not do the game any favors and makes it apparent how the stylized art of previous games like Nioh did a lot to hide the technical shortcomings of the game. 

Core gameplay design is solid, but it just doesn't feel good by the end since there's no variation to the deflect like in Sekiro or any game with a core parry mechanic. Exploration feels the same as Nioh despite having more mobility and that's not a good thing. Build variety doesn't really feel like it exists either and the magic system feels kind of awful since everything is tied to your deflection meter: heavy attacks, deflect, blocking, magic etc. The gear system also feels like it half-heartily implemented and was just here because Nioh had it. They should've just committed to making this a full action game like the old Ninja Gaiden games Team Ninja used to make, and I think the game as a whole would've felt more cohesive. 

Some of the human bosses can be fun, but the demon bosses are some of the most annoying to fight. The flying bosses are truly some of the most annoying bosses I've fought in a KT or Soulsgame since they will snap your camera to them if you're locked on and just fly around the stage forcing you to chase after them. They aren't even hard either and are just tedious. 

Overall I do not recommend this game. Team Ninja has made much better games in their past and recently: Nioh 1, Nioh 2 and Strangers of Paradise are genuinely fun and great games despite their flaws and are much better choices to play over Wu Long. This game is just unfun without the reward of it's inspirations like Sekiro, the exploration of the Souls games, and everything else that made the studio's prior entries great games.

However, this port is not without its issues. I don't know what it is about Koei Tecmo's PC ports, but their releases always come with some immersion breaking problems. Wo Long is unfortunately not exempt from this and I had recently completed this game on PS5 so I was able to compare the ports. 

There was a short period of time that I was unable to start the game and it would crash on the initial loading screen. I was able to fix this by turning off OneDrive syncing, and I have seen other players say they also get the startup crashes. There are occasionally frame drops (the worst for me was during the last boss in the Glaive of Righteousness mission - the frame rate dropped significantly during that fight). There were some random freezes in-game and I had to close the game application. Twice the game crashed after story cutscenes. Fortunately, the game had autosaved for me so when I loaded back in, I got the notification to say I had obtained the story-related items. None of these faults occurred when I played on PS5.

When the game works, it's really fun - not as difficult as Nioh and could be considered a simplified Sekiro, but not without challenges of its own.

The mostly negative and mixed reviews for Wo Long come from people who are often either Pissed off at not understanding how combat flows or, are so extremely tilted that they've given up trying the game entirely.

I've had practically none of the issues anyone else has had with this game so far, Morale is so easily farmable that if anyone has a problem with an enemy being ""Too high morale"" then you, as a player, have the choice of either overcoming that factor, or resting at a check point and returning to fight previous enemies a little more to achieve a higher rank.

Ontop of that there are consumable items that you can buy from the Battle Flags supply shop that are actually useful, and I can safely assume no one in the universe uses them.

I guess that's really all I can say, I'm personally enjoying the game and have been since launch, my only real issue is the drop rates for the ""Special Wizardy Spells"" are WAY too low.",1697416879,1697416879,True,1,0,0.457184314727783203,0,True,False,False

Other than the PC port, the game is really fucking good. It is arguably a simplified Nioh, which for some is great, for others is bad, but with the new Sekiro ish combat it felt fun all the way through. 
While the level design is great, the levels feel way too reminiscent of what has already been done in Nioh. I don't think there was one level look or feel that I couldn't just point to a Nioh mission and get the exact same. The added verticality with the jump is very nice tho.
The gear system felt so redundant compared to Nioh, at least to me. It felt impossible to have an oversight over what gear you have, and if it's better, which isn't helped by the fact that there is no button to compare your equipment. At the half way point I stopped looking at the loot for the most part, unless it was like a 4 star weapon or such. 

In conclusion, the game is incredibly fun, and I'm so excited to see what they do next, and with the DLC's. Systems may have been simplified, and there are aspects from Nioh, I wish was brought over to add a bit more depth, but it was definitely the soulslike game I have been aching for since Nioh

Oh boy this game breaks my heart. The combat is super fun, but that's basically all the positives I have, frankly. The Story is uninteresting, voice acting is pretty bad. The game graphically is very unimpressive, which would be fine if it ran well, but it doesn't. Lies of P looks way better and runs perfectly, so this game doesn't have an excuse really. The soundtrack is painfully generic. The game has quite a few bugs and feels fairly unpolished. 

Edit: I've finished the game now. Wow... this game was not good. The combat gets old fairly quick, and please tell me what the heck is the point of wizardry spells? So many of them are completely useless. The story gets worse and even more repetitive as it goes on. For a soulslike, its really easy. I beat the entire game just by spamming deflect and attack, not even needing to do anything else. I was like 20 levels below the recommended for the final boss and he was still super easy. The levels as they go on get worse and more boring, they all blend together. Almost every level here is some sort variation of ""Destroyed village and fort"". Visually it gets old, and gameplay wise it gets boring. 

 If you loved sekiro and need more of it, well play lies of P instead. But if you finished Sekiro, Lies of P, and literally EVERY other soulslike game ever made and you desperately need more.. go for it I guess. But good lord do not buy it at this price it is not worth even half of it. Very disappointed

Now I'm on mission 5 and at the boss fight the game slows down randomly. Wo Long is heavily based on precise deflecting your enemies attacks.

Even for the red point attack which you can not use normal defense, perfect defense only apply for bear bar but cause no damage. However, it is acceptable since Nioh is the same  except Nioh series can cause high damage without perfect defense. The reason why I gave bad review is every time when there is flame, FPS changes weirdly, still I can knock off the torch to fix the problem, but when you came to the boss fight of Lv Bu, he use flame attack 2/3 of the battle and he rides a horse which means your fight would be prolonged since you are not faster than a horse, then you know what happens, every time he attack without fire I can perfect defense while he attack with fire I can only bet my luck to defense since the FPS change caused by fire would makes the defense timing random.

I think it really is quite good and gets better as i progress. The setting is also refreshing as opposed to the usual ones for these types of games. I like the combat and the loot system as well. The combat is snappy and exhilarating and combined with all of the unique martial arts, spells, weapon switch attacks mid combo, spirit attacks, dash attacks, spirit moves, jump attacks, counters and fatal strikes, I'm just hooked. The only improvement I would have liked would have been to have some sort of combo system to pull off special combinations similar to fighting games like mortal combat or something, but either way, it's still great. Even getting the same weapon twice is still exciting as it might come with different martial arts skills on them so it spices up even common drops. Enemies are interesting and they definitely try to create different encounter scenarios so I haven't felt like I was doing the same thing over and over. The first boss is a bit tough, but you can actually just take the old rpg route and grind some exp by resetting the stage with the resting flag and killing mobs for 5-10 mins if you think it's too hard.

For the game play i would rate it as 8.9/10. the game play is very well designed and less complicated then nioh.  story are interesting, pretty average story but is great to see all the famous  scenes of three kingdom time.

Graphics are okay but nothing special, some of the textures look great and some other bad so there's no consistency there.

Story is pretty cool so far.

Gameplay has some twists that i really like.
Basically, it feels like Nioh but smoother, faster, without the stance thing which feels better but it's a bit easy so far (some parry timings are a bit weird : same timing/attack sometimes the parry will be flawless, sometimes you'll get fucked).
Allies can sometimes be an obstacle more than a helping hand resulting in a waste of healing if you don't want them to die until next checkpoint (which can give some missions an escort mission vibe).

However, it crashes after each and every single mission.
That needs to be fixed asap.

The OST and artbook seem to be exclusive to the deluxe edition so don't even bother getting the standard for now. If you don't want to miss out on content you'll have to spill almost 100€ which is likely way too much for what that game seems to be.

A good thing is it has full controller support... Unlike Nioh (same studio) which claimed to have it but still doesn't have.

Given the fact that game is a souls-like, the optimal way to play it is using a controller...
Hoooooowever, a lot of people are review bombing the game !
Here's a sample of their arguments :
""It's not optimized for m&k""
""It's not optimized for m&k. Therefore it should not be on PC in the first place""
""It doesn't support m&k""
""It looks like an early PS3 game""

To clarify things, it does support m&k. However, most of the souls-like games are meant to be played with a controller (that includes most of the AAA ones i'm aware, part of that there's the ones by From Software aka the ones who made the genre).

Bashing this game not being made for m&k and nothing else is a ridiculous expectation.

Should a driving game be review bombed for not being built around guitar hero controllers ?
Should a platformer be review bombed for not being built around a steering wheel thingy ?
Should a strategy game be review bombed for not being built around a wii board ?
Heck no, that would make no sense.

Should game have and keep platform exclusivity based on the genre ?
No.

When it comes to hardware limitations, a PS3 game could not look like this. That's just not possible.
Sure, there's a quality gap between certain textures but it's not terrible.

One other thing :
This game being by the same team as Nioh 1&2, there's no excuse not to have a badge ad backgrounds.
This is pathetic. If you have the possibility, you might as well get it on console given the disregard for steam users.


Edit 1 :

On some levels there are big performance dips to the point i played most levels 1080p 60fps maxed quality and some aren't playable without insane artifact (even min quality, 30fps, 720p).
The fluctuation is insane !
In a number of others i am getting big visual bugs to the point where it's hard on the eyes and i can't play a minute without my eyes hurting like bad !

Thankfully, it's not the whole game (otherwise that would have been a refund immediately).

Solely based on that, i can't recommend this game until fixed.

Otherwise it's pretty good.

I'll finish the story and leave it in backlog until a fix is out... i'm not getting the season pass before that either.


Edit 2 :

You know what ?
I'm done for now. Better wait to enjoy it rather than force myself to play with sometimes unbearable glitches and noticeable dips.

28 days after release, the game still is not an acceptable state on PC... It is (and has been for a bit) on console...
I guess it's probably just bad port syndrome and we'll have to wait years before same as Nioh before it becomes okay on PC (difference is that Nioh still is not despite being fantastic on console).
It's just money down the drain and i regret buying it.
Don't make the same mistake as me : When it comes to team ninja games, buy them on console or wait a few years to get them on sale if you want them on PC (even then it's no guaranted to be playable and enjoyable)...
Still, they dumbed a boss down and perfected the sub-optimal controls due to criticism from people who straight up don't understand what souls-like are/have no clue about the genre's origins...
They need to get their priorities straight but i honestly doubt they will even despite review bombings...

Edit 6 :
I missed update 1.06 but today is the day of 1.07 and me giving up.
It's been 8 bloody weeks and the game still suffers the same bugs (with some added along the way).
Now, the game takes twice as long to launch, hitting continue makes a new character instead of, i don't know... CONTINUING FROM MY ONE AND ONLY SAVE (noticed it a few updates before and hasn't been fixed yet). Performance gets from bad to worse. I used to be able to play maxed out over 60fps and now i can't even get a stable 30 !

Welcome to my ignore list, i am done.
Be it console or PC (all your PC ports i played up until this last one are clearly inferior version with next to no effort or ability). Even given that, you can keep your console versions away from me.
I gave you 8 weeks, already 7 too much imo, i'm done fix or not.

Edit 7 (28th September 2023):
A huge visual glitch i probably mentioned has finally been fixed... OVER 7 MONTHS AFTER RELEASE ! I only tried it in one location so at least that one is okay but maybe not all. As i said i'm done with this game aside from DLCs i HAVE to play not to f**k up my account stats (which did cost me an extra 25 euros).",1677840792,1695880606,False,0,0,0.528265118598937988,15,True,False,False

Overall, I enjoyed the game and definitely recommend it. I'm a fan of Nioh 1 and 2 and this feels as good as those while streamlining some things. The combat is great with plenty of builds to choose from to fit your style. The bosses are fun with a few standout ones. 

Things I didn't enjoy: 

Story - too many characters and I stopped caring about the story like 4 hours in. It's a good thing the combat carries the game forward for me. I'm a gameplay first type of person with story being second.

Loot - they did trim down on the loot compared to Nioh 1 and 2, but IMO it's still a bit much with no ""wow"" moments. What I mean by that is the loot doesn't matter too much in the grand scheme of things and there's no super unique drops. Just find a rank 4 item and then you keep it for the rest of your playthrough. You can min/max for sure but it's not going to be massive upgrades. More of a PvP thing. 

Enemy variety - too much of the same thing. It can be a little boring fighting the same enemies. Would have loved to see more enemy types.",1689730955,1695872452,True,3,0,0.528130650520324707,0,True,False,False

If your fps still has any issues post update, i would recommend limiting the fps to 60, that seemed to be the issue for me.

Sometimes it is just ridiculous that I kill a person 5 meters before his friend’s eyes, and he just continues looking at me undisturbed.

The current version of the game still has many bugs, for instance, the randomly appearing wild flickering in the menu was weird, but I have found enemies standing in the sky a few times too. Not a bug, but an irritating feature is the invisible wall, that held me back many times from jumping into places the developers did not want me to, very illusion-breaking.

I did appreciate the setting allowing me to become a scholar of Chinese history and inciting me to whip out Google and Wikipedia, it was fascinating to read about 黄巾の乱 (こうきんのらん), Yellow Turban Rebellion, as it actually happened, but the story of the game was somehow utterly uninteresting. I am usually not that invested in video game narratives, but I do pay attention if they are enthralling enough; unfortunately, in the case of Wo Long, this did not happen, and I often found myself scrolling through my phone during cut scenes. The game tries to mimic other RPG elements besides leveling up, like how you can build a relationship with certain NPCs accompanying you in the battle, but even if you reach the highest level of friendship, your reward will be gear, but no special conversation or any sort of interaction.

To sum up, Wo Long is not a revoltingly bad game by any means, but it is so glaringly just an inferior copy of a masterpiece, that the only thing it could achieve is making Sekiro look even better and making me want to play it again. If you have nothing else to play, do give it a try, but be prepared that this dragon is not just sleeping, but somniferous.

Graphics engine has been worsened, rather than improved compared to the Nioh series where the engine is excellent and performing, this game suffers from stuttering and sporadic fps drops for no reason, you can understand it better by using MSI Afterburner and looking at the frame graph, up to to date nothing has been resolved and the players are already starting to abandon the title after a short time because it is boring exactly like Sekiro, at least for me.

In the last 2 years too many triple A titles are sold at full price already with serious technical problems since the launch on this platform, ported or not, it doesn't matter, the point is that there is a lack of consistency and Valve is also guilty of this.
2 hours of maximum play before I can ask for a refund?
Too few and this is a trick to be able to rob users as they can no longer ask for a refund except through a lawyer, given that on many titles, the problems are also found long after this playing time.

🎀The mistake was to release it simultaneously with the console version which is a thousand times better than the fake pc version. Porting? Yes, porting!
Was following the same method adopted on the Nioh series too complicated?
Given that both the first and the second had been released many months after the console version, on pc and without any problems, here instead is the party of stuttering, graphic gliths, and fps drop, why this?

🎀The game itself is very nice? no, dodge/parry and counterattack, dodge/parry and counterattack, simple, repeat ad nauseam.
This crap is all like that, the builds are useless since to finish an opponent just activate this trigger, player skill replaced by an animation, what crap.
First boss killed without armor to be more agile, only the sword.
The moral system? Useless, other than making you wander around the maps like an idiot looking for flags, it's nothing more than a temporary buff, with each map you start searching all over again.
But who exactly chose the design of this game?

🎀In the meantime we also have to wait for the opponent to turn red color to activate the counterattack, I have time to drink a coffee during this interval, or run like an idiot inside the arena waiting for the boss to give me the chance to counterattack.
The builds are practically useless. 
This game takes mechanics from Sekiro, but Sekiro really has nothing to teach to the Nioh series, because it is a castrated action game.
It doesn't matter if the game is patched, the problems are not just technical.
 
Which is why the review is, and remain negative for eternity.

Nioh is a thousand times better since everything is focused on builds and ability/free combat and variety and not on mandatory and repetitive mechanics.

This game is Nioh bastard son and have nothing to do with Nioh series.

Combat: Fluid and responsive. Please read the parry timing on the weapons cause it does matter. The higher the number=the bigger parry window you have so if you parry too soon it's more forgiving.
Story: Meh. It's alright. Not much lore compared to Dark Souls but that's not really a issue cause most people know about the 3 Kingdoms already.
Gear: A decent amount of stuff to get but you'll probably end up only using a couple of weapons cause the weapons changes your fighting style.
Mechanics: Summon a divine beast to help you in a pinch. Some give buffs or heals. Pick whatever you want for the fight ahead but you can only have 1. Would be broken if you can summon the whole zoo.
End game: There is new game+ where you just get higher tier versions of the gear and farm for 5 star gears from bosses and certain enemies. And yes, they will hit harder.

Negative:

- Morale flags are annoying after the initial play-through and feel pointless in NG+/+. More of an annoyance after a bit. This system just seems like it doesn't even have to exist after the first playthrough.

- Build variety feels ""flat"". Not as dynamic and flashy as Nioh. This could be due to lack of weapon depth outside of martial arts that come with the weapon which are underwhelming damage wise anyway.

- Nioh 2 was already suffering a bit from over-dependence on buffs/debuffs and spells. This was countered with at least some build variety. This game kinda takes that to the next level. Martial arts and most melee damage is kinda just a tool to get to your real damage which is fatal strikes or just using spells that are OP. Feels like Diablo 4 which is just mana generation to build up to your actual damage. Doesn't feel good. This feels bad in a game that is supposed to revolve around melee combat which Team Ninja does so well. Raw melee damage is a pretty big joke compared to spells and fatal strikes which doesn't feel fun. It would have been nice if they focused on a solid damage foundation from raw combat and then use spells and fatal strikes as a cherry on top kinda thing instead of making raw combat damage a joke.

- You hit a point where you are grinding mindlessly just to put together a build and then thats it. There is not much to test your build on (that is with builds and power progression feeling flat and not rewarding).

- Enemy variety is lacking. This could just be the universe they have to work with lore wise as NIoh 2 revolved around yokai (there are a ton of yokai in japanese lore). Or they are just slacking who knows.

- Accessory customization is a step back.

- Graces feel underwhelming and boring. There is so much they can do with the foundation they have. They already have a loot and stat based game why not add cool effects or even boss uniques.... something to add some variety or effects that change a build completely. 

- Not sure if it was added in an update but not being able to transfer graces is annoying.

Some positive features to the game: 

- Buffs and spells are not tied to ""capacity"" like nioh. It is nice not running out of casts, etc during a mission or fight. This was a good change.

- Combat and movement is snappy as expected from Team Ninja. Parry mechanic is fun. This is why a first playthrough can be enjoyable. After that it just feels pointless to play.


DLC: Didnt bother continue playing this game once DLC came out because the additions did not do it for me. Not enough upgrade levels on gear for a sense of power progression (only added 1 + level). Also lacking solid end-game content.

Overall I don't know where they will take this game or what direction it is heading in. They need bottom up changes to systems to make it something that people keep grinding and playing. I don't feel a big sense of power progression in this game as the game overall seems very ""flat"" and pointless to grind. I would give it some time to see what they add in the DLCs.",1680118515,1693449162,False,89,4,0.808967530727386475,0,True,False,False

I was very wrong.

The game is alright...just alright. 

Not comparing it to Nioh or Nioh 2 and just look at the game by itself. The design and the graphics looks quite good and I enjoy the visuals quite well. Combat wise it is fast paced which feels nice but also a bit on the boring side. The spells are neat but I feel like they could have honestly done a better job.

Now I am willingly/unwillingly putting faith in this game. Hopefully further updates will help this game. But that is entirely dependent on the devs putting their rears in gear. Since performance is quite literally just eh. I already brushed upon the game play.

For those who are curious about this game and want to play this game. Play the demo and see if you like it. If you don't I advise you to play Nioh 2 or Nioh 1.

----Update----
7/1/23

Personally still stand by my above comments. But I can only pray Steam gives me a refund. Pre-ordered it for my birthday awhile ago. Honestly last time I do something like that. I try to give games benefit of the doubt on release day as well as a handful of months afterwards.

After all Devs are only human and irl stuff can get in the way of things. But update after update with the announcement of two collabs. Devs make progress with bugs but I feel like it is more of an after thought.

So like I said if you want to give it a go please - PLEASE play the demo first. Not only will it give you proof that you can run it. But also see if you will enjoy it before making the mistake I did.

----Update for the update >:D ----
Well-well the consequences of my actions. 

Rest in peace my wallet as no refund is allowed. So now to divert all my energy back into my hope for this game. Truth be told I feel like when modding is allowed this game will most likely pop off. Fingers crossed as we can only pray.

----Update 8/30/23----

My hope is still strong for this cause I don't have much choice. Despite meeting the requirements I just can't for the life of me find a good balance between solid quality where it doesn't hurt my eyes and I can play the game without sweating bullets every single time I need to parry as I concentrate waiting for that moment to parry.

Spells are still just meh. But to be honest I think that is just due to me playing Nioh 2 first. So I will throw myself under the bus on that one. The combat is still boring since it is really just you pushing one maybe two buttons. If you are feeling really fancy for that special someone in your life you hit three buttons.

If you are a console player I think you will just have an easier time. Mainly due to the fact that on PC it just feels awkward.

Now don't get me wrong it isn't a bad game. Just ultimately it could have been a lot better than what it is now. So in the end I shall have my fingers cross and wait for a handful of updates, patches whatever you want to call them before I give it another go.",1687382524,1693447581,False,138,11,0.7541847825050354,0,True,False,False

It's dark souls meets dynasty Warriors, and it's slightly easier.

It's better on PC than it was on the console, especially when using a controller.

You don't need allies, but when you use them, they start off kinda whack, but are able to level into being great based on their oath with you - holy shit - just like the rest of the dynasty warriors series.

If you want to fight the animal within half of these great general Larry Boi's - while having epic spear on sword clash battles - where getting hit actually matters - then you've found that game.

There's no clunk, besides the jumps which Koei and Ninja still have issues with to this day. Ramps that you can't vault over, seem to be a staple since DW4 days... But then again, its not like dark souls doesn't have clunk on half their weapons and spells. Never mind Elden Ring.

It's a smooth combat experience, where your character actually winds up for the swings, and takes a legit approach to the weapon style. Add in some Martial Arts, and you start really feeling like a true warrior of the three kingdoms no musou.

You get to fight along side some of the greatest warriors that ever lived, and fight some pretty cool demons. 

If your looking for an exact copy of Dark Souls, just with out the name - go grab mortal shell. 

If your wanting an interesting story, that adds demonic qi to the usual Warring Kingdoms series of stories, turning The Tiger of Wu, Sun Jian, into a brutal tiger boss - you've found that game.

It was a great attempt at another genre switch for their games, being more similar to Sekiro than Nioh, but if I had to make the next choice, I'd say stick to what you're good at.

PRO
- The setting is beautiful with so many cool looking places to explore
- The music is really nice and sets the haunting, mystical and action filled landscape perfectly
- The game play is pretty simple but looks stylish and feels really cool when you can time things just right
- It was cool seeing so many historical characters in the game and I imagine most people would recognise them from Dynasty Warriors.
- All the enemy and boss designs were awesome and they all have some amazing sound design
- I loved how hard the first boss was, it really gave a challenge and made sure you understood the mechanics
- If things get too hard you can summon AI and real players to help
- You can choose English and Japanese audio but if you want to keep things authentic then there is a Chinese audio option too which was a really nice addition.

NEUTRAL
- The button prompts are PlayStation and I can't seem to find a way to change it to Xbox controller not that it made any difference in how I played.
- The levelling up is very simple. So simple in fact that I got through the whole game without using much of the magic or abilities. You can find what works for you pretty quick and go with that.
- While the enemies do look really nice and stylish there aren't a massive variety and you'll be fighting the same ones over and over.
- Checkpoints are very close together so there's not that much feeling of fear of dying.
- You can summon AI to help you (and most levels start with at least one) and to me that just makes the game too easy. Turning them off felt a lot better.

CONS
- The Three Kingdoms era is one of the most fascinating to learn about and the stories involved are really cool. However, the story is really hard to follow and just seems to go wherever and jumping around a lot with little explanation. I only know somewhat what's going on because I have a very brief and rough understanding of that time.
- There are a ton of weapons and gear to find but I found myself a select few, upgraded them to the max and that's all I used the entire game. Nothing I found even came close.
- Most of the bosses felt unbalanced. You can either beat them in one or two tries or it can take you at least ten.
- There is an online component (like Dark Souls invasions) but it was hard to find people to invade and when I did it was pretty laggy.

All in all I'd say this game is worth a go if you're into historical Asia, Three Kingdoms or just souls-like games in general. As much as I do like this game though I'd say wait for a decent sale, you'll feel you'll get your moneys worth a lot more that way.

The world looks mostly fine, sound is not bad either...so much for the good parts.
The story is...well it's romance of three kingdoms. The few twists are kinda...strange. For some reason the game ends after what is basically the opening act of the Three Kingdoms novel, despite the end showing characters and events from a lot later....my guess is the DLC's were already planned and in development before the game was even finished.

The whole world is the stereotype console game. You have set path, straying from them is not possible, even if it looks otherwise. Invisible walls prevent you from walking over grass ... or walking up slopes. You often get stuck on random clutter as well. In that regard it feels like you are playing a PS1 game, though honestly even PS3 and PS5 games love to have this completely un-open world where invisible walls and corners block paths that are clearly there.
Combat is... sluggish. Dodge is mostly cosmetic.
Like most games these days the devs were like ""real time action is so cool"" and at the same time ""party play is so cool"". As a result you have 1 or 2 bots ""helping"" you, I put the air quotes because those bots are a detriment. More often then not they charge into enemies, pulling whole areas when you try to sneak behind them and launch a sneak attack. In other occasions you walk a thin bridge...then the bots go charge, pushing you into the enemy (or off the bridge) with literally no way to opt out. Of course there is no controls for the bots and they are not optional, literally every single mission you have 1 or 2. 

The game copied a lot from Dark Souls, especially the non existent AI. As already stated above your bots are a detriment. Often you can see them die because they stand in a fire...and cba to move. Other times you jump from roof to roof..while your bots just jump off into a horde of enemies. Enemies aren't any better. There is a field boss before Lu BU.. I pulled him with a ranged attack to watch him charge off into the distance. Since he didn't return after a while I walked off to search for him...found him ""walking without moving""  in fire, obviously stuck on nothing. He died like that. It happens all the time.
Last time I played the game would often flash for no reason, whole screen suddenly turning white, then area loading while characters are still bright white, then characters loading. Draw distance is mostly garbage. Took 1 step forward, giant enemy spawns out of nowhere like 10m away...walking towards me. I take a step back and the enemy vanishes....minutes later and the mob is still gone. So I take 1 step forward and the enemy re-appears right where I last saw him and continues walking towards me. Some great 1990's tech when enemies aren't rendered within spitting distance and not rendered enemies are obviously not even moving or acting...
Another thing they copied from Dark Souls is the game is plainly unfair. Not a single enemy possesses something remotely resembling AI. Archers just spawn out of thin air on roofs 20m away from you, behind every corner is at least 1 mob scripted to jump you the moment you get close, enemies have unlimited resources to use, most non-trash mobs possess far superior agility and range and ofc. you are almost always forced to face superior numbers in limited space.

If you like the Three Kingdoms era, just play Dynasty Warriors (I don't recommend the latest), if you want some soulslike, then just stick with Dark Souls or Elden Ring.

But it's not. 
Lacking in every way compared to Nioh games: weapons, moves, skills, spells, character progression, customization. Everything is lacking. 

FPS stutters are a thing, but I would definetely ignored it if this game was good. But it's not. 5/10, maybe 6 at best. Sadly, can't recommend.

Oh, but they added a PRONOUNCE option!

Update after I finished it.
It took 21 hours to beat. The last boss was easier than the first one. Although there were some even more frustrating than that.
Towards the end I started skipping all additional missions, because they offer me literally nothing except frustration and timeloss. You get enough upgrade materials from the main missions, and the only thing that matters is your weapon anyways. Once you get it to +9 it's over, there is basically nothing you can do to improve your build. And I wouldn't call it ""build"", it's just any +9 weapon and parry/evade button.

The most dissapointing and downgraded thing is magic. It's basically useless. It runs off VERY fast. For example weapon buff last about 10 seconds, maybe even less. It leads to such stupid situations were you apply buff, run to the enemy, try to hit it once or twice and it's gone! You spent most of the buff time to cast the buff and run towards the enemy.

Final thoughts: I was hoping to change my verdict when I finish the game, that it will have something to appreciate, something good. But no, there was nothing.

And when considered in relation to its Team Ninja forebears, the Nioh series, it is a dramatic departure in not only gameplay, but design principles.  

Wo Long trades the complexity and depth of combat of Nioh for a system much more akin to Sekiro, although having more depth than it does. At the same time compared to Sekiro you lose out on much better designed world. For my part, I didn’t think Sekiro’s story was anything special and nor did I find it compelling. And I skipped all the cutscenes of Wo Long, so I cannot testify to its quality.

The combat is as satisfying as Sekiro’s was, so if you enjoyed the moment-to-moment gameplay of Sekiro, you should enjoy Wo Long. If you did not enjoy Sekiro, then there’s likely no chance you will enjoy Wo Long. It is the same basic gameplay loop, but with a few additions. I did not use magic nor did I really make too much use of the spirit attacks in my playthrough. I didn’t find them particularly necessary.

There are some amazing bosses in the game. Lu Bu, Dong Zhuo, Zhang Liao, etc. They make for such grand spectacles that you will forever remember them the way you likely remember the Sword Saint or Owl. And the regular enemies are generally quite fun to engage in combat with varied movesets that demand mastery of the game’s system. 

As for difficulty, I found it much easier than Sekiro was, but I think that was mostly because I was primed to play Wo Long by Sekiro. On its own, I think it is as hard, if not harder than Sekiro, due to slightly less generous parry timings and more aggressive bosses. 

Perhaps the most damning aspect of the game is its numerous technical and QoL issues. And it simply does not make sense that they are so terrible. The game clearly lifts a ton technically from the Nioh games, yet Wo Long is radically more unstable and somehow manages to perform worse while also looking worse than the Nioh games did. From what I understand, the game has been patched significantly since I played it at release and the experience may differ; however, my experience with the game was of constant crashing. I have nearly 200 hours into Nioh 2 and it has only crashed several times. Wo Long crashed over 50 times in 20 hours. The only saving grace being that Wo Long is so easy and checkpoints are so frequent that it didn’t present too much of an impediment.

What I find most baffling is the missing QoL features at launch that were in Nioh. The game lacked a ton of basic features that made managing your inventory, equipment, and other basic aspects of the game much more manageable. There was simply no reason for it to be missing those features. And I just cannot fathom why they were not there at release. The only explanation I can offer for the game’s numerous issues is that it was clearly rushed out. It’s quite unfortunate because I feel like the game would have been much received had it just had more time in the oven.

No doubt a lot of people are upset that this is not Nioh 2. As someone that loves Nioh 1 and 2 and considers them two of the greatest games of all time, I’m sad we’re going to have to wait a good long while before we ever get another. Still, Wo Long, outside of the aforementioned issues, is a fun game. It has satisfying combat for the style it is going for even if it isn’t anywhere as satisfying as Nioh is. And I’ll be glad to have both Wo Long and Nioh going forward to scratch different itches. 

I feel divided on the game. I had fun with it, but the game was marred severely by technical and QoL issues. And these things aren’t excusable. There’s no reason the game should have been released in the state that it was. And on top of that, it is much shorter with far less content than Nioh 1 and 2 even without the DLCs. It is not worth full price. Not by a long shot. Pick the game up when it is 50% off or more.

One of the biggest issues is performance, I play on a super ultrawide monitor (32:9) so your experience may varry, but I also have a 3080 Ti and i7-8700k with more than enough ram (64GB ram). I can get the game to run decently fine with DLSS on, and with the sharpening enabled it looks and runs quite well.

Gameplay wise is a big mixed bag, I personally love the gameplay loop because I love challenging gameplay, I will however say that this is definitely not for everyone and that this is likely one of the most challenging games I've played in this genre. I will say if you're coming to this game expecting Nioh 3, you'll be disappointed as the gameplay is nothing like Nioh. None of its complexities of combo exist in this. If you're familiar with Sekiro, its more similar to Sekrio. This game may get somewhat repetitive for those who want more verity in the combo system though. But the thrill of perfectly parrying an opponent and perform some arts and do a critical attack is very satisfying.

A few great changes to quality of life have been done in this in that changing effects on weapons and armor is no longer random and its based on a currency system. To do the some of stronger effects you have to find it on a piece of equipment first. Salvaging the equipment as well as explicitly taking the effect out will grant you said currency. The effects are also limited to one per type as indicated by a shape icon. armor / weapon sets are still in the game.

The game drops frames if it has to think about anything more than a menu. As far as I can tell this seems to be due to a broken frame limiter that can not be disabled.
After an hour of attempting to configure it, the only thing I managed to achieve is for it to look worse and still drop frames.

Difficulty is unfair after first play through. There is always a sense of masochism when it comes to difficult games like this, but after a certain point this game becomes only pain and no pleasure. Getting one or two shot by 90% of the bosses in the game kinda make your hp redundant, there is no difference between having low hp and high hp, you have to constantly chug potions to keep your hp full otherwise one slip up and you are dead. Your character gradually feels weaker as you go deeper into ng+ and ng++, which contradicts the premise of games like these, which is asking for more challenge as you get stronger, but you never feel like you are getting strong in this game. There is little build diversity that may suit your play style, but when it comes to function(meaning killing bosses) there is only a few that work and they are the same cheese strats everybody else is using.

Stat/build progression feels unsatisfactory after you invest like 40 in any stat, and item farming is very unrewarding, there is just too much RNG and good items are really hard to come by.

Aside from bad gameplay design, there are some technical issues. The speed of the game is tied to your fps. Meaning when you get fps drops, the game slows down, which effects how fast the animations play which in turn effects your timings(parry timings are crucial in this game), so your muscle memory is thrown off at times resulting in frequent death.  
Also the camera, especially in closed spaces against larger enemies, is absolutely horrible. There will be times when you won't be able to see anything or follow the enemy movements. Certain visual effects(like poison clouds, lightning/elemental explosions) impede vision, which again hugely impacts gameplay because the game is all about parry timings. 

People complain about the graphics, but I do like em, I like the animations, armor design and weapons. Level design is pretty medicore. Bosses are ok'ish. NPC companions are so so. Like I said earlier, there are some good in the game, but it is riddled with problems.

Don't think this game ever advertised itself as Ni-Oh 3, yet people wanted this to be that. For reference, the combat is more akin to Sekiro than Ni-Oh which is a matter of preference on your end which you like best.
I personally have only encountered a few minor bugs, nothing game breaking, but that's also kind of up to the game and one of the visual bugs I encountered would've definitely given me an epileptic fit if I suffered from those (thankfully it was patched out rather quickly).
That said I absolutely adore this game! Every fight feels like a fight to the death and every move counts: parrying someone and reduciding their morale and stamina only to then blast your spear into their chest and do massive damage, straight up makes you feel like a Dynasty Warriors character.
The story does go a bit fast, but so did Ni-Oh's so I guess it's more about gameplay than that, unfortunately characters don't get much time to develop but they do have rad designs so that makes up for it.
There's a neat mechanic that allows you to fight alongside other generals like my bro Mengde, but if you prefer more of a challenge, you can easily not fight with them!
Also the game has great customization in terms of your build and a LOT of cool weapons and armor to choose from. The devs seem to also be doing a lot of neat quality of life updates that add some fun new features to the experience.
Amazing game overall, hopefully the DLCs can keep it going like Ni-Oh 2's!

There at least from where I'm standing seems to be no reason for this as one moment the game is running as fine as this poor PC port of a thing can be and the next every other loading screen it just decides it wants to crash on you. Oh and lets not forget it deciding it wants to crash 5 to 6 times trying to boot it up and if you think I'm making this shit up just look up crash on the Red, the Steam forum and I'm sure Koei's official forums and you'll see hundreds if not thousands of complaints. Hell some people can't even PLAY the game as they are simply crashing on boot up just like the demo. But you know what really is just.. assinine? The response to it all. Basically being treated like they are stupid or their computer just isn't 'good' enough for a bloody game that runs on the gosh danged PS4.. hell go google the PS5's specs, its really not some god machine people make it out to be. There is a reason recommended is the 2060. Oh and I can't forget those who are all 'just update your drivers' um yea with how in your face Windows 10 and Nvidia is about driver updates you'd usually always have those damned things up to date. Not everyone is going to sit down and either uninstall Geforce Experience because its such a nuisance or find a way to disable Windows Updates. Its sad to see such a fantastic game suffering from issues that should of very well been fixed within a day or two after launch yet here we are a week later with Koei basically not even acknowledging they exist and even according to some shrugging it off as 'PC not good enough'. But hey at least they admit the mouse and keyboard controls will make you wonder what kind of acid trip the person choosing them for the PC port was on.

I'll delete my review once these problems are rectified and maybe even give a better one once I'm able to.. ya know be able to play the game.

Update: Nothing was fixed since making this review and the devs seemed to have stomped their feet going the route of blaming the consumer.

Everything feels like a music play game or even quick time events. The bosses and enemies are way too predictable, even when i die I come back and just read everything they do. Dodging is a rapid double press of the dodge button, it's odd. This game is actually slower than nioh and ninja gaiden, it's really strange. Stranger of paradise is probably the most ambitious but effective game team ninja has made. I thought that game would be the base for this one, but it isn't. This game is reliant on a parry mechanic way too much. That makes pacing slower, tedious, and boring.

The combat is nice and the story is ok (lots of references to the “Three Kingdoms period”). There were a lot of moments where I was like: I know this dude, or I know this place/battle/event.
The replay value is also there (ng+ and so on) with better armour/weapons and the increased difficulty. You can also just roleplay one of the many characters ingame.

Performance: I had some difficulties at the beginning. Namely massive stutters that made the game unplayable. But after some changes the game ran smoothly at 60fps. I disabled the ingame vsync, set the ingame fps cap to 120fps and then capped the fps via “RiverTuner” to 60fps (GPU fps cap works too). After these changes I never encountered any noticeable stuttering or frame drops.

The game could have used some more polish like: There is only one climbing animation for absolutely everything, sometimes the ground looks smooth enough to walk on, but you get caught on something small. But that happened like 2-3 times during my playthrough.

If I had to name some negative points: Very rough launch, shouldn’t and can’t happen to a game at that price point. And, the cutscenes are sadly capped at 30fps.

The morale system is great. It's essentially a secondary character level contained to each battlefield which is raised by killing enemies and activating checkpoints. It provides a sense of progression within levels, rewards exploration, and helps normalize difficulty to a degree even if the player is somewhat over or under leveled.

The spirit system is also great as an alternative to the more standard stamina system. Spirit can be spent on spells and more powerful melee attacks, but needs to be gained primarily by parrying or connecting with normal melee attacks. This solves the common soulslike problem of slow and passive play being the easiest path to victory. You can even get really aggressive without needing to worry about running out of stamina and just shred enemies with a flurry of attacks and perfectly timed parries, which feels awesome.

The most difficult bosses in the game are very difficult indeed. Mostly these are a lot of fun, even if there are a few stinkers (looking at you, Taotie). Lu Bu on his horse stands out to me among the many soulslikes I've played as a truly great boss. That being said, between each hard boss that took me a dozen or so attempts, there would be 3-5 total pushovers that went down on the first or second try, so the difficulty curve is very weird. It's worth noting that the literal first boss is among the hardest in the game.

There's a very in-depth gear system based around random drops. Personally I can't stand this sort of thing but luckily you can basically ignore it. I beat the whole game using armor I found during my first few hours and only switched weapons once about halfway through. So if min maxing gear stats is your jam then go crazy but if you're like me, rest easy knowing that skill alone is good enough.

Performance wise I barely had any issues. Playing on the default high settings, the game crashed on me exactly once in ~30 hours and I suffered only some mild frame drops during certain parts of a single specific battlefield. My machine is nothing impressive either so I'm not exactly sure what's going on in that regard as so many others are describing a lot more technical troubles.

That said, Nioh 2 is a fantastic game, and not reaching the heights of such a fantastic game is by no means an indictment. Wo Long is still very good.

Wo Long takes the Nioh formula, and strips it down a lot. The game is shorter (took me about a third of the time to beat), far less complex, and significantly easier (I only  died roughly 60 times, rather than around 300 times, on my first playthrough, though experience with Nioh 2 probably helped). 

The combat revolves nearly entirely around parries (technically deflections, but I'm going to call them parries), which is basically animated i-frames that do stagger, in Wo Long. Your dodge button is your parry button. To do a full dodge, you press twice, to do a very short dodge, but have parry frames, you press once. This means, unlike Nioh, or even Dark Souls, you've only got two main defensive buttons. You've got your standard block, and you've got parry/dodge.

Furthermore, Wo Long does away with stamina/ki, and replaces it with the spirit gauge. When you hit enemies or parry, it goes up, when you get hit, dodge, or use a special ability, it goes down. When you get hit when it's at 0, you get staggered, and the bar naturally goes towards 50% over time. Sprinting and basic attacking do not impact this gauge, so you can stay on the move and aggressive at all times without sweating stamina management.

Everyone has a spirit bar, even enemies. Doing big damage to bosses generally means doing a number of parries against critical strikes to lower their spirit bar, staggering them when they're low, and then doing a fatal strike. Nioh 2 also had something like this, where the enemy glows red and you use a Burst Counter to stagger the enemy. It's largely the same here, but you don't have to use a special button combination to pull it off.  The game [i]really[/i] wants you to do this, and while you technically don't [i]have[/i] to do it, it's definitely way you're supposed to play, because it's by far the biggest damage you'll get in on enemies. This comes across as a disappointment for some fans of Nioh, because that series gives you just an absurd amount of options and ways to approach things, whereas in Wo Long, there's pretty much just the one.

That said, the one way to fight in Wo Long is fun. Trying to rush in, get hits to lower the enemy spirit (on top of the critical blow parries), and parrying as necessary gives battle an exciting, flashy, organic flow of attack and defense.

The biggest criticisms I have against the game are probably balance and the morale system.

The morale system is basically an in-level leveling system. On each level, you'll start at morale level 0 (usually, side missions may start higher), and cap out at 25. The morale system has you running around the levels looking for stone flag stands to shove flags in. The main ones of these increase your baseline morale by 2-3, and function as checkpoints, and smaller ones increase your baseline morale by 1. Baseline morale generally caps out at 20, with max morale, as said, being 25. You can raise morale by defeating enemies as well, but it'll drop to the baseline if you die, and will also go down if you get hit by critical blows. The less you die in a level, the higher your morale generally builds up, making a level easier as you go on if you don't die. This includes the bosses of the level, because you'll likely be at 25 when you reach them, but your morale will go down if you die to them, making you actually less powerful if you immediately challenge bosses again without farming back up morale. It's not terrible or anything, but it's definitely weird, and seems questionable, since it's one of those, ""Oh, you died? Let's make things [i]harder[/i]."" type systems, which I'm never a fan of. Still, there's a baseline, so it's not like it progressively punishes you, thus it's not too bad.

As far as balance is concerned: Boss difficulty is all over the place. The hardest boss in the game is mid-game rather than the end boss. The first boss is a decent bit more difficult than the next few bosses. Some bosses are relatively easy to just go in and beat in one try, whereas some may take a fair number of tries. One character you face twice is significantly easier the second time you fight them than the first time you fight them (and there's really no narrative reason this should be the case). Most games you would expect to get more challenging as you go on, but Wo Long actually just seems to dot difficulty around, rather than having a natural ramp up.

Still, most of the boss fights are fun. There's a couple I didn't really enjoy, but having a few misses in these games isn't too bad, so long as they're not run-ending due to frustration (and they weren't).

Anyway, despite the fact that Wo Long often gets unfavorably compared to Nioh 2, it's still fun, and really kind of its own thing. They're different enough that just because you like one absolutely does not indicate if you'll really like the other. Wo Long doesn't lean even close to as hard into the RPG character building as Nioh does, and chooses to mostly just focus on the parry-centric combat (rather than showering you with options, like Nioh does). Did I enjoy Nioh 2 more? Yeah, I did, but I also had a lot of fun with Wo Long.",1688347222,1688696982,True,46,5,0.724438965320587158,2,True,False,False

Hardest first boss you may have ever encountered, with co-op being locked behind it.  If you don't learn the systems and strategize properly you might have a really hard time.  I say kill the little guys until they drop a polearm and then deflect, light swingx2 then heavy or martial art and keep on the guy until he tires.  You can do it!

The system for the elements is pretty interesting, still trying to feel it out since it's both elemental AND things like stamina/strength/wisdom etc.  which also coincide with your weapon's natural output.  Still not entirely sure how to build my character, but been enjoying this with friends so far.

====EDIT===

Alright, now that I understand the systems, I should update this.  

The element systems affect base stats (like defense, martial arts damage, etc) and also are requisites for certain spells.  If you have 20 in fire and something requires 20 fire, you can cast it, but it won't necessarily be very powerful if it is offensive magic.  However, if it's just a buff, you're good to go.

That said, you can alter your equipment quite easily, and whenever you salvage things you can rip all of the boosts off that thing and put them however you want on other similar items (armor or weapons).

If at any time you want to respec your points, you can do that for free.  Was fun to experiment, but I concluded the following tier list:

FIRE  (great damage over time & initial damage)
WOOD (great debuff that makes enemies tired)
WATER (most enemies are not resistant to ice and you can destroy them)
EARTH (the debuff is awesome in co-op as it makes them take more spirit damage)
METAL (this tree feels very underwhelming and the status is also the weakest)

The spirit (aka stamina) system is really interesting and refreshing, and basically counts as both a stamina and mana bar simultaneously.  When you cast too much or do too many fancy/heavy attacks, it will go into the negative, and in order to get it back into the positive you need to do light attacks, wait, or deflect incoming strikes.  Makes for a very cool back and forth and A VERY COOL PVP INVASION SYSTEM.  Absolutely incredible PVP experiences for me.  You can take on multiple player opponents and win if you're methodical, have a good strategy, and good timing/luck.

The end-game DLC content is a bit slow, as the level requirements for it are very high and to reach such heights it will take some grinding. 

I will say that the drop rates for bosses feels more like an MMO than what this game ""is"".  It took me 2.5 hours to get the spell I wanted from a boss that I was relentlessly farming.  That seems a bit off, but otherwise, loving this game.  

Whatever changes they made to networking for the DLC release seem to make the experience worse.  I would have preferred the previous rendition, as sometimes enemies simply appear next to you sometimes (or the other side of the planet).",1677882288,1688594175,True,7,1,0.53273773193359375,0,True,False,False

I have nothing negative to say about this sublime game since the story is excellent where the developers mix Chinese history (or rather literature) with Chinese mythology. The gameplay is very entertaining, it does require some understanding of the game mechanics to progress but it is not that difficult. It can be said that it is an easier version of Nioh and some comments see it as lesser version of Nioh but I find that the developers have outdone themselves here, creating a game that should be treated as an equal of Nioh. The graphics and music are amazing where you can really enjoy the immersive aspect of Wo Long.

If you've read the negative comments you will notice that most of them discuss the performance of the game, stating that there are numerous crashes or FPS drops.

----Prognosis-----
It seems as though Team Ninja in an attempt to reach a wider audience, has in fact isolated their core fan base; through simplifying their established niche diminishing their overall product for anyone involved. 
I'd recommend for Team Ninja to instead realise the wants of their demographic and focus on doubling down on those fundamentals. 

----Gameplay-----
Game felt silky smooth with the added ""parry-all"" system, although a downside being that it was far too forgiving with the parry window. They need to realise the tools they gave us in retrospect of the difficulty. Every early game boss was a 1 shot, thanks to the attention of any boss being split among you and your mandatory teammates on every mission. 
I'd say the overall difficulty of the game should be about 3x harder.
Like any Team Ninja game the monster variety is weak, please add more...
Map design has come A LONG way, this was by far the biggest improvement from Nioh 2, I would look forward to having similar quality in the next Nioh game.
Overall the gameplay felt good, game was decently fun, sadly.. by the time the game ended I was still wanting more (which is probably a good thing?) but again the game was pretty much a joke in terms of difficulty, only really a couple bosses giving me some trouble.

I'd say this game would score somewhere between 6.8-6.9. Not a horrible game, but knowing the previous title they had created was easily one of the greatest games of all time made this kind of a disappointment. 
the systems in Nioh 2 were akin to streetfighter combos/darksouls, animation cancelling attacks into weapon swaps/spell animation cancelling had the depth of their previous title something for anyone's brain to really chew on. Sinking over 400 hours into Nioh 2, as Wo Long got a measly 40 hours with 1.5 playthroughs, yikes...

The new DLC bosses are a lot of fun, and really challenging, but they always felt fair. Difficult as hell, but every time I lost to them it was because my timing was off or I got too greedy with additional hits. The fact there are even more new armour sets, new scrolls to farm for new spells, and whole new NG++ with updated enemy placement and a new rarity tier is fantastic. I can't believe how badly the game is rated on steam. I am running a 3080ti, so it probably masks a lot of the optimisation issues people face, but if you like Nioh 2, I suspect you'll like this. Maybe get it on a console if your PC isn't a powerhouse.

Ive not been impacted by the tech issues, and I play on a controller anyway. If you love the Nioh games, then chances are you'll love this just as much, if not more. The combat feels the best it's ever done in a Nioh-like game, they're taken the formula to the next level, and it's a joy to play. The enemy design has also really stepped up a notch.

EDIT: After completing the game, my views have changed somewhat. I still rate this game very highly, and have just bought the season pass. I've began NG+ immediately. I did notice that whilst the bosses in the game stayed awesome in design, there were great disparities in difficulty, with some bosses taking me 20+ goes to complete, and others I would steamroll in a single go. Sadly there were quite a few more steamroll worthy bosses in the game than challenging ones. NG+ does seem suitably harder already which I'm happy about about. I think the game could do with some more balancing, especially around the final 4 bosses, who I beat in collectively less than 10 goes (between all 4 of them). Whereas Lu Bu, I went into fairly underpowered, 12 Morale to his 20, and it took me upwards of 50 attempts to do him because of his one shot attacks. That was a genuinely great fight (first version of him, not the one later in game which only took 3 attempts, which again doesnt make sense considering the second time he should be harder).

I also think that the combat isnt the best its been overall, I think Nioh 2 had the best pure melee combat because of the stance system and the counter mechanic, but Wo Long does have a far better magic and martial arts system than anything you had in Nioh 2, so it evens the playing field in that sense, and I find both combat systems equally great in their own ways.

The action takes place in a grim, dark fantasy version of Chinese Three Kingdoms period, or rather the events directly preceeding the formation of actual ""Three Kingdoms"". And as it is a game of Tecmo Koei, producer of Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Dynasty Warriors series, one can expect their take on history (a bit like how it was with Nioh and Samurai Warriors).
Most negative reviews focus on poor performance. While I've got to admit that the game IS demanding in terms of hardware, I was able to play it just fine in 4K with high details on PC with i7-11700K and RTX 3070 while recording gameplay with GeForce Experience app. Nvidia optimization tool suggested 2K resolution, but it was still very much playable on specs mentioned above. That said, I needed to turn off all other apps. So I suppose that it should be possible to play it with satisfatory results if you choose the right graphic settings and resign from using your PC for other things while playing.
As for the story, apparently bland and non-existent for some, I would say that overall it is similliar to Nioh games - though much closer to Nioh 2 than 1, as you play a nameless millitia soldier that you create yourself at the start of the game. Due to this, your character is practically mute, like in Nioh 2. The story is mostly presented in cutscenes, during which other named characters, often famous historical figures, talk with each other or have a monologue commenting recent events, explaining their plans and so on.
During the events of the story you meet and fight - sometimes alongside, sometimes against - most of the most esteemed warriors of the early Three Kingdoms era. Usually you can instantly tell that someone is important at first sight, as they wear characteristic armour, designed with great care to detail.
Fighting is what this game is about. And that's the best part of it. Action is thick and quick. They went into a interesting direction with parrying - you can parry EVERYTHING, from simple strikes, through arrows to giant fireballs. All by one press of a button which is actually paired with dodge. But there is a catch - you need to time it right. And a lot of bosses have surprisingly long wind-ups for their attacks. So in a classic souls-like fashion, sometimes you might need to take a few tries before you finally win, but the triumph will be sweet. Although, in many cases it is possible to ""learn"" the bosses during the first encounter good enough for it to be the last.
The most unique part of combat is the Spirit system. Instead of stamina, the staple resource used for attacking, blocking and dodging in souls likes, there is the Spirit Gauge. It decreases when you:
a) get hit
b) try to dodge-parry (and not actually parry anything)
c) use a ""strong"" Spirit consuming attack, Martial art or a Wizardry spell
did you notice a distinct lack of regular attacks and running in the above-mentioned? Trust me, during gameplay you will. Because the spirit increases with each:
a) succesful regular attack (even if your opponent blocks, as long as the attack connects your spirit will rise and enemy's will drop)
b) succesful parry
This spirit system makes combat very dynamic and fun.

TLDR - It is a game for people that
- like fast paced combat
- like the Three Kingdoms period (or at least the Tecmo Koei version of it)
- like Chinese folklore, as there is plenty of demons and Mystic Beasts
- have a decent PC

honestly its a really great game, love the story and mechanics, the systems they have in place make it feel like a mix of Nioh and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice.

Its incredibly poorly optomized, on any machine ive tested it even on the lowest settings it stutters horribly, there are graphics options you just cant turn of, the LOD is so short that in some maps enemies will almost literally appear on top of you. in an early map this is so noticable that when using a ranged weapon (the camera zooms to aim) you can shoot at an enemy, and when the camera returns to normal the arrow misses as the enemy has unspawned, despite me being maybe 20 feet away. Constant stuttering, horrible performance, and frequent crashes set this as a no recommend from me, i honestly regret buying it in its current condition.",1680277732,1688133913,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

DLC EXTREMELY OVERPRICED!

LONG REVIEW. CONTINUED IN COMMENTS. Steam sucks and has too many issues so I can't add more nor upload clips. Steam says ITSELF is unsafe and won't link my youtube for the video page. Thanks I guess for protecting me from yourself Steam.

My full review is like triple this because there are just SO MANY problems. I'll try to add what I can, if Steam stops sucking.

Invading is unplayable. Co-op somewhat tolerable.

Wo Long is a bad game with some potential. This is like the C team using the skin of Nioh to pass itself off as legitimate. Game is cheap, like everything is made of plastic. It's the director's first title ever and it shows badly. They cashed in on company reputation here. Don't buy.

I've 100%'d it and beyond. I have everything, I've done everything. I've experimented extensively with everything. Every spell and skill, all weapons and armors and bonuses, in every mode. I'm the only one I know of who has no-hit the bosses on NG+ legit no cheese and have the final title that comes with that accomplishment. I probably played the game much more than the devs did.

But they did release an actual demo and that is to be commended as demos are a lost move in the games' industry and incredibly important. I'm very appreciative to the company for that integrity act. I'm almost glad I could support this for that alone.

But I digress, Wo Long is a watered down, aka ""streamlined"", action game in the vein of Nioh/Ninja Gaiden/Sekiro/and a little Metal Gear Revengeance set in the Three Kingdoms period of ancient China.

However, the characters and events are there in name only. They are tangential, cursory, barely recognizable and hardly significant. It's a poor excuse to rehash Nioh. Amrita is now Elixir, the MacGuffin of this nonsense. Kelly is now Yu Ji and the protagonist is chasing him for what was stolen just like William did. There are one or two good twists I'll give them that. But literally Yuan Shao complains about bonds and laments the power of friendship. It's enough to make you puke with how trite and stupid it is.

If a computer AI spat out this ""story"", I would not be surprised at all. Nothing has any impact despite the attempts to. The last stage is a revisit to the first stage, but the character you are supposed to have a bond with only appeared in those two stages and the game acts like it's an epic encounter. No, because obviously we spent zero time with the character we were supposed to care about. It has all the trappings of emotional build up and investment (the music, the stage revisit after time passed, the atmosphere) but falls embarrassingly flat and for obvious reasons that I can't believe they actually tried to pass off. Again, if a computer was programmed to spit this out, I would not be surprised. Beep Boop. Input emotion here. Are you invested? I'm playing the music! Remember this!? Please clap. Hell, they even did something like this in Nioh 2 and it was fairly decent, so AGAIN, with so much taken from Nioh, how did they mess up so bad? 

The above represents the rest of the game. Fake, pathetic mimicry.
It's a stolen template without any soul.

The English voices are terrible, the others are fine.

None of the characters were cool or exciting to see. Unlike Nioh, it was not gratifying to see famous figures from this legendary setting. Almost no one stood out and I was grossly disappointed. This is a great shame because one of the best things about Nioh which took place in Sengoku Japan was wondering what surprising encounter was around the corner. This sucked.

Even the music is bad. Maybe one or two good tracks in the game and I think one or two were taken from Nioh. But the main problem is how much is reused. Too many main levels reuse the same track (snow level and rainy level for example). It makes the game feel cheap and shallow.

Game looks fine except for the PS2/3 era attempts at distance vistas. The effects look good, the sounds are good, but it's all in service of bland level design. The levels are so boring and uncreative. And the last main level is basically a vastly inferior copy to the last main levels in Nioh 1 and 2. It's not fun to explore or even causally go through the stages. A handful of nice item placements, but that's not significant.

Okay, now to the meat of the game. Consistency is the word and this game doesn't have it.

Anything outside of the core combat of: deflect, normal combo, spirit strike, fatal blow...sucks. That core is satisfying and addictive, but everything else is bad.

There are an absurd amount of big and small issues  as well as baffling, almost stupid, decisions ranging from gameplay to camera to UI to even automatic text scroll speed. I cannot fathom what they were thinking, especially since so much was copied from Nioh which didn't have most of these issues. Did they only take some parts and not all? Why? How?

It's a very simple action game with skills and spells, centered around a light combo and a heavy strike while deflecting enemy attacks to build meter for stronger hits. However, most spells suck, most skills suck and honestly the player is far better off, more effective, stronger, more accurate, safer and faster if they DON'T use any those bells and whistles. Sticking to the basic formula of using light short combos and deflecting to built meter and then use the heavy strike is far more effective. That's three buttons. Don't even have to move the character. You could play this game with one hand. Not even exaggerating all that much. The game can be difficult but I'll get to that later.

While the core is sound and mostly satisfying (sounds good, looks good), the issues come from everything else.

So not only does the presentation of the game(music, visuals, sounds, story) all feel like cheap plastic, the rest of the gameplay does too.

It's extremely unpolished to the point of feeling underdeveloped. The game is designed for 1v1 combat and when it gives you scenarios involving anything beyond that, it's atrocious and completely falls apart. You feel you fight the mechanics and features more than the enemies at times.

The game cannot handle verticality at all. Try to jump over a horizontal swing and you'll still get hit. And the physics can't even make that look right.

The bells and whistles are meaningless. Buffs and Debuffs hardly have any effect on anything and don't last long enough to be meaningful. 

Almost all spells and skills suck too. They can look good, but almost always pointless. They provide minimal utility, damage, and speed in comparison to the basic attacks. And completely unviable in PVP. So combat there gets even more limited and bland than it already is. 

And skills are tied to weapon drops. You can only use a mere 4 spells at a time and a paltry 2 skills per weapon. You can equip two weapons. You CANNOT change weapon skills. So maybe you got a rare drop that has good stats or a grace you needed for a set bonus, but it lacks any fun skills, or vice versa. Sorry player, you're out of luck, screw you for trying to have fun your way. There is currently no way to change them and this was an extremely stupid choice.

Nothing sucks worse than multiple enemies spamming one hit kill red attacks from off screen. Even the audio cues are terrible. And enemies higher up are programmed to use those hyper armor OHKOs when you commit to a skill and there is nothing you can do about it. You just eat death because they didn't know how to make engaging enemies.

I have so much more to explain but no space!

I said the game at the time was a 7/10. I Complained and rightfully so. that the story was a terriblely put together copy of nioh 2. beat for beat almost. Its been a few months. I came back. and I am going to change my rating a bit. I will be brief on some parts as they arent important or theres no need to expand on them. 


The story: nothing has changed for me. skip/10. play nioh 2. and you will know the story. it doesnt matter if the characters are different. or whatever. the ending could even be different. its still just a beat for beat copy with the same character archetypes. hong the wife character they give you as a companion is hot. she has an aesthetically pleasing body proportions and is nice and caring. and the voice actress in japanese is good. I always pick japanese because I am learning japanese. simple as that. good job on the wife I like / 10. does it effect the score? meh not really. but I am going to mention her. I dont care about ""incel vibes"" or whatever. cope, seethe, get over it. smugface.jpg




the gameplay: so. I said its good and its too easy. just a bit. Playing more I think its too easy because im just really acclimated to koei techmo games at this point. its actually not that easy. it can get challenging at times. its just that I understand how to build characters in general for my playstyle and I have already made a build that I can use very effectively. its testing my building skills and my gameplay skills and I am excelling thus far on my second chance. it doesnt mean its easy. its fairly challenging. if your a nioh 2 vet you will also find that you can excel here. but now that i have gone beyond what I did before I will say it does get more and more challenging. and you will find yourself making sure your character is sufficiently built. I am very much so enjoying the gameplay this time. maybe because I am on a break from nioh 2. I have a on again off again relationship with it. the gameplay for this one is very different. very new. they wanted to do something new and they succeeded. I honestly dont have too many complaints here. the weapons are basically like 7 weapon types. out of those 7 weapon types there are actually a couple sub weapon types such as spears having the heavy spear and the non heavy spear which have different movesets and reach. and some variation on the weapon types that favor different attributes like one will be a fire attribute type one is earth maybe etc.. I find it to be entirely sufficient. the variety feels nice. I dont feel like its at all dumbed down from nioh 2. its different. because this game have entirely different mechanics. such as elemental magic spells, a spirit meter system that sorta a mix of poise and stance. mostly stance sorta like in sekiro. and the flow is very different. It is insufficient to look at nioh 2 and say ""weapon types have all these skills this game doesnt"" you get your two weapon arts you can customize. and you get lots of spells. theres variety here they just built it differently. and I am enjoying it alot. it is very satisfying to to combo and while combing parry attacks and keep going with no loss of flow into a heavy attack doing more spirit damage into a weapon art(called martial arts here) into a riposte. its great mixing spells into my two preferred weapon types being dual hatchets and the not heavy spear as im doing a very fire heavy build. I think honestly the system here succeeds. it is sufficiently unique and takes from other sucessful systems and uses those inspirations intelligently. not to go out of the scope of the review too much but people need to absolutely calm down about stealing game mechanics. theres no such thing as a unique game mechanic. you will never find a game mechanic that wasnt just borrowed somewhere else. they are good mechanics. people can iterate on them. people can mix them and improve them. this is called art. music does it all the time. its ""does it work and is it fun"" unless its an atari game. its stealing from somewhere. you wont find a unique mechanic. its been done already. so I dont care if its like ""oh sekiro stance system"" its fun. it works well. they integrated it into magic. and your martial arts and heavy attacks. and your ability to dodge efficiently. they clearly did work on it. and I like it. 





graphics. not much to say. performance is good. graphics are sufficient. I dont think they are great. I dont look at graphics when writing reviews. the game has to be ""ugly"" for me to care. it has to take away. I look at games like the witcher 3 and notice the graphics for about 3 mins . then i dont. because im playing the game. they dont matter. artstyle matters. this games artstyle is servicable. it does not detract from the game. the areas are fairly varied although within similar areas it is absolutely a bit samey. but I dont notice it. so it doesnt matter to me. I dont get pulled out of the gameplay. thats my important part. 




overall score: used to be a 7. I say the game honestly deserves an 8. taking away from nioh 2. just looking at it as its own thing. yea. its an 8. if you want story. its probably like a 6 to 7 for you and you should play nioh 2 instead. if you want more nioh. this isnt quite that. if you want more fast paced action combat and your bored of nioh dis for you.",1677860071,1687671884,True,8,1,0.565109193325042725,0,True,False,False

What I can say is the combat felt good. It rewards what is basically 'parries' very well and there is a variety of weapons and associated attacking mechanics you can play around with. 

The look and feel of the world was great, and at first, it seems like there is a great variety of mobs. But, by mid-game, you've essentially seen all the mobs there will be.

I've spent hours reading reviews about graphic problems, game crashes and so on. Coming back to the store page, reading comments to patch notes, only to leave empty handed. 

This game is good.

It does not look very pretty. But not all good games look good. Let me be clear here: If you run every game on ultra, overclock and fiddle your nipples when you see the high grass density, this game is not for you. But I can recommend it to everyone else. I'm running on standard settings with an RTX 3050. Cutscenes show 30 FPS, some objects in the distance flicker. Otherwise it's smooth 60 FPS, not one crash so far.

Don't listen to people telling you this game ""steals"" or ""copies"" from Nioh. Same studio, similar mechanics. That being said, don't compare it to anything. The combat system is fast-paced with heavy focus on parries and counters. Throw some magic and utilities in there. Different weapons, armor-weight system and something along the line of stamina (spirit. Weird concept.)

To summarize: This game is good. It's not great. It's not bad. It's your ugly girlfriend, but you still love her, because the inside is what matters (gameplay, not graphics.)

I havent finished the game yet, but have just run into two VERY POORYLY optimized areas where i just have to hope and pray combat goes my way, and not look in certain directions. Honestly i find this in EVERY team ninja game, but this has been the worst offender for me.
Optimization aside, this is a pretty good game. If you like Nioh and Sekiro, your goin to love Wo Long. While its not nearly as polished as Sekiro (optimization and combat), it does scratch the Sekiro itch that ive had since finishing it for the first time. Dont get it wrong, Wo Long does not have the flow of combat that Sekiro did, its Nioh combat with Sekiros deflection system. so if your good at parrying you can really dominate in this game. in fact once you get it down the game is down right easy. Instead of balancing the game properly it feels like they gave you NPC's to help in combat, which makes the game even easier..

Not bad, but not great. It would be a recommend IF it still wasnt so poorly optimized, and we are months past release at this point, really no excuse. and at this stage it wont be fixed.

Just like nioh, Wo Long includes various weapons, but it ditches unique move sets from nioh and each weapon only includes one basic combo and a couple of special moves that use the stamina bar. Weapons feel boring compared to nioh.

Wo Long emphasizes parries just like sekiro, but the enemy variety and behaviour are lacking to pull it off as well as sekiro did.

Not sure what the purpose is for the morale system, all it does is restrict the player. You have to find all the flags on the mission to make sure you can use more powerful skills and also make the boss manageable.

Adding insult to injury, Wo Long removes the dismemberment of the enemies that was present in Nioh 2 and made the combat feel impactful.

In this game u have no reason too, u can just parry parry parry, which once u got the hang of it is fun but pretty much becomes the only thing u do. 

I hope there next game goes back to what Nioh2 had for its combat system, it had way more replay ability, people back then complained about all the numbers, but there stats mattered and making unique builds made a difference, here your character build does not matter at all... 

Its worth playing, it was fun, but only really once then you probably wont want to go through it again, unlike Nioh1 and especially Nioh2, there was just so many smaller reasons to replay the Nioh games, this game does not have.

Now for Story... its a mess and insanely hard to follow, not only that the setting of china is quite bland compared to how they did Japan in Nioh games, The story wont have anything u will remember nor the locations really, the Nioh games where bad also in telling its story, but you could piece it together after playing it often enough and did get me interested in some Japanese lore it was loosely based in unlike this game did",1684754846,1684754846,True,1,0,0.508119940757751465,0,True,False,False

I will say this game gets an unfair amount of hate, half of the negative reviews are from people saying its not as in-depth as Nioh is, which honestly it doesn't need to be. When comparing it to Sekiro, which is the obvious inspiration for this game, it can be argued that Wo Long has MORE depth than it. As a huge fan of Sekiro and Souls-likes with a similar 'deflect' mechanic, this game definitely scratched that itch, albeit being a bit more janky and not quite as responsive as Sekiro.

My main gripe with this game is how quickly it grows stale. I was having a blast until about the 15 hour mark. Around that time, I realized the game already showed me everything it had to offer, although I was only half way through it. Every single main and side quest play out and end the same exact way, and the enemy variety is completely lacking. Once you reach the half way point of the story you've pretty much encountered every mob the game has to offer, and those mobs are just recycled again and again on every map going forward. You'll master the attack patterns of every mob pretty early on, and it gets very boring having to fight those same mobs dozens and dozens of times again since you know exactly what to expect every time. The thrill of combat eventually wears off because of this. Combat aside, the story is not very impressive and pretty much all characters in the game lack depth, are forgettable, and literally only talk to you like you're a heaven-sent killing machine. I get it, I'm a badass, I don't need to be reminded of it for the hundredth time. Not to mention they are more of a hindrance than a help when it comes to boss fights since all they do is die repeatedly and raise the bosses' spirit gauge that you've worked so hard to deplete. Pro Tip: send them home when you get to the bosses at the end of the quests, the fights become more rewarding and you'll have way more fun that way (at least from my experience).

Overall, I recommend Wo Long if you're a fan of 'deflect-style' Souls-like games and yearn to play something similar to Sekiro, even if it doesn't stack up to Sekiro (but to be fair, Sekiro does set the gold standard for games like this).

In case you enjoyed Sekiro or Nioh 2, you'll probably enjoy this game as well. Parrying seems more generous than Sekiro and they have toned down on the crafting and complexity of Nioh 2. Combos flow nicely without having to worry about stamina. Instead, you need to balance a bar of positive and negative energy which is used for everything from parrying and special attacks to spells (quite innovative and fun). 

Map design is similar to Nioh 2 when it comes to complexity but the maps somehow feel smaller.

Once you understand how the game want's you to play it, it becomes quite fun and fast paced. The spells and buffs last for only seconds but cost nothing but the game's equivalent of ""stamina"". The equip burden system is similar to Nioh in that there are 3 breakpoints at 30% 70% and 100%, but since the deflect (aka parry) window is affected by these breakpoints, and defence stats arent all that effective, there's no point in going above the 30% breakpoint unless you want extra challenge. Build variety is very low since the game mostly plays around deflecting. 

The strongest part of the game is level design and enemy placements imo, but once you beat a level once there's little interest left in replaying it.

I can understand anybody who waits to play this, though, as I have seen a lot of PC players torching this game for how unplayable it is. I did not have a ton of issues personally and enjoyed the game quite a bit. A few things to enjoy the experience more: 

- Don't use the English VAs. It is brutal. Zhang Fei especially makes me want to cut off my ears. I used the Japanese VAs with English subs, and I've seen many people recommend using the Chinese VAs. Most people agree do NOT use the English VAs.

- Use a controller if you can. I played this game with a PS4 controller on a wired connection to my PC and had almost zero issues playing this game, even around launch. I have seen people say that the keyboard mappings for this game are particularly horrible, and I must admit I do not know, but I would recommend avoiding those if possible. 

- TURN OFF ONLINE INVADING ... listen, this is not about ""git gud"" or something like that. This is on PC, and quite literally every invader will be hacking or trolling in some way. Just turn the online invasions off. It makes the game much more fun, because 1) you are not worried about some annoying griefer messing with your run 2) with online invasions turned off, there are pre-set offline NPC invasions that will become more frequent

The game also let's you respeck whenever you want once the ability is opened up and there are 50 build slots per character that can be saved and swapped between (MMO-style) as the player chooses. You can, quite literally, play this game until you have a preferred set-up for any situation the game throws at you. 

The elements/spells are also particularly fun, but this requires a little patience and practice. The elements having strengths and weaknesses against one another that feel very basic at first, but have some huge pay-offs. Using spells not for offensive damage, but rather to cancel your opponent's own buffs/spells is incredibly fun.",1682614738,1684153457,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

        One of my problems with a lot of Chinese themed hack and slash games is that you're given these elaborate fancy cool combos only to do 5% of the targets HP. Unless you play on easy these flashy moves lose a lot of impact when you have to spam them on HP sponges. Wo Long does a great job at getting over this hurdle for me. Well timed parrys and attacks feel impactful and look as impactful while spamming is not. However, whenever the enemy uses it's red gotta deflect attack it feels like the game comes to stop. They get Hyper Armor so often in the middle of ur combo u just have to pause what ur doing and watch especially with multiple enemies.  Also the camera is terrible, struggles to follow leap attacks, see enemies outside of what ur locked onto and often ur own model obscures the target enemy. The game feels best as a speed run game just to fill a fast hack and slash itch. It's very easy to snowball and make the game irrelevant especially if ur into min maxing and new game + stuff.                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                    
                   Story wise it's less interesting than any book or game of Three Kingdoms. Think of all the factions and motives of the characters in 3K and replace it with demons and evil Qi. It relies too heavily on a 3K fans knowledge of 3K to be enjoyable or even understand the ending twist. There's a cut scene of the famous fight between Lu Bu vs Zhang Fei & Guan yu outside of Hu Lao Gate, and  in the middle of the fighting the scene abruptly cuts and our character is just there fighting Lu Bu in an Arena out of no where.

i found it much easier than the nioh and ninja gaiden games, and i want to play these games for a challenge. nioh was a masterpiece for taking the dark souls combat and making it mindless diablo style speedrunning, here we have a lack of combat fun, as well as no reason to grind.  the enemy variety is also lacking, nioh had this problem too. it also shares nioh's lack of story, which is fine, because the three kingdoms period is indeed as cool as the sengoku period of nioh 2.  the level design is on par with nioh, which is good, exploration is easily the best part of the game, note that there is no replayability here though. the graphics are ok, lots of screen tearing, which i dont get in nioh, not enough to be a problem for me. the controls are inexplicably unable to be changed, which is weird since they are drastically different then nioh's. no longer having a hub system was a smart move, the character creator is great but none of the armour is all that interesting, so much to say, but i will keep playing as it is a good game at the end of the day

TLDR: If you've played Nioh/Sekiro and think this looks fun, unfortunately you'll be disappointed. If you haven't, go play those games.
I'm gonna compare WoLong to those games a lot, it borrows ideas from those games obviously. And Borrowing itself is not a bad thing, but it depends on how you implement and integrate them to your own system.

- Technical issues. Performance is still all over the place after a couple months fixes and patches, constantly stuttering, got a few freezes in cutscenes. And I don't understand why the game is using so much CPU power.

- This time looting is really boring, trying my best gives me maybe like 10% up to something (attack/ defence/ hp), I remember in Nioh a good suit does like 2~3 times more damage. Not to say rare items are really rare. I haven't seen some elemental enchants after beating the game.

- Equipment effects doesn't do much anyways, your basic strategy is always parry until enemy stuns, and give the fatal strike. Same as Sekiro, right? But Sekiro knows itself, it's a simple system and it just works, adding 10% damage is kinda useless here, you don't attack that much anyways, not to say those elemental and debuff system, you won't be able to utilize them until late game.

- And parrying itself. I don't know it's caused by the performance issue or parry motion itself. The timing is a couple frames early, if that's the only problem I can get used to it. Problem is the enemy motion. See Sekiro knows it's a parry game, so it deliberately designed all enemy attacks somewhat slower, you can see the blades coming and time your parry. Here they just did it traditionally, prepare -> 2 or 3 frames real attack -> post attack. It's really hard to see that attack motion, sometimes it's just impossible and I have to FEEL it and press parry in their prepare motion.

- The game's unnecessarily punishing sometimes. Most actions costs Spirit, equivalent to posture in Sekiro. Again Sekiro knows itself, posture is only ""consumed"" by being attacked. Here parrying, dodging, martial arts and spells all cost spirit, heck even the heavy attack. Wanna do some cool stuff? You take the risk being stunned and beaten to death. High risk high return you say? nah, high risk for a little return. Summoning is nerfed too now we don't have invincibility. And if you die? the enemy killed you gets a morale buff. Like what? this guy is too tough for you so let's rise the barrier higher and give another try?

- Talking about morale, martial arts and spells. The game feels really...restricted, there's almost no freedom. OK, encouraging exploration is fine, but here it's forced exploration, not getting all the flags you won't have enough morale, and that works like a heavy level penalty. In Nioh you learn martial arts and spells, and combine them to make your build. Here martial arts are bind to weapons so good luck hunting, and spells? well there's nothing like a spell caster build, not enough level = no good spell, wait until mid/late game, and you only get 4 spell slots.

- And last not the least. Companions are forced in most levels, especially early levels. I know those helpers in Elden Ring was welcomed, but mindlessly forcing that is a bad idea. Elden Ring is not a parry game. Now it's just harder to practice dodge and parry because a 3 vs 3 fight is just pure chaos. And Oh yeah, Team Ninja likes to throw unfair fights to you, 2 vs 1, 3 vs 1. Come on it's a parry game, how am I supposed to deal with so many opponents all at the same time.

That's it. They tried the same methodology from Nioh, borrowing some other games and adding their own stuff, just this time, everything seems working against each other, it's a mess.",1683312568,1683312991,False,105,3,0.778948485851287842,0,True,False,False

Because of the strength increase you get from the Morale boost of the flags and killing enemies it becomes much easier to clear levels as you take significantly less damage and do a lot more. It feels more forgiving if you suck at parrying n for the most part you can kind of panic spam the button an you will either parry or dodge out the way. Coupled with the fact that you can have 2 NPCs help you in most missions It was a fairly easy game with I'd say one really challenging boss which I'd have been mad if it wasn't a challenge to be honest because of what the boss is.

The only negatives I personally could give the game is that the performance, as with so many PC Ports now days, was pretty bad with a reduction to shadow quality and some settings dropped a little to medium I was able to get it running at a stable 60fps probably 95% of the time. 
The other being the player invasions. I believe 4 out of 5 player invasions I experienced were either cheaters or there was such a serious network issue as they just stood around whilst I beat the crap out of, taking no damage what so ever and then all of a sudden would spam spells an I'd die.

It's essentially Sekiro with loot drops and gear sets thrown in. Most of the negative reviews criticize the performance, and disparage the depth of the games systems in comparison to the Nioh series. It definitely isn't the most optimized game in the world, but the extreme performance drops it had at launch have mostly been fixed as far as I can tell. 

As for the Nioh comparison, I was never able to beat either Nioh game because I lost steam halfway through. If I had to sum up how those games made me feel in two words, it'd be ""analysis paralysis"". I found their combat and demon encounters tedious and the amount of micromanagement required exhausting. Wo Long strikes a perfect balance between customization/loot drops and ease of use. The combat is punchy, responsive and addicting. The animations are great and the whole thing feels fluid. The enemies are tough without feeling like damage sponges. The game is demanding without feeling crushingly difficult. I love soulsbornes, and Wo Long is now the one I load up when I'm just looking to unwind and have fun, not necessarily be worked into a rage. 

There is plenty of replayability and experimentation with different builds to be had here, and unlike other games, Wo Long allows you to save tons of stat/build loadouts to be swapped on the fly. Respecs are free and limitless. I can't speak to the pvp, as I haven't tried it, but if you're someone who enjoyed Sekiro and/or the Dark Souls series more than you did Nioh 1/2, I think you'll love this game.",1683035988,1683035988,True,4,3,0.537935078144073486,0,True,False,False

Will it be fun for you? Depends on some factors
If you like Wuxia, If you like Dark souls-ein style nonsense (think more Sekiro then bloodborn/DS proper), or if you like games that let you rub elbows with Chinese historical figures then it's a solid enough game. 
On a personal note I found the story to be passable 
The combat to be involved enough and fun enough to warrant a thumbs up 
I thought some of the multiple interlinking system felt superfluous at times (the Chinese academical system allowing magics to cancel each other out felt cool but more tacked on in some ways along with the the myriad of different enchantments.)

I don't doubt that they were/are a problem for some people but I can say I didn't have any performance issues start to finish. I got it about a month after release so maybe it was fixed by then. The second negative review type seems to mostly boil down to ""it isn't Nioh and I wanted more Nioh,"" so I'll preface this review by saying don't buy this if you just want another game identical to Nioh. While it shares some aspects of Nioh, it's a different game.

The story was extremely hard to follow, possibly because the names were difficult for me but also because characters appear and then disappear constantly with no pause for breath. But the story really seems like it's there to just be serviceable for getting us from level to level. Also, good lord the voice acting is incredibly awful. But if you can ignore those things the gameplay is pretty good.

Combat is smooth, fluid, and very rhythmic. However, I'll say that it does get old before long given the lack of enemy variety. There simply aren't enough enemies with enough move-sets to keep it interesting enough for a 30 hour playthrough and it starts to become mindless towards the end because you already memorized every enemy's attack pattern 15 hours ago. It kills the pacing when there isn't enough new stuff being thrown at you. I also was not a huge fan of the gear grind. Too much gear to manage, making every trip to the village feel like work and ultimately the differences between the thousands of pieces of gear you'll pick up are so negligible that it feels meaningless to have in the game. It'll really only appeal to min-maxers.

The level designs were truly enjoyable. The shortcuts and paths were well designed and exploring was a joy. The strongest part of the game was the bosses. Some truly amazing boss designs and some fights with fantastic mechanics. However, the bosses that stand out are loaded up on the second half of the game. I would say if you love good boss fights, this alone makes the game worth it. 

I'd say it's a game that could have been amazing, but is held back by lack of variety and poor writing. Whether or not the fantastic bosses are worth the buy is up to you.

Well since i started wo long, this meme kept popping up in my mind.

Wo long ... is not Nioh 3 as much as i would have liked it to be that:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Its more like a bastadized mix between nioh 1 and sekiro. Or in other words: ""team ninjas bloodborne""

Take Niohs Combat system and plaster the sekiro deflect over it. Thats  Wo Long pretty much.
Its also a lot easier  in comparison. I got my ass handed to me in other souls-like games.

I should mention, I love the Nioh games, more than dark souls or even elden ring. However,  I am pretty bad at it. In comparison, I had no issue with wo long, I think without the hard mode or NG+ its realitively easy.
You have to learn how to do the counter-deflect it makes the game a lot easier

The problems i have with this game are that its too similar to Nioh. The story telling is almost identical. The story is weak in my opinion. You don't really care about the characters and they keep bringing new ones frequently. The level design is also similar to Nioh (And very confusing too...) and you fight the same enemies lot of times so not a lot of enemy variety here. Also the game does a poor job teaching new players how to play or how some mechanics work.

I strongly advise against buying this game. The movement system of character, combat system, Inventory stats system and the entire game infrastructure is badly done. In the game itself, there are also very few types of weapons and their different visual variants. In Nioh, you could easily change the appearance of weapons and treat these other weapons, e.g. weak but cool looking as skins for your main weapon, and there is simply nothing of it here. In the same way, in Nioh you could literally play with dressing the character in different ways thanks to the fact that you chose your main armor but gave it a different look that you wanted and thanks to that you could play your way the way you wanted.As for this game, forget about it because it is what it is and there is nothing to choose from. Maybe 10/14 picks will be that much and in Nioh you had hundreds of them. Instead of enjoying playing this game, I rather struggled with it terribly, and not because of the level of difficulty and opponents, but because of how bad-constructed it is. There are really many much better games on the market than this one, such as Sekiro or other similar ones, and much better than this. If reading this you are still wondering if it is worth buying then I will say it again NO. I bought it as a pre-order and I REGRET I spent a lot of money on it and had no satisfaction from the game at all. The only thing that was quite good was the story, but there is not much of it so it doesn't save the situation because everything else is a tragedy.

Which me and alot other players struggle with for while. In fact whenever helping anyone on Nioh 2 on there first playthrough never see anyone ever use it. Since there can be very risky and difficult to pull off. Luckily they had one burst counter in Nioh 2 done in Brute form. Which I eventually got good at after about 50 hours in.  Since the brute form was slower to burst counter with. Didn't have to be timed or 100% accurate so was a bit easier to pull off. Still have to time it right but as long as you pop it. When enemies are close and glow red your usually good. The other ones like Feral Form were alot harder since had to manual aim and time it just right in the split second of the counter. 
In Wo Long you pretty much have to master how the Feral Form worked in Nioh 2. Right from the beginning of the game. Honestly at first wasn't so bad since you get in a lethal strike after countering most of the time.  Although later that changes, half the time your counter doesn't do anything for break damage.  Would have  to do it like 3 or 4 times. Keeping in mind if you mess these up they can pretty much one shot you. 
Now if they made it so every time you countered a boss. You could do lethal blow then that would have been fine. Although trying to do it multiple times while being the only way to really break a boss is bullshit. 
Everything in this game just feels cheep compared to Nioh 2. In fact Nioh 2 is actually about twice the size of Wo long and it's older game.  Which is likely because it has so much more content then Wo Long. 
Everything this game does just feels stupid, especially the souls system instead of recollecting your souls if die. This game instead automatically removes like half of your souls whenever you die.  Looting in this game also never feels exciting. Seems like just always get the same shit with higher star rating. Instead of using the color system like blue is rare, purple, epic and orange legendary. Instead they decided to use a star rating instead.

I loved everything about it, one of the most satisfying games, with a multitude of weapon styles to choose from. Wo Long basically took the whole Sekiro combat like parry/posture breaking approach. It's great but it just felt like a less satisfying Sekiro game. Nothing really stood out to me in the game, besides the unique enemies and bosses. The story was ok, it felt like every other wuxia story out there. As you can see I was mostly disappointed with the choice of weapons and the whole combat system together.

After unlocking all achievements, I can say for sure this is a great game on its own. It isn't a Soul / Sekiro clone.

It's the most fluent 3D hack-n-slash I've played to date. And I love how you could see through enemies' every single flaw and make decisive counterattacks from there. It's a much better mechanism than the Yokai Counter in Nioh 2. 

Now Team Ninja decided to dump the customisable movesets and favour a similar system to most souls game that the active skills are now bonded to the weapons and the same genre shares the moves for normal attacks. Thus, it isn't that flexible to make your own build compared to Nioh. 

But there's always a ""But"", this makes picking up a new weapon type much easier so I don't have to build my skills from ground up, I can simply pick up and enjoy different weapons and don't have to mess with the UI. 
Thus, it isn't as deep as Nioh when it comes to customising builds but I'm happy as long as the combat is engaging enough. 

Levelling and collectables are simplified to smooth out the experience for newcomers. 
For hard-core gamer the ambushes are quite naive. Other than that, the gameplay is amazing. 

My major issue is the repetitive enemies and boss fights. Variety in enemies is really lacking compare to Nioh series. Why always those tigers and the apes??? LOL   
From the first main quest to the final battle, more APES~~~~~~~~~
And the end-game content is quite lacking atm. That shouldn't have happened given that Nioh had developed endless challenges for end-game.  It makes me wonder Wo Long is likely a result of rushed production.

My biggest issue is the flow of the combat. This game has a parry/deflect system, that when timed well acts as a perfect dodge, resource generator, and staggering mechanic. I think this game would have been better without it and followed Nioh 2's block/dodge system. I think the idea they had was to copy the highs of mastery of Sekiro's deflect, but ends up falling flat due to a core design flaw with the parry. 

When doing perfect deflects in Sekiro, the risk is:
-getting hit when timing improperly (or hard blocking the attack)
-Build-up of posture break for you- regardless of whether you pull it off.
-misreading perilous attacks as normal attacks - and then getting hit

In this game it is:
-missing the parry will result in you getting hit, unless you spam dodge sometimes
-you lose ""posture"" if you mistime it

Why is it bad? Imo it is too punishing to *not* deflect. Any time I wanted to switch to dodging/blocking I felt like I was neutering my defense.

Not only is it omni-directional - it works for almost any attack in the game I have run across, even the critical attacks. This led me less to paying attention to what the enemy is doing and instead micro timing their combos like a rhythm game. I did not feel like I was learning moves of enemies, nor did I feel like I was mechanically getting better at the game. I started to chock up most of the deflects that I landed to luck and then quickly started to dislike the way it is implemented. I never wanted to dodge or block and fully understand the mechanics of enemies I encountered, unlike in Nioh 2 where I felt it was absolutely necessary to do all of the above (all of which felt much better to do in that game).

After a certain point, I was waiting to bait out critical attacks to open up a riposte through a reflect- something I never did in Sekiro. Perilous attacks in Sekiro were avoidable and punishable, but would heavily punish me for spamming deflect- they were not ever anything I *wanted* to appear. I cannot count the times where I have been body slammed by Genichiro and face blasted by the gun valley chick because I poorly responded to a perilous attack and they force me to respond in a way that is not hitting the deflect trigger.

The posture system in this game is a resource for skills and spells- which is a poor choice in my eyes. Due to how good the deflect is - I had a subconscious thought to never spend the spirit I had besides for the posture reducing heavy attack. My gameplay subsequently boiled down to parry-parry-quick attack chain- posture attack- repeat- For every fight, against every enemy type. It felt like a stripped down version of Sekiro's reactive system. Even the first soldiers you encounter in Sekiro will mix up what they throw at you and react to your deflects/lack of deflects- furthermore- they will even deflect your attacks when your are attacking! It was a much more satisfying back and forth, risk and reward, and mastery. 

I do not know what they were trying to make here. I love Team NINJA's work, but this one aint it. I may come back when they have worked on it some, but it seems to be fundamentally not what I am looking for. Ill go play Nioh 2 in the meantime- which I can wholly recommend to anyone that is a fan of difficult 3rd-person action rpgs.

I had enormous expectations for this game, and while they haven't exactly been fulfilled for me when everything is said and done I had a blast playing this game.

What I liked:
- The whole setting of the game, fighting with all of the characters I only read about was awesome, really enjoyed how they created them and mixed them with a dark fantasy setting
- Combat is quite fun, while I'm not the biggest fan of parry heavy defense combat, this was quite enjoyable.. it did take some getting used to, but once I did I felt invincible
- Boss fights, while this might be an unpopular opinion I feel like they did a great job with boss fights (major ones), while it definitely might have been harder I had a fun time in a lot of those fights

What I didn't like:
- The nightmare mode after finishing the game is basically the same missions with same collectibles.. Wish they would've done something closer to what they did in Nioh
- Weapon variations felt a bit lacking, wish I could've had tonfa and stuff like that
- Optimization is pretty bad, I basically played through whole game on lowest settings to make it playable on a pretty decent pc which should be able to run it on highest settings
- Price

All in all I had a fun time playing the game, hopefully they will optimize the game to make it run a lot better, and add a bit more NG+ content

Wo Long is a combination of Team Ninja's Nioh and FromSoft's Sekiro. Being a huge fan of both these games, I have a lot to say about this game. Let's start with the things I like. Wo Long has the fast paced action of both the games it draws inspiration from, tight deflect timings and really nice boss designs and enemies. The level design is great, building on the same ideas from Nioh 2. There is a lot of variety of equipment options with the slasher looter play style giving you some freedom to use what you like and the character designer is just as versatile. Kind of a bland list of stuff really, derived from their older games.

Now the things which I don't like, the lack of skills, the single best part of Nioh, it kind of ruined it for me. Fixing the number of combat arts to two and making them random on weapons. Their attempt to replace skills with spells didn't work for me and since you can't choose specific skills for weapons, it killed build variety for me. Yeah, you can spec into a specific element for the spells and their passive effects but it kind of all melts together, you end up running the same kind of spells, a big AOE one, a smaller single target spell and a couple of buffs.

And then there are the technical and quality of life issues the game launched with it, these have mostly been resolved with patches since launch but certain things don't make sense, things that could have clearly been available from the beginning, the ability to compare equipment, the option to travel to different missions after completing the main mission and the dojo to try out stuff (which still isn't there). It makes me think the game absolutely wasn't complete for launch.

Like I said, most of these issues have been patched with some much needed loot and enemy balancing but it left a bad taste in my mouth. I sincerely hope the DLCs resolve these kind of things. I also wonder if this is how the Playstation folks felt when Nioh 1 and 2 launched since we PC players got the complete version with mostly all updates applied.

I will just conclude by saying what I said before, Wo Long is a combination of Team Ninja's Nioh and FromSoft's Sekiro but it has fallen short of both these games. It doesn't have Sekiro's hyper focused combat and fantastic story nor does it have Nioh's excellent skill trees and build variety. I am a fan of Team Ninja, I haven't lost hope that Wo Long will be an excellent game but so far I am disappointed.",1681731241,1681731241,False,1,0,0.493385374546051025,0,True,False,False

It's a few steps ahead of Nioh 2 in some ways, but a few steps back in others. It could have used some more time in the oven, but it's still a solid game, and if you enjoy this genre then I'm sure you'll enjoy Wo Long. I hope the DLC adds more than just levels, bosses, and story.

[b]Pros:[/b]
-Expanded version of Nioh 2's character creator, so basically 10/10.
-Simplified systems and lower difficulty make it more accessible.
-Good music (real good theme song).
-Engaging combat system (though it can feel a rough around the edges at times).
-Some really cool bosses; though some of the early game bosses are forgettable or a bit too easy, the mid-late game bosses get much more challenging (in a good way), and their animations and moves are pretty awesome. I think overall, Wo Long might've scored higher with its bosses than Nioh & Nioh 2.
-An actually good duo boss.
-Respec-ing is free, loadouts can be saved/swapped between for free, and changing equipment perks is simpler. This makes experimentation soooo much easier, and you can swap between builds quickly and without spending rare items.
-Hub level is cool and gives you quests.
-Level design and exploration is generally better than Nioh's; verticality opens up new options, and there are more key items to find like health potion upgrades or quest items.
-Very few two hit kills, almost no one hit kills (that I noticed)

[b]Cons:[/b]
-Still not perfectly optimized, though it might be in the future.
-Parrying can feel clunky, and parry times don't always feel consistent. About 50% of the time, parrying feels less satisfying than Burst Counters in Nioh 2 or parries in Sekiro, though it might feel better if you're a master at the game.
-The story is lacking; I don't play these games for the stories, but compared to Nioh and Nioh 2, you can really feel the difference. The player character has little to no personal attachment to the plot. In Nioh, William (who actually talks) needs to find the dude who stole his spirit, while in Nioh 2, Hide needs to looks after their friend. In Wo Long, you like... need to stop the bad guy... and maybe find the dude that gave you a necklace at the beginning of the game? Aside from a couple parts, most of the big character moments are only observed by the PC; you just kind of spectate and then nod or walk away. Part of the story is the importance of the bonds you make, but it feels more like the other characters are bonding with each other while you do all the fighting.
-Some of the bosses feel ruined by the inclusion of companions.
-Has some of the same flaws as Nioh: repetetive levels (battlefields, war torn cities, etc.; though Wo Long's levels have more variety), reused enemies, etc.
-PvP is... a thing. I'm hoping the shift to placing unique moves randomly on weapons wasn't in an attempt to streamline PvP balancing. Nioh 2's massive skill trees were a lot of fun, and they added to build variety.
-The world map is downgraded from Nioh's.
-The grunts are soooo overdone. If you want to climb a wall, there's a jump grunt, a double jump grunt, and a clambering grunt. In some of the cutscenes, all you can hear are anime grunts.

Souls-likes are my favorite genre, and if you’re like me and need to play all the best ones, you should check out Wo Long. I think it is one of the best (of those not made by FromSoft); it‘s better overall than Code Vein, but a step down from Nioh 2. It’s also worthy of being recognized as its own thing, unlike many other souls-likes.",1680219056,1681708671,True,1,0,0.491803258657455444,0,True,False,False

One credit I would give the story is the treatment of Lü Bu, they gave him a unique and interesting storyline that I enjoyed a lot, only weakness of it was the ending not leading to anything really. They made a character usually seen as an irrational brute into a noble martyr, very cleverly done.

I would give it a solid 8/10 mainly due to gameplay being a solid 9,5/10, the story is pretty generic and if you aren't paying attention it can get confusing, I would give it a 5/10.

The morale system is just a super annoying level scaling, putting you at an advantage if you don't want to explore every little bit of the level. I get it that they want to encourage exploration, but the kodama system was simply a better solution. The deflect system itself is actually quite nice by itself, unfortunately they decided to use the same button for deflect and dodge, which you can change, making it awkward to use in many situations. This is accompanied by many bosses having bad telegraphing, often due to excessive (and not even all that pretty) particle effects. At other times some bosses just throw attacks at you with such a timing that you can not react (like no control over your character) to the next attack if you get hit by the previous one, turning them effectively into one-shots.
Most of the spells are pretty useless I feel, and even if you wanted to play a mage like character you can't really because to unlock the spells of the elements you have to upgrade the corresponding that, but also the metal-phase, which is basically the only stat that improves your casting capability. 
Then there are just minor things, which is weird because they did it already better in nioh, like a preview of switching the look of equipment. Itemization in general feels rather bland, with a big lack of fashion souls or getting excited for loot.

I went in with pretty high expectations, since I loved the Nioh games by the same devs, but was left extremely disappointed.

The combat is decent enough. If you get used to the deflect you can probably breeze through the game, since it's extremely strong. Levels or gear don't matter at all in a first playthrough, just parry and counter.

The morale system is alright at first, it's a nice incentive to explore the level, and it makes a big difference with how strong you are. However, progress resets if you ever repeat a level, so unless you're good enough to fight enemies that are much stronger than you and might one-shot you, you'll have to do it all over again, every time. Additionally, since most spells need a certain morale level and you start almost all levels with morale 1, it feels bad to just lose access to some spells temporarily.

While item drops are reduced in this game, compared to Nioh, you'll still have to go through your inventory regularly to clean it out.

There are also tons of weapons, but they don't really feel like they matter at all, since deflecting is just so strong. It also doesn't help that most weapon skills are bad or useless, and it depends on RNG on what you get, with no way to change them.

The story is complete trash, and I'd recommend not paying attention to it at all.

It took me 40 hours to complete all missions on NG and another five hours to get all achievements (includes my time with the demo), which is a good length in my opinion.

It would probably be best to wait for the DLC and get the Complete Edition or whatever on sale in a year. By then, it'll hopefully have been patched a few more times to fix a few more issues.",1678584480,1681460854,True,0,0,0.501845002174377441,0,True,False,False

And the tutorial boss being the toughest one in the game out of the 8 or so I've fought so far is fairly frustrating, but aside from that I honestly don't have many complaints. I've played a lot of Souls/like games and I have to say that Wo Long probably ranks in the top 3 for me in terms of fun-to-frustration ratio.

I will admit to you right now: I am abysmal at parrying and countering in games. I simply cannot do it, panic-smashing takes over every time. But the deflect move is *key* in Wo Long. You basically have to parry or you're screwed, but SOMEHOW, the gaming gods have graced me in this one specific instance. I promise that if you're struggling with the parries, you just need to try a different weapon with a better deflect stat, because if my inept possum brain can do it, then you can do it. I believe in you.

Look, if we're really being honest with each other, I spent like 6 hours on the tutorial boss in the demo. No, that's not a typo. But 5.5 of those hours did not feel like frustrating bullshit, it just felt like I was a baby possum that was still learning (and enjoying it). For comparison, I spent 60 minutes on the Dark Souls 3 tutorial boss, and I was bitter for 55 of those minutes. And I loved DS3.

Anyway, the magic/elements system adds a little bit of depth to the gameplay that is a pleasant surprise, and the faster pace and satisfying combat rhythm is top tier, but I think the most enjoyable addition to the game, for me, is the co-op system. 

It's not the best co-op ever made, but compared to Nioh and Dark Souls, it is SO MUCH more convenient. Basically start a lobby, invite your friends, and start a mission. You can keep playing together until you reach a point in the story where you have to travel to the Hidden Village safe zone. Then just make another lobby and rejoin for the next mission(s). 

There's no co-op currency, no misty world barriers, no kicks after the boss is killed, no having to beat the level first to even play co-op (honestly, wtf Nioh??). Just join their lobby and go. You can even revive each other for a limited time if you're downed.

Or your friends can plant battle flags for you while you wander off to pick up the shiny thing in that bush over there. And then when the bush turns out to be a monster that almost rips your face off, you AND your friends can rest at the bonfire--I mean flag--and then LEVEL UP.

Oh instanced loot? Yeah, you got it buddy. Your friends can open chests and pick up items in your world, and vice versa.

And did I mention NO INVASIONS?? No hacking asshat is gonna join your game uninvited and one shot you right before the boss fight because you can just TURN INVASIONS OFF in the settings menu. Bless you for this, Team Ninja. 

As someone who spends 99% of their gaming time nowadays playing co-op with friends, and 50% of that time playing a Souls game with said friends, by comparison I feel spoiled by Wo Long.

1. Optimization. I have more than a powerful enough computer to run anything. I can't play this on the lowest settings without it running like a rock in the mud. It's laggy, causes input delay, and just... horrible lag. Please optimize.

2. Please allow for button customization for controller. This is very much a souls-like game and the game-play is so difficult without a RB/RT heavy/light attack system. It would have been much better to combine dash WITH the deflect/dodge button through a tap/hold change with the dashing being held and the deflect being a tap making the combat more smooth rather than having two different dedicated buttons for both. 

3. The character customization is just literally ripped from Nioh 2. It's the exact same character customization. Maybe with two or three extra make-up choices. Other than that, the exact same customization. Not really a problem, but it felt very lazy and disappointing.

Other than the first two issues, the game would be fantastic. If they patch the game and optimized it I would gladly change this review, but with how companies are dealing with their games lately I doubt it will happen.",1681343411,1681343411,False,2,0,0.483630567789077759,0,True,False,False

- FIXED : Game crashes every hour or so.
- FIXED : White flickering which can be fixed by disabling ""Ambient occlusion"" but you need to do it every time because the settings are not saved when you exit the game.
- Other random clipping through environment leading to falling into the void.
- Random drop frames. Mostly unnoticeable except when it happens right before you jump or try to dodge an attack.
- Sometimes the skybox is flickering. I don't know if there is a workaround.
- Random message when using the battle flag saying the game could not be saved.

Pros: 
- Really good gameplay.
- Lots of spells, weapons, martial arts.
- Good morale system.
- Great level design.
- Basically Nioh 3.

Cons: 
- Well if you don't like Nioh, don't play this game :D
- Parkour controls are clunky. Sometimes you hook onto the ledge, sometimes you don't with the same inputs. Sometimes there is an invisible step preventing the character from falling, sometimes there isn't.
- FIXED : When you finish a mission, you have the option to continue the main quest, return to the village or retry. But not choose another mission. You have to load the village, then select the new zone and load it. I don't know why they force you to load 2 zones instead of 1 after every mission.
- AI is really dumb. NPC helpers will stand in fire and drop into water.

Both the NioH games are very good, with some very good ideas and amazing combat systems. Compared to NioH, the combat is a little more streamlined, It's more about learning your weapons and getting the most out of your wizardry spells and martial arts. Levelling is also a little more streamlined and free respecs give you a lot of freedom on trying out different builds and also use different builds for different situations.

With the deflect system the game does feel a little on the easy side, every boss only took a couple of attempts. And if you have a good build, you can just run through things with no issues. I haven't done NG+ so you can prob find more of a challenge there. Other than that, gear progression is way better and less rng oriented this time, which is a nice change overall. Praying for a good drop was never fun when you are trying to build.

There are performance issues in the PC port, but It was not too much and sometimes it went away after a restart. The main issue is with the co-op with excessive rubber-banding, which makes the game borderline unplayable in co-op. It is not a good experience in co-op and I hope it gets fixed soon. NioH 2 had such a good co-op, idk what went wrong here.

All in all this game felt much better as an overall experience than NioH. Every new Team Ninja game has been better than the last one and this is no different.

now that I can ENJOY the game with proper controls for KBM, and some improved performance, its good enough to get to the game and enjoy it for what its supposed to be.

Audio/Visual:

Let's start with the opening cutscene:

The opening cutscene was tinged blue for an extensive period of time, I still can't tell if everything was actually supposed to be blue or if it was some sort of visual bug but it was very jarring and the longer it went on for the more I was sitting there wondering if this was a deliberate design decision.

The in-game visuals are just generally of a lower calibre than I expected from a game releasing in 2023. Nioh 2 came out years ago and generally just looks better visually. The entire first level is very reminiscent of the early UE3 color pallet of ""everything is either mud, wood, or on-fire."" Lighting looks awful and there is very little color beyond the low quality particle effects which take up most of the screen space, presumably to conceal the really grainy textures and low-poly level geometry. There also appears to be some sort of audio fidelity issues with this game, its hard to describe exactly what it is but the audio sample quality in general is just poor, even the voices sounded kind of garbled and difficult to hear.

Gameplay:

I really wanted to like this game, I loved Nioh 2 and I've played other similar games so I kind of knew what to expect but right from the outset I was just disappointed with how the combat felt. Your character feels kind of weightless and slow, as though they're moving underwater, the entire game just kind of handles with a ""slow floaty"" quality to it. Combat feels clunky and unresponsive, attacks are badly telegraphed, lacking any of the impact or snappiness of Nioh or Elden Ring. Your move-set and animations are very limited

I can't even comment on the story because I only played it for half an hour

A niche title but very much worth a try for people inclined to the genre or recent previous Team Ninja games.

The biggest downsides were a rocky release with some optimization problems and some weird UI choices that apparently are being patched (I did all achievements before you could even track wich Shi tieshou, potion upgrades and golden cicadas you already had gathered, so I had to retry many levels looking for wich were the ones missing, hopefully that has already been fixed alongside the storage acessibility and auto restocking).

Also hopefully the DLC will fix the lacking enemy variety like Nioh's NG+ modes did by injecting new enemies into the main story mode, finish fixing the last seams and lastly maybe even make this game from a good into a great one.

The gameplay itself is great, i might even like it more that Nioh 2, deflecting bosses and counter attacking them just makes you feel really cool. It feels simpler that Nioh 2 for sure, but i don't necessarily think thats a bad thing, there is still loads of depth in the combat for you to learn.

temization is a bit mixed bag, personally i don't have a real problem with the amount of gear in the game, but i prefer more of a Diablo like loot system compared to what we have here. If you really want to, and have a bit luck, you can easily use a weapon you got in the first mission through the whole game.
My biggest problem with the items is that the set bonuses are just too small. It feels pretty bad to farm a boss for his set, and get a 5% damage increase, but a great thing is that you can swap your item bonuses really freely to make the item really fit your build.

After getting Platinum on Sekiro I was looking for something in the same ballpark. This is it!! I want more combat like this!!!! Love it! Thank you thank you!  I dont think the combat is as masterful and well designed as Sekiro but it gets really close. Its really enjoyable. I'm having fun. 

The plot is pretty meh thats the biggest buzzkill for me. Not really that engaging. The game really excels is the respec and building. So much freedom. Where they balance that freedom with is weapons and upgrades. I think over all this system is huge advantage over other souls games. 

The Sworn Oath process is also really cool. Morale system is great- this is literally the mechanic I thought Elden Ring should have been doing for Graces to make that part of the game more meaningful rather just check point to check point- cough bonfire to bonfire.

Negatives of the game- its just not as refined as Sekiro. I'm currently on Lu Bu and going through my rounds. If Lu Bu is the Genichiro of the game, its just not that rewarding and exciting. While he is still kicking my ass, I dont think its a challenge to defeat him its just a battle of attrition and going through his cycles. It's more about being patient and waiting out rather than really having this big epic dual and battle. He is pretty easy to read, his patterns are no where near Owl (Father). You get a lot of forgiving windows- its just your damage is really insignificant compared to his. It's unfortunate feeling. I feel like they cant even let you do more damage either, otherwise  the match up would be too one sided for the player. 

Worst boss so far is Baishe- I played around with dodging (not deflecting, not blocking) but the game is coded to let her still land her hitboxes on her critical grab. I would sprint forward with her snakes going above me and land a couple combos before instantly dragged into the animation of being grabbed.  It felt like a cheat rather than a fair fight. 

I definitely recommend the game. Look forward to more content in the later parts of the game. Etc.

EDIT: I have now Platinum the game. I think this is a solid game. Hope for more games! After getting through all the content though, there were more things at the end of the game that did become more of an annoyance. The Side missions after beating the final boss were probably the biggest problem. Especially the final gauntlet and a side mission to fight a boss you just fought maybe a few minutes earlier. It definitely feels like they had budget issues at this stage and just put together what they could. To have the final side mission a gauntlet was just an absolute buzzkill after accomplishing everything and for me underwhelmed the final boss' importance. 

The story does actually get better after the Sun Jian and his family section of the plot. Then you see how the demonic qi impacts the three kingdom story line in a unique and interesting way. Lu Bu's rematch was just so so- and the RNG element of his armor and weapon set suckkkkssss. Just give us all 4 Star stuff at this stage!!!! We deserve it hahaha. 

Worse boss after playing it all the way through- Aoye! Terrible terrible terrible.

Best boss in the whole game Zhang Liao!!! That as the most Sekiro level challenging and rewarding fight. His design and combat is perfect. Its a balanced fight. Keeps you fully engaged and hyped.",1679595362,1680777701,True,3,1,0.48421052098274231,0,True,False,False

I really love the ancient China setting, and the creators did justice to the architecture and cultural details I feel. They obviously did their homework and put lots of interesting historical lore in there.

The story is VERY loosely based on the Three Kingdoms era history. Obviously this is a reimagining with fantasy elements, but still, there are lots of fantastic stories they could've taken advantage of but did not. The relations and motives of characters are simplified to good vs being possessed by evil. Nonetheless, I was excited to see the references.

I'm comparing it to Nioh 2 because it's from the same makers, but you may not like that comparison because it's an older game.

It is lacking in many ways when compared to its predecessor, not just in terms of gameplay but even just content which is sad because it wasn't like team ninja broke the mold with this one, and I expected a lot more. Anyway onto the review!

My favourite game of all time is Nioh 2 and this is that but worse. Wo Long is essentially Nioh 2 lite. It is worse in almost every way, it has worse enemy variety, skill trees, stats, levels, content overall, and less RNG/replayability/end game. The graphics are also pretty much identical, they didn't do anything new, all of the assets look like they were re-used from the models to hair and even the story line feels like a cheap re-run of Nioh 2 just replacing spirit stones with Qi and shifting the setting elements. 

Though with all that being said, it is still a good game despite falling short of a masterpiece, and if you're smart enough to play it with a controller you'll probably have fun.

ALSO The demo was a sham, the first boss was absurdly difficult and misrepresents the difficulty of the game going forward as there is only 1 maybe 2 other challenging pieces of content, a 3v1 against humanoids in a side quest, and a boss fight against a dude on a horse, which quickly becomes trivial after the first time you beat it.",1677899273,1680709548,True,2,1,0.536439716815948486,0,True,False,False

The deflect mechanic is very addicting when you get good at it. Every single attack can be deflected if you time it correctly so you never need to master any other system. I never once used a wizardry spell or a martial art. I used the default sword you have in the tutorial for the whole game. I used a set of light armor you start getting as a drop in the 2nd mission for the whole game. I only ever leveled up one stat because it was connected to both my sword's damage and my HP. Just deflect everything and none of that matters.

The Romance of the Three Kingdoms setting that you may know from Dynasty Warriors is back. Basically it's ancient China from 180 - 196 AD. The armor and costumes seem accurate and the item descriptions teach you a bit of history. You will go through several cities and get a good look at the architecture. You get to meet and fight alongside various heroes from the Three Kingdoms.

It took me about 40 hours to 100% which is very short for a Team Ninja game, but they have already announced DLCs which will no doubt contain a better endgame. 

I recommend it if you understand what you're getting into. Don't expect From Software tier levels or enemy variety. Don't expect Elden Ring's exploration. Don't expect the length or depth of Nioh.

So if I had to Describe this game it would be if Dynasty Warriors, Nioh, and a tad bit of Sekiro came together as a game. 
Pros- 
-The Lore: I like following the lore behind Dynasty Warriors and some of my favorite characters showed up in this game. 
-The Combat: There is a mix of Nioh and Sekiro for blocking, dodging, and Deflecting enemy attacks. It's not overly complicated to pick up but the first boss is a bit more challenging than he should be. And you don't have online help until you get past him. 

-Cons-
-Graphics: Feels a lot like an Xbox360 and Ps3 game. The details weren't stunning and seemed limited. 
-Not Wide Screen compatible or Adjustable:
Kinda heart breaking that I can't adjust the screen to fit a widescreen and full screen fits a little less than most games. 

-Builds/ Playstyle Customization:
This game is a bit of a step down from the old Nioh Games. Yes, it has a variety of weapons and spells but it doesn't seem to be a smooth polish and it feels clunky. 

TLDR: 
I would recommend this game. It's a step up from Dynasty Warriors since 8 was a disaster. 
A step down if you like Nioh and Sekiro.  The game has some value to it and allows backtracking for completion and with a few updates could be a good game if they take the replaying boss fights from Nioh and Sekiro and add them in. It's Good/Ok not Great or Fantastic but fun none the less.

EDIT: 04-03, 2023--

So the game has been out a while, long enough for people to get the game on Game Pass through Microsoft, if you'd rather do that (Which, I kind of reccomend)

Since my inital review, I have played through the entirety of the game twice on console (PS5), and am able to form more of an opinion based on what I've experienced.

First off, and please tell me if I'm wrong, but the ""end game"" of Wo Long is straight horrible. It basically revolves around grinding 5-Star special gear sets that give various traits when equipped, and...that's about it? The new game plus feature is a sham because in the game currently there's 7 parts (Chapters) and about 2-3 main missions per part, and some less-than-spectacular sub missions, most of which seem to be duels against one or more of the game's characters to grind their armor sets, I suppose.

The draw seems to be ""Oh, wait until end game REALLY drops in the first DLC in June!"" which, what a horrible business model because only those who REALLY love Wo Long will be around that long. The RNG on 5-star gear drops is horrible (Though I'll mention that on March 31st they addressed this by upping the drop rate further in an update) to the point that you can play through these missions several times before even getting ONE 5-star drop, and you're SOL if it isn't one of the grace sets you want (That's fine though, that's the grind portion of the game, of course).

I can't stress this enough, so I'll bold it - [b]I have not in the time I have played the game, gotten a SINGLE 5-Star ranged weapon.[/b] Not sure if it's because of the low drop rates on the 5-star weapons before the update but even reading on the game's subreddit shows that people seem to get considerably less drops for ranged weapons than anything else. 


I can go on for a while about features I don't like, and to be fair, mechanically, the game is probably the best that Team Ninja has put out, assuming you prefer the parry system of Sekiro to the stamina breaking of Nioh. I don't hate the game, and in fact even enjoyed my time, but I would suggest picking it up off of Xbox Games Pass for the few dollars a month comparatively to buying what feels like a Team Ninja side project for full price.",1677883820,1680524710,False,10,0,0.612552881240844727,0,True,False,False

I tend to like Souls games having one set, with set stats that you can mix pieces around if need be than 40 pieces of the same armor with either the same or less stats, or a few extra bonuses.

Awesome game, great parrying and moment to moment combat. Some really good bossfights in both bosses movesets and visuals. Story is the usual Team ninja so its mid at best. if you like parrying and enjoy souls-like games then get it asap.

(Only continue reading if you've played nioh 1 or 2)
If youve played Nioh 1 or 2 then then there's alot more considerations. Game format is near identical to Nioh system that it's mission based, UI is pretty much the same in menus. The game is shorter, less weapons, less enemies. They are all noticeably more refined though.  But it trades it for a streamlined nioh system which makes getting builds up and running alot easier. Reallocation of main stats is super easy and free compared to other niohs. Morale system is actually quite a cool way to determine how strong you are on a map regardless of equipment strength. There's now a ""hub world"" where you can interact with all the NPCs for side missions and upgrade weapons, attributes etc. Burst counter has now meshed into one button that does both parrying and critical parries (Burst counter - angry enemy turns red). Overall visuals is a small but noticeable improvement on Nioh 2. 

In terms of game performance it ran quite well at 4k throughout the game. Just have a few tweaked settings.
Still very much worth a play on a sale but if you're expecting Nioh 3 with improvements on all fronts you will be disappointed.",1677930754,1680518478,True,0,0,0.530271410942077637,0,True,False,False

1) The endgame grind for the PvP gear you will want takes forever, for no good reason. Instead of letting us breakdown what we get by playing normally to build whatever we want, prepare to kill the same boss repeatedly because you know it's most likely to drop 5 star items with graces.
2) There is no crossplay and there is no matchmaking, so there are very few people with whom to PvP after the game is beaten, anyway.
3) The game uses a morale system that means you can't comfortably PvP with all of your abilities on most stages until after you have cleared the entire stage (which is tedious), because you cannot cast certain spells until your morale for a given stage is past a certain point, and each stage resets your morale (usually to the lowest state, which gives access to very few cool spells).

The combat design is fantastic and I feel bad for the devs who worked on the animations, the timings, and the general feel of that system, only to see their effort muddled by trashy grinding and gimmicky skill-limitation systems.

On one positive note, the level design is stellar, definitely some of Team Ninja's best. Traversal sometimes feels a little wonky, with the double jump and wall climb often misbehaving for no obvious reason, but exploring the levels and taking advantage of alternate routes and stealth attacks is quite rewarding. Sadly, things begin to fall flat outside of this.

Combat feels very repetitive, with all weapons generally having the same gameplay loop, despite the apparent variety of weapon types - mash Quick Attack until the enemy attempts a Fatal Strike, then Deflect, press Triangle, and repeat if needed. The main schtick of the game, as it were, the Deflect mechanic, sometimes feels almost tacked on, due to the fact that other than when used against simple mooks, or to counter a Fatal Strike, there isn't any ""real"" feedback on the enemies. Larger enemies will simply continue to swing until their attack string is completed, which makes deflecting feel more like a rhythmic challenge than an actual fight mechanic. Compare to Sekiro (a game often brought up in comparison), where properly blocking and reflecting has a visceral, high-impact feel.

Martial arts, the various skills randomly generated for each weapon, all feel quite lackluster and ultimately unnecessary, with several feeling more unwieldy and dangerous to use than they warrant. Enemy variety is very shallow. By halfway through the game, I felt as if I was repeating the same three fights with only the scenery being changed. After a while, most encounters feel rather trivial, since you've likely already memorized all of the enemy tells and deflect timings.

Boss fights are a mixed back, though mostly on the negative side. While there are a few that are genuinely fun, most of them are either just the same sort of fights as generic enemies, but with larger health bars, or truly annoying gimmick fights. In addition, most of them are honestly quite easy, which is a bit of a disappointment when coming from some of Team Ninja's other works.

In all, Wo Long is a game with a lot of very interesting ideas and potential, but some rather bland execution and poor implementation of some of the main mechanics really work against it. I honestly hope that Team Ninja considers a sequel to improve upon the foundation here, as they did from Nioh to Nioh 2, because I really felt like there's a diamond underneath all of the rough. However, as it stands now, I didn't really enjoy it.

I enjoyed this game and can recommend it fairly easily, though if you have not played Niôh 2, in most cases I would suggest to pick up that game before this one. 

I place this game in the Souls-like reference frame for good reason, because it has many of the elements of those games, including bonfires, significant difficulty, the system of losing your experience points (half of them, in this case) upon death, the weapons upgrade system, as well as the methodical nature of the combat. However, there are also many ways in which Wo Long does not fit in this mold neatly. Niôh already set itself apart from Dark Souls with its level-based structure and focus on infinite colored loot, but Wo Long is probably most accurately described as being a spiritual successor to Ninja Gaiden, that also happens to have many Souls-like trappings.

Wo Long's combat does not quite have the fluidity and malleability of the system found in Ninja Gaiden, which is an absolute classic of the character-action game genre. However, playing this game I was reminded in many ways of how Ninja Gaiden felt to me back in the day, even if the combat here is more rudimentary and therefore also has parallels with games like Onimusha: Dawn of Dreams. Regardless of which comparisons to draw, Wo Long feels distinctly different from other Souls-like games in its combat, as far as I am concerned. 

To be honest, the game's combat would maybe feel too superficial, if it was not lifted up by the parry mechanic, which is always satisfying to pull off. I used to be a steadfast sword-and-shield turtler in the earliest Souls games, but awesome games like Bloodborne and especially Sekirô have taught me that when I am forced to engage with a well-tuned parry system by one of these games, I tend to also really enjoy using it. Just like in Sekirô, hitting a parry in this game just feels so right, and so satisfying. It makes fighting even the lowest of enemies rewarding, if you can get that parry off on their unblockable move and with a piercing clang drive them into the ground, it's always at least a little bit exhilarating. This satisfaction is what carried me through the game.

In all other aspects, the game feels good, but doesn't necessarily stand out as great. The environments are relatively tame to explore, and don't have very many of those Souls-like flourishes where the levels cleverly fold back onto themselves. Not all games need to have that, but in Wo Long you do end up with a fairly linear-feeling experience, that -- again -- harkens closer to Ninja Gaiden rather than your typical Dark Souls. This game is to be played for the combat, and little else. I admit to not knowing much about the Three Kingdoms story, but the retelling of it here feels utterly forgettable, and I stopped paying attention to the cutscenes for the most part. 

And then there is the technical stuff. For the first ten hours, the game would present me with a true performance lottery: sometimes it would work perfectly and run at 100 - 120 fps, and other times (even within the same session) the game would inexplicably have long and harsh stutters that made it impossible to enjoy, and the parries impossible to get out reliably. I guess this was a frame time issue? I don't know. What I do know is that after ten frustrating hours of technical troubles, I finally found a solution for myself. I had already gone through every possible configuration of in-game and Nvidia control panel settings, before realizing that if I set my screen to 60hz instead of 144, and then set the game to 60 fps and with v-synch on, the stuttering no longer happened. 

I am a real sucker for this genre of games, and so I stuck with this game despite its technical difficulties, because when it worked well, I was really rather enjoying it. The 20 hours that followed after my stutter solution was found, were very fun. There are a bunch of games I would recommend over this game in this genre, but as a mix between the character-action games I used to play 15 years ago, and the modern slate of Souls games, it delivers a good experience.

Now granted, even though this is a new IP and should be treated as such, some things such as systems (menus, equipment acquisition, etc) can be carried over and improved, yet, for some reason this game abandons that completely. Gear being very uninteresting, getting it even more so, menus are awful as well as basic things like favoriting aren't really ease of use. 
Now as far as gameplay which is the part most people even acknowledge or are about, unfortunately it's not much to talk about here either. A positive is the deflect and counter system that makes fights feel alive, but, it's quickly ruined by the lack of options for attacking. Martial Arts being tacked onto weapons rather than learned skills slotted and equipped makes for skill expression to be albeit nonexistent outside of being able to deflecting consistently. That, and with Wizardry being tied to Morale can rain on your parade as some fun magic may not be able to be used halfway if not til the end of a map/boss fight. 
Lastly, performance. I'm not sure if it's the engine they did for this game, or some other unknown reason, but it's beyond poor. I'll just flat out say it: the performance of this game is beyond mediocre it's almost insulting. And in a game where the game running smoothly is an absolute necessity it's a complete and total game killer.

All in all, I really and truly wanted to fall in love with this game as myself and some people that enjoyed Nioh a lot played with the idea of ""What if Nioh but in China"" ideas years ago. However, this is what the game is.

The deflect system is intuitive and satisfying on basically all enemies. While this game may not live up to the heights of Nioh 2, I do think that it is easily better than Nioh 1. My one major complaint with this game is that there are a few achievement-related collectibles spread throughout the game which can be a pain to find due to how poorly the game does at showing the player what they have and have not found in each level. In less words, it can be hard to tell what levels you have 100% completed because the game does not tell you. 

All in all, I do recommend this game to any fans of the soulslike genre (my controversial take is that I like this game a bit more than sekiro but don't tell anyone).

Also, the story is pretty convoluted (at least 200 characters named Zhang) and the voice acting can be a bit goofy, but this didn't make the game any less fun for me and kind of added to its charm.",1680285929,1680286174,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

If this game was made before the Nioh series I think it would of been a great game with some porting fixes.  But it wasn't it was made after.  Wo Long is a very stripped down version of both Nioh games.  Yes i'm comparing Nioh and using it as a reference because Nioh was made by the same people and being made after this game should of been made better.  

The Bad:
- First off will start with the port.  This game runs terrible even on the best of PC's.  I'm running this on a Ryzen 9 7900x, 32g ddr5 ram, a m2 hard drive,  and a rx 6700xt there is no reason i should be encountering fps drops.  
- If you're playing a mission with a buddy and you guys get disconnected you lose all that mission progress for the both of you.  
- The leveling system is very stripped down, building a certain way doesn't feel immersive at all.  We go from having multiple paths to build a character from prior games to being able to choose five slots to level.
- The amount of magic you can have per mission is stripped from prior titles. 
- Weapons and armor sets are lacking.  I feel limited on my characters outfit design.  Also using the armor/weapon visual changer is an absolute chore compared to the nioh series.
- lack of enemy types
- The combat system is interesting but not as rewarding as prior titles.  I went from rewarding stance dancing and cool combos in prior titles to having a very limited move set.
- Moral system has to much influence on how you progress a mission and magic usage. 
- The hidden village hub is neat but is a step down from how nioh's world hub was.
- Side missions are incredibly short.
- Ranged weapon play feels almost like a waste of time. 

The Good:
- The recruitable officers allows you to play with some of your favorite three kingdoms era characters. 
- Lu Bu is a pain in the A** like in all three kingdoms era games.
- The jump feature is fun.
- Stamina while running isn't a thing
- 3 player co-op (when it works)
- invasions added for PVP
- Spirit beast have cool abilities

Neutral:
- I won't say anything about keyboard and mouse support as I've always played souls like games with a controller and have found all previous souls like games to suck on keyboard and mouse.  So I can't make a judgment on it.
- Story is okay, nothing to write home about.
- The parry/dodge system needs reworked (being able to cancel attacks).  It's a cool foundation but in its current form it robs the fun and satisfaction of combo's and stance dancing from prior titles.
- The games overall difficulty feels solid in certain spots and absolutely awful in others (tutorial mission).  The tutorial mission doesn't scale with the difficulty of the rest of the game at all.
- The weapons.  I like the new weapon choices but they lack the depth of weapon development from nioh titles.


Overall I really did enjoy my play through of the game despite its bug, but I won't recommend it and will give it a negative review because it's a major step down from prior titles for this company.  I've played through this once and I don't feel I will again.  Maybe when we get dlc i'll try again.  I know what this company can do and the games they can put out and this is a major step backwards.  Way to many features from prior titles got stripped or dumbed down.  Honestly it felt like the foundation was made for the game but nothing was built from it.  The combat, magic, graphics, character customization, skill building and leveling feels like a step back.  This would of been an amazing game if it came out before the Nioh series but it didn't and a inferior product was made.  This game felt like a cash grab vs prior titles.

The game has technical issues on pc, so if you have stuttering from the start just refund the game asap since we have no idea when they will get their shit together and patch the pc version.
If you have Intel 12th gen or newer I urge you to not buy at the moment, version 1.04 of the game.

My first review was colored by technical issues and it made me chew the game more negatively. Still a negative is that I as a customer had to get the product I had paid for to work.

On to the game then.
This is the easiest soulslike game I have played, it is not Nioh 3 because many of the systems from Niho 2 are not to be found here. This an action game with souls like elements.

Going with the positives first.
The combat is fun, it is not deep but it is visual and it feels awesome when you execute the deflects.
Sound and music I find to be good.
Character creator is really good and the options you have are many.
The character models look great, same goes for their animations.
Gear looks good.
You have mission areas rather then an open world, for me this is a plus.

The negatives.
Unbalanced bosses. Most are easy with two or so being more challenging. Some focus way to much on deflect while some almost not at all.
The moral system is in my opinion the one thing that drags the game down more then anything else, when the game is working. To me this is a system that punish players who are good and want a challenge by making the game easier the better you are. It will also punish those that struggle by making the start of each mission area more difficult if you die. Some like it because it forces exploration, rather then force me to explore design better mission areas so that I want to explore.
The first boss. Not that he is imposible but if you are new to these kind of games chances are you will refund because of him and that is a shame.
The design of the mission areas are not that great. Sure, some look great and are fun to explore while most are around bad to neutral and one in particular is so bad that I can not help but wonder why the person who designed it hate the playerbase.

The neutral
The story is there.

I would be bored to death if I have to play Nioh 2 again with new China skins and all that grinding from level 1 to 713 for divine grace gear sets. Don't get me wrong, I love Nioh 2. I enjoyed it while it last, spent 700 over hours in that game. The grinding eventually killed the fun, also the combat, while top notch for this genre, is still relatively mostly similar to other souls like games.

Wo Long has a more natural flow and faster combat system. It may not have skills tree to unlock combos like in Nioh 2 and the combat are actually much more simpler and basic. It is a lot my enjoyable and did I say the combat feels more natural and faster?

Combat is basically normal attacks, spriti attacks(Heavy attack really) and 2 martial art skills which are preset by the weapons you choose to use. Lower gears has one martial arts skill while higher level gears comes with two. They varied based on the type of weapons and loot drop. 

Defences mechanics has your usual guard, dodge, deflect and Parry. Guard and deflect in this game is rather forgiving with deflect being the most important defensive option you have in this game. It allows you deflect critical hits from bosses and do massive damage. Needless to day, it is the bread and butter of this game, but compared to games like Sekiro, you don't need to memorize deflecting rhythms, but some mobs and boss do have chain attacks which can be blocked anyway.

If you have game pass, try it and get a feel of the game. Demo for steam version has ended so that is the alternate option.
This game is really fun for me imho, I enjoyed the PVE, I love the COOP and I am crazy for the PVP(you don't have that in Nioh 2 sadly).

It depends on your preference, I like it.

The game is very forgiving with both its combat mechanics, boss difficulty and check points. There is a check point in front of every boss door that lets you travel to side quests and the black smith for farming levels and upgrading gear. Highly recommend. 

Pros:
Forgiving parry system
Fun and engaging combat system
Incredible art design for the bosses and enemies
Fun setting with the 3 kingdoms.

Cons:
A little buggy, I had a crash in the second to last bossfight during the cutscenes and another crash to desktop early on in the game shortly after a boss fight also while loading a cutscene. 
simplified magic and leveling systems were not that fun to engage with
Parry window is almost too forgiving making the game far less challenging than its contemporaries in the genre.

Better in some ways, worse in others, and straight up just different in others still. I will still be comparing the games, since I think it's safe to say they are for the same audience.

+++ Fast, fluid combat, with an emphasis on brutal parries, and weaving your spells/melee abilities between your standard attacks. It's a lot of fun, and it's a great fulfillment of a spellsword/warmage fantasy. I'd probably even say this is my favorite spellcasting system in a soulslike that I've played.
+++ Fantastic character creator, mostly an upgrade from Nioh 2's, with countless customization sliders I wouldn't have even thought of
+ Optional PvP
+ Ultrawide support
+ Ranged weapons feel punchy and are still very strong against human enemies
+ Beautiful aesthetic with some fantastic ambient music
+ Great Chinese voice acting
+ Lots of cool lore from Chinese mythology
+ The difference from B to A agility is greater, and A agility is easier to reach. B agility still feels very good though!
+ Some very fun boss fights mechanically
+ The flags give an increase in power that make exploring feel worth

I have not tried the co-op yet so can't comment on that. Hoping it's about the same as Nioh 2's, since these kinds of games are a blast with unrestricted co-op.

= Not as deep as Nioh 2. I put this in the middle because this might be good or bad, depending on what you're looking for. There are straight up fewer gameplay and gear systems. If you enjoy diving into and mastering a bunch of systems to get the most out of your character, and mastering your moveset and interactions between abilities, you will prefer Nioh 2. If you'd rather jump into combat that's rewarding enough on it's own, you'll have a good time. Personally, I miss stances, the greater variety of abilities available at a given time, and the greater customization of gear at the blacksmith that Nioh 2 had.
= The village is visually nice, but I wish it were a bit more straightforward to get around
= The morale system makes this game much easier than Nioh 2. If you do any amount of exploring for flags, you can reach 20+ morale by the end of each main level fairly easily, at which point most bosses just aren't very difficult, especially if you are wearing medium armor. Again, this might be bad or good depending on what you're looking for.
= Level design is.. alright. It's easy to get lost in a lot of the levels, although they are still mostly linear. I'm glad Rise of the Ronin is giving the open world thing a try.

- PC port woes
- Where did DLSS go?
- Nice graphics, but they do look a bit dated in 2023. Hoping Rise of the Ronin has more modern tech features
- Story follows the same formula as Nioh 2: history + demons + magical item/substance that causes war and corruption. Had some cool moments but overall felt less personal
- Kind of a negative in itself that it's doomed to be compared to Nioh 2
- Very cheesy English dub kills the atmosphere
- Should be more variety of enemies TBH

If you've already played Nioh 2, give it a try, but try to enjoy it as something a bit different, gameplay-wise.
If you haven't played a Team Ninja Soulslike: try Nioh 2 if you enjoy having a lot of options in combat, systems to master, and Diablo/WoW-ish loot; try this if you are cool with fewer of those things, or want an awesome spellsword fantasy.",1677917966,1679908991,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It’s considered to be Nioh’s spiritual successor, but a much simplified version. The game is based on the Three Kingdoms period, with the underlying theme of a deus ex machina controlling people behind the scenes, eventually resulting in evil domination and explaining the chaos of war. It’s impressive that they have not glorified and promoted the act of war while they're on the world of the Three Kingdom but actually fairly neglected.[hr][/hr]The combat system revolves around a spirit gauge that is similar to Nioh's Ki system. The spirit gauge has both positive and negative states, and once it reaches the limit, the player's stance breaks, leaving them vulnerable for a few seconds. To prevent this, players must deflect enemy attacks or use standard weapon attacks to build up the spirit gauge, which can then be spent on spirit attacks. These attacks decrease the enemy's spirit gauge, making it easier to break their stance and deliver critical attacks.[hr][/hr]While this combat concept is engaging, the system's execution is somewhat lacking. Wo Long only has two types of martial arts compared to Nioh's three stances per each two special movesets and 4-5 additional movesets, which limits the player's tactical options. Furthermore, martial arts and spells consume too much of the spirit gauge, leading to passive gameplay. [hr][/hr]Deflecting enemy attacks is an instant action without any initial vulnerable frames, making it easier to deflect most attacks, but the window is short. The short deflection window, however, can be challenging, as it requires quick reactions and good visual acuity.[hr][/hr]While Wo Long's combat system has its shortcomings, it still offers an engaging and challenging experience. The spirit gauge system provides a unique twist on traditional action gameplay, and mastering its mechanics is a rewarding experience. However, players must be prepared for the harsh consequences of mistakes, especially during late boss battles where 100% deflection of critical attacks is necessary to avoid death.[hr][/hr]The audio experience in Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty is truly exceptional, with a soundtrack that rivals even the acclaimed Nioh series. As a devoted fan of Nioh 2, I must say that the Chinese historic background themes present in Wo Long's music are truly captivating. The boss music, in particular, is a standout feature that elevates the game to new heights. Without a doubt, the music is the game's strongest aspect and a testament to the careful attention paid to audio design.[hr][/hr]Here's the issue. Despite there being no DLC released, there’s too little content. The grinding item range is too narrow that you will collect quite plausible items in a very short time that you don’t even feel motivated to keep playing. Collecting the reward was a key point of this type of game. Not even what you wanted, this makes you try the new build/new weapons. But Wo Long lacks this kind of variety range.[hr][/hr]The game suffered from a significant issue with its framerate, which proved to be a major obstacle for many players seeking a smooth gameplay experience. While the subsequent release of patch 1.04 appears to have stabilized the performance, it is disappointing that the developers did not address this issue prior to the game's release. [hr][/hr]In conclusion, while Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty showcases a great deal of potential, it ultimately falls short in several key areas, such as gameplay mechanics, content diversity, and performance. The combat system, though straightforward, lacks the depth and complexity found in games such as Nioh, resulting in less challenging and somewhat unengaging and easy gameplay.  Music in Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty is exceptional with Chinese historic background themes and standout boss music, making it one of the game's strongest aspects. The game's dearth of content, even without any DLC released, makes it challenging to maintain interest beyond the initial week of playtime. Most notably, the persistent framerate issue remains a significant hindrance, impeding the smoothness of gameplay despite the release of patch 1.04. Ultimately, while Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty offers glimpses of promise, it falls short of being a truly satisfying gaming experience.[hr][/hr]8/10",1679847941,1679848325,True,5,0,0.5446128249168396,0,True,False,False

The addition of jumping and mantling opens up a great deal more verticality to the level design, which is also a nice plus.The actual core gameplay of Wo Long is fantastic. It feels like if Sekiro and Nioh had a baby and honeymooned in Three Kingdoms China; there's a great flow in attack-deflect-attack-deflect, and Nioh 2 players will feel right at home dealing with the 'burst attacks' used by many enemies. Exploration, intense combat, wild boss designs, cleverly hidden loot with lots of tiny % numbers, so far it has it all, and I've enjoyed it immensely.But there are severe, glaring issues that keep me from recommending the game.  While the graphical options are decently in-depth, performance is lacking, with FPS drops, video flickering, and outright CTDs happening regularly, even in scenes with little on the screen. This is very disappointing given the quality of Team Ninja's previous ports. Further, important features of the game are not adequately explained if at all; I was not even aware there was a world map until I started menu-hunting at a banner, the game's equivalent to bonfires/graces/checkpoints, and thus missed four chapters worth of side missions and other content.

Abhorrent PC port, and yet the game looks about as good as a PS4 game. Only buy this game if you intend to play with a Controller. Don't even bother with keyboard and mouse.
Nowhere near as developed or deep as Nioh 2 was unfortunately, with only 2 special 'arts' per weapon, only one 'weak attack' string and one 'strong attack' - only 4 spells even though there are unmapped buttons even on Controller.
Speaking of the spells, some are absolutely busted, two or three shotting bosses, while 90% of them are absolute garbage that at best does nothing.
The way the game works is that your Weak attacks and Parries are 'Builders', as in, they build your meter, and Heavy attacks, Weapon Arts, Spells, Dodges and botched parries are your 'Spenders'.
That leads to some Weapons being clearly better than others, as the 'parry' button doesn't animation cancel attacks at any point. This means that slower weapons will get smacked out of attacks more often - combined with the fact that most of your damage is either in A) Your spells or B) Your big 'visceral attack', means that while its true the Hammer (example) hits twice as hard as the sword, that's mostly for your 'Meter Builders' as stated before, which do minuscule amounts of damage when compared to the 'Spenders' the damage of which is mostly equal between weapons.
Lastly, the loot system should be familiar to people who've played the Nioh series, with a bunch of RNG affixes on every piece of loot, with different rarities and a new rarity and effects added at NG+. Unfortunately, the affixes themselves are not very interesting in this one, but they can be quite potent, despite what some others might have you believe - this is an endgame system, though, and as such you can just go through the game and just equip whatever has the best numbers on it.
I will say that in terms of armors and weapons, the way they handled the upgrade system means that if you do find a good piece, you can hang to it all the way to NG+ and beyond, as you can just upgrade it to stay relevant - at that point, you might as well change the affixes on it at the Blacksmith, allowing you to, potentially, create a vastly stronger build quite early on if you either farm a particular piece or get lucky.
Unfortunately, there are far fewer clothing items in general - and those that exist are very same'y looking so in terms of fashion you won't get as much diversity as the Nioh games had, with most of the sets in the game making your character look like a brick house regardless of your characters' physique. 
Why the thumbs up, then? Despite what I've said, even a watered down, less polished and bad looking Team Ninja game is pretty damn fun - with the combat system single-handedly picking up the slack of the rest of the game. 
I'd personally wait for a Sale however (unless major updates happen).",1679579622,1679579622,True,23,0,0.631032884120941162,0,True,False,False

Team Ninja, step it up please. Make the DLC bosses harder and please, for the love of god keep making stuff like the propeller turtle or the dual boss that used his friend as a weapon. The more insane and crazy the better.

Game is fun but I personally miss having more offensive options like we did in Nioh, I feel that the game being centered about parry makes it slower than it should be. I really hope that we get more weapons with different and varied movesets in the future because It was a huge disappointment even though the animations are superb and the game feels great.
It is a shame because I really like the formula but it still feels like its missing the insane 100 to 0 combos you could achieve in previous games.

I want to be able to master the systems until I become an unstoppable beast like in previous games, please give us more ways to cancel animations other than spells, please add some more platforming and maybe wallrunning.

This game is tons of fun but it feels watered down, I really hope it was harder from the get go.


also it runs like ass on PC, I hope there will be performance patches along with multiplayer fixes because I've only been invaded twice during a full playthrough. I pre-ordered specifically because of PVP and I wasn't able to enjoy it at all.

Some players have reported issues with performance on release, which understandably leads to frustration. I would suggest anyone to first try the demo. I did exactly that and had no performance issues. However, I'm seeing a lot of ""It's not Nioh"" reviews on here. They are right, it's not. However, that doesn't make it a bad game. They removed some of the complexity of the combat you had in Nioh. Stuff like combos, stances or Ki Pulse aren't a thing in this game. However, they added a very satisfying deflect mechanic and tacked on to that is a cool resource mechanic that links offense to defense. The better you defend, the better you'll be able to punish your enemy. It makes for some really enjoyable combat. 

The story is a bit over the top and corny at times, but it certainly isn't bad and it's worth paying attention. Really sets up some of the bosses. The art direction is also worth mentioning. It all looks great and consistent with the theme. The armor, weapons and environment all look amazing. I very much enjoy going back to the Hidden Village to unwind. The game also features an easy to use transmog system and a loadout system. You can respec at will and save different builds to use on the fly. This makes it really easy and fun to try different builds and different weapons. I also quite like parts of the UI. It's a lot more streamlined than it was in Nioh 2, even though inventory management is still a bit of a nightmare.

I also think that most of the bosses are great fun. The only downside is that it's difficult to fight them again due to the morale system. You essentially have to repeatedly find a bunch of flags in the boss zone if you want to fight the boss again on even ground. You'll have a rough time if you don't. Still, it's one of the few games I've played where I actually wanted to play through the NG+ because the combat is so much fun. You can seamlessly switch between NG and NG+, so there's no reason to not give it a go. It's not like in Dark Souls games where you lose your progress in NG once you go to NG+. It's more like a difficulty setting in this game. 

Overall, I really loved my time with it. Still playing NG+ casually and looking forward to the DLCs.",1679529418,1679529554,True,4,0,0.517906367778778076,0,True,False,False

Bosses also have many skills and fight with them is very satisfying. There is a lot of cons here. Smaller or bigger but in my oipinion game still deserved to get a shot. I am not regreat that I bought it. Difficulty in my opinion is on good lvl. Even if you have problems just in the begging it is imo good way to learn how to play. Later will be only easier.

If someone is interested about things that in my opinion should be improved then can continue reading :)

Camera - in this games some enemies are fight much more hmm dynamic? they move faster etc. Camera simply moves to slow after them. Target system could be some kind diffrent and upgraded imo. If u release game on PC then keep pc standards. BTW those enemies for me are a big advantage. Usually mobs and bosses in many games are slow and just annoying.

In generall everyone who played NIOH 2 will shortly see that in KOEI made there better job. For instance remodeling armor. In WL u can't check how new outfit will look like before accepting the changes. U have to approve it and exit the blacksmith. If u wanna changing again u have to delete old one skin and again accept new one. Annoying

Optimalization - I dont know why KOEI made this in almost all PC port games but there is always problem with optimalization in their games. NIOH 2 also had this problems.

Allies - they are simply stupid. For my they more times disturb in a fisht thatn help. Also mobs act like they don't see our allies. Well this is stupid and sometimes handly in the same time imo.

Co-op. For me the worst part here. I am not a dev and i don't know how it works but it is almost unplayable. It is lagging as hell. There is no chat in game. U are adding randomly to someone. I know that it is similar to EL or DS but I never liked it. In nioh 2 u could see what activity ppl are looking for.

Best momnet in this game was when one day game crashed while I farmed a little the same enemy over and over. After restart I only saw that game can't load my save and that was end of my first playthrou :( Start everything again (I just made a plation and I was on NG+). I wanted safe some times so I asked my friend to share me his save because he was almost in the same point as me. Then I discover u can't shar saves in this game :) I wrote even to KOEI how I can use this save but it is impossible. At least for now. Don't know why. I am not a fun of this kind of sharing but lost my whole playthrou was much worse :) Because I didn't play game with such good combat for long time I wasn't too much angry then :)",1678123516,1679511707,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The best thing about Wo Long is the combat. It is fast paced and extremely satisfying. Deflections feel tight and smooth. The level design is about the same as the Niohs and the missions aren't too short or long. Good use of verticality and short cuts that loop around. The story is just about as confusing as the Niohs too but that's not why we play these games lol. The sound design is on point. Personally, I felt like it was a tad easier than them and the souls games but still had me retrying a few of the harder bosses. Enemy types are detailed and unique but few and reused throughout the game. I would like to see way more enemy types in the DLCs. The bosses were enjoyable and even the human bosses had a twist to them.

Builds in this game can get crazy. There are so many customization and upgrade slots to the weapons and armor. It throws tons of data at you and it can be kind of intimidating at first compared to other games like this but there are some good yt vids that help break it down. I played using a controller.

if you familiar with the story, this game follows that timeline, from yellow turban rebellion just like any Dynasty Warriors franchise :D

But, if you played Elden Ring, Nioh 2 or Any Dark Souls game, i think you will be disappointed in terms of ""Souls Like"" genre.

I tend not to recommend this game at current launch price point, also there's still graphics bug going on. i wish steam have ""mixed"" reaction instead of ""yes"" or ""no"" this game is in the ""mixed"" category.
but if you purely wan't new soulsborne games, this is game for you.

Compared to Nioh 2, magic skill tree were simplified here, you pick what you see, no need to use them to level it up. i like this part
But this game don't have Ninjutsu (kinda item based build skill tree). i don't mind this part

most of my disappointment comes to the martial arts (combo skill):

In nioh 2, you can use any martial arts on any single group of weapon, this game? they randomized it based on your loot and cannot be changed, this is one step backwards from nioh 2 :(
Compared to Fromsoft game, Dark Souls 3, martial arts locked to single weapon when they make new game, Elden Ring. You can change it to any non-unique weapon, now this is one step forward.

Flag system (bonfire/shrine/kodama), i wonder why they reset the count, while in Nioh 2, you found kodama you don't need to find it again, this also one step backwards :(

In terms of gameplay fluidity. love the jumping mechanics, keep it up :D
but on the combat side, you can't cancel martial arts or normal attacks once you commit (idk why some martial arts take super long time to initiate like blades of king helu), while some of enemies can throw fatal / red attacks quicker even than your normal attacks, so you always lose half of your HP for no reason. that's unfair :(",1677982565,1679495054,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Boss fights over in seconds and no reason to play a level. Game dead to stupid people and stupid players despite being dumbed down for coop specifically. Team Ninja has become a crap company.


From someone who understands what team ninja does right and what miyazaki does wrong.

The Very Bad-

The story is disgustingly stupid. Not only does it not make sense, they went out the way to straight ruin rottk and dynasty warriors fandom as if it were japanese hating on chinese lore. Renaming and misrepresenting characters as if no source material existed only to give rise to a highly questionable story going forward considering the game ends in a nonsense climax hinting at what to come. The trope of you are the hero and china needs you to do anything devalues the entire reason people like the era and is complimented with useless AI that makes heroes like Guan Yu look useless.

Key points on story: 
1. You villianize the yellow turbans as if peasants countrywide are just bandits when the whole plot of the three kingdoms is fighting corruption from those officials from he jin well into cao cao and liu bei stubborn doom the nation  goals.
2.Why is lubu a hero and why are you portraying him that way? He killed his fathers for personal gain and became a tyrannical leader why does this game go out teh way to glorify him well into the end?
3. Why is team ninja obsessed with these stupid hero stories that depend on a main character fixing another worlds problems? If it wasnt the trashcan idea of the nioh 1 protaganist pushing a western savior on japan now it is china is useless and easily manipulated by greed and magic. Always a single ""ominous"" sorceror in teh background that runs every boss fight. 
Your writers should be fired for making such stupid stories.

The game multiplayer is in a sad state and will surely be repaired soon. Random floating makes invasions questionable for cheating although that went unserviced in both niohs and cheaters are what killed online play for both nioh games aside from unbalanced stats. Thankfully you can turn off invasion of people but ai spawns will come on designation. The multiplayer UI options are worse than nioh meaning multiple loading screens and a step away from niohs expedition freedom . I don't know what the logic of this change was aside from a counter to cheaters but that doesnt mean much with joining random drop ins.

The game is buggy and crash prone  Sure it will all fix itself in time but there are quirky platforms, places to get stuck (few), and animations that cause some weirdness (also a few). The crashes are atrocious and the worst i've seen in a single player yet. Boss fights can crash making you restart during or at the winning cutscene. Crashes in the hub randomly. Crashes when in load screen. Even crashes on startup randomly. Fix the game this is sad for team ninja.

Random wtfuckery. Why is there not a better organization for a diablo loot system? Why can I not skip cutscense or leave a game post boss fight in coop when I will be kicked at the end of the video either way? Why can I not even interact and emote at the end of the fight, the emotes are pointless, people run levels and emote when it is done? WTF IS THE HUB DESIGN (a moronic magic plane where you can fall off ledges, that is confusing, and inconvenient to traverse for builds because of teh stupid design choice to force you to run from A to B). 

The Good-

Combat is fluid and deep although reasonably simplified vs nioh for accessibility to new players. It is more of an arcade game with mechanics that get deeper when you look at builds. I am worried that those mechanics might fall short if the game play revolves around posture breaking though.

The level design is actually pretty decent for what it is. Aside from the hub and the final boss, the levels are pretty good good for the material. Team ninja has an obsession with running up winding logs though. Stop making this trash can level design. The hub would've been hella cool if it were just a nice city layout like a mini Puyang or Chen liu. 

Music and audio is satisfying. I prefer more Chinese war influence with the three kingdoms era but whatever works. It is a war theme though. A bit hard to respect a period deeply tied to ongoing wars.

Boss designs are good although some are gimmicky. The eunuch fight is the most creative I fill and worth respect. The horse blob is a camera annoyance. The dragon fight is the worse for hitbox and not understanding what to do. Last three kingdoms before the final boss is underwhelming although his design is great, mechanics, great, visually great, just a weak boss in comparison. I love how people complain about lubu, he is all mechanics and parries. If you don't get the flags or explore before teh fight which is accessible early, he will kill you easily.

Builds are still here and I can see progression I'm hoping will come with dlc. Smaller numbers for balance but you can see the effort when you build right. Variety is there all though it is lacking to nioh and likely will remain less than nioh because of pvp with any new additions. I can say my main two build focuses are a speedy crit healer and a tanky deflection buffer. Two uses of game mechaincs that have a multitude of effects for the playstyle.

On builds with team ninja -

I hate that they put effort in making builds accessible them give poor implementation especially in coop. no way to tell people what you do or to signal what you want to do. No real teamwork, just mash buttons until you win. If I make a crit character that heals and does high damage on crit then let him crit. Coop doesnt respect this. If I make a deflect tank that buffs from reaction play, dont take agro and let the build get its set bonus buff. This is teh same problem in nioh where unique build mechanics were ignored and almost useless because they couldnt play on what they did well. In nioh it was yokai pool builds where you absorbed pools for protection via uesugi clan and had buffs with the izunagi grace. One guy cast barrier and all of that gets shat on.


Conclusion -

Its a good game by a good company and in time they will expand it, fix the quirks, and continue making more complex game than the overrated souls series. The game is literally a dumbed down nioh for a dumbed down community who didnt respect half the mechanicis of teh two prior games. People btching on that probably havent even made it to ng or actually know what making a build looks like. Worth buying. The only reason elden ring should be better is its open world and in game lore.

People are understandably upset about the quality of the launch port but should keep in mind this is one of the very first times a team ninja game released on PC and consoles at the same time.

While I was upset by the lack of quality in the port itself, after working out some kinks by disabling overlays and soem graphical options performance wasn't an issue and crashes were infrequent, where they did occur progress was not lost. 

An interesting story blending well with the early events of the ROTK stories. The combat feels good, perhaps a little easy once you get the flow of combat and deflections down. But it is enjoyable and requires developing skill to get a hold of. An interesting blend of Sekiro and Nioh feeling to it.

The morale system should have been fleshed out more and some bizarre decisions were made such as having a HUB world village map that needs to be loaded into to conduct basic business (blacksmith, respecs etv.) as opposed to a menu system allowing you to do these things more efficiently. 

I was also disappointed by the way you manage storage in this game as it is objectively compared to how it is handled in Nioh.

I hope there are some changes made to the game to get around the long load times (such as menu interactions outside of the village, or just a mission select after the current mission as opposed to being forced to load back into the village).

Combat is enjoyable , nothing less I would expect from a Nioh successor. Although feels the weapon variety is lacking. The stance system not making a comeback also removes a lot of move set variety. 

As a PC port it lacks polish. Did not experience crashes but seems it doesn't use computing resources effectively. Quality mode is a no go even for simple environment. Get close to particle effects and the framerate tanks. 3 years old hardware should be able to run this easily. Also got issues where cinematic scenes were not able to render or were playing with a lot of frame skips.

So in conclusion I enjoy this game very much but would advise to wait.

The performance can get preeeetty bad at times, I actually found moving my mouse to a second monitor and then tabbing back into the game helped a lot which was super weird.

The Story is very very basic, it's really just there to give you a reason to be doing stuff it's not super deep or enthralling but it's fine. 

The Gameplay though is very fun!

The first boss of the game I personally think is the most challenging, more so than most of the bosses in the game and I think its because he is a sort of tutorial boss for the games combat mechanics. If you can beat him you can beat any boss in this game for sure. Don't be discouraged by losing to him a bunch and the game really opens up once you start getting all the different weapons and spells!

I did all the side missions and I finished the game in about 35 hours at lvl 131. I think a good 10 of those hours were just me running around lost trying to find flags lol! I hope you give it a shot and Good Luck!

The difficulty is high, almost seeming insurmountable at first, but part of what makes Wo Long great is how the difficulty isn’t unfair. The game play is structured where players are rewarded for learning the fighting style of their enemies and using their mastery of their own skills against them. It can be frustrating and requires patience to master, but it’s such a great feeling to finally overcome a strong adversary. Challenge alone does not make a game great, but Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty excels in every area from artistic design to game play mechanics. Watching nameless warrior execute their different moves is akin to a ballet of brutality. The game play mechanics are are smooth and responsive as the game is challenging, making it a joy to invest the time in mastering the battle system.

Combat is top notch and fun, though few changes there are also welcome, currently it was a lot of fun combat wise. Bosses have been balanced, with more of them leaning towards the easy side, but KT games have always had bosses difficulty being increased with the NG+ cycles with them reaching one shot potential and same.

Build crafting has been made easy, though i would like more weapon variants with different scaling options.

Overall the game was fun to play and worth it. with the upcoming DLC's i expect the game to become even more fun and my rating may also change, till then i would recommend this game to anyone who liked Nioh and Sekiro.

As a veteran of Nioh 2, with hundreds of hours and having completed all achievements and reached the maximum level cap. I eagerly anticipated Wo Long with VERY high expectations. 

I'm satisfied with how the game turned out. However, there are some instances where it's a bittersweet experience, as the developers made both positive and negative changes. It's clear that they rushed the development process somewhat, perhaps due to their simultaneous work on other projects like Rise of the Ronin. 

I have great respect for developers who take risks and try something new, and it's evident that Team Ninja has done precisely that. They have accomplished something remarkable by creating a game with a completely different feel from Nioh 2, even down to the key layout. In my opinion, they have solidified their position as masters of gameplay, as they managed to deliver yet another incredible combat system.

While Nioh 2 remains my personal favourite in terms of combat mechanics, Wo Long's combat system comes in a close second, and it's worth noting that they achieved this while crafting a completely different gameplay experience. It's clear that the developers put in a lot of effort to make the game stand out and succeed, and it's a testament to their dedication that they were able to create a unique and compelling game.

Unfortunately, the port is abysmal and unacceptable that they still struggle with performance issues in their games. 

Team Ninja excels at creating engaging gameplay, clever map progression with well-designed shortcuts, and thoughtful map layouts. However, their level designs often lack a climactic visual appeal. This is a significant issue that needs to be addressed to elevate their games to the next level. The enemy variety being the biggest offender and critical flaw this game has.

The added ability to jump is a game-changer, and they have adapted their maps exceptionally well to accommodate it. The AI's path-finding abilities are impressive, with enemies able to jump around and pursue the player with great agility. Though there may be occasional hiccups and odd AI moments, for the most part, the enemies are just as capable of jumping as the player and present a formidable challenge.

[h1]The combat: [/h1]

The combat in Wo Long is incredibly satisfying, the game has reduced the number of stats you can level up and instead introduces virtues, such as wood, fire, metal, water, and earth. Each element can serve as a counter to the others, which adds another layer of strategy to the gameplay.

One of the new unique mechanics is part destruction, which allows you to destroy the enemy's hardened limbs to limit their attack power. However, in my opinion, it's a missed opportunity as this system could have been tied to a visual effect like a gore system.

The spirit gauge serves as the stamina bar for you and your enemies, divided by an orange or teal bar. The orange bar indicates how fatigued and close the enemy is to being staggered, while the teal bar shows how much in control you or they are, providing benefits to your attacks. The combat is a perfect blend of Sekiro and Nioh 2's combat, balancing the best aspects of both. Deflecting feels on point, and you can still perform normal attacks and block most attacks, but for special attacks, you'll need to deflect them to avoid taking a moral hit. It always feels like a tug of war between you and your enemies.

Fatal strikes are used when the enemy is out of spirit or unaware and hit via stealth means. The wizardry spells are tied to each of the virtues and their elements, each with its own tree and branching paths.

If you die, you lose your moral points and half of your Genuine Qi, but you can regain them by killing the enemy through the revenge system.

Gear-wise, the game is quintessential Nioh 2 but slightly streamlined, with a gems system that allows you to implement passives onto your gear.

The game features three types of ranged weapons and fourteen types of melee weapons, each with their own unique move-sets, styles, and skills. There are three armour types: light, medium, and heavy, and you need to be careful to choose the armour that fits your build and status so that you don't roll fat. 

The game also has two accessory slots that provide stats but no specific abilities. The gear is divided into tiers, just like in Diablo, with common, rare, epic, legendary, and mythic items represented by stars. 

Similar to fromsoftware games, you start with a limited number of healing flasks that you can augment by finding items throughout the world. These items increase the number of flasks you gain on resting and the amount they heal you with each usage. 

[h1]Concluding thoughts: [/h1]

The game offers engaging co-op with a lobby system, as well as PVP with world invasions similar to those found in FromSoftware games. However, the experience can be hindered by lag issues.

The game's GUI is beautifully crafted and organized, providing a polished feel reminiscent of games like Elden Ring.

The audio department is truly exceptional, with an amazing musical score that perfectly complements the Three Kingdoms vibe and atmosphere. Many of the soundtracks are memorable, and the sound effects, such as the deflect sound, are satisfying and on point.

I won't delve into the story to avoid spoilers, it's serviceable and enjoyable, but not groundbreaking.

The world still operates on a mission-based system, but it's now far more subtle. The companions system allows you to call upon your favourite heroes from the Three Kingdoms era, such as Cao Cao or Liu Bei, and they'll work alongside you on many missions. On others, you can go it alone.

One of the game's major new mechanics is the moral system, which affects both you and your enemies. The system provides a buff to the overall amount of damage you can inflict or receive, and it's dictated by the number of flags you discover throughout a map. This mechanic encourages exploration, as you'll want to find all of the flags hidden throughout the map. The system is a brilliant alternative to Dark Souls 1's Bonfire-Humanity system when you wanted to adjust the difficulty of a specific area. However, the game's one critical flaw is the fact that your wizardry spells are tied to your moral as a prerequisite for enabling spells.

It's surprising how many people are overlooking the remarkable aspects of this game, significant improvement that takes the series to the next level. Team Ninja has developed an engine that can serve as a strong foundation for future iterations of the series. Possibly even a Wo Long 2.

To start with the positive, some of the boss fights are amazing in this game. If the entire game was just a boss rush game with Lü-Bu fights, it would be an easy recommendation.
But, the majority of the game is not Lü-Bu fights, and in fact sucks ass.

Enemy variety is terrible, the same 10 enemies are copy-pasted throughout the entire game. You barely meet any new enemy types past the first 4 or so levels. I'm pretty sure individual dark souls DLCs have more unique enemies then this entire game. As a result clearing zones gets boring when your killing the same enemies as the last 15 hours.

Level design is dogwater. Average level quality is the same as a DOOM2016 snapmap. They are all the same; a direct path, and then a ""hidden"" path that takes 3 seconds of looking to find which conveniently lets you backstab every enemy by following it. Wuxia as a setting allows for so many breathtaking locals; something the game takes advantage of in 1 level, with the rest of your time being spent in dusty battlefields and dark tunnels.

Stealth is boring, and feels like sneaking up on a blind toddler. Enemies can barely see 10 feet in front of them, and most of the time you can skip sneaking up by just jumping on them from above. It's so trivial to do that it never feels satisfying.

RPG elements are terrible. You only have 5 stats, and since all of them scale different weapons and increase your HP, you mind as well just pick your favorite color and max it out ignoring all others. Bonus points if you pick Earth, since then you get to scale your HP, Damage, and Equip Load with the same stat. Endgame I literally had 20 points in 1 stat to unlock some spells, and the other 45 points in my main stat. Gearing is a joke. You can put any affix on any gear, so all that matters is the rarity of the gear (which changes the affix slots). So once you find light/medium/heavy armor with a set bonus you like, you can use it the entire game and ignore all other armor drops. Weapons of a class all share the same moveset, but they at least have different special moves that range in power from useless to broken so there is some incentive to find more.

The Morale system is baffling to me in how fucking terrible it is, in both idea and execution. This shit seriously sounds like some garbage that SAO made up, but it's unfortunately real and I had the displeasure of playing with it. Essentially you have a separate leveling system that resets every map. You start at 0, and gain Morale as you kill enemies. When you find Bonfires, your minimum Morale level also increases. Certain enemy attacks drop you a Morale level if they hit you, and dying resets you to your minimum Morale level. As for what this actually means, the higher your Morale the more damage you deal and the less you take. Enemies also have morale; fighting a level 20 enemy at level 0 is possible but will take 5x as long as if you were also level 20. Conversely, this also means that if you are level 20 then lower level enemies become completely trivial. And sense you don't seem to gain less morale at higher levels, you will then quickly become level 25 and make everything even more trivial.

The effects of this system serve only to worsen the entire game. If your good enough to kill enemies without getting hit much, you get [b] rewarded for your skill by the game making itself easier. [/b] Who thought of this? The incentive to not get hit by morale-draining attacks isn't needed because they are already high damage. And you drain a morale level of bosses on staggering them, making them [b] EASIER [/b] the longer you fight. If you build up to max(25) morale before the main boss of the level (something you can accidentally do just by playing well) your ""rewarded"" by the boss fight being turned into a complete joke as you take do damage and effortlessly stagger it. And since the boss fights are the only redeemable part of this game, this is a massive problem. Once I realized this I started regularly killing myself before the boss room to reset my morale to my minimum. If I have to [b] ACTIVELY [/b] work to prevent a system from ruining the gameplay, it is a truly terrible system.

Morale is also used to terrible effect in level design. The first is by limiting design space. While there are shortcuts, most are useless because if they re-use the same bonfire with shortcuts then you wouldn't gain minimum Morale, so levels are practically elaborate hallways. The 2nd is that sometimes the game will think it's clever by giving you two choices on how to progress. A way with level 20 enemies while your level 5, or a way with level 5 enemies. Gee, I wonder what I should do? Don't worry though, because one of the NPCs with you will be sure to go ""man sure looks dangerous over there, if only there was another way!"" because god forbid the player come to even the simplest of conclusions on their own without being spoonfed the entire time. God I hate modern gaming.

Anyway Combat, which is supposed to be the highlight. It looks good at first, but becomes samey really fast. The stamina system is novel and pretty good actually. It's essentially a hybrid stamina/stance/mana bar. It builds when you hit with basic attacks or parry. It's lost when you get hit, or use strong attacks/spells. Your defensive options is practically just parrying, like Sekiro. You can also attempt to dodge, but the i-frames on it are terrible and moves track so much that you mind as well parry. This also means that there is effectively no downside to heavy armor since dodging is so terrible. (And if you invest in Earth you just get to wear heavy armor as if it was light lmao). Wearing said armor breaks most of the games combat as you become nigh invulnerable to purely physical attacks, even from bosses.

Offensively is where things get bad. Your moveset is tiny regardless of weapon. You have 1 main attack chain, 1 heavy attack that is different if used during the main chain, and 1-2 special attacks depending on weapon (most of which are useless, or so good that you will spam them.) As a result whenever it's your turn to attack your just mashing a button mindlessly. It gets boring and repetitive really fast, especially when combined with fighting the same enemies over and over again.

You get some spells which theoretically might add some spice, but after experimenting I found the ones I had access to bad so I just used buffs for the entire game. You also get a Divine Beast summon thing which is like an ultimate you build up. I used it exactly once, it 1-shot the demo boss, and I decided to never use it again.

The game also loves giving you AI followers with terrible pathfinding who trivialize combat. You can turn them off thankfully, but that also means not hearing any dialogue as you walk around the empty levels making the story experience even worse. I settled on just turning them off before bosses.

Speaking of the story, it's pretty eh. Three Kingdoms is a sick setting, but they don't really use it to their advantage. Lots of stuff got omitted, and it incoherently timeskips around. Like seriously, in one Cutscene Yuan Shao assembles the Coalition to march against Dong Zhuo, and in the VERY NEXT Cutscene the Coalition disbands after Dong Zhuo burns down Luoyang offscreen. If you weren't already familiar with the Three Kingdoms story I feel like you would be completely lost.

In summary, some legitimately good boss fights do not save an altogether terrible game, in-which almost every single feature is broken or garbage. Also, the camera sucks.",1679353252,1679353778,False,3,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

[h1]A Cheap copy of Nioh 2[/h1]

When i played Nioh 2 for the first time, I was amazed how deep and entertaining it is compared to other souls games, I literally Found a gem!, It felt like the game has no limits, Skill tree after skill tree, Weapon Poses, Core Abilities, Weapon arts, Weapon Familiarity, Skill chains and very grind focused game. Your character build is so complex you can't get bored cause you have multiable combat Technics that you can execute. When I finished the game i felt empty and thirsty because no game can deliver the same gameplay experience. I wished that someday Nioh 3 see the light or any similar project from team ninja! same quality or better!. Then they announced Wo long, It has the same Play style, Equipment, Menus and it looks almost identical !, I thought it to be a successor to Nioh which got me so hyped ,Until i played it.
ــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــ

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

Here is how this game works, basically you choose a mission and spawn with 0 Moral rank\level, Every enemy you kill increases your rank, The higher your rank is the more health, stamina and damage you have, Each hit you take lowers your rank and increases the enemy rank, If you die you lose your rank (to 0), To prevent losing your collected rank after death you must search and capture flags in the area until you reach rank 20 and fight the boss, You kill it and leave the mission and so on, you choose another mission and start with Rank ZERO.
 
The system sounds interesting for hardcore players at the beginning
Cause no matter how strong your build is you still spawn with rank 0 and have to make your way thro hard enemies, but then you find out you spend a lot of time hunting flags instead of enemies and combat! Which will become annoying, especially if you can't find the flags!

[h1]leveling System[/h1]

All in one system! It's built around Five Phases of elements: Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water. The element are mainly effect your wizardy spells damage and buffs, but it also effect your build (health, defense, consumption and also the damage of each weapon, which is very minimal, weird and confusing system for new players!

[h1]Your Build[/h1]

You can carry 2 main weapons, Each has 2 abilities that are attached to the weapon when you find it and it can't be changed, Which means YOU DON'T HAVE WEAPON SKILL TREES!!, Nioh 2 on the other hand had 12 Skill tree just for your weapons, Each tree has +40 skill and each skill can be upgraded separately! aside from your guardian, ninja, wizard and samurai tree


[b]Let me give you the short version of how poor this game is compared to Nioh[/b]
[list]
 [*]No weapon skill trees
 [*]No Prestige bounces
 [*]No skill customization
 [*]No soul cores abilities 
 [*]No Scrolls and scrolls missions
 [*]No Crafting material and trade
 [*]No Weapon familiarity
 [*]No Tea house\utensils items
 [*]No Guardian skill tree
 [*]No Skill chains and combos
 [*]No daily missions
 [*]No Dojo-like challenges (Only2)
 [*]No appearance transform
 [*]No Weapon poses
 [*]No Clan battles and bounces
 [*]No kodomas (Panda) bounces
 [*]No online rooms browser
 [*]No separate leveling system
 [*]And i can go all day, It has no depth and nothing similar at all![/list]


[b]Tho the game has 2 new features[/b]
- A posture system like in Sekiro, Deflect and punish! which is good.
- Invades and Phanroms, Was happy to see it, but it is laggyyy.

-You also have few wizardry spells to combine with your build, But it's mostly limited, Not fun to use and useless Until you reach rank 15-20 of every mission to unlock your ultimate spell.

ـــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــ

[h1]Technical issues[/h1]
Here is what i went thro and why i really don't recommend this game.

[list]
 [*]Cut-sences not working
You must install VP9 Video Extensions from Microsoft Store to fix it
 [*]White screens
The screen flickers white like crazy (have't seen anything like it before), You must Turn OFF Ambient Occlusion to fix it
 [*]Black screens
Either you Alt+f4 or restart your whole PC
 [*]Long Loading screens
Even if you play it on the fastest hard drive on the plant
 [*]No mouse support
The mouse emulates controller movement, they fixed this issue after 3 days, but i must address it
 [*]Broken Autosave
Imagine you customize your build, sell and dismantle items, upgrade and level up, then when you go to help someone or when you open your game the next day you realize it didn't save your work, this happened to me 4 times in row, also to my friends.
 [*]Terrible auto-lock
If you want to lose your mind use the auto lock in this game, it jumps from the enemy in front of you to the enemies behind to the enemies in the underground tunnels. Manual lock is also broken.
 [*]Broken\useless mini map
I can't see the main boss or my friends direction\location on the map, I tried everything, but it is broken it seems.
 [*]Broken camera
The camera may go thro walls or behind objects in mid fight, died many times because of this.
 [*]Teleportation
If one of your friends has a minor connection or performance issues he will ruin the entire session, The enemies will teleport randomly, spawn and despawn, Spawns in safe areas and won't take damage.
[/list]
ــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــ

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
What can i say, It's probably the worst PC port ever 
The game has better graphics and effects, More cool cut-scene and more story content (Still poor) But a FAR worse gameplay, If you say you still want to enjoy it as a separate game (which it is), I still don't recommend it to you, it's filled with issues to the teeth.
For me tho, I will continue playing this game in the future, Just because i'm a big fan of the gameplay style here and i already bought the DLCs.

The combat, spirit posture, counters and stealth kills are a great step-up in games like these. Being able to counter a boss and finish it off with an awesome kill never gets old and the combat styles of each weapon is satisfying. Being able to finally jump across platforms just reminds me of Sekiro, making the game more enjoyable to move around without being restricted to the ground. The convenience of travelling to different parts of the map when you can come back to the same battle flag where you left off, never needing to start the level all over again to progress is a big win.
Even the spells had a variety of elements and uses to mix and match to which suits your style in the game. Not to mention the variety of martial arts attacks for each weapon is so awesome and addicting when you can pull it off. But unfortunately to me, it doesn't really hold up as a successor to Nioh 2 for several reasons.

The story is very mid to where it just doesn't really matter. It lacks on the reason to enjoy the main protagonist, the main villain, the key characters and others. In Nioh 2, you were a Shiftling in a struggling war between Human and Yokai while on a quest for vengeance for your mother (and family in a sense).
Here, you're just an ordinary Militia soldier who somehow happens to have the ""power"" to beat the Black Taoist while fighting a war and on a quest to rescue a blind-folded boy who we never even connected at all. It's not that bad, but Nioh 2 had a better story despite it not being so great either.

The variety of weapons and armour are very limited. Even though there are different types, there's only the Sword, Spear, Glaive, Hammer, Staff, Twin Swords and Halberd. There could've been Fist Weapons, Nun Chucks, Bladed Fans, Tonfas, Whips and Meteor Hammers to add in there. Even the designs of the weapons are so limited. There would only be up to 4-5 designs for each weapon. Nioh 2 had way more weapon types and designs. Plus I could also customise my Martial Arts attacks to what suits me the most. 

In this game, your Martial Arts attacks are always random on whatever weapon you get and you can't change them into what ever one you want. So getting the weapon type you like with the martial arts attacks you want will take a miracle or an extraordinary amount of luck that can be better used for the lottery. 

The Divine Beasts where great but again, Nioh 2 had more and a variety of different types with different traits. My favourite one is the Lion Divine Beast. Raining lighting in your surrounding area against a horde of enemies is awesome to have

Now just to be clear, just because Nioh 2 was better, doesn't mean this game is bad. It's still a great game if you look passed all it's flaws and which I'd say only worth the discount price when the sale comes in. So all in all I give this game a solid 7/10.

Weapon variety sucks. Combat is honestly kind of shallow and even more repeditive than Nioh. Enemy variety sucks. Levels are empty and linear. Side missions all suck. All the gear it's constantly feeding you is interchangable and boring. Elemental buildup on weapons is gone? Named character duels are now basic enemy reskins? 

For a game that's 90% similar to the previous entries, the experience sure feels tackier and less polished in almost every way.

Reasons
-Early on I had little to no understanding of what was going on in the era or the story. I found myself confused as to what necessarily my role was and what the significance the events I was experiencing held.(I feel this is an area Nioh 2 did especially well with, tying the main character into the story from beginning to end)

-Sometimes broken voice acting. Felt like some cut scenes were read from a teleprompter as the game was being played out. Voices would cut off mid sentence only to continue when the subtitles for the next lines appeared.

-Combat became more and more bland the further into the game i played. 
--Human enemies outside of bosses are generally jokes and as I built water as my primary attribute most fights with demons would start and end via a critical strike or before combat even starts. 
--The morale system while a neat idea makes it so most difficulty actually occurs when you skip parts of content or do areas out of order. 
--Only building Water makes it so certain fights become wait to parry a red attack vs actually trying to fight the enemy (not very fun). 
--I also never felt the need to weapon swap attack a feature that made Nioh 2 compelling for me as i never needed more then my weapon's basic combo attack to kill mooks and never had enough room in boss fights to feel comfortable using it. 
--Parry NEEDS to be a separate button then dodge. So many boss fights I early input and get punished by a follow up attack because I didn't know the timing of the first attack, or over estimated the attack's speed.
-- Getting put to one health because you fell in water or off a cliff is nice till you realize if you have enemies aggroed they are going to be mid attack when you respawn.
-Targeting system becomes finicky when multiple enemies are present. (probably could fix by adding a slight delay between switching enemies.
-Fighting multiple enemies isn't fun. the combat system is based around parrying and it becomes really hard to say, deal with three enemy characters at once. This is especially prevalent when you can't go for a critical attack due to the other enemies spamming attacks during the time frame or after a critical attack the other enemies  hit you before you can regain full control of your character.

-Bosses outside of a few (Aoye, Lu Bo first encounter, and The final fight) were pretty much push overs for me. This is in part due to either having allies for the mission, having high morale by the time you get the boss, or the boss weakening significantly after a critical attack. (something that later bosses ignore completely) Most late game bosses seem to just make you spam the parry button which is problematic as double tapping the parry button instead dodges. Boss hp seems to vary wildly rather then grow linearly as the game and my characters strength progressed

- Lu Bo's first boss fight gets a special mention because he is a giant health stick attached to an endurance fight that pretty much requires you to wait for red attacks. If the horse was only part of the initial phase and Lu Bo didn't have the chance to remount randomly or the horse phases stamina break actually did damage the fight would be fine.

-Can't comment much on the elements outside of water as that is what I used for my play through.

-Despite having the ability to change my build at any point i never wanted to because that would require finding a new set of gear with desirable special effects. as this was a problem in Nioh 2 as well I don't necessarily see this changing.

-Wished there was more early game content to get used to the benefits of the various element stats or to try out all the weapon types

-limiting the accessibility of certain spells till certain story missions felt cheap.

-After a certain point didn't really feel like I was getting stronger


The Positive
- The game is generally beautiful outside of a few areas that are perhaps a bit too vibrant.

-I never experienced any of the technical issues that so many others are communicating about the PC version of the game. (My PC does however have some fairly high specs)

-Controller was a great way to play the game outside of the targeting issue pointed out in the above.

-Despite parrying being slow and tedious it felt good when i got a critical attack off.

-Bosses were all different enough to be enjoyable (except Lu Bo first encounter)

-seems that they've done away with the rng special effect rolling in Nioh 2 by adding embedment. (this excludes weapon arts/rarity of gear)


The Final Score
-Wait for the game to get its dlc before purchasing unless you really want a less engaging Sekiro or want and eastern themed story with less oomph then Nioh 2. I say this because Nioh 2 changed alot with every dlc that released for it and some of the problems may be fixed in these future updates. Otherwise go buy Nioh 2 or Sekiro. This isn't a bad game but I would give it a solid 4/10 as it currently stands.

I was hyped for this game because it is from Team Ninja and Koei Tecmo, the guys that made Nioh 2 which in my opinion is a fantastic game. Nioh 2 was so good that it earned a spot in my personal top 10 best games of all time. Nioh 2 is a complex game with a lot of mechanics, amazing build variety and enemy variety, memorable soundtracks and bosses and actually a memorable story despite how minimal writing it is. 

Now comes the crouching dragon itself, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty. Truth be told, if you jump into this game expecting to be like Nioh 3, you'll be disappointed. Wo Long falls in many aspects that made Nioh 2 amazing, mainly the toned down build variety, criminally lack of enemy variety, disjointed storyline, and reduced combat complexity. The combat is significantly easier than most of the popular Souls-likes out there, with or without companions. However, the combat in this game with the focus on parries and perfect deflection is amazing on its own. The sound effects when you manage to parry and deflect incoming attacks are nothing short but orgasmic, akin to Sekiro. Magic in this game is almost always useless but gets significantly better and sometimes OP when you reach the midgame.

The inconsistency of difficulty is another critique that I have with this game. Introducing a difficult boss in the tutorial level is a great way to force players to adapt to the combat system. What is not good about this is that it makes you expect more bosses to be tougher than this guy, which is sadly not the case. In fact, there are only 2 other bosses that are more difficult than the tutorial boss while the rest are just pushovers. The game length is about average, but I expected more from it ngl. The lackluster enemy variety also hurts the game more, as by the time you are before the midgame, you've pretty much seen every single enemy variants in this game which is a shame because there are tons of Chinese monsters from myths and folklore.

Another issue with this game is the bad PC port. The optimization is not great. My PC is quite ok, RTX 2060 with AMD Ryzen 5 3600. It can handle most games at the highest settings. I had to turn down some settings in this game like volumetric fog and ambient occlusion to reach the 60 FPS. Even so, this game just struggles to run at a consistent frame rate. If you're in a area or facing a boss with many particle effects, your performance will tank hard. In a game like this, not being able to time your deflects properly will give you a very bad time. That said, at the time of this review, the recent patches (1.04) did improve my performance, but not as significant as I would hope so.

In my very honest opinion, this game has a lot of good things and bad things going for it. In many ways, this is basically the 'Nioh 2 at home' meme. If Nioh didn't exist, this game would be amazing on its own. If you look at this game without thinking about Nioh, you'll like this game. if you're a Three Kingdoms era fanboy like me, you'll love this game. Seeing a setting like the Three Kingdoms era, where famous warlords and warriors with magical divine/demonic powers is so damn cool. If I were to rate this game, this is an 8/10 for me. It's definitely not GOTY material, but I had a good time with it. Hope the upcoming DLCs can change things for the better.",1677863788,1679230726,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Right after the credits ended, I’m 100% sold and eagerly wait for the Season Pass’ content to drop. But before that, here's a couple of things I liked, disliked, and neutral:

GOODS:
First of all, this is the first time I see a game in PC that has PS5 buttons, not even Insomniac's Spider Man switches to the PS prompts when I’m playing the PC port w/ my dualsense controller, which makes a two-step thinking process into one-step for people that change (NS, PS5,X-input)controllers often.The great character creator from Nioh is back but with more Chinese aesthetics, accessories, and make-up that’s also reasonably limited(bc you can’t make your MC an NTR Ugly Bastard) due to cosmetics.The combat is simplified(compared to Nioh) but still has depth( when it comes to experimenting and combining weaponry, wizardry spells, martial arts, summons) along w/ two generously satisfying deflections/parry.And bc the combat is simplified, the lack of a skill sphere for each weapon type makes it easier to change and try other weapons anytime.While in Nioh,if I wanted to try another weapon I have to start from zero and grind until I obtain additional moves to chain combos.
Stamina bar is replace w/ a Spirit Gauge that rewards perfect deflection w/ bonus spirit that can be used for dodging/spell-casting/martial art moves instead of going back to a neutral state(like Sekiro’s posture meter)
The Morale System justifies the linear mission based structure of this game as it is a self-imposed difficulty parameter that rewards people w/ buffs and access to high level wizardry spell for exploring and finding (Big and small) Battle Flags or let them undergo a challenge when they reach the Boss w/ minimal Morale rank. Also, the QoL implementation of this game’s bonfire(the Big Flags) is great, it lets you register your checkpoint the first time you raise that flag without reviving all the enemies and lets you backtrack stress-free.
The Boss fights were great, when some of them were becoming stale, the next one would freshen things up w/ unique gimmicks,and everytime I felt like an over-leveled big donk G, I was served a piece of humble pie.
But by far, my favorite feat in this game is the Photo Mode, it lets you triangulate your lights and immerse into becoming a obnoxious cinematographer, and all that jazz( I would say 30% of my overall playtime is me setting all the lights and their colors)... it’s sooo goood(it’s 1 steps behind Ghost of Tsushima’s photo mode but still)
Also, I love the effort that the English voice actors put into pronouncing some of the individuals/locations’ names, even if they didn’t nail it 100% of the time

NITPICKS:
It sucks that the PC version wasn’t well optimized on release and Mouse+Keyboard Warriors had a terrible experience. The cutscenes were a bit choppy sometimes( maybe bc it is animated in a different framerate[not 60?] while the real-time rendered cutscenes were fine[ 60 fps in my case ] ). The mission[Centuries of Glory Burned Away] where the Dragon is summoning lightnings kills the frame rate, you should equip a low-level projectile spell to shoo it away while you’re under cover. I didn’t like how NPC Assist is ON by default and makes encounters easy most of the time( but there are also rare instance of even w/ Assistance the fight is still challenging ). But even when I wanted NPC Assist, I didn’t like that some of the Reinforcement NPC are locked based on the mission, especially when I’m trying to grind for friendship levels to get their weapon/clothes.
Also, I dabbled w/ the online Invasion for a bit, and it was rough.

NEUTRAL:
Most of the Drip in this game is not to my taste(including the cool Pre-Order armors) but it’s serviceable and you have the option to transmog them when you talk to the blacksmith. The player character in WoLong is not as relevant to the plot as the PC in Nioh 2, but I’m not playing the game for the story so I didn’t mind it at all. The music is fitting to the theme/setting but I didn’t find them as memorable as Nioh 2’s. And as much as I love the sound design of pieces of metal cranking in Sekiro, sound effects for deflection in here are fine too, I like the difference between Sekiro’s impact and Wo Long’s swiftness. I really wished that the function of dismissing your NPC Assist is also on the Game Settings and Reinforcement menu, instead of just using the Willow Branch in the inventory.

Overall, Nioh 2 Complete Edition is still the GOAT and its content has spoiled me too much, but Wo Long is good too and introduce couple of things that I would love them to carry forward",1679209746,1679209746,True,21,1,0.573529958724975586,0,True,False,False

I think they could do a lot better with the martial arts. They are not bad but some of them are clearly preferable to others. Overall the combat is less complex than nioh.

Another area they have improved a lot from previous team ninja game is level design. The levels are more interesting and bigger than nioh games. Fortitude feature really urge you to explore the level so that you can have a higher rank when you meet the boss of an area.

- Graphics aren't the end-all be-all of this generation, but still work really well when a lot is going on.
- Haven't had any issue with graphic stuttering and crashing like a good amount of reviews have stated. I'm not particularly high-tier with the computer.
For reference, I run on 
Ryzen 9 3900 XT processor
AMD RX 6700 XT graphics card
32GB RAM
on a MEG x570 Motherboard. I do use a M.2 SSD as well.

If anything, I recommend turning off ambient occlusion and checking the shadow's settings. There is a level with a great deal of fire, and it might be good to check particle settings when you reach it if you struggled with graphics at any point prior.

All that said, the gameplay is Sekiro with NIOH drops. The only issue with this is that armor level doesn't really have much of a difference (With ""heavy"" equip load being very generous with how much you can equip), and some weapon types are just not viable. The staff, for instance, is just so short ranged that you'll miss attacks point-blank (where it should shine). 

Once you get away from the Souls-like instinct to dodgeroll everything and learn that literally every single attack in the game can be parried, the game gets fun. A giant two-story tall demon's crushing blows can be parried just as easily as a normal sword swing, and that's the core essence of the game that I can see people struggling with.",1679196094,1679196094,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Nioh 2 has a better game design (more streamlined - level selection and blacksmith is accessible, respec.. no in game walking, so it focuses on the action), there are more builds (you can min max, which some people either like or dislike), controls feels nice and responsive.

Compared to Sekiro, gameplay wise, Sekiro is much better. In Sekiro, block and deflect is mapped to one key (hold to block, press to deflect), and dash is mapped to a different key. In Wo Long, deflect and dash is mapped to one key (double tap), while block is mapped to another. While in a sense, both Wo Long and Sekiro relies on rhythm, Sekiro is much better and feels more responsive. The timing makes more sense compared to Wo Long timing, which often the hit comes sometimes later or quicker.

Story wise, sure we meet some notable characters from the three kingdoms. But the main character (you) are not even in the story. You're just an observer. Also, in a level where we know there is a war going on (against Dong Zhuo or, in this case, Lu Bu, in the Hulao gate pass) it doesn't feel like a war is going on (where are all the armies? where are the characters of the different factions in that level?). Instead, we are roaming alone in a war torn level, facing isolated demons and such, with no war going on, and suddenly we face Lu Bu. Nioh and Nioh 2 did this better, by only placing the protagonist in the outskirt of the war (the war is happening in X, you should go to Y), or, placing a lot of enemies in the war level (with both allies and enemies facing each other).

Tldr; Wo Long should be more like Dynasty Warrior 10, with these mechanics - instead we have a Nioh 2 and Sekiro mash up which fails to live up to both games.",1679194752,1679194752,False,1,1,0,0,True,False,False

They say this game is like Nioh 2 and Sekiro having a baby. But I beg to differ. The only things they have here from Sekiro are 1. Deflect and 2. That Taotie death-revive which was obviously from the Guardian Ape.

The boss fights are quite underwhelming. There are only very few bosses in this game that will keep you engaged in combat the way Sekiro did: Lu Bu, Sun Jian, Dong Zhuo, and Zhang Liao. The rest are just either mob fights or annoying magic spamming bosses. Liu Bei could have been a really good boss fight; they gave him a 6-hit combo that feels really awesome if you deflect all, however, the area denial lightning balls that he spams on the ground while flying made him feel really cheap to fight against.

Zhang Rang is the most bullshit boss in any game next to Bed of Chaos. There are bosses where you learn and memorize the attack patterns until you can react accordingly to perfection. But this one is just pure bullshit-RNG-pray-to-god-no-homing-lightning-ball-is-flying-towards-you. Nothing to ""git gud"" on this one.

Regardless of the many bugs I had especially when trying to play co op, the game has a nice and unique game play, it is really fun using the parry system they built, but everything else feel like meh. 

If you played Nioh 1 and Nioh 2, you will be pretty much disappointed in this. It does not have any depth in its mechanics, enemy variety so scarce, you literally fight the same mobs over and over again. There is no difference in visuals even. 

In addition, armor and weapon variety is not much, and most armors look identical just with different colors. I still remember in Nioh 2 especially trying out different weapons and armors, mixing things together. Btw, I finished the whole game using the same armor and 2 weapons, I didn't feel the need to change cause literally all enemies can be beaten fairly easily with any weapon. Also visually there weren't many weapons.

One of the most annoying things is they made animation for fighting with fists and it has a nice blocking system, but there are no weapons using those animations at all.

I am mentioning Nioh games a lot since it is the same developer and it was the selling point for me and my friend to purchase this game without thinking and jump into it immediately after release.

Let alone they put out a Demo which by far was the best thing about it. 

Some maps are plain and empty, so many things are illogical in terms of terrain even for a fantasy game. They just don't make sense. Enemy placement is laughable, like they took soldier statue mobs from Nioh2 and put them in a sewers area in Wo Long, when you see it, you can feel that it is completely out of place and random. It felt they had many things copied from their other games, recolored and then pasted in Wo Long.
Dynasty Warriors games seem to have some real influence on Wo Long in terms of story, cut scenes and maps.

It's certainly interesting but all told the entire system is just a bit annoying when mastered and insufferable when not. If they decide to try this style again the UI definitely needs work, your spirit bar and health absolutely need to be easier to read at a glance. 

I feel I must draw attention to the concept of locking what type of magic you can use to a morale level (power level that goes from 0 to 20 throughout each level based on a collectible). It's such an amazingly terrible idea, magic use is already very very restricted due to the way the spirit system works and I guarantee this just results in less people interfacing with spells at all. They're gonna have to come up with a better way of making morale feel meaningful because this is on the level of adaptability from Dark Souls 2 being tied to your I frames on rolls, which is one of the dumbest things I've seen in a video game.

The game feels like Dynasty Warriors, works somewhat like in between Monster Hunter and Soul-like games.

- The game gets repetitive real quick. You have to grind for great and set equipment and that takes a lot of time.
- There's little variation of minions, and most of them are easy to brute through.
- The remaining ones just test you on your sneaking and parrying skills - the parry frame is huge.
- Maps are reused in each chapter - lack of variation again.
- Jumpscares are uneffective and very predictable.
- Storyline feels very shallow with so much characters involved and so little going into most of them. Some random dudes just popped up in side missions and has their own signature equipment, and that's all for them - a waste of character development.

- Graphics are above-average. Definitely can be optimized further but at least the game is fluid most of the time.
- Lots of combinations for spell users which feels fun! But outside healing and damage spells other spells feels mediocre.
- And the type system is pretty innovative as you can cancel enemies' status with the correct types.

They really should have addressed this before releasing the game on Steam. I bring this up because the lessened player base has hurt the greatest highlight (of many) of this game for me, which is the multiplayer playthroughs. You can easily link up with other players and are never penalized for doing so (or you can do the whole thing solo). The rewards won't be lessened at all. Hope this never changes.

Smooth playthrough, and good replayability. I've sunk 100+ hours already into it, which is the most I've ever sunk into any RPG this soon after its release. Great animations, great build options for your character (no penalties for switching character specs once you unlock a certain area).  RNG can be frustrating for some. but not me because it's not pay-to-win at least as of now. You actually have to play the game. Haven't even really gotten into the PVP aspect of the game yet, but from the 15 or so invasions I've done, it's all been a blast. 

Overall, my only complaints would be the following... This is a small one for me, but the CPU AI is a bit silly. I can stealth kill someone a little too close to another but I honestly enjoy it haha. I can't lie. There are bigger fish to fry though.  Fix the framerate performance so people who have certain PC builds aren't running 30 FPS all game. Fix mouse and keyboard controls. I've tried it, and the deadzones on the mouse make this unplayable using those controls. The drop rate for legendary items could be tweaked a bit to drop a bit more often, but if you play enough, you'll get what you need in my opinion. I don't have what I want yet but I have 2 of the 5 pieces of the legendary after about 7 hours of grinding.

If you give this a chance, I'm sure you won't regret it. Every time I change my character build, change skill phases, weapons, armor and spells, it's like playing an entire different character and my fights with enemies are almost entirely different. If you like a certain build you can also save it as a snapshot. It's refreshing.
I would give this game an 8.5/10, but the PC controls and performance docks it to a 7/10. It's a near flawless game experience for me due to my expensive PC and the fact I'm using a controller, but finding people to play with is a bit hard at times since this is clearly not everyone's experience.",1679093175,1679093175,True,0,0,0.477272719144821167,0,True,False,False

First of all the game does run fine, not had a single problem with the game on that front at all. Side quests are a weak point in my opinion cause they dont really unlock anything cool or massive, though that does mean your not heavily punished for missing them so its a toss up what your thoughts on that might be. 

The morale system is hit or miss, depends on how you engage with it in my opinion, if you under engage with it the game will become much harder in the most boring ways since enemies will take little damage and you'll take so much more yourself, engage with it to the max and you'll activate easy mode because you'll take so little damage from regular attacks you can just trade with everything, including bosses. If you have maximum resolve in a level i think you'll be at the point where the difficulty is satisfying. 

Spell balance is horrible, a lot of spells are not worth using for one reason or another and the good spells still suffer from good balancing, so certain enemies will have good and meaningful resistance. But unlocking spells is easy enough though and by the time you have them all you can try them all to see which ones are good.

The basegame story is weak because for the wide majority of it you are barely involved with the story despite you being the trump card for whoever your currently working with in the story, the only time where the story is yours is the start and the immediate end.

Not a stupid decision but perhaps just an oversight but you cannot have the blacksmith craft specific weapons like you could in Nioh, meaning you have to do a lot of grinding if you want to min/max (which i am very certain a lot of people who play this game past base difficulty do). You also cannot preview decorations to see how it meshes with your current look.

The gameplay is the best part of the game, it does away for the most part of the soulslike tradition of dodge and attack for deflect/dodge/block then attack (thats somewhat reductive but i dont wanna break down the entire combat system in a 
steam review lmao) and outside of that loop are optional spellcasts and martial art attacks. My one gripe with this is that only one enemy in the entire game will deflect your attacks, everyone else will either super armour through your attacks or block them, i hope in the dlc enemies as a matter of course deflect attacks to encourage diversifying your attacks.

Weapon diversity is good, no super crazy (mean that as a good thing) weapons like the switchglaive or splitstaff from Nioh. 

I personally think this is a good thing but theres no skill trees, the closest thing are the five phase spells which you can max out (technically) by level 65.

TLDR : Game is good, i dont wanna call it great yet though.

Wo long is a good game with good combat, horrible story, but is fun to play.  Well for a little bit it is.  The reason I can not recommend this game to anyone.  Is it is so horribly unbalanced it's not even funny.  From someone who likes difficult games & has been a long time fan of the Souls serious.  You might wonder why I wouldn't recommend this game.  To me it's a repeat of Nioh games.  A good game that I enjoy when it works which almost never happens, they are beyond unbalanced.  Any enemy in this game can basically one shot you.  And that's it you dead. I'm not joking. Leveling up does barely anything the game does not play that much different at level 10 or level 150 which is the max.  Something is wrong there  The game goes by this stupid point karma system that goes level up with each kill or should I say each 5 kills.  And if you die it goes down on.  This is all that matters if your karma is at 10 or more yourn a monster.  If not you feel like your fighting for you life with a pencil in your hand. So your horribly underpowered in this game.  It's like playing Dark Souls starting with negative 100. 
 And sometimes the buttons just don't work.  So deaths feel cheap, like the game isn't playing by it's own rules.  I like to go at it solo but there comes a point were your throwing the controller into the wall cause because the lowest level enemy just went through your block & killed you in the swing.  You ask for some online help from the community.  And I live in the states, but I always seem to get someone with an Asian name the comes in to help.  Which is cool as long as they have my back like I have there's.  Maybe I'm strange but I all Souls games when someone comes in my game I will greet them, I don't care if it's a invader.  It's a matter of showing respect.  And you can tell how your game is going to go if they greet or not.  Anyways some Asian person comes in my game to help, I'll bow or wave to them & they just run pass me like I'm not there.  They even run pass enemies.  I just asdked for there help because I just lossed something when I got killed before & I need help getting it back.  I don't want that to happen again.  Anyways they run off never to be seen again.  And sometimes they kill everything like it's nothing.  I mean 1 hit.  And if they didn't run off,  I left running around picking usless loot off the floor till I get to the boss.  When this happens I feel like I've been cheated.  Like I'm not even playing my own game I'm just watch some piece of garbage that's at a higher level fly through my game. And I'm just watching.  And left thinking I wish I was playing now, I want to do that.  I wanted to explore.  But this pushy people that come in your game take it over.  But most of the time they just disappear & I die from the same enemies I needed help with.   After this happening over & over again.  And the same thing with Nioh.  It becomes clear this game NEVER should have been released in this state.  But people are garbage & will always pimp themselves & there fellow man out for the all middy dollar.  Sad, people are the same everywhere.  Keep away from this game.  Unless you like getting mad & like unfair deaths over & over & over.  Well that honestly what to expect if you buy this game.  And you'll by pissed.  The thing is, the reson why I'm ranting is after everything I said about the game.  After you go through that it makes me mad.  And when I playing a game to have fun.  And when I'm done the game I'm like why did I put myself through that.  These devs should be proad of the garbage they made",1679045438,1679045438,False,1,1,0.4120139479637146,0,True,False,False

Nioh 1 & 2 were surprise hits for me when they came out and remain to this day as some of the perfect executions of what a souls-like should be. They are near and dear to my heart because of the fast paced action that leaves my heart beating a million miles a minute along with the ridiculous number of builds that you can do post-game. But this isn't about my love for those two games this is about Wo Long.

I preface this by saying I've never played Sekiro so I can't compare the combat at all, but the one thing Wo Long has done is made sure that I probably won't play such a masterpiece if this game is supposed to emulate the feeling. Deflecting is a key combat skill that one will develop as they play the game and somewhere along the way you'll pick it up and it'll be exhilarating to do assuming the camera doesn't go weird, or the lock-on system decides to fuction, or companions decide to not get in the way. Particle effects as well immediately became an issue as they would block my vision, preventing me from deflecting an oncoming attack. Although timing deflects is a skill issue this game absolutely cannot get enough of delaying all of it's attacks. It felt like every single enemy had some sort of delayed attack that felt like it was tacked on just to annoy people who play other souls games. A lot of little things in this game are annoying enough to be a monster in itself.

It felt like there was a lack of building and as a result any armor, weapons or spells I took didn't really mean much. I'm probably wrong about this because I didn't research enough but armors really didn't feel any different from one to another; if I went from blue weight to green weight it felt like nothing changed at all. There are more weapon types sort of? There are several types of sabers, spears and dual weapons but while some of their normal attacks and martial arts varied it did not change my approach to fights at all and ultimately made me stick with one weapon throughout the rest of the game rather than wanting to experiment. Nioh 1 & 2 had extremely unique weapons with a diverse cast of skills that made me feel like I was mastering something. In Wo Long however every weapon felt like light attack x 2 > deflect > light attack > heavy attack. Spells exist, yeah that's about it. They didn't feel like much but if you're curious I went full Earth Phase and used of all the spells additionally I primarily used dual blades to try to maximize healing and spirit gain but it didn't really feel like much. 

Throughout the game I wondered what was the core reason that I didn't enjoy this game and I finally realized somewhere along the way. This game is not at all what I wanted. I hoped and wanted Wo Long to open up more of it's gameplay to reveal itself as Nioh but during Romance of the Three Kingdoms and at no point did I get that. From the demo and trailers I ultimately fooled myself into thinking that I would get a game that resembled Nioh and all I got was basically a Sekiro clone that makes me not want to play Sekiro.

The gameplay itself is fun, and it reminds me of a more streamlined version of Nioh 2 with a parry that makes the combat feel satisfying. Visually the performance issues haven't been a major issue for me, but that can be very hit-or-miss and hardware dependent. 

What I can't excuse is the constant crashing though. The game seems more likely than not to crash during the cutscene after a boss fight, making you refight the boss. I like the game but I'll be putting it down for a few weeks and genuinely can't recommend anyone buy it in this state.

I think a lot of the reviews lay out some very worthy criticisms, most notably the performance issues, the lack of enemy variety and the overall feeling that this game doesn't have the same depth of content as Nioh 2.

The only one of those I feel might be an unfair criticism is that last one. Whilst it is certainly true, Nioh 2 was built off the back of Nioh 1 with a lot of assets and systems being ported entirely from one to the other. That wasn't the case here and so expecting a true sequel level of content just isn't being realistic. 
I should also say that I have run this game at a consistent 60 FPS on a Ryzen 5800X with a 12GB Nvidia 3060 and experienced no slowdown or stuttering at all. The white flash issue that I did encounter has been patched out.

What you get is a tight, enjoyable 'Sekiro-like', but with more RPG elements and player expression opportunities than Sekiro ever had. Additionally, many people may have been put off by the sheer weight and complexity of the number-crunching and theory-crafting on offer in Nioh 2, which isn't going to be as much of a problem in Wo Long.

I would argue that Wo Long is an eminently approachable action game in the Souls-like style that leaves open a lot of room for further development through the 3 DLCs, which if Ninja Theory follow their pattern with Nioh 2, will include entirely new NG+ difficulty levels and loot tiers alongside the additional levels.

I enjoyed my time with the game, but my recommendation to anyone on the fence would be to [u]wait a while for a sale in the summer, sometime after June[/u].

It is fun, the combat system is its heart beat and that alone is enough for me to say its good, that along with the equipment customizing, character building, virtue points, and choosing which wizardry's to use but everything else is kinda meh. I wouldn't say its worth $60, i think $45 would have been a more fair price, atleast with the current optimization.

more in depth info for others who are interested-some spoilers ahead:

Things to note: I never played any of the nioh's, and i am playing using a controller, i did also play through the wo long demo.

The story seems sub par, and not too creative. Evil energy infects your enemies and the world and you gotta get rid of the evil energy. In souls fashion, the story isn't often spoon fed to you and told a lot more through items as well as there is a section in the start menu where you can see the details about every character you meet and enemy you face. Its not the best way to tell a story imo but thats how souls games are. I really hate that your character doesn't ever have a single line of dialogue and you don't really have any dialogue options when doing quests or speaking to npc's, they always result in the one intended outcome. This was definitely one of the weaker points of the game imo.

if you compare this to other souls games, it's probably easier than most, but thats not to say its a walk in the park. I got my ass handed to me by a few bosses, most notably Zhang Liang, Aoye, the first Lu Bu, the 3 followers in the courtyard, zhang liao, the blindfolded boy, maybe died 2-3 times on zhang rang and even died a few times in some stages.

The loot system could also have been a lot better but the game introduces a decent way of getting rid of the clutter through salvaging, and the embedding system is cool too.

if you like pvp, it should be fun, i got invaded a few times and they were fun, very fast paced, high intensity encounters.

The combat in this game absolutely carries it, by far the best part about the game. Mixing martial arts, wizardry spells, deflections, light and heavy attacks, a divine beast option, and deciding how its going to be put together with the points you distributed into your paths and armor you choose is very fun to me personally and if you enjoy that level of customization with a fast paced fighting system that punishes you for getting hit but also rewards you for landing hits i think you will enjoy this game. I like the spirit system, I am however not a fan of the morale system, having to grind to use spells every new stage and when you die to bosses in order to make the fight more fair is annoying, i think the spirit bar alone and difficulty decreasing while still remaining challenging with higher leveling and better gear and virtue choices would have been way better.

Stages could have used a little more thought and time, some stages are literally just a previous stage but backwards where you start at the end of the stage and work back to the beginning with a different boss at the end. There is some enemy variety but not enough, it's just small guard variations, big guard variations, giant gorillas, giant birds, giant tigers, demon mermaids, porcupines, and giant alligators everywhere. 

I like the flag system as a way to encourage you explore, it's also a way to keep morale in check and not be as annoying.

optimization was maybe a 7 out of 10, game crashed a few times, mostly during cinematics, after you beat yu ji's first form theres a cinematic that leads to his second. My game crashed during that cinematic so i had to restart the game and fight him again. Some stages were so bad that in small sections, the game gave off an impression that made me feel like i was trying to play while extremely intoxicated.

If they had spent maybe 3-6 months just adding enemy variety, some better story telling, better optimization on launch, and maybe a better loot/inventory system i think this game would have been in the amazing category. I find it hard to give it a thumbs down because sure, it has its weaknesses but all in all it was fun. 7 out of 10.",1679000102,1679000102,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Also the crafting system was simple to use and to decorate your gear could not be easier. The numerous choice of weapons are nice and all have there own attack animations. Having individualized animations for each weapon is nice but since the attacks took so long to actually hit an enemy I opted out of using most of these weapons. Playing through the levels I would say the game is a lot of fun but that's where it all ends.

Boss fights (after the first one) against demons are so easy its a joke. Fights against humans relied on you waiting for the critical attack to parry in between constant range or close up attacks. Which would not be so bad if your character attacks did not feel so underwhelming and meaningless.  I'm not going to even speak on the boss fights against two or three humans. 

To add icing on the cake, you will need to farm some of these bosses for a hopeful drop of the gear you want. I even took time to watch others stream Wo Long who I would say are more skilled than me and lose constantly due to poor designed boss fights. It appears the idea of difficulty is around throwing numerous attacks at you as the boss fights progress. The last few human boss fights pull every elemental attack out none stop. I did not play the first Nioh but I did play Nioh 2 which I enjoyed immensely. Also I thought Sekiro was quite an adjustment from the normal but fair once you got the hang of it.

Also being able to cancel your attack's animation would be nice since most attacks leave you completely open when a boss decides to do back to back critical attacks. The pvp/invasion system is okay but nothing like FromSoftware games. The story was more of an annoyance at best due to the game just throwing it at you. I just never felt part of the story and no one wants to read numerous paragraphs on every character involved. At the end I would say I'm quite disappointed with this title and have deleted it now.

Boss fights are just pretty bad. The first boss fight was so far easily the most difficult and others after it have been pushovers, except for Lu Bu, who still wasn't as difficult as the first one but was just a terrible and unfun fight in general (Along with buggy). 

If you're going to make a system that supposedly both the player and NPCs have, then at least make the NPCs follow the same rules as the player or the system is completely redundant. (The spirit system) 

What is the point in having well hidden treasure chests that feel rewarding to find or get after winning a fight, only to have them contain a bad 2 or 3 star weapon? I will never understand this. Exploring should be rewarded.

Combat is tight and engaging with a focus on deflecting attacks rather than blocking or evading, which makes the moment to moment gameplay very addictive, all of which presented with some lovely fluid animations. This, combined with a wide array of weapons, spells and martial arts, you'll be spoilt for choice on what to equip.
The story is nothing noteworthy, but as someone who played the old Dynasty Warriors games, it was great to see old favourites of these larger than life characters again like Lu Bu and Guan Yu.
Speaking of, the bosses in this game are quite the spectacle. Managing to land the deflections on their critical attacks and watching a part of them shatter never gets old. However, I feel the challenge overall fell off the further I got into the game, as most bosses went down on my first or second try, with only a few standouts that forced me to learn their patterns and practice their moveset. Which is a shame as when this does happen the game is firing on all cylinders and the fights descend into an incredible flurry of blows.
I do think this issue with difficulty partially stems from a lack of variation, with there being relatively few regular enemies. The result of this is that by the halfway point in the game you've seen most enemies and know their pattern so they pose very little threat and nothing surprises you. This same lack of variation also extends to the fatal strikes you can land (which are satisfying). Regardless of weapon or enemy you are against, the animations are basically all the same. Considering how much work was put into the animation of the characters martial attacks and bosses, I'd really like to have seen the same level of effort extend to this area as it’s a core part of the gameplay.
Final area which has it’s ups and downs is the environments. Wo Long is structured with a level based system and some of these zones do standout. It’s certainly a step up from their previous work. However they still lack atmosphere and character. I can’t see myself remembering many of these locations in the years to come.
Flagged a few negatives here, and I’d argue that Nioh 2 is the better game if you want a taste of Team Ninjas work in the souls-like genre, but Wo Long is still a great game with plenty to enjoy, and I’ll certainly be jumping back in for the DLC later in the year.

Here my humble opinion:

The game was absolutely difficult for me in the beginning, I had never played a game where I was forced to parry and this game does force you to parry in order to beat bosses, it was really frustrating but yeah thank god our brains are so awesome and most people will get better timing after some hours of play, and it will become way much easier, still there will be some awesome and strong bosses like the mighty Lu Bu that forced me to try dozens of times and change my build and do some farming so I could beat him but it was really awesome after I beat him. I would recommend to play the Demo first if available.

Anyway, here are some pros and cons for me:
Pros:
- Nice combat system and gameplay, and the sounds when fighting and blocking are really good.
- you can reset your stats whenever you want to try all elements and spells, that's pretty cool.
- It has some great bosses and fights.
- Gets easier once you get the hang of the parry system.
- if it's too difficult you can practice the parry and level up and it will become very easy (Except for some bosses that required some more concentration)

Cons:
-At least as per March 15, the game is still not fully optimized for PC, it's the only one I have had that much trouble with the FPS; though my pc is not that great(16GB and 1650) I didnt expect to be this game the one that has given me the most FPS drops so far.
- The spirit skill are not that impressive and you use them too little as they charge really slow.
- I Didn't feel like there were too many useful spells and you can only equip 4.
- The different armors are not really relevant, yeah you may need to upgrade them but their adittional stats usually doesnt make much difference, the game morale system and the need to parry red attacks are pretty much what you need to win in this game, this can be a pro for some but for me it's kinda boring that the items are not that relevant, you can basically pass the game with any armor just by upgrading the level and kwowing how to play.
- Story is not too good, I come from Nioh2 and this one felt boring.

It so desperately wants you to parry literally every fucking thing in existence, but guess what, the funny thing is that you cant. You can only parry a single attack per parry.

One thing I find neat is that you can literally use the same weapon you obtain from the start all the way until the end of the game. Unlike Nioh, there is no level or stat requirements for the weapons. It's an interesting take, but it makes the game feel like it lacks a little progression. On the plus side, you don't have to micromanage your gear and make sure you always have the latest and greatest, which got quite tedious in Nioh. If anything, it's more similar to Dark Souls, minus the stat requirements. A strange aspect about the game is that you are not able to swap out skills for the weapons. It feels a little detrimental to have to have to farm for the weapon just to get the skills you want on them. The Wizardry Spell progression feels ""too easy"" and shallow. Coming from Nioh, which had a more robust skill tree for Onmyoji Spells and also skill progression and familiarity with weapons, it kind of feels like a step back. However, I don't necessarily feel like this is a bad thing, as From Soft, made an even simpler game than the souls games, (fyi Sekiro), but the parry mechanics made the game feel rather satisfying and their game was hugely successful. I feel that the same can be said of Wo Long. One thing I will gripe about is that Wo Long uses the same animation every time for the deflect and the critical counter, whereas Sekiro mixed it up a little. Nevertheless, it is still a rewarding style of gameplay. One thing I will say about this game is, as a person who played Dynasty Warriors parts 3-8, I will have to say that it makes me happy to see the characters re-imagined in an alternate story. My biggest disdain is that for some reason, at least so far in the game for me, it seems they don't have my favorite character in the game: Taishi Ci. It's rather upsetting because in some of the Warrior games, Taishi Ci was held on equal regard to Lu Bu, so it makes me sad that it seems he does not exist in this game. I'm crossing my fingers and hoping he shows up in the potential DLC. Regarding the feeling of the game being ""incomplete,"" perhaps it feels this way because Koei intends to use DLC to expand on the story, similar to the Nioh games? Regarding the desync issue, as long as you play at 60 FPS, the desync issue is non-existent. My brother and I have been able to play the game in coop flawlessly after limiting our FPS to 60.

Nioh is, in my opinion, the best modern day franchise, and Wo Long separates itself enough from that to feel fresh and still rewarding. There's a lot of back and forth about whether the game is easy or hard, and I think what it boils down to is your ability to utilize all of the tools the game gives you. 

Just waiting for Red Parries is stupid, you can do a lot of damage in between combo hits, plus blocking can be cancelled into attacks or parries so using it a lot is helpful. Once you understand the magic system, it becomes very free-flowing and satisfying to land chunky hits + negative effects on the enemy. Pair that with martial arts that actually help your case and you've got an incredibly fun gameplay experience.

I've seen complaints about the story, but I actually grew attached to several of the characters and the story beats. It's not overly complex in message or anything, but it makes you appreciate the world you're inhabiting and what peoples' motivations are once revealed. 

The music is nothing to write home about, especially since it reuses songs in every level which was a bit of a letdown. The sound design otherwise is top notch, with attacks feeling heavy when they need to, deflects having satisfying crunch, and enemy notifications making it clear what's happening around you. The one issue I have in the sound department is that a mid-fight conversation might start between the allied NPC's and the boss, and they quiet down the rest of the fight, so it can be a bit jarring and you miss a few audio cues.

All in all, I don't see this game as a replacement for Nioh, but as a companion piece. The gameplay far exceeds souls games in term of complexity and fun levels. There's no stamina to manage (which is awesome), but the game does punish you for going too crazy all the time. I'm very disappointed in the launch for this game, but I hope Team Ninja continues to focus on making games that are actually fun compared to all of the other boring uninspired garbage out there.",1678846523,1678846523,True,0,0,0.464135020971298218,0,True,False,False

You'll be fighting a LOT of the same stuff most of the time (I didn't mind, but that's maybe because I like the DW series and the combat feels similar to the series).

It feels like for every step forward the devs were trying to make with this game, they also made a step backwards, or at the very least in some unspecified direction that's not forward, and often for no apparent reason. This coupled with the technical issues plaguing the game made for a rather disappointing experience that took me almost all the way until the end of my first playthrough to actually find the merit and footing in.

Let's start with the core gameplay. It should be fairly obvious to anyone who spent at least an hour in this game that this game is Team Ninja's attempt to merge Nioh with elements of Sekiro. The deflects system was basically copied from there; the spirit gauge is actually an interesting, enhanced spin on the posture gauge, and there's a significant emphasis on utilizing them, along with sneaking around and assassinating enemies from behind, to progress through missions. The issue is with the implementation - in Wo Long, deflecting doesn't work as well as in Sekiro, because the animations are faster and unfortunately more janky, so you have to rely more on guessing/predicting and luck than actual reactions. The fact that deflecting is tied to the dodge button instead of block doesn't help either, and I realize this was probably done this way to discourage spam tapping the button (repeated dodging costs resources, but repetitively raising your guard doesn't) to luck out on deflects, but in that case, they should have just made a separate key bind for deflecting (or maybe at the very least tie deflecting to pressing block and dodge buttons at the same time). And then, there are also issues with incosistent framerate and 1-second stutters which could really throw you off in a crucial moment. The potential was there, but the execution left much to be desired.

Next, the story. Or more specifically, its presentation. Unless you're a fan of the source material/its myriad other adaptations, or have no issue with slogging through tons of glossary text, you're most likely just gonna be frustrated with the story. I'm of the latter category - this was my first contact with Romance of the Three Kingdoms, and I was actually decently curious to get to know it - Nioh was also my first contact with the Sengoku period, but I got hooked enough to start reading up on the characters and events in the in-game glossary. But even on this front Wo Long messed it up - the glossary text window is so short it has to scroll through its contents, but so wide that the lines disappear before you're finished reading through them, making catching up on lore a torture. Because the actual in-game storytelling is done in the typical Team Ninja fashion - incoherent, jarring mess. There are at least 3 cutscenes for every main mission, and they still do a terrible job of helping you remember who's who. The fact that there are so many similar sounding Chinese names doesn't help either, although this is probably more personal and not a factor for everyone, and also not something that can really be helped.

When it comes to customization, Wo Long uses Team Ninja's trademark hack'n'slash approach to loot, meaning you get hundreds of it. Your opinion of it is largely a matter of preference - you can like it for the amount of options you're given, or hate it because of how overwhelming it can become. I would say that Wo Long is still a lot more tame in this department compared to previous TN games. There are only 5 base stats to increase when leveling up, there is no real talent tree, you can only use 2 types of basic attacks and 2 weapon skills, and magic is no longer a separate build option, but rather another core gameplay element. This is all probably because the main gameplay loop is a lot more streamlined in WL, so there's naturally fewer customization options so as not throw the game balance entirely out of whack, but you still can't help but feel like this is just kinda lackluster. Although I've still yet to make any effort towards making something resembling a coherent build for NG+ (I finished all main and side missions with armor I got after the very first mission, and I didn't even bother to upgrade it), so hopefully it gets more interesting in endgame, where TN games always shine the most anyway.

Still, getting to said endgame just... didn't really feel satisfying. The game uses a morale system, which is basically a separate ""leveling"" system where a unit's morale rank influences how much damage they deal and take. Morale progress is also isolated between all missions. This means that because every mission you have to increase your morale rank to keep up with enemies, and due to lackluster character customization, I hardly ever felt like leveling up my stats or upgrading my weapons actually made me stronger. This is probably supposed to make it feel more rewarding when you get better at fight mechanics, but honestly, the main gameplay loop lacks enough depth and visual feedback for it to feel sufficiently satisfying for the entire game.

I'm also baffled at some of the decisions TN still makes for their games. For example, the 1vx miniboss fights in some side missions - I just can't find any excuse for these to be placed in this game. They were bad in Nioh 1, got a bit better in Nioh 2, and in Wo Long they just got even worse. One mission pits you against 3 human minibosses, who just pummel you relentlessly without any openings to counterattack. If you run, they have ranged attacks. If you try to turn on them, your target blocks/runs away while the other 2 whale on you. If you just block, your spirit gets drained very quickly - you have to deflect too, but it's not as simple when you're being whacked from 3 directions. So your most realistic course of action is to wait until one of them does a critical strike, but you still need luck to capitalize on it - if you deflect it while locked on to someone else, you most likely won't change your target in time to do any meaningful counterattack. If you manage to kill one of them, the fight does become significantly easier, but there's still no good, consistent way about making it happen. And it's not even some endgame side mission - you unlock it fairly early, so it isn't one of these missions that you're supposed to cheese with your OP build.

There's also a bunch of other QoL annoyances that I don't really know why they made it to the game, because they used to work better in previous games and here they were just unnecessary changes:

-There's no gear comparison. When hovering over an unequipped gear piece, it only gives you the equipped gear's numerical values for comparison; for scaling bonuses there's only a higher-lower indicator, and for special effects there's nothing.
-You can only access the storehouse at the blacksmith. I don't know if that means that any loot you can't pick up due to inventory limit is just lost, as I haven't tested it, but it's still annoying that there's no easier access to the storehouse.
-When slow walking, you can't step off ledges. I guess I can see the intention behind it, but to me it just makes it difficult to sneak through a section with ledges, becuse it forces you to jump and potentially make too much noise.
-Lock-on can be frustrating to deal with. It can lock to a wrong target and then just refuse to switch.
-Some stuff I mentioned earlier, like the inconveniently sized text windows in the glossary.

In summary: if you're a fan of TN games, you might like this game, but be prepared for slow beginnings. If not a fan, this game will NOT change your mind. If you're unfamiliar - just try Nioh 2.",1678832168,1678832168,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Lots of focus is on parrying, so this is going to feel very much like Sekiro. The story is whatever but who cares, right? You do a lot of cinematic anime jumping up in the air and launching an air dive with your weapon when you can get enough parries in on an enemy or boss. So that's neat for hyper-stylizing anime points.

The areas are similar to Nioh games in that they aren't too memorable unlike how From Software can craft pretty unique areas, buildings, and environments. But again, for people like me who are in it for the combat, who cares?

This had a bad launch on PC and while it has been patched, I still had some small lagging moments after encountering a new area in a level almost every time. It wasn't enough for me to get upset, but it was a little annoying seeing how the PS5 version (or the demo I played on PS5 anyway) ran smooth as butter with no stuttering at all. But it is what it is. I like to think I'm pretty tolerant as I have just dragged down the story, the level design, and the performance in Wo Long but ultimately it is an enjoyable experience because it all boils down to the combat. And Team Ninja really nailed that once again. Super fast flowing strikes with swords and parries. Parries, parries, parries.

Got attacked by some guys with pee soaked scarves on their head. Only had a sword in my hand and had to stab them. It was self defense. Even the blind boy could see that. Wait, why is he following me? He gave me some healing potions that seem to refill every time I touch a flag. This world is weird and feels like it's gonna be a dark no-harem isekai this time.

[b]Day 69.[/b] These first couple months have sucked. I can't speak any form of Chinese and really regretting not starting that Udemy course I bought on discount recently. I've nodded, smiled, grunted, and screamed my way through all of my exchanges so far. I met a cool man that rides a horse like a skateboard. I met a blacksmith with amazing abs that fortified my equipment. And a young woman has been following me around for weeks that smells like a mix of boar poop and an uncleaned bird cage. She's trying to teach me magic. The most I can do is squeeze out a poisonous bubble from my hand or shove a small stalagmite into someone's groin. I still haven't figured out the timing to do this during combat or don't have the energy to spare after my heavy attacks.

I've come across about 14 different types of weapons so far. I got a basic attack combo in my mind for each of them that help me build momentum, two heavier attacks, some Martial Arts moves I've seen others do that either hit harder or just look cool, and some jumping attacks. Sometimes I'm able to jump down on enemy's shoulders and crush their head with my spear. Other times, I just land next to them or behind them with my spear hitting the ground. And understandably so, they're very angry and want to fight. Often times I just guard against their attacks, wait for them to stop and start with my own basic combo. Other times, I see them glow red and I know I can't block those. I've been able to deflect some of them, causing them to lose balance and gaining some momentum for myself. But more often than not, they knock my butt down and they snark a bit. I'm feeling pretty demoralized, my attacks aren't as strong, and getting hurt a little more than before when the enemy lands an attack. But sometimes I feel the flow, where I'm doing my basic attacks, follow-up with a heavy attack, enemy glows red and I deflect with my other weapon, followup with that weapon's attacks, perform Martial Arts, gain the advantage and deliver a fatal blow in one fluid transaction. I think it can be described as... satisfying.

Also, I can call this spirit animal forth now that will shove stalagmites up everyone's butt (except mine), it's pretty effective.

[b]Day 2201[/b]. I fought a man that drives stick shift on his horse. My allies retreated at the beginning of the fight. And if ever I knocked the man off his horse, his horse would patrol the arena and try to run me over. The only advantage I had was this bullet time mode that seemed to happen when his halberds caught on fire. And I thought myself a deflecting genius and I thought I heard my opponent express in disbelief of how I deflected all of this. In general, I've noticed that I go into bullet time or see the world in this filter like a PowerPoint slideshow when too much is happening, usually once flames are on the ground, when I'm near a body of water, fog, or on stormy days with a lot of lightning. This reminds me of my computer. It's an older computer, but it gets the job done sometimes - but it's time for a new one. 

[b]Day 5886[/b]. So... a lot has happened. I've seen so many spirit animals showing me flashbacks of people's lives. I know they're important if I get the flashback, but man - I feel like I've picked a fight with all of them at this point. I think there is some peace in the land, for now. Across the years I also inexplicably blacked out 10 or so times. One time during an opponent's speech, they probably weren't happy with that - but everyone was more than happy to take their places and repeat the scene. The isekai experience can be unstable, but perhaps the isekai gods will smooth things out for future travelers. I've the opportunity to relive my isekai experience again with greater challenges or address several unfinished requests from the residents, but I see the gateway leading back to modern day. So I'll take it.

[b]Modern Day Earth, within 24 hours of return[/b]. Found out I never actually bought the Udemy course when it was on sale and now it's full priced, so learning Mandarin may have to wait... again. Fought against a cat that tried to take down the Texas magnet from the fridge. Left an unpolished fanfic review on Steam. Impatiently waiting for someone to make Bromance of the Three Kingdoms.

Edit: Minor clarifications: If you aren't sure about the game, the demo should still be available to give you a pretty good taste of it and troubleshoot.

previous experience including Nioh2, dark soul3, sekiro and elden ring. (all 100% achievement)

so, here is my conclusion if you are in a hurry, if you never tried any of these games, and wish to have a taste of ACT/ARPG ""souls like"", then my suggestion is that you try the above games out. At the current stage, wo long is by far the worst ACT/ARPG among them. And no, this is not just about the PC platform framing problem or the keyboard binding problem others talk about, but the whole design of the game reflect the laziness of team Ninja (the developer)

the last game they published was nioh2, and make no mistake I love that game, though it has many flaws as well, but it gives about 150 hours of content in the first play through, while you have over 12 weapons with totally different move sets to play with, and over 30 to 40 maps for main quest and side quest,and at least over like 60 kind of enemies.

for wolong, all the maps of the side quest is reused from main quest-- yes, they didn't make any maps additionally for side quests, and  that locked the map amount around 20, so is the enemy types -- the smallest amount in amy game i've ever played.  

for the weapons, all types have a unique set of light and heavy attacks - but they share very small difference only between some weapons - such as duel sword duel knife and duel axes, and most skills (special move sets) is available for all similar weapons -- that reduced the total weapon move sets to like around half a doze, again the lowest amount I've ever seen.

as to the boss fight, the experience is greatly volatile. Some of them are really good (most of these boss shown up in the mid game), some of them are bit boring, and some of them are just pure disaster (mostly in the late game, the last 4 main bosses is like the worst boss fight in the game), this is not about difficulty but rather about interaction between the player and the boss, the game play with those mid game boss shares a quick offense/defense transformation and it fells good even with the time you lose to them. But for the later bosses its more like ""your show the whole time"" or ""the boss's turn all the time while you wonder if it ever ends"", some of them are easy some of them are hard, but none of them are fun.

And the last thing I'd like to point out is that team Ninja didn't really correct the mistakes they made in Nioh2, the map is still a disaster, full of reused material and made I wonder why they design it this way. And there are still multi boss fight. In one of side quest you fight 3 boss at the same time,  at that moment I seriously wonder if the developer of that fight has any game development experience or play that quest himself.

So this is what I fell about this game, the maps are too few, the enemy  type is too few, the move sets are too few,  and I don't think the game went through enough quality test before releasing, all of this signs of laziness. The fair price for this game should be around 25% of its current price. For now, if you want to try ACT/ARPG, Nioh2, dark soul3, sekiro and elden ring are all better than wolong, don't waste your money here like I did.",1678726250,1678726250,False,1,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Great game for sure, but they do seem to have cut some corners. A lot of (pre) 3 kingdoms things that they skipped over. It really could've been better.
Still, I highly recommend it. Even if you couldn't get into Nioh, Wo Long has more simplistic combat and as such is much easier to get into.

So yeah, I recommend it very much. Still though, there are a few flies in the ointment, so I'm gonna elaborate on all of that stuff.

Oh, one more thing: the character creation is [i]amazing[/i]. I mean, Nioh 2 already set the expectations high regarding the achievable girltwink heroes (and apparently your bears and butches too, but I know what I want to be in a game, okay?), but this one was [i]fantastic[/i]. This game might give me an eating disorder 😱 (not really, please don't send me automated mental health check-ins). I really wish Dark Souls/Elden Ring gave us that level of customization, and the glamour system. Yes, I know DS reasoning for not doing that, I don't care. Let me be the inexplicably tanky girltwink.

Now, to the bad things.

Apparently KB&M controls are not as good as you might expect. I wouldn't know, but there are reasons to prefer that. I'd consider this the biggest issue, as it might be a proper dealbreaker for some people, especially if you either don't have or can't use a controller.

Performance is fine 99% of the time, but there are spots where it unexpectedly drops visibly. It's never a big issue, though, seems to pass almost immediately. Note that I have the RTX3060, a reasonably chonky CPU and an almost comical amount of RAM - but considering this is mostly a GPU game, and it's not even a TI over here. I'm pretty sure it counts as ""mid"" over here in 2023. Slowdowns seem like they're caused by some local anomalies in geometry/effects optimization, rather than the game being overall too complex.

Also, because this gets people: this isn't actually a soulslike, but gaidenlike (apparently, never played Ninja Gaiden myself, but the style [i]apparently[/i] stems from that game). So while there is an important parry mechanic and a ""dodge,"" expect a much more aggressive combat style than in Souls games. I think it still scratches the same itch, but for some people this makes a big difference, for either better or worse.

Network coop is fun, but tends to make bosses a bit too easy. Sometimes curbstomping a giant angry boar is exactly what you need in your life, though. 

Sadly network PvP is completely broken, and no, I don't mean it's incredibly hard or ""oh no invasions"" (you can easily disable them). I mean I haven't had an invasion where the result would be in any way decided by skill - and I don't mean ""oh no I lost."" I ""won"" every time, and by ""won"" I mean ""the invader lost all motivation and found the nearest fire to go and stand in while waving and/or making sad gestures."" There weren't many of those either, unsurprisingly.

PvP netcode in a game as reflex-oriented as this is hard to make, it's not really a surprise, especially with me being a host - if I see the invader rubberband all over the place, I can't even begin to imagine their side. This is a shame - I can imagine it being a lot of fun, even if my experience would be, most likely, getting curbstomped all over the place by butches. Look, my switchy self is stuck always being a top in real life, at least let me get smashed in a game, okay?",1678292858,1678714525,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In terms of difficulty, I'll say that this game is already refined for the majority of players. If you can play other Souls-Like games, you can absolutely play this one.

The gameplay is kinda okay-ish with some questionable features that make my playthrough a bit frustrating. The combat system and spell are bland and not much to play around with. The level design is mediocre and the world is not really worth exploring (at all) unless you want 100% achievement.

The storytelling is honestly bad (and will be especially bad if you are not accustomed to the Dynasty Warriors storytelling style). If you had no background on the 3 kingdoms before, you would not be able to follow most of the stories, and even if you had, it is still bad. The game feels like it wants to compete with Fromsoft's passive storytelling, but they fail hard on that, resulting in a half-ass storytelling that lacks continuity and immersion. 

The endgame content unlocks hard mode with rarer gear drop from enemies, which is totally RNGesus and requires grinding, which sucks real bad for me. Basically you go into hard mode, farm more gears, build your gear stat and effects, and play the hard mode, which is the improved version of enemies' stats and AI.

Again, playable and a decent game overall if you want to just play some casual Souls-Like game for some fun, but would not recommend playing 100% or any of the endgame contents at all, unless you really like grinding in this kind of game.

Like many has said, me included, it's not a bad game. The god awful launch made the technical issues more frustrating than the gameplay itself.

Patch 1.03 fixed a lot of things, though not everything. The game still crashes at random. I've also noticed that for some reason, the game hates USB hardware. At complete random times, it will reboot whatever is using USB. It's been happening to not only my Logitech hardware, but also my wireless controller. This only happens when I play Wo Long.

There's a lot of re-used assets from the Nioh games. This is evident in late game. Had this been a spin-off to Nioh, I could forgive it. But since this is a new IP, it just look lazy. 

Speaking of lazy. Some body armors are - visually - exclusive to males. Playing as female and maybe you want to look cool with that one armor that you just found; Nah fam, you'll look like a dude.

I can't hate the game too much. I am enjoying it.
Like I mentioned in my original review, this game feel like whoever is in charge at Team Ninja wanted to copy From Software and them giving Dark Souls a break to make Sekiro instead.

I'm on the fence about recommending it. I don't hate the game, but in good conscience I simply cannot recommend it at full price. If you really want to play it, wait for a sale. Or just grab yourself a Game Pass.",1677845689,1678682938,False,0,0,0.527353942394256592,0,True,False,False

Why do i say mostly? Besides those 3 or 4 secondary missions to the side when reaching the end game you unlock dragon difficulty and that basically makes the game ultra hard but extra better and unique loot that i have yet to explore those maps as well, however i do think since i beat the core game and seeing how much i've played i think its worth a review so here it goes. 

Pros:
To begin the graphics are slightly better than nioh 2's, not too greater but its still a bit noticable sometimes. Some sections although admittedly are worse than nioh 2's but mostly overall its a little step above not a whole step but a step regardless. But team ninja was never known for its graphical amazement, its always been the gameplay. To summarize the gameplay think of the deflection of Sekiro meets a more standardized heavy feel of nioh with a simplistic system that is easier to understand. They tried to do something different, yeah some may not like it but me personally i do enjoy its fresh take on both systems being mixed together. Not once did i feel like the combat was the fault of any of my errors as i felt like the way they implemented the combat was easy to understand and a good mix between fast and carefully planned; giving players the choice of strategy and fast action at the same time. This was very similar to bloodborne in my opinion, you could combo someone but in the end you had to have a plan thought out otherwise you would panic and die. The learning process wasn't as hard and the learning curve wasn't that deep either in comparison to other soulslike games but that is what could make it more enjoyable for you if you thought the other games in the series was a bit too rough sometimes; for example i beat the last boss in one try, although a very fun fight still. 

But enough of the combat and graphics, what about the system at its core? The magical abilities although not as strong in the beginning really shines true near the end game as at that point your build you've been creating this whole time finally shows its true potential. Some enemies are strong against some elements and some are weaker than usual to that element but in the end you'll have to pick one or two element(s) to master which makes the game very interesting. You could ultimately pick one element to master thus making it a powerhouse or dual two elements but not as strong as if you would've mastered one, however you'll have more utility and mix up regarding properties and the so forth. Logically speaking you could pick multiple elemental magics to use as well, this was shown when a youtuber released a video that showed you could replicate nioh's debuff spam in this game as well, but its not required at all and is up to your personal preference to how you'd like to play. This brings me to online . . . 

Pvp / or invading is a thing brought by dark souls and is in the game, is it good though? yes, when stable connection is made otherwise its a mess. Depending on your internet and the internet or region of the other person youre invading it could be fun but sometimes its not and people teleport around. But overall the pvp is great and makes it thrilling, for coop its amazing as well, the emotes you can share and spam with others is funny and a good touch brought back from the nioh series. 

The story, although a slow burn it makes up for it with twists and turns and you almost feel sad about some characters nearing the end and the cause your character fights for you can feel. Is it the best story ever? nah but nioh didnt have a good story either its a souls game after all and its not about the story its ultimately the gameplay. And with gameplay and with all souls games comes with weapons, the variety with them is pretty great, alongside its unique properties for each and every weapon. I've seen people say things like ''just pressing one button'', please dont listen to them as they've probably never left the tutorial map. Every weapon has a light, heavy, two unique skills, running attack, and jumping attack for both light and heavy versions; you can also chain these in any pattern you'd like. Discovering unique weapons and with their own properties and character was fun to find and even more fun finding rare weapons and seeing their own unique skills and properties. Is there fashion souls though? yes, so many combinations of unique armor and robes and heavy armors or light or even none its all there and it makes it easier when you can transform any piece into your liking. 

But heres some small details that i feel was much needed from previous games that are also pros:
- Less screen clutter
- Better character customization
- Better music 
- Handles its theme better 
- Better loot organization 
- More badass moments


Cons:
Enemy variety wasn't much, you'll often see the same enemies over again but sometimes once in a while you'll encounter something new but not that often. I do think they balance this well though with npc enemies being so unique but its still not enough, once you've defeated your 20th tiger you'll understand that perhaps they could've made at least 3 more enemies but its not that huge of a deal either. Some bosses are just reused regular enemies, granted this is worse in secondary missions but its still a thing in main missions and if it was only in secondary missions i could excuse it but its in the main section of the game and thats just sad to see. The maps are oddly empty sometimes and bloated with open areas, i could recall at least 5 or 6 times i'd look at a big empty room with one chest in the middle of it and say ''the floor is gonna fall'' or ''someone is gonna fall from the ceiling'' or i would find a huge open corner of the map and say ''theres people in the bushes'' but no. All of these examples i thought would happen didnt, and it really taught me that when i saw loot, it was literally just free loot and its just kinda weird to just walk calmly to a open area they could've put a surprise in but end up just saying oh thanks i guess. Granted, near the end game they picked this surprise up so dont think the entire game is without surprises, just look around some corners because they really like to put things around corners like ALOT near the end game. Weapon rarity is very rng, the loot rarity goes up to 1 star to 5 stars and throughout the game its almost like they have no clue what to give you. Even in the end game you still get 2 star or 1 star weapons or armor which makes them completely useless, even after a hard fought boss battle your reward could be a 2 star spear or sword, why ... its very annoying because then you may have to try it again if you want a better rarity but even a better rarity the second time aint a guarantee either. 

Heres some small cons:
- Fps drops when loading in heavy assets 
- Crashes from cutscenes are still a thing after patches
- No accessory customization for optimal builds
- Some Npcs suddenly drop out of the overall plot
- Middle-aged gold diggin woman npc has yet to find her pretend husband

Overall i'd pretty much give this game a 9/10 with DLC if it still has the cons, 10/10 if all or most of the cons are fixed with DLC, but right now its a . . .

- Online experience is totally ****ed if you play the game in 120fps mode. 
- Some obvious QoL features, even have been in their own game like Nioh 2, are not present. E.g. the ability to go back to the MAP after beating a level. 
- The optimization is completely unacceptable. This level of graphics should be capped flawlessly at 120fps on a PC with RTX3090, Ryzen 9 5950x, and 128GB of RAM. instead, it runs with significant stuttering
- The variety of mobs are atrocious, there are probably more types of bosses than mobs. 
- The spell system is mostly irrelevant unless you invest fully into it, at which point you become a glass cannon and get killed instantly by the camper mobs
- The stealth system is pointless, with 20 skill points into the element that contributes stealth, you get spotted by mobs in 0.2 seconds as soon as you enter their field of view.

5/10 - Base Game as of 03/12/2023

5/10 - Story (Neutral, I've seen enough 3 kingdoms from Koei to know and expect; casuals can safely ignore the game story and not miss a beat.).
3/10 - UI/UX, if you thought inventory management in Nioh 2 was bad, Wo Long is even [i]worse[/i].
10/10 character creation - I found the updated character creation to be more entertaining than about 70% of the game.

Now about Wo Long... I will compare it to Koei-Tecmo/Team-Ninja's most recent success, Nioh 2.

[b][u]Combat[/u][/b]
This game is NOT Nioh 2, you won't have numerous builds and options for beating enemies and toughies. You parry or you die - spells and buffs merely cover bits of your mistakes on those parry timings (reduced attack, improve defense, life-on-hit). Said buffs can also be easily removed by opposing elements dealt by enemies.

There is also no animation cancelling. Your attacks chain are executed until you're hit or done. Meaning you should avoid long-ass animated attack weapons (such as the spear). The spear is absolutely [i]garbage[/i] so far in my experience because of said attack chain and no animation canceling.

The staff and dual wield weapons are overwhelming superior to every weapon simply because of the combat mechanics in place - they hit fast and they recover fast, minimizing the window in which you are left defenseless and maximizing your ability to interrupt enemy attacks.
""Martial Arts"" so far are very underwhelming, but that could change depending on how endgame builds goes; but said martial arts are also RNG skills attached to weapons... 
You can't learn new martial arts outside of what the weapon provides which are randomly selected up to 2 (wtf?). Just like normal attacks, your martial arts can also be interrupted mid-attack and take even more damage; which is VERY brutal when a red critical attack hits you...

Hope you guys enjoyed QTE games all these years past, because this game is literally pressing 1 button for that dopamine hit and most other things in the game is purely decorative.

Now about the common enemies you face... All of them have the same model and animations with different colors. You may become tired (as I did) of not seeing anything new after mid-game. (In Nioh 2, human enemies can come at you with 11 possible melee weapon types and demon types are varied enough to keep it interesting).

[i]Note: For the boss fights, I have always engaged them at morale level 20 at least as the game intended.[/i]

Now the boss fights... 

The very first boss is stupidly tuned to keep out at least 20% of the players who bought the game in an effort by the game to pound the ""parry-system mechanics"" into the player. Hopefully most said players didn't break the refund period. Also helpers cannot be summoned on the first mission - so have that refund ready if you can't play the game. (In Nioh 2, help can called from start to finish).

Literally the following bosses after the first boss were cakewalk and one-tried until Chapter 3 for me. [spoiler]Dong Zhuo and Lu Bu[/spoiler]

The difficulty spikes is annoyingly inconsistent, because I had no issues with some bosses in-between while some were overwhelmingly difficult. [spoiler](Zhang Liao, Lu Bu part 2,  Xiahou Dun).[/spoiler]
In the 2nd-to-last mission, all 3 bosses were stupidly easy compared to what came before that I only died once before finishing it.

I got tired of dealing with some of the BS and repetitiveness that I ended up summoning help for some of the bosses. (Nioh 2 would allow for ninja glass cannons, magic for easy mode, and even yokai shift builds for endgame if weapon smashing isn't doing it for you).

[b][u]UI/UX (User Interface and User Experience)[/u][/b]
Dumbed down weapon skills; There are no weapon skills to choose; those skills are determined by RNG on the weapon (lol). See the ""Martial Arts"" above about their relative effectiveness.

Items are sorted by ""time obtained"" by default and the game can't remember to sort by rarity nor enhancement levels.

So the completionist in me wants to go back and replay a few missions to collect stuff I missed. But there are no trackers on what I missed (Golden Cicadas, iron-eating pandas). Also, morale flags [i]must be recollected[/i] from 0... WTF? There goes that replay value.

After every mission, you're forced to choose to select repeat mission, base camp or next mission. Which for some users, reportedly takes 2+ minutes or simply crash to load in the worst case. Why can't we just return to the mission selection/world map? 

Blacksmith is only accessible at the base camp. You can only lock specified items from changes at the blacksmith rather than in the inventory. Storehouse is only accessible at the Blacksmith. Arrows/munitions do not auto resupply during mission. Why do we have arrows in storage for if not to reload? Why can't we have the blacksmith be menu accessed from the world map?

Transmog/gear restyling is only available at the blacksmith and... there is amazingly, [i]no preview[/i]!

Those aforementioned issues were not in Nioh 2.

But the issues held over from Nioh 2 still exists (no grouping, shoddy filtering; meaning you can't filter items by gear set, etc.).

[b][u]Character Creation[/u][/b]
If Nioh 2 was about making a waifu and getting good to kill demons, this game is about making a waifu that can't be touched cause getting touched by the red hand is death (at low morale).

Edit: 3/12/2023 - So, I tried replaying some missions to collect items I've missed the first time around. Found out flags have to be recollected (or you get demolished by trash mobs trying to run through it). There are no trackers on missed iron-eating pandas, no tracker on missing golden cicadas... fml, the replay value is practically destroyed for me.

EDIT: 03/11/2023 - Base game main story missions complete. May update review for ""complete"" edition with the DLCs in the future... If my attention can be held.

EDIT: 03/08/2023 version 1.03 is up, keyboard complaint is gone - for now. will update the review again in the future.

why the fuck would you take my stats away at the beginning of each stage? what was the point of playing the game and grinding for those stats? just a complete lack of foresight here

boring, repetitive combat. boring repetitive environments. the levels are labyrinthine and dont feel fun or easy to traverse. 

the game boils down to wait, parry. wait, parry. wait, parry. the game forces you to rely on the parry mechanic to do any meaningful damage to anything, especially if you do not have morale. if you do not, you will be chipping away at enemies and bosses health for an eternity.

also the story is pretty inaccessible unless you know about the romance of the three kingdoms story, which i did not, so its hard to connect to it and remember the countless unique chinese names associated with the story. it felt like the first time i read dostoyevskys the idiot, basically a huge list of names to memorize. god help you if you put the dialogue in english, it is horrendous, just the worst tropey anime style youve ever heard. your character does not play a meaningful role in the story as they are an insert, so you serve the valorous heroes of chinese legend by....clearing the battlefields of annoying tiger enemies and exploding porcupines and shit....

in short, this game does not give you a choice of playstyle. you can make your character and build unique, but at the end of the day you are playing parry: the game

The graphics are alright, the game play is a underwhelming, the story is absolute garbage. 

Some points that annoyed me: 
- the difficulty was wildly inconsistent. I first tried most of the bosses, except three which were irritating.
- The game crashes during cutscenes, to add to that  it plays cutscenes after bosses and when it crashes you have to re-fight the boss. This happened 12 times during my playthrough. 2 of which were against the final boss, I had to kill him 3 times.
- The loot pileup was excessive and weird, like why so much? 
- The multi-player was barely there. I don't know what servers they are using but every invasions was just a test of who's lag was worse.
- The story made no sense. Every character was written to be loyal, brave and brain dead.

But I loved the build aspect of it which allowed for very high replayability. So when Wo Long came out and I played the demo I immediately fell in love. Because it has the quick and engaging gameplay I love while keeping the flexible build aspect I like in some RPGs. And of course me also being a big Dynasty Warriors fan, the story revolving around Romance of the Three Kingdoms with a unique take makes even the story fun for seeing characters I grew up with and love in this new style.

The difficulty of the game is also something I really like as well because I will always feel like i die due to my own mistakes and I find boss fights much more fun than in Fromsoft games where bosses feel more tedious (probably, because it's just dodge simulator). Add that to the impactful, deep, fast paced, and fun combat and I can see myself enjoying this game much more than any FromSoft game. 

Also the game looking amazing, even on, lower end graphic cards is a huge plus. (RTX 1060ti, here) So many games coming out bringing out the age of my GPU but Wo Long still looks impressive even when the graphics aren't maxed out. Not to mention it's beautiful character customization (not surprised since this is a Team Ninja game). If you want to make a beautiful character you actually can.

The game crashed in the wizardy selection screen.  I hear there are a lot of video caused crashes and that would make sense because it was showing one of the spell preview videos when it happened.  It also does not save your key bindings.  I have to reset them at every launch.  Pretty annoying but not game breaking.

Gameplay feels fun so far.  I am of course banging my head against beating the tutorial boss right now which is a little less fun but that's how team ninja games are.  I played their ninja gaiden back in the day and the first boss there was ridiculous.. until you finally beat him and realized he wasn't that hard after all.

Haven't experienced much of the story but the first couple videos haven't kept my interest at all.  But I'm pretty sure like nobody plays these games for the story so that doesn't affect me much.

Performance wise, playing on high everything on a 2070 RTX/threadripper (although in a vm in linux so it only gets a 6 of the cores) and I have it locked at 60 fps and never really feel it stutter or slow down.  It does bug me that it doesn't support ultrawide but I dealt with it in elden ring so whatevs.

No opinion on co-op or pvp since I turned that off and have no intention of online play.. I always hate online play in souls like games.

Don't have much of a review yet but wanted to get this out there to offset the negative reviews that were based on pc camera controls (which was a big deal, but is fixed now).

EDIT: No sooner had I posted my review with the key binding bug and it seems fixed today.  My guess is my annoyance last night with the first boss and I alt+f4'd before bed rather than exiting via the menu .. and maybe that saved it lol.

It has the same issues as Nioh,  and the stages are somewhat lacking. Fighting multiple elite mobs is not fun, and I wish the game were designed more around the new combat, as opposed to a similar game to what they have made before with a brand new combat system. Had the game and combat worked together this game could have been something special.

The boss fights are incredible, anyone who leaves reviews about the game's difficulty, reaction time, or bosses being bullshit, is just refusing to learn a new combat system, spam deflecting, and not watching the opponent. This game functions much like a fighting game in that aspect, and you have to be paying attention; not going for punishes with normals, but instead deflecting and building the new ""spirit"". Heavy builds feel pretty bad (or maybe I haven't found a playstyle that works yet) but fast weapons such as spears, sabers, and duel weapons feel smooth as fuk. Once you have learned the new combat you feel like a literal god and the game (in my opinion) is the easiest in the category, much much easier than nioh, and even easier than elden ring.

The lighting general, people who have played will realize who I am talking about, is one of my favorite bosses across any of the genre from nioh to sekiro to soulsborne. Him and Lu Bu were so much fun to fight.

Combat is just OK. Parrying feels good, except when it doesn't work. Combat with multiple enemies is miserable, worse than Nioh.

No exit to desktop option. 
Wizardry/5 elements system is... really bad. Most spells are not worth casting. Only four slots for spells combined with the stat requirements for using them results in a rock/paper/scissors element system that is more of an annoyance than anything you can deliberately engage with. 
Very little character building, even with the equipment system from Nioh clumsily bolted on in a modified fashion.

1. Every enemy has hyper armor and if you are staggering them they can just cancel into a hyper armor move
2. Going off of 1, you cannot animation cancel into deflect leading you to be punished for attacking the enemy if they use a red move

These first two are by far my biggest complaint about the game (except for the terrible performance).

3. Putting deflect and dodge on the same button is bad because if you try to chain deflect sometime you'll just dodge and get hit, staggered, can't block or do anything because no animation cancelling, and die
4. Sets are incredibly underwhelming (and I know this is because there is PVP in the game so it has to be ""balanced"") and by NG+ they are god awful and offer nothing. Most of them also have the same capstone of ""X damage increase 6.7%"" where X is a weapon type. There are graces in NG+ but they are so incredibly rare (and not too powerful) they aren't even worth grinding for
5. Terrible performance leads to the game stopping/stutter every so slightly changing the timing of deflects all the time
6. The game has the same difficulty issue that the first Nioh has and that is the answer to ""How do we make this game harder?"" is always just add more enemies (The three enemies battle in NG+ is impossible)
7. There are so many QoL and basic functions that just aren't there, just to name a few: there is no character transform options, no world map (forced to load into a map to load into another mission), your filters in the menus don't stay and always default on date obtained, storehouse is only tied to blacksmith so you can't restock in a mission, etc etc.
8. Utter lack of enemy variety. By the second half of the game you have seen every basic enemy in the game and the only ""new"" enemies are the bosses.
9. No animation variety. There are two or three animations for almost everything in this game. Fatal blows and death animations just to name a few. The first few missions you do you will have seen every animation in the game.

[b]TLDR:[/b] Games is good, wish it was better. Happy to see another AAA entry for a 3k era game. If i wasnt a 3k fan, I wouldnt play this. Plenty of room for dev's to improve on. Had super minimal performance issues.

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
Story is incredibly corny / just plain bad. As someone who's an avid 3k fan I could barely follow it. 
Events/characters happening for seemingly no reason and your character has no real say in anything. Just along for the ride and treated like a ""best friend"" in a era that's known about the importance of relationships and why the occur. This issue must be further compounded by the translations where voice actions/subtitles constantly use the character's style (nick) names. So the speaker text will display Cao Cao, but when other characters refer to Cao Cao, they typically use ""Aman"". I cant imagine how confusing this would be for english players not familiar with the story. 

Voice acting is pretty rough too, especially Zhang Fei.

In terms of actual mechanics, the 5 element system is so shallow, or at least appears to be. As someone whos familiar with these sytems (and likes them). I couldnt figure out how to actually utilize this in moment to moment gameplay. For example, one would think a boss might be a certain element type, leading to you needing to use a weapon strong it its counter type. However that info is just not displayed anywhere. After 30h I honestly have no idea if any of this matters aside from being able to put out flames on the ground with a water spell. 

As touched on before, wizardry spells feel do not feel impactful, and the cost benefit ratio of wrecking your spirit gauge never seems worth it. Better off just melee-ing everything.

Spirit management feels too tight, getting to -1% cost every few levels didn't really help.

The numbers for stat modifiers on equipment are small and therefore feel insignificant. Not enough to want to micro manage. 

After the first 3-4 chapters, you've seen all the enemy types and you can quickly steam roll most levels.

Personal issue : Not a huge fan of the parry simulation that are these boss battles. If you love the brutalness of needing to perfectly time 30-50 deflects in a row.. then great.

Personal issue : Feel like the animation telegraphing is all over the place for certain boss designs. Some are quick, some are short and cover a ton of ground. Some are hard to see. 

Personal issue: cant believe how hard the first boss is, i would have quit if i wasnt a 3k fan. Its also not set up well from a tutorialization standpoint. Easy to miss that youre supposed to summon a divine beast. Seen many streamers miss this.

Had 2-3 crashes, one after a boss fight during a cutscene that really sucked because I had to replay it.

Occasional white screen flicker that goes away.

Dealing with the mountain for your central hub/gear management is pretty tedious. Just put the blacksmith at the start of every new level.

  I was excited about Wo Long when I started playing, but neither did the depth in build diversity and consequent gameplay variety ever come, nor does the singularly important and powerful parry mechanic make fights as intense as in Sekiro.

[b]Performance-wise[/b], the port is far from ideal. It runs quite well in FPS mode but that destroys resolution considerably. In Resolution mode, the port shows its true colors and runs horribly, even on good hardware. Having FPS mode helps a lot but makes the game look worse, as expected. There have been some game-breaking bugs on PC such as non-functional mouse control. There is no excuse as to why would anyone release a PC game with downright broken mouse controls. It's a great way of saying you do not care at all about the PC port - while asking full price for it at the same time.

[b]Gameplay-wise[/b], Wo Long can be quite a lot of fun. The issue is that it's a short-lived type of fun. There is no true depth to this game, no matter how many animation cancelling techniques you can fit in. It's all down to deflecting attacks. There isn't much else you need to do in this game to succeed, even with bad gear and a bad build. Just parry everything and counter attack. That's the whole game and you can beat it to the end like that. If you can maximize your morale before each boss, you will rarely have any issues in Wo Long, even with the worst character.

[b]In terms of game systems, user experience, polish, various QoL features[/b], this game is a massive regression compared to the Nioh games and Nioh 2 in particular. All of the depth of those games is pretty much gone, but it's not just that - all of the systems they have already established in the past are just missing. I could go into each of those but the review will become too long. It's enough to say they did a massive step back in terms of polish and user experience, and quality of life features.

[b]The actual combat[/b] of Wo Long is quite fun and the animations are just fantastic. It's very enjoyable, but the problem is that it gets old extremely fast. I haven't had a single long session playing this game because I just got bored! This has never happened with Nioh 2. I was addicted to Nioh 2 for 600-700 hours straight. With Wo Long, after 40 hours I am done and it didn't feel like any sort of accomplishment. The game is easy, I just had to parry and spam some attacks, that's all.

[b]The Morale/Fortitude system[/b] seemed interesting at first, but ultimately falls short in my opinion. It creates a weird sense of balance during each mission, where your power and the enemy strength varies constantly with each change in rank. You don't ever get a feeling of being grounded and understanding the limits of your character. It's all... fluid, and it ends up creating a sense of either being too weak, or too strong, with just a moment of being in the middle. It's wonky, and I don't like it. I think it created more problems than it solved, and I am not sure what problem it wanted to solve in the first place. Seems like the main goal of this mechanic was to be different and interesting, but it ends up feeling worse than not having it at all. This system also makes equipment feel insignificant. Furthermore, some spells are locked behind morale ranks, meaning you are not able to use them at the start of any level. That feels so bad, and I can't believe someone thought it would be fun to implement it like that. Let me use my abilities...

Wo Long [b]doesn't even have real coop.[/b] Yes, that's right. I don't see this mentioned enough. In Wo Long, you can summon/visit for help (equal to Torii gate in nioh games). And beyond that, you can create private lobbies with stream friends, or by using a password. It took me ages to get into a coop game with someone on steam. It was such a hassle before we found a way to form a party. And it still sucked hard after that. There are no public rooms or lobbies, no way to search for other people who want to do normal coop. The game simply does NOT have this basic feature, which has given so much new life to Nioh 2 as the coop is still holding that game up. 

After reaching NG+, I have no desire at all to continue and see no point in doing more in the game.

The combat is not going to get any more interesting than it is on a new character at the first mission. The armors and weapons are few and far in between. There is no point of working towards fashion goals for your character as the game just does not offer any truly interesting variety in any of that. It's a bare-bones game if you think about it critically. But even if you inject a ton more content into the game, you will still be limited by the overly-basic combat system. You will still get bored fast if you are like me (a person who dreamed of seeing Nioh 3 instead of wo long).

There have been arguments about how unfair it is to compare Nioh to Wo Long. But it really isn't. A similar comparison would be Dark Souls 3 versus Eldern Ring. ER is Fromsoft's best game ever so far. I fail to see why Team Ninja have no capability to do the same and make a ""new"" game while still using all their previous experience. That's how you get games like Elden Ring to begin with.

So, yeah. I'm sorry Team Ninja, this game is not all bad and it has a lot of positives to it. But it's just a step back from your older games. It's far less fun than Nioh 2 (long-term), and it hasn't got the same replayability potential at all as Nioh 2 does. Nor does it have the same quality in multiplayer. N2 is a great coop game, but Wo Long barely functions. 80% of my random coop visitations were filled with teleporting players and NPCs. 

You couldn't even implement real coop, which is just... an insult. And there is no way I can recommend that sort of a game.

At the end of the day, I am forced to give a negative review because this is not the game I wanted from Team Ninja in terms of both content AND quality. Virtually all Nioh fans wanted Nioh 3, and those fans are the core audience. Wo Long is a far simpler, shorter, smaller, and more boring game than either of the Nioh ones. It's a game I can only recommend to the casual players who have no interest in Nioh 2. It can be a fun single player experience.


For anyone who wants the true potential of what Team Ninja can do, go buy Nioh 2. It's a better game.

If Nioh 2 is 10/10, Wo Long is 6/10 at best with no potential to ever be a 10/10 in my opinion, due to the stripped down gameplay and mechanics.
 
I am still eager to see Team Ninja's actual next game where they put all of their effort into it and make a masterpiece. You could have done it now too but for some reason didn't, so the wait continues.",1677933954,1678620327,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

All these negative reviews just look like Skill Issues.

Finished the game and have only had 1 issue of the game freezing and then crashing, other than that, no bugs or issues to speak of.
The bosses, to be completely honest, were easy AF.
Most only taking 1-2 attempts to clear with the final boss of the game (Post Credits) being the only boss that was kinda challenging.

Each level was fun to explore and clear out.

I must admit that there was a but too much Nioh 1 and 2 in this game than I would have liked, as much as I enjoy it, I would have liked if Wo Long felt like more of it's own thing, with the cutscenes and spirits almost feeling like 1 for 1 replica's, much less the story feeling very similar.

Overall, a great game that was great fun, but I feel that the team didn't challenge themselves enough to make something unique and different to previous games.

Long Version: I'm just coming off Sekiro, tried a couple different Souls games, found them to be clunky (hurr durr skill problem...the stamina mechanic in DS is stupid and obsolete). Wo Long however hits the groove. You'll have to adapt your combat. it's gonna be easier to shift from Jedi Fallen Order than Sekiro, but it's much more similar to those two than it is to DS. 

As for this game: The graphics are gorgeous, the controls are tight and once you learn them, the combat flows beautifully. There's plenty of room for character building. The story and environments are rich and engaging. And the fun factor is there as long as you like difficult games. Absolutely recommend for SWJFO and Sekiro fans. ER fans will like it too, DS fans might or might not like it but usually retreat to their Goth Comfort Dungeon of Stamina Management (referred to as 'skill') when they run into stuff that isn't a carbon copy of DS or Nioh.

The weapons LOOK good, but most movesets feels way to slow, and the ones that are fast do NOTHING. 

The Armor does very little, The difference between a random mixmash of light armor and full set with bonuses heavy armor, with defensive embeddes are 2 maybe 3 hits. And this forces you into the equipment weight stat, because the penalities for everything ore than medium load is WAY to high.
AND the'yre almost all ugly and/or  way to similar to eachother.

The Morale systems is dumb... i'ts an anti-farming, playtime padding tool, so even with your maxed out character, you can't run through a level. Which is terrible if you need to re-visit a level because you missed an item.

Your NPC allies are good for nothing, they refuse to attack, and they can barly tank a couple hits.

The bosses are either EXTREMLY easy, or just complete bullshit. (I might be writing this after rage quitting after spending 4.5 hours on the final boss of the game, after my friend did it first try only using 2 pots....)

Story: borderline nonsense unless you are very familiar with Three Kingdoms history. Does not bother to contextualize things for people who are not. 
Gameplay: Enemy variety is lacking. Can't interrupt your attacks to parry so the game kinda forces you to play passively. (For this reason I recommend playing something besides fire, which relies on attacking a lot. I recommend earth.) The AI helpers are pretty useless and sometimes actively harmful by body blocking you.
Difficulty: Mostly kinda easy (compared to Nioh 2) with huge difficulty spikes. Some bosses are pathetic pushovers while others took me several days to beat.

I'm still pretty early but the game gives you a lot of options for dealing with difficultly, so you can more or less make it as hard as you like.

With QoL changes and performance fixes it will be a great game. 
There are some really weird stuff - I keep buying arrows from the supplier but they don't autorefill when I rest/die and you can still buy additional arrows that get sent to a storage that seems to be nowhere to be found. 
The transmog system is god awful aswell, you can't even preview the item you want to change the appearance of and if you want to switch it to another you have to switch back to the OG appearance first and then switch to another one, resulting in having to go through way too many menus for absolutely no reason at all. 
But even with the bad stuff I think the game is good and am rather optimistic about the future of it. Especially fun seeing a new take on all the Dynasty Warriors characters if you're a fan of that aswell.

[*]playing this game with mouse and keyboard is like eating soup with a fork. if it doesn't work use a spoon (controller)
[*]framerate is very bad in some places, lots of freezes, stutters and sometimes a crash. this needs a patch, desperately
[*]cutscenes are 20 fps, why? lol
[*]after every mission you get automatically get sent to the next one. if you don't want to go there you have to go through 2 very long loading screens instead of one. why change the formula? nioh 1 and 2 worked fine with the mission map. i bet this was done on purpose to make the game feel more like an actually connected world and not small maps that don't have anything to do with each other.
[*]am i imagining things or are some of the level maps straight up entirely copy pasted from nioh? the snow battlefield and shipwreck map felt sooo very familiar. if it's true that's fµcking incredibly lazy - big yikes.
[*]why do flags reset when you restart a mission? don't show them to me as 6/6 on the travel screen only to then have 0/6 when i enter. makes it unnecessarily hard to figure out which ones i am missing, especially on missions that have areas which you cant leave once you reach them.

PROS:
- deep, fluid, skill-based combat system
- decent enemy variety, but not as good as Nioh 2 (so far)
- bosses are extremely fair, with fully telegraphed moves, you'll never get one-shot
- same art direction as Nioh 1 & 2, which I love
- music is great
- sound design is great
- the setting runs on the Rule of Cool

CONS:
- game runs well on my computer (ryzen 3700x, gtx1070, 16gb ram, nvme ssd, 1080p TV), but it does get some frame drops when there are lots of spell effects
- the graphics options are lacking, for instance there's no option to tone down spell effects
- the story is pretty dumb overall, same as with Nioh 1 & 2
- the 1st boss and Lu Bu are way overtuned compared to the rest of the game so far
- it's just not as good as Nioh 2 (but then, very few games are)

Pros:
Wo Long gets to the fun faster unlike Team Ninjas previous Soulsbourne games by tying special moves to weapons rather than making you unlock them. This allows you to do cool moves right from the start depending on the weapon you have equipped.

Magics take no time at all to unlock and you only have to have a high enough element stat to use them which makes things much quicker.  

The overall experience has been streamlined with faster leveling up and less stats planning which allows you to enjoy more of the gameplay rather than spending time in the menus. 

Wo Long was the first game of it's type where I found myself using different weapons types during my first run through which was nice. I usually stick to the sword in them all and found myself using a whole range of them. All of them were equally fun to play with and made for cool moments. 

Cons:
The game is short compared to Nioh. The main levels are long but the side missions are quick and too simple at times. 

The Travel system is a bit convoluted. When you complete a submission instead of going back to the map you are asked if you want to go back to the main level, retry or go back to camp. Which doesn't seem like an issue until you want to do the sub missions. Then you will find your self loading in and out of levels for no reason. I suggest they just allow you to go back to the map menu after every mission. 
The world map is actually too simple and you really have no clue what or where you are at any time. Where Nioh had a detailed map that allowed you to learn fact about the area. Wo long is nothing but a menu with a map in the background that serves no real purpose. 

The story and dialog are are sub par and make you cringe at times. The story feels meaningless as you never get any real time to be around a single character long enough to care about them but it's not like they have personalities that you would want to be around for long anyway. 

The game launched in a mess and there was no excuse for it. As of writing this a patch has been released that addressed many of the issues but there in no reason a game that is essentially Nioh with more polish ran as bad as it did from the start.   

Conclusion:
Wo long is a good game that I suggest you pick up but ONLY ON SALE. It is not worth the $60 price and i'm sure there will be a definitive edition that releases with all the DLCs and better optimizations in a year or two and honestly it's worth the wait.",1678548889,1678548889,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is a stuttering hell even at the lowest settings + 1080p..
The major issue is that stutters happen the most when enemies launch their deadliest attacks. On a gaming title like this, most of the gaming time will be spent fighting bosses; and this is where most of the stuttering happens. Frame times go from 16ms to 200-300ms when a boss is about to hit you with a strong attack or a red flash attack, giving you instant death without any reaction.

This is what I tried. I did lock FPS to 59/60 in the AMD driver (Chill parameter), disabled vsync, and lowered other settings like volumetric cloud and most other demanding settings. I also tried 1080p vs. 1440p with resolution between 50%-100%. Nothing worked.
Note that locking FPS in the driver did stabilize the game when traveling maps and fighting weak enemies. It's a very stable 16.6ms frame time most of the time. But the moment you fight a boss and they are about to hit you with their strongest attacks, frame times spike to 200+ms. I measured frame times with the latest MSI Afterburner.

Note that the stuttering varies. I reached the prison chapter and killed the snake boss. The worst stutters happened when fighting the Bull in the forest. So, even if you did not experience the stutters against the first 3 bosses in the Demo, you might still hit them on future chapters. 

Hopefully this helps other players not to waste their money like I did.

EDIT 1:
The game got updates that say they fixed issues. AMD also released a new driver saying it officially supports the game. Unfortunately, not much has changed. In fact, seems like it got a little worse. Stutters are more frequent and if you set the driver max FPS to 59 while in-game FPS is at 60, the game crashes.",1678118020,1678546075,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

I will talk about the gameplay briefly in the later part.

First of all here are my PC specs: i got a 9900KS,  32GB 4000Mhz DDR4 Ram + a 2080Ti. The Hardware is getting a little bit older but i am pretty sure it is still way above the average PC user. 

I set the graphics settings and everything to as low as possible and set it to 'prioritize FPS':
I am playing on QHD resolution 2560x1440 and i get about 80 - 100 FPS in most cases, sometimes up to 120 FPS.
With these settings it sadly doesnt even look good anymore but i am mostly a performance guy. I like my games to run well rather than look well.

Now here comes the problem. While my FPS are fairly consistent. Supposedly at least. The gamespeed is not.
I encountered multiple slowdowns during the gameplay, where the game plays in literal slow-motion, running at about
0.25x - 0.5x the normal speed during which my FPS didnt really change.
So it was not bound to my FPS (which shouldn´t be a thing anymore to begin withanymore).

Other times it feels like the game is running slightly slower than normal (maybe 0.8x or 0.9x of gamespeed).
During those slowdowns, there were usually next to no stutters which would indicate frameloss or low frames. This was simply the gamespeed slowing down.
I have never encountered this in any game in recent years.

Although i stated the game had next to no stutters during the slow-mos it otherwise had frequent stutters. In this type of game where you have to have fast reaction speed to dodge/parry enemy attacks, any type of stutter is detrimental.
This is especially bad during boss-fights.
I won't spoll but one boss in particular always had the same stutter during an attack in which he charges at you. You can only dodge or parry this attack. The game always stuttered during the startup of the attack. Even though it is just a splitsecond hiccup, it is enough to not be able to react.
Since it was always the same stutter i was actually able to adjust my timing, but this should not be a thing.

The really frustrating part was, that since it was a critcal attack from the boss, it would do a lot of damage to you and caused me to die multiple times. In retrospect i actually think this is the boss i died the most from.


Now comes the worst part in my opinion. I encountered extreme slowdowns during a cutscene twice.
I was stuck on 1 frame of the cutscene and could hear the sounds running at about 0.01x speed or something.
Extremely bassy 'voices' could only be heard. After 2 - 3 minutes the game would then crash for me.

The cutscenes are mostly during the start of the level or after you finish a level, meaning after a boss fight.
In my case, said cutscenes were after a boss fight.
For whatever reason the developers decided to code the save sequence after the cutscene.
So i crashed twice during cutscenes and i come back to the game only to find out, i have to fight the boss again.

This is unacceptable in a souls-like game in my opinion. Just imagine you are struggling with a boss for whatever reason.
It could take you hours just to defeat 1 boss. You defeat him and your game crashes from a freaking cutscene, not even gameplay and boom you have to defeat him again.
This could honestly be a moment where someone drops the game and never comes back.


Now let us talk briefly about the gameplay.
I really like the mechanics of this game. I am a big fan of the spirit gauge in this game.
Kind of like a stamina/stance bar which depletes from martial arts, dodging and deflecting but also fills in succesfull deflects, attacks.
The different weapons and their martial arts all feel really good and different form one another.
Spells are pretty useful in this game.
The gearing system makes this game pretty different from other souls games. It makes it a lot easier but also allows you to specialize in different fighting styles. A lot more so than in other souls-likes.
The only thing i am still not sure on whether i like it or not is the morale system, which is a little too long to explain here.
All things together make for a really solid game maybe a little too easy for my taste tho, but i played a lot of different souls-likes before.
It took me about 32 hours to beat the game including every battlefield. (basically main + sidemissions).
The only thing left is the new difficulty (New Game Plus).

One more thing to note. I play every souls-like on controller so i didn't even check but it seems to be unplayable on keyboard + mouse.


So to summarize:
As stated before, i really like this game from the mechanics at least
So it is a shame to say that i can not recommend this game in its current state.
It runs incredibly bad especially considering i am way above the mininum system requirements.
If your PC is even slower than mine or just barely passes the requirements I don't even wanna know how bad it could get.

After I beat every mission, even the smallest performance problems makes me ragequit. The only thing keeping me going before was that i wanted to see everything.

I would still advice against buying this game on sale unless you are sure that it has received patches to fix a lot of things.
There might be a few online solutions to my many problems but this should not be acceptable for a full price game.

Not to say I did not play with other weapons but I've finished the game with a sword I got from the second level. Why? Because I can. The game does not encourage changing gear. Changing weapons means you have to get used to the martial arts on the new weapon and get used to the movements on the new weapon. But why bother doing that when you can keep that 4 star Iron sword you got on that stage with Zhao Yun and just upgrade it till rank 10?

There is a lack of depth in the combat mechanics, different weapons just present a different way of flailing yourself around, its more or less the same speed and gameplay type across different weapons and the dodge parry thing just makes it shallower. You literally can clear the game with dodge parry + Spirit attack only.

One way to make this already easy game easier is to inflict status ailments. When you inflict a status ailment on an enemy, that staggers them and you can follow up with a different element to inflict another status ailment leading to another stagger. You cycle this status ailment infliction till the enemy dies. It's so easy you wouldn't think it was from the same guys who made Nioh. 

Multiplayer makes things even more easy. How do you kill tough mobs easier than Ailment stacking? Stealth dropping them twice. First player jumps in, stealth drops the Chang Gui, then once it stands up, second player jumps in stealth drops it. This works for every miniboss and is quite disappointing tbh.

Multiplayer still crashes randomly and still manages to ruin that game session you and your friend had. 

There is a severe lack in QoL features. When you buy arrows, crossbow arrows, throwing knives and such, you can buy in excess and those get stored in the storehouse. But they don't automatically refill you when you run out. How do you restock? You could buy some from the nearest flag(I know, doesn't make sense huh) or you could disturb your ongoing quest to go back to the village, wait out the loading screen that manages to still be long despite the game installed on an M.2 NVME, and talk to the blacksmith to access your storage. You have to endure an unoptimized loading time, just to access your storage otherwise everything in the storage box just rots. Unreasonable. Clearly, the devs do not have the players in mind when they made this game.

The NPCs accompanying you are as competent as the ""pebble"" item. Literally no benefit to taking them along, might as well go use the Willow Branch every time they appear. Getting them to Oath level 10 does nothing to improve their performance.

There's a lack of variety in mobs and you can probably count the type of mobs in your hands. 

Every enemy except for Lu Bu(first encounter) and the last boss is very disappointing. Yuan Shao being the most disappointing.

Lastly, this game is too short. Cleared in 19 hours on normal difficulty. My Ninja Gaiden playthroughs on normal difficulty averaged over 30-40 hours per installment and Nioh 2 on Dream of the Samurai(First/Normal Difficulty) went for 120 hours without the DLC stories. What happened here really? Why is Wo Long this short? Did interns make this as a kiddie project?

Overall, I wish I stuck to the internet's wisdom quote ""Remember, no pre-purchases"". I was foolish to think that because it was made by Team Ninja, it would be amazing. This was a waste of money. Whatever they're making next, I'm not gonna be pre-purchasing no more.

Initial Review:
Bright flashes of white, frequent crashing especially on multiplayer, teleporting enemies and friends on a 600mbps connection, I bought this game for both me and my friend, and we cant progress together because of the technical issues. We'll get to a far enough point in a stage and then crash without any hope of recovery. And if you do crash on multiplayer, both of you will have to do the stage all over again. 

I have a 9700K running at 5GHz and a 3070. While it's not the latest gear, it is still able to run most games at a decent framerate without crashes. Just don't get why a game from the same guys who made Nioh 2 can fail this much.",1677914980,1678540305,False,8,0,0.545075356960296631,0,True,False,False

About the actual game: If someone would drop me in the game with no context and told me it's Nioh 3, I wouldn't even doubt it. Menus seem similar, controls feel similar, gearing seems similar even though it's somewhat streamlined.

The combat feels like ""take dark souls and turn it into a fast paced brawler"" - if you've played Nioh 1 or 2, you know what I mean. I enjoy the spell system, as all spells simply use the same ""stamina"" that you use for everything else too.

""Stamina"" is called Spirit and there's a few key differences, but the basic idea is there. Without going too deep into details: blocking drains it, dodges drain it, heavy attacks drain it, spells drain it - passive regeneration is slow, but quick attack and parries *regenerate* your stamina.

Since quick attacks are the main way to get stamina back, the combat feels like it rewards offense and aggression. Want to block more? Make sure you also get some attacks in.

Defense heavily focuses on Block and Deflect(parry). I rarely use dodge for anything else than just as a panic button to spam while running away - the default keybind for dodging is double-tapping the parry key, so it seems like dodge is just a secondary tool by design.",1677922618,1678539686,True,4,1,0.537192821502685547,0,True,False,False

I forget the name of the place, but it's very green and little island things are connected by big branches

This game kinda just feels like Sekiro but worse, and the only thing it has over Sekiro is having character creation.  All the bosses feel basically the same.  Like sure, they're visually doing ""different"" moves, but it all feels the same, just reskinned

And the first boss of the game is somehow the hardest one that I fought, it literally just kept getting easier with each boss.  And then after the boar, each boss just kept getting more annoying to fight

Even though this is seemingly most games nowadays, this game is one of those games that just releases unfinished and it still deserves a point off for that.  And games doing that is becoming especially annoying.  Like, anyone could just release anything at this point and just be like ""uh... yeah... we'll fix it later.""  Like, fix it before releasing the game, bro.  You even had a demo people played so you could work out the major bugs, but the full game was somehow worse?

The story of the game is probably one of the most uninteresting/unengaging stories in a game I've seen tbh.  Like I just have zero interest in it lol

Two fights come to mind for seeming to come from an area of zero intelligence for the system the team tried to implement, and those are Zhang Rang and the tiger's loyal subjects. Both pit you against a squad of enemies and let you handle the fight your way, but both seem to have forgotten the poise system in place and the dev's team's brilliant idea to remove invincibility at the start of a critical. So you've managed to break your enemy's posture and try to hit a critical, but the moment you hit the button, a wave of projectiles hit you and cancel, now you are back to square zero and fighting it again until you rinse and repeat the same issue over and over again.

I'm a big fan of Soulslike; Nioh 2 is my favorite game of all time, and DS3/Elden Ring really hit as well.  I was a big fan of Sekiro as well, but I wouldn't say it's my favorite.  With this in mind, I'd say I should've loved Wo Long.

[b] I didn't [/b]

So let's talk;  This is not like any Nioh/Souls/Sekiro lookalike game.  This actually handles more like Dynasty Warriors (imagine that) with fewer enemies and higher difficulty.  I'll spare you the nitty gritty and just go onto what really earned this ""no"" from me.

So for starters:
[b] Pros:[/b]
-Looks great.  Character creation is just Nioh 2 with more options (which is awesome imo).
-Solid idea.  Three Kingdoms makes a great setpiece for a Nioh-style game.  The subject matter is deep, and the teams working on it have earned their stripes as 3 Kingdoms worshipers.
-The game is hard.  The battles themselves present a decent threat, and can be quite fun, especially Zhang Bao.
-Fans of Nioh specifically will see a lot of ""oh, that just replaces these"", like the lovely pandas that replace Sudama.  It's a great idea to throw out garbage you won't use and replace it with an item; However I liked how in nioh, giving it a weapon meant you'd get a weapon back, armor for armor, trinket for trinket, etc.  I can forgive this small issue since the core idea is still there.
-Access to magic, early on in the game, is pretty cool.  I'm sure magic is really cool in the upper levels I haven't gotten to, but it's a nice little thing to have in the wee early game.
-If you play this on a controller, you'll have literally no reason to complain about what the mass amounts of people have been crying about; IMO Soulsbornes aren't keyboard games.  They're controller games.  This is just my opinion, but if you play DS with a KBM, you're a sadist.  Use a controller.

Unfortunately that's all the good I have to say about the game.

Now then, time to drop the axe.
[b] Cons:[/b]
-[b] Co-op bad.[/b]  They should've just copied Nioh 2 shamelessly.  Everything about it, that was perfection.  Instead we have a glitchy, slow-to-load lineup of our characters that look like they're getting ready for a mobile game.  I can't speak to every individual experience, but my game partner and I were literally flying all over one another's screens, lagging.  The monsters would sometimes be in places they actually weren't, so you'd go for a stealth attack and hit nothing, then they appear behind you and nothing personnel you in the mouth.  We're hoping a patch drops and addresses the Co-op before anything else.

-[b] Combat actually gets kinda boring.[/b]  So you only have two attack moves, Light attack and Heavy Attack.  You also have an obligatory dodge/deflect mechanic and a jump button.  Unlike in Sekiro, there aren't any moves that need to be jumped, so your jump is basically more for getting outta tight spots, platforming, and stealth bombing, so it's not a real combat mechanic as it was in Sekiro.  If you do a Heavy attack, you take a long charge up and hit for middling damage.  If you do a Light, you can combo it up to like four times, then end with a Heavy.  A Heavy attack is a combo-ender, a cinematic attack when you posture break, or a stealth kill.  That's all.  This fighting style is very Dynasty Warriorsy, and it's okay there when you're mowing down literal thousands of people with broad, sweeping strikes.  But in this game, like Nioh, where you are handling 1-2-3 enemies at a time, give me some variety.  It's fair to note that I haven't progressed *super* far into the game.  But it's just not that thrilling to continuously do the same 4 moves on repeat until the thing dies.

-[b] Morale replaces your actual stats.[/b]  So this whole system sucks.  Give me levels back.  I don't wanna grind for levels every time I get in a stage.  Morale is this wonky system that lets you deal more damage and take more punishment without dying.  It's a second set of levels that's only active during the mission you're on, and then it resets.  You need to kill enemies and raise flags (bonfires) to raise your morale levels so that you can deal damage, but there's also your normal ""Souls-esque"" levels that effect your scaling damage and hp, among other things.  So you have two systems to accomplish the same thing.  (It kinda feels like they had two teams working on progression, and the Dev execs just decided to not pick one or the other).

-[b] Gear system is dogwater.[/b]  You'll get a million items.  (And all of em stink).  You can't change affinity from what I understand.  The martial arts move attached to the weapon cannot be changed as far as I'm aware.  So you might get a weapon that checks every box, but it doesn't have the move you want, or its scaling.  There is no more ""gear level"" as there was in Nioh, so you just have a buncha stuff that all looks the same, and is separated by 1-4 stars.  It's kinda just confusing to be honest.  It just feels like it doesn't work.  Just bring back weapon levels so I can sell the junk that's below my level.

-[b] Weapon variety stinks.[/b] So there are some classic, Chinese weapons here.  Jian (straightsword), Dao (broadsword/saber), dual Swords, Bo staff, Podao (Guan Yu's weapon), Spear, and a few nifty polearms and such.  Problem:  Their playstyle is all fundamentally the same, as per the boring combat system, and it's a question of how are you stat-scaling, and do you prefer fast attacks with low commitment, or the opposite?  I'm a spear guy myself, and I enjoy the halberds and podao.  So unlike Nioh where the weapons all have completely different playstyles with different uses, all the weapons in Wolong are just melee range with some few differences, such as the sudden dash attach on bo-staff, or the wide cleave of the podao.  Some are slightly better at dispatching multiple foes, and others are more suited to rushdown play, but they all feel so similar it's almost useless to pick a weapon based on your favorite choice, and just  pick the one with the best stats that scales the best for you.  Also.  Where the heck are the fists?  Literally everyone is complaining about the lack of fist weapons and I'm one of them.  Just to tease us, if you unequip your weapons, your character visibly knows Kung Fu, and he throws Ba Ji/Pi Gua style attacks.  Give us our fists, Wo Long.

-[b] The story....Yikes.[/b]  My biggest complaint of all.  It's contrived as heck.  You aren't [b]really[/b] a character.  You're just a shoehorn for the other characters' narrative exploits, such as Zhao Yun deciding to become the superhero of 3 Kingdoms Era China.  You do the famous Oath in the Peach Garden with Zhang Fei and Guan Yu, while Liu Bei is bleeding out of his liver.  Only it's not in a Peach Garden, it's in a dingy cave, and you just met ZF and GY like an hour before.  Big time, ""did we just become best friends?"" moment.  It tries really hard to be Nioh, feeding you exposition while you get a new guardian spirit.  But unlike in Nioh, where most of them gave you their spirit in their final moments, the big bosses of 3 Kingdoms Era just start talking to you while their magical horse flies into your ears or something.  Good time for a pee break.

That's enough for you to formulate a decision on whether you really want to buy this.  I didn't have a horrendous time, but I'm going to shelf this game until a massive QOL patch gets released, and I'm more than a little disappointed in the end product.  After hearing that Wild Hearts (also a Koei game) dropped to mediocre reviews a few weeks ago, I have to wonder if the teams weren't trying to shove things out the door before Fiscal Year (March 30), cause y'all know how certain publishers are.

I'm 100% certain that if this game had been put off until it was ready, it would've been a blockbuster, but for now, I'm gonna go back to Nioh, DS, and whatever other games actually let me have fun with my friends.  Sorry Koei.  But do better.",1678284049,1678517991,False,371,17,0.770878195762634277,18,True,False,False

Visual bug like white flickering, super annoying. 

Content wise, its a huge downgrade compared to Team Ninja's previous souls-like game, Nioh 2. The game is super short compared to Nioh 2, weapons/spells variety not as many, and the weapon moveset/animation is not as deep and detailed, can barely do any combos with them, especially since a weapon can only have 2 martial arts. The game has so many downgraded aspects that i cant be bothered listing them all. Again, massive downgrade all around compared to Nioh 2.

Combat is great, similar to sekiro, but a bit more thought out. If ur a fan of Sekiro, you'll dig the combat. I also like that there are several elements that you can level up, each elements has its own wizardry spells you can cast like buffs, debuffs, element-based skills, etc. , and the element's spells can counter each other's spells (ex: fire-based spells will get countered by water-based element, etc). All wizardry spells need certain moral level depending on the spells to be able to use it.

There is a moral system in which you can level up by killing enemies, and placing flags on a specific spot through out the map's level. You can also lose your moral level by getting hit by enemy's red attack, or by dying, but you can get it back by killing the enemy who killed you. Placing flags will level up your base moral in the level, preventing you to lose all your morals to 0. I kinda like the moral system because with it, even the same type of enemy can have different difficulties depending on its moral level, making them more challenging in each encounters.

Main content of a souls-like games are the Bosses. The bosses in this game is not that many compared to Nioh 2. The bosses are all good overall, but theres only two bosses in the main game that i find great and fun to fight with. The rest are good enough, and some are just not challenging enough.

The game has coop and pvp. I personally hasnt tried them but ive seen streamers doing them. Coop seems fine and serviceable, when you do coop, the enemies will be buffed for balancing purposes. Pvp is in a form of invasion. You can only invade people who has npc companions/a coop buddy. No comment if the pvp is balanced or not but souls pvp ers been having fun doing pvp in this game so theres that.

Conclusion: dont touch the game in its current state yet. Wait until they fixed the damn game.",1678462211,1678515734,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Combat - All attacks can be reflected/deflected, actually really satisfying. Attacks feel weighty and good. Each weapon type have their own elements that they excel on. Each weapon has their own special attacks and might require some grinding to get the specific of what you want since they are not changeable, which can be good or bad.

No more poison puddles - Unlike Nioh series, maps do not have those annoying puddles that just straight up make you lose health. Instead, they increase your stagger gauge while you are in them, making it risky to stand on but not annoying, waste pots, and timed.

Map size - Maps aren't too huge that it doesn't feel overwhelmed when you approach new zone. Optionals are bite sized and can actually feels stress less to grind.

Flags - Every small flag refuels your HP to full. Every big flag refuels your HP and potions to full. If you are the type to not like every enemy to respawned this is one of the best feature/change IMO. It allows you to walk back and check for hidden paths/items without stressed out about re-fighting mobs.

NPCs - You can choose to turn them off with an item, but for casual players, the existence of them makes it not feel very lonely and harsh. Also they provide gear sets/glamours at max bonding.

Game flow - There is no grinding needed to clear the game unless you really want to max out/perfect your gears. You can also 100% achievement at the moment under normal difficulty and without having to replay the game.

What I don't like:

Port - I had resolution issues that I had to search around and do workaround to fix(it was a parsec driver issue). I had stutters. Crashes during cutscenes. Just play it on console if you have that option.

Mobs - After a certain point they just feel like a chore since a lot of them are reused. Spiders are literally there for nothing, why are they even there??

Story - Unless you already know most of the three kingdom era history, this game skips around with twists which makes a lot of plots not get explained.

Map teleportation - There is no way to teleport to other flags. Replaying the mission does not save your flags.

Morale - You can farm your way through higher morale to make bosses easier, IMO late game makes bosses too easy.

End game bosses - The bosses are either not balanced or just too easy. Either I got too used to attack patterns of this game, they just die too fast. It just seems like the game isn't very balanced overall based on what I saw from streamers.

Camera - Lock on feels really weird at times and does not want to target who I want to target. The switching is also slow if you want to switch to next target.

Music - They are forgettable. Some sound effects tend to be missing when I use my speaker with other stuff playing.
-----------------------
Overall I enjoyed the game quite a bit, finishing all missions and getting all achievements. I definitely recommend to anyone who wants to play a more friendly version of Nioh series game. Just play on console if you do not want to risk having optimization issues which they are fixing or fixed.

As a fan of both Dynasty Warriors and Nioh i was exited to expirience this game, for my suprise it wasnt on par with neither of those games.

For one side the story its so disconnected that most ppl wont know whats happening i think.

The rest is what they choose on to base the game Nioh, in my believe one of the greatest souls-like games.

Making Nioh the base of the game hurt it in several ways, first of all they had to strip Nioh to the very bones. Then they added a couple new mechanics on top in this case Deflecting ( parry ), Jumping and Spirit system.

In comparison to Sekiro, in that game it worked because they didnt base the game on Dark Souls or any other fromsoft that i remember.

In Wo-Long Deflect in my case doesnt fully click  or works because they tried to be flashy but at the same time the rhythm is lost when u cant attack because u cant cancel any other animation into Deflect, the main mechanic of the game to stay alive, one that is imposed into you, making everything else weak at the same time, for example attacking both melee or with magic is a big risk, so with most bosses or situations makes u play on the defensive, contrary to what you should be doing.

Jumping didnt add any depth into the map creativity, i still think most of the maps in this game are boring and bland with lots of empty places, neirly to the end you can appreciate some beauty but is the less.

In everyway  Wo-Long feels like a downgrade on Nioh and i mention some of them:

No map to choose missions, instead the game keeps throwing you on the main missions and you have to go through lots of loading screens to make it to a submission, it even rush you out of missions ending them automaticaly instead of the glowing circle in Nioh.

Items are scarce and most of them feel like dont matter at all, u will only care for 1 weapon of your choise, level it up easy and keep going with a full inventory of irrelevant junk, same for armor. This is a big dissapointment compared to the varied and big quantity of things you can grab in Nioh 2.

I was specting some depth with weapons compared to Nioh, but instead we get nothing, yust some basic square-square-square-square-Triangle combo. That definitly was a big turn off, they didnt even put in the game more weird or complex weapons like for example Nunchuks, Rope Dart or Triple section staff.

The lack of options to choose your builds makes it less aprouchable, i know that ninjitsu its a no in chinese setting, but they could have added some assassin options instead of simplifying everything.

Overall in quality and presentation i feel they didnt have much love for this project, maybe they are making too many games at the same time and the group and resources for Wo-Long were short.

In any case i cant recomend this game, i feel dissapointed and a bit hurt for specting something at least good.

I feel that this game is a response to Sekiro which is also kind of a boring game in the same light that Nioh was a response to Dark Souls. I have beaten the game and am halfway through NG+, but unlike Nioh 2 not a lot changes between original and NG+. 

As far as the gameplay, basic attacks do not do much. Magic also does not do very much and it seems often the enemy will see you casting and prioritize some kind of special attack to hit you. Because magic, as well as any other move, costs so much stamina, if you get hit just once (at least later in the game) your character will become exhausted which opens you up for another hit which will likely kill you. Magic and resing allies also takes too long and you will very likely be punished for it. 

The game does not encourage creativity in either builds or the weaponry/armor it provides. Ultimately, damage does very little and spirit damage also does not do much to bosses--the only real damage you will make is with fatalities which you will mostly get from deflecting special attacks from the bosses as that is the only major way to reduce spirit. Also if you get hit by anyone, it recovers their spirit so you will often have to play unbearably safe. 

No characters are memorable, the story is not good, most of the longer weapons (spears, hammers, poleaxe) are almost always a bad option due to their long windup frames...Frames still drop as well for me even after the updates. Honestly, I can deal with the frame drops and poor kbm setup as these problems pale in comparison to the aforementioned as well as very long (and often) loading times between stages.

as for the difficulty, the morale system imo is a little too much. if u go into a bossfight with the maximum morale of the level, usually is at 20 morale, you tend to beat the boss without even having to fully learn its moveset. and god forbid you're a little bit above the recommended level for the boss than it really trivializes the difficulty. im still 50/50 on this cuz on one side, its your own choice to choose how much morale you have for a boss and what level you're at, and this allows players who want an easier experience to get one. But at the same time the majority of people playing a game like this play it for the challenge, and the fact that the only way to make the game a real challenge is by going away from core parts of the game that you're taught to use, mainly the morale system, defeats the purpose of it being this uphill challenge. Dont get me wrong there are still some very tough bosses in this game even if you fight them with maximum morale, but for every tough boss there's 2 to 3 that just don't cut it unless you purposefully fight them at a lower level than intended and with low morale. I'm of the belief that this shouldn't be a thing in a game who's main selling point is the challenge that it has to give. 

Outside of that little nitpick tho, i really loved this game. The story is more of an easter egg type story for people already familiar with the plot of the three kingdoms era, which is fine imo. I like the weapon variety a lot. Usually games centered around a parry system give a default weapon to use but here you have an endless variety of weapons to choose from all with their own uniqueness to them, whether it their abilities or the timings of attacks. So im a big fan of that. 

TLDR; really fun but the game runs better on console than it does on pc. difficulty can feel trivial at times but there's ways to make the game harder on yourself for those after a challenge. story is there, if your familiar with the three kingoms era you'll see it as an easter egg type experience. weapon variety is pretty good and all in all a very solid game. 8/10.

Having grown up with playing Dynasty Warriors, seeing all those characters I love and getting a new take on the Romance of the Three Kingdoms story might skew my perception a bit, but either way, these are my thoughts on Wo Long.

First off, Wo Long is a Souls-Like game and Souls-Like games have a reputation as being ""difficult"".
However I wouldn't say that Wo Long is a ""difficult"" game, and I don't think that's a ""good"" or a ""bad"" thing since it's very much a subjective point to make, and it all depends on what YOU specifically are looking for.
However when the first boss in the game is the one thing I struggled with the most out of everything else in the game, it not only sets false expectations of what to expect, but it also makes the other bosses feel really unsatisfying and lacking in comparison.
Basically what I want to say is the hardest challenge I faced was the first challenge in the game and that is[strike], in my opinion,[/strike] objectively bad game design.
Sure, maybe after that boss I had learned how the games mechanics worked but whatever.
As for the other bosses, they were all flashy and unique and while most of them were fun to fight, only around 3 of them  actually felt satisfying to beat and weren't beaten on the first try.
My issue with that is that even though most of them were fun, all except for the first boss and the 3 other are incredibly forgettable.

Now to summarize how I felt about the difficulty in general.
Like I wrote earlier, Wo Long is, by Souls-Like standards, not a difficult game.
Most of that comes down to the morale system I believe, and I won't explain how that system works in this review, but basically as long as you don't die it allows you to easily snowball and become stronger than every enemy on the stage fairly quickly.
On top of that, on most stages you will have one or two AI companions with you, and if you don't, you can spend an item to summon them yourself, and because of these two things I can't say that there was a single stage that was challenging at all.
Again, the game not being ""hard enough"" is not a bad thing and personally I still had fun playing through most stages, and if you're not used to Souls-Like games the game might be pretty difficult.

Onto combat.
Most of combat will revolve around managing ""spirit"".
You can think of it as your mana and endurance both neatly packed into one bundle.
You get spirit by either deflecting blows or attacking, and you lose spirit by either casting spells, blocking, dodging or doing heavy attacks.
Once you loose all spirit you won't be able do any heavy attacks or cast spells and the next attack you take will stagger you for a second, but you can still deflect blows and do light attacks to build it back up again unless you get staggered.
The system keeps the pace of the combat up by promoting you to play aggressively and stay in the fight or weave in and out if you're a spell caster, rather than waiting for a stamina bar to recharge or chugging potions to cast more spells.
Honestly I really like it, good stuff!
[Edit]
I forgot to mention when I first wrote this review that it's a deflect/parry based combat system so no matter what build you choose you're going to need to deflect/parry at least sometimes.
[Edit end]

RPG elements?
You've got a character creator and fairly early into the game you'll be able to completely change your characters appearance if you don't like how you look.
As for the stats, it's based on the Chinese philosophy of the five phases.
In other words, you've got 5 stats you can pick and choose from and you could probably say that it's a dumbed down version of a stat system but honestly it's fine as it is.
Sure, you don't have as many stats to put points in but is that really a bad thing?
Look at which of the five phases works best with the weapon you like to use the most or the spells that look the most fun and put points into those stats.
If you want to try a different weapon or set of spells you can always just re-distribute those stats later on.

Quick note on the story.
Wo Long is based on the Romance of the Three Kingdoms so if you know your Chinese history you basically know the story of the game.
I don't know if I really liked it's implementation though, I liked the story (probably due to my bias) and most of the game felt like it had a good pace to it but then the ending just felt really rushed...
The ending was also incredibly unsatisfying and I think it's partly due to the story of the last part of the game feeling really rushed but also how the last couple main bosses just straight up were some of the most boring and easiest boss fights in the game, even though they felt like the most hyped up ones.
The last main boss fight was alright though, but since it came a little out of nowhere it felt like the game didn't have any momentum left and as such, it just felt like a chore to do.

As for the graphics and the sound I don't really have much to say.
It's a really beautiful game and I like the art direction they've got going.
The music is really nice and the sound effects sound really nice too.

Lastly a quick note on the state of the game.
Wo Long needs more time in the oven, there's no other way to put it.
Even though I enjoyed playing through it and don't regret buying it, it shouldn't have been released in the state it was released in.
Now don't get me wrong, the game is in a playable state...
Aside from one map that's basically guaranteed to hard crash every 10 minutes, most of the game runs just fine and doesn't crash THAT often.
Sure, a couple of times I'd get a lag spike during a critical moment where I'd need to dodge and basically at least once every minute I'd get a white flash and in a few places the lighting effects are non-existant but other than that it runs fine.
However, because of that lack of polish I can't really in good conscience give this game a good review.
It's a 69,99€ game for Christs sake, had it been half that price I could probably overlook it being unpolished but not with this price tag!
So until they've polished up the game to a standard that reflects the price they're asking for I'm going to leave this game a negative review. (Ooo, scary!)

Buy it if it seems interesting and you've got the funds to spare.
Or don't.
It's your money, why would I care?

TL;DR
It's an easier Souls-Like game that's fun but towards the end of the game it feels rushed. 
It's also really unpolished and needs more work from the developers.

[Edit]
So apparently there are issues with keyboard+mouse.
I did try to play through a stage with it and aside from some weird button placements like dodge on tab (which you can change in the settings), and having to manually go into settings and switch from controller layout to keyboard+mouse it seemed to work fine for me.
Maybe I'm just lucky, maybe I didn't test it enough, maybe they recently patched it but either way, from what people say the game might be completely unplayable without a controller.
[Edit end]
[Edit 2]
According to patch notes the keyboard+mouse problems should be fixed but as I haven't really confirmed it myself I'm letting my previous edit stand.

Something happened here because they forgot to include the same inventory management and general UX that the Niohs had. Meanwhile, Wo Long shuffles uncomfortably close to Sekiro in gameplay by making the player rely too much one mechanic, the Deflection (""parry"") : The B / Circle button becomes the ""make everything better"" button, the way every fight should be solved according to the designers. 

In general it's hard to react to enemies on the fly, the game expects you to act in anticipation and know boss moves by heart, not doing anything but Blocking and Deflecting until the time comes to press your advantage... but only for an attack or two or you'll get destroyed because you can't cancel your animations to block, deflect or dodge. The combat ends up feeling same-y with your chosen weapon because you don't have more than 1 or 2 special moves while the Nioh games had an entire tree of actives and passives for each weapon class. It feels like such a downgrade.

Magic in Wo Long has been severely nerfed into costing the player stamina, that thing that kills you very fast when you don't have any. You have to (again) use Deflection properly a couple of times before even considering casting one spell, or you're putting yourself in danger of being swiftly staggered by the enemy.

They did something strange with equipment where you just gotta go get 1 set of gear that you want and then you just keep upgrading it for the rest of the game. I wouldn't mind except items are raining as much as in Niohs yet the inventory management is way worse and you don't need to switch gear anyway, giving a feeling that item drops are unimportant and just get in the way.

Fights against more than one bosses are a nightmare, but that's very standard for Team Ninja games. Still, having a prompt appear when the second or third boss is moving in with a red unblockable attack from off-screen would have been nice and feels like a basic UX fail. 

It raises the point of playtesting. Did they play their own missions? Did they see that Wo Long's first boss is tougher than the 6-7 following bosses and will discourage new players from learning their game? Did they want to maximize their Steam refunds in some strange 4D chess move? The first boss is not unsurmountable, but again, basic game design rules have been forgotten and I can't help but think Team Ninja has done a better job before.

I have completed Sekiro twice, it's my favourite game. I have also completed Nioh 2, to the second DLC. I am now only trying to complete this game because I payed R800 (about 60 dollars) for this game and can't refund it anymore, but honestly, I might just uninstall this after this review is done.I am not going to talk about the performance, or the fact that KOEI TECMO never fixed the camera before launch, I am only going to review the game. 

 If you don't want to read this entire review, just take this away: This is not a souls like, it is a AI co-op level grinding game with a poor deflect mechanic with a frustrating level scaling system, with only three bosses of the first 12 that are fun, and a story that you can't possibly follow. This game is not Nioh, it is not sekiro, it should not be compared to these games, it's not even close to those games in quality, content or fun factor.

Now, I will explain in depth why I 80% of this game.

1. The Moral system.
This is my far the worst part of this game, because it destroys the souls like element of this game completely . Every level you start with a level 0 moral the boss at the end is always level 20. You can think of moral, like a damage and health multiplier. The lower your moral the less damage you do and the more damage you take. This goes both ways. There are flags across every map, large flags (that are your checkpoints and raise Moral by 2) and small flags (which raise your moral by 1). You have a set moral that you can keep after each flag you take and which can not be taken away. Before I get into the second issue of this system. Let me break down why this already destroys this game's soul like tag: Difficulty can be changed and it's between two scales, 1 you do way to little damage and take way to much (where a boss can one shot you with their default light attack) and 2, where you do so much damage and take so little, that you barely have to focus and can just grind until level 25, where you can kick a bosses ass. This now takes us to our second point of this system: The fact that levels can be taken away, if you do not grind all the flags. If you are hit by a red attack, failing to parry it (which you will, trust me) you lose a level. Get attacked by 6 enemies at the same time, get hit 4 times, lose 4 levels. Now you probably have 2 level 9 enemies and one level 10. If you die, then that last enemy gains a level, but you go back to what your set limit was. So if you got 9 levels, but were unable to find 3 flags let's say, you are now level 2 about. Which means, you now need to kill those 3 enemies, that are at least 7 levels higher than you, which mean they take 7 times less damage than you do, and do 7 the amount. I fucking hate this system, and it's a disgrace that it was put in this game.

2.  The parry system:
The parry system is not horrible, but it's not fun. This is not Sekiro, it does it much worse and through some questionable decisions it makes the game's combat un-fun. It does this again in a few ways. Firstly, the moral system, as I said, the parry system now becomes fear inducing grind, rather than just dying, so when you fail a parry, you are not frustrated by your lack of skill, you want to just close the game, because you again have to waste 20 minutes grinding. Secondly, parry barely effects the poise of the enemy, unless if you parry the red attacks. (In sekiro, you could deflect a single attack chain and fatal strike them killing them. In this game, it takes about 40 parries without the red attacks. This becomes worse when you consider block has no downsides other than to raise your poise slightly. (In sekiro, if you miss a deflect and you tried to block, you were punished for it, blocking could be broken easily, and it it was, you were open to an attack for about two seconds, making it very likely you would die.) So with parry being risky and the timing sometimes not even activating, This means you could just hold block and only parry when you are 100% sure you can. If you parry about 40% of enemy attacks and the two red attacks they constantly throw at you, you will kill them very quickly, and you will barely break a sweat, and hey, fear not, if you are the same level as them, they won't really hurt you that much anyway, as long as you start blocking again soon. The last thing, is the parry timing. In sekiro, you time the parry the moment the strike hits you. In this game is slightly before. Not a horrible thing, until you consider that sometimes four or five enemies attack you at once, and all of them have offset timing. It's not the exact timing their sword would hit you, but about a half second before that. 

3.  AI companions.
For most main story missions you are forced to play with two other AI companions that will help you throughout the level. You can't turn them off. This combining the moral system makes this game laughably easy compared to Nioh, Sekiro or dark souls.

4. All the weapons have the same attacks.
The weapon animations are nice and yes, they are varied, but you can't change them like in Nioh (WHY?!) there is not skill tree for your weapons. You have light attack and heavy attack. You can't even choose different martial arts for weapons. So, most encounters: Light, block, light, deflect/block, light, light, deflect (red), heavy, dead. This is 90% of fights. The animations feel satisfying, the fighting feels good for the most part. But when every single encounter is this, with some slight variance in the degree of parries and heavies, it just becomes really stale, really soon.

5. The bosses:
The first boss is good, Oaye is good, and Lu bu is fun. The rest...are either really cheap  and frustrating (like duplication fight) or just really, really bad (Taotie, what a laughable boss)  I am now at sun jian. He is fine, but I have two AI companions that I can't turn off, so took away his first phase first try.  that means, of the compulsory bosses, I have killed 11 out of 20. Look most of them...are fine. But none of them are memorable or fun like the three I named at the start, or come even close to some of Nioh 2's bosses. Like the fire dude with the gourd. So, if grind is not fun and the only reason I am grinding is to get to the boss, why would I continue if the boss was a huge disappointment.

6. The story:
I was really excited to delve into the Chinese story of the three kingdoms, the first few missions, I was really into it, but every mission, you just get a new companion, in a new area, with no context, other than ""this place has been corrupted by old dude with beard"" I mean, for crying out loud, one moment you are fighting Lu bu after a huge battle. The second, you are talking with people you have never met in a burning city. Once that's done, you teleport to a shore, with two new people, wanting to win a battle. There is no grounding the player and the story that is there, is impossible to follow. Usually, souls games don't have stories really, but Wo long, seemed to want to change that with the trailers. Yeah no. Except in this case, it's not hidden away in items, it's hidden away somewhere between ancient Chinese legends and the made up parts of Wo long, good luck trying to figure out what the hell your character is actually doing, other than fighting a war as a soldier.

Verdict:
This...is not a fun game, it's a huge grind, with mediocre bosses, a non existent, an extremely incoherent story, a a combat system only made around grind and spamming the block button with some attacks and deflects. Combine this with points I did not even mention, such as the poor tacked on stealth ( walk slowly to the back of an enemy like in Nioh...) or the fact that there is basically no gear variety in this game. (about...6 sets after 16 hours?) It's just...not worth the asking price, and quite frankly is a disgrace.",1678391532,1678466375,False,1,1,0.476190477609634399,1,True,False,False

     When I started to write my opinion about Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty my thoughts went into different directions. First of all I need to say that I wasn't faced with technical issues in single player but online in this game is totally painful. Around 70% of online sessions are “teleport” experience, where you are trying to understand what is going on. 

     I like the new battle system, but can’t say that it is fair enough. Oftentimes you will play in defense and parry. 
     I like visual. It looks gorgeous and stylish, but you will be faced with “PS3 textures” and low quality shadows from time to time.
     I like locations in this game, they are much bigger than in Nioh and have a vertical structure. But rewards for level exploration is “naaaahhh” very poor.  
     I like bosses design, but a lot of them have boring fights.

The combat - the reason why I choose this kind of game - is painfully absurd sometimes. The enemies plainly ignore hits, and doge attacks like they were possessed by some ghostly force - even jumping out of the screen sometimes- and there is a constant delay between the inputs and the reactions in-game. It’s odd… to say the least. 

I have played Dark Souls 1,  Dark Souls 2 - yes… with its infamous hitboxes - and Dark Souls 3 when they were released on PS and totally busted them to almost absolute completion. I am currently playing Nioh 2 - Nioh 1 I also finished it long ago - and I’m deeply enjoying Nioh 2 difficulty and combat - as well as all the others - yet…. I’m stuck at my 67 attempt to pass through this game's first boss… it is just insane. 

Would not recommend it at all… they either fix the frame rate and input issues, or this thing becomes almost unplayable. 

PS: It seems after the patch, the ‘phasing effect’ on enemies has completely disappeared. Also, the framerate issues have improved noticeably, and the delay between inputs and actions in-game has reduced to a playable state. Even so… I would not recommend it - although I even got the deluxe version, so much was my hype for this being a fanatic ‘souls’ like game - and the main reasons to do not recommend this game - not even to hardcore souls players - are now design reasons that I don’t think any patch will fix.

The Morale & Fortitude System: It sucks… I mean, I could further elaborate in a more detailed explanation of why it seems unnecessary and at the same time, counterproductive - it takes away the feeling of achievement and hard-earn progression derived from farming and grinding over and over the enemies - as one single hit from a critical can easily take down an entire morale point, and further more, you won’t defeat the boss at the first try - most likely - so farming and farming to reach the highest morale before the battle with the boss is a thing you have to do every-fucking-time you want to try your luck battling a boss… this is absurd.  And a complete waste of time, that produces only two results: you clutter your inventory with shit that is not valuable or useful… and you end up hating the level you are in… A million times killing the same fucking dog is a bit too much of an overkill, in my honest opinion. In fact, I could even understand Team Ninja feelings regarding China post-covid… but I think they overdo it a bit… I have done things to some enemies trying to grind this horrible morale system that I won’t even think to do to the Wuhan bats… 

Inventory is terrible: It is literally like going to a Chinese bazaar… piles and piles of cheap useless things all bundle together. I had, after the first mission, over a thousand pieces of the same crappy weapons. Granted, it took me 68 - to be precise - attempts to beat the first boss…. which is just close to insanity. Dark Souls played with the mechanic of hollowing… but Wo Long perfected it. After 35 attempts, I felt absolutely hollow inside… and I had no equipment that could significantly make a difference and ease the pain of going through that first absurdly difficult first boss. 

The first boss…: God please be merciful of me if ever I have to make a different character. The grinding combined with the battle itself is just too much of a pain… this is not the idea behind Souls games. They are not supposed to be artificially complex or difficult, and trust me… there is no learning curve with the first boss… It is just an exercise in pain. The patterns are relatively easy to figure out, and then some are just impossible to time with the parry/deflect thing… The reeds growing in the field make the boss attack so fricking hard to see, the input delay also adds to the mix, and then… just when you think you have it under control… your AI retarded assistant kicks in, to hit the boss and break the chain of hits you are currently working on.

After 25h of gameplay that felt like Nioh, played like Nioh, I was expecting an endgame like Nioh. Unfortunately, the gear cap at +9, there no ascended items neither there is +15 are so on. You can now receive, at NG+, 5* gear instead of 4* gear. (took me 3h of intense grinding to get the full set I wanted on NG) The only difference it make, it add one stats that will not change upgrade your build by much. Can only add one attack modifier per piece and the rest are more status duration and defensive perks. Apart maybe some new gear set that you can find, I got 2 piece of this new set in 10h of gameplay in NG+. 

I need to talk about the Moral rank system. Hmm it is weird, I feel that it completly disable to power of the gear I have. I can go do the first boss of the game with no moral and despite being full max gear still do no damage cause of the difference in ''rank''. Let's say that you have 15 moral and the boss has 20. It will take you much more to hit him then if you where at 20 and you will probably get one tap by every critical ability they do. It softcap at 20 with all the flag in the zone. Hardcap at 25. In NG+ all boss are at 25. I suppose that in NG++ they are at 30. I love challenge but sponge mob, a bit less. 

That said I am not recommending the game at the current state. For 90 bucks I advise yall to wait for the full DLC release and maybe the gameplay and performance will be in a better shape.",1677842294,1678445254,False,0,0,0.518204629421234131,7,True,False,False

I'm really really enjoying this game. The combat is extremely satisfying and it's a good looking game. Some bosses are challenging and different and the ability to parry literally everything feels incredible, though I'd appreciate the requirement to jump over certain attacks to add some variety.

Level visuals, enemy variety, the magic system, music, plot and some QOL elements have taken a step back from their previous game. English voice acting is worse than what I hear weekly in my amateur DnD game and rather than tying you directly into the plot as a character like in Nioh, you are a nameless former militia soldier from the beginning to after defeating many of the famous generals, heroes and demons of the land. It becomes somewhat grating midway through the game when you have directly fixed many of China's demonic problems. If you don't have a passing knowledge of the Three Kingdoms’ events you will be lost and even then there are some changes and twists that seem pointless.

The game runs basically fine, but there's the rare FPS dip or the extremely rare crash -- usually after a whole day of playing. In total I crashed about 5 times in 84 hours and the majority of them resulted in no progress lost, and the few times I lost progress it was only a minute or two.


Overall, it is a fun game, especially if you enjoyed their past games: Nioh/Nioh2; however, Wo Long does pretty much everything just a little bit worse than Nioh 2, too. It feels like a game that would have come out before Nioh 2, instead of after it. Subjectively, the theme (Three Kingdoms, China) is a lot less cool than Youkai + Sengoku Jidai + Japan, too.

The real problem is, games can not always be better than the last game you played, or the last game a developer made and if you always compared them like that you would have an unbelievably and unreasonably high ceiling for what is now a ""good"" game. So despite being a little worse than Nioh 2, it is still a fun/good game -- with a year of upcoming patches/DLC planned, mind you.

I did not run into a lot of technical issue, that other people complain about, the game crashed 2 times during almost 60hours of playtime. Also Patch 1.03 seems to fix quite a bunch of technical issue. Hopefully further updates and patches, improve the game more. 

Nioh felt more polished and more complex than WoLong, but this does not limit the entertainment, when you like this type of game. Also as fan of the Dynasty Warriors Series, it is fun to see all these iconic characters. 
The item and build variety feels too weak for my liking and the active weapon skills are unfortunately quite boring. I barely use them, because most of the time the skills have a weird targeting behaviour, it feels like they do not really connect with the enemy. Deflecting and counterattcking feels way more response and impactful. The multiplayer is also not as good as it was implemented in Nioh.


Endnote: A lot of people probably had too high expectations that the game could not quite fullfil. Unfortunately technical issues are a farely common and a shame for every new game. Just give the devs at least some time to respond and fix stuff, before raging. 
For hardcore souls/nioh/sekiro/rogue-like players, the game might be too easy, but from another point of view, some could say it is more beginner friendly, and gives players who are new to this generes the opportunity to grow into it.

Not sure with the negativity. I only crashed 2-3 times in random menu sections and cut scenes that are auto saved so I didnt lose progress.

Its not so bad when you consider that you can guard (and attempt to deflect to mitigate damage), and that there's a pretty large window before being struck where you can actually trigger a deflect.

With a little practice, it's not too difficult - even the first boss which I thought was ""hard"" at first fell pretty easily once I started really focusing on improvement. I see people saying that this is ""harder"" than Sekiro but that's just.. categorically false. You'll have a hard time unless you learn to take advantage of the easiest ways to defeat enemies - which are linked directly to deflecting.

 [Edit : After changing to a build that is more my play style (aggressive, damage based) the game is even better. I ran through the very first area in less than 5 minutes and spent maybe 10 defeating the boss (died a few times).  At this point any gripes I've had with the game have dissolved.]

Edit 2: 20 hours in and I now use that ""very difficult"" first boss as fodder to test my builds. The recent performance update came as well so I'm having more fun than ever.

If you are the type of person who loves a challenge; who plays souls-like games because you love the punishment the game puts you through until you finally ""git good"", I would say hard pass on Wo Long. It's pretty anticlimactic when you run right through the final boss, especially when the first boss of the game posed somewhat of an actual challenge.

There is like 6 different enemy types you will see in the missions over and over and over again... making the game feel pretty stale, pretty early on.

80% of your time is spent beating up on easy mobs who pose no real threat as you look for flags scattered around the map and make your way over to the boss location... making the only engaging part of the game the boss battle, which not only makes up a small part of your play time, but doesn't even feel all that rewarding when you do finally get to experience it.

The combat system does feel good though. Very fast and fluid. Too bad Team Ninja wasted it on non challenging combatants.

The story and presentation is (IMO) the best out of all their games so far. It was still a bit hard to follow but the characters were interesting enough. 

The combat is also very fun, especially at the start of the game. It can feel very responsive and satisfying. Some of the weapon types can feel very similar, but they do have quite a few different weapon types to choose from. The balance is definitely a bit off, but not terrible for a single player. Staves are probably the best weapon type in the game because they build the stagger meter quickly. 

Speaking of the stagger meter, the parry mechanic is very good... but it also doesn't feel quite right. You will parry A LOT of attacks in this game, but really the only attacks worth parrying are the red power attacks. Parrying regular attacks increases the enemies stagger bar so insignificantly that it basically doesn't matter. On bosses it can often feel like you are waiting for the boss to do a power attack so you finally parry and do something. Since its random, sometimes you can be waiting quite a while for a boss to do a power attack. It gets frustrating quickly because it feels like you SHOULD be doing well due to the amount of attacks that you are parrying, but it doesn't reward the player at all. Parrying regular attacks should be more rewarding, but instead it just ends up feeling like a chore. 

All Team Ninja games have severe item bloat. I hate they way that their item system works. Most of the gear you get is basically worthless. There is gear that has set bonuses, and there is gear that doesn't. They do have a good decoration system so you CAN use these pieces for cosmetic reasons, but you probably won't want to. The set bonus pieces are also typically the sets that look the coolest as well. 

Rather than finding unique items in the game, you instead find the same pieces of gear over and over. Once you beat a specific boss, their gear can start dropping randomly in the world. You can also farm bosses, or level your companionship level to unlock new sets. There just isn't a reason for so much gear to drop. Sets should drop one time with one tier of quality, similar to dark souls. Unique pieces of loot should be hidden in chests, gotten from bosses, or found throughout the map. Opening a chest for the 100th time to get another piece of worthless gear is just a brain dead decision. 

All Team Ninja games basically start to feel too long by the end. They also get a bit too easy towards the end of the power curve and that can cause me to lose interest. I got to the very end of the first Nioh and barely finished the second one. They can feel long for the sake of being long. 

Overall... there's nothing new here but its still a fun game to play through if you like these type of games. Definitely worth 60 bucks.

This especially bad with it comes to intense situations or even just simple platforming. Game also crashed on me twice and I thought maybe it was just my graphics card could handle the game but judging from everyone's review. It seems I'm not the only one. Also fell through the floor one time on the level featuring the famous Battle Of Hulao Gate. I exited the battle and returned to the main menu to only find out my save game was broken upon trying to load the game causing the game to crash-to-desktop instead. And now I'm having to restart the game to only have the game crash on me mid-level with Sun Jian as an ally. Nioh 2's combat is far superior and more complex which is sad considering how old Nioh 2 is now. Love the spirit system but I hate the parry system as it can pretty much break the flow of combat especially when it comes to pvp. Making any careful planning or strategy completely obsolete added the fact your character can parry from any and all angle regardless of where they are facing trivializing mobs. 

But all in all, the terrible performance issues and bugs are still the biggest problem and needs to be fixed ASAP or people will quickly move away from this game.  Romance Of The Three Kingdoms is one of my favorite stories and I would love to see how this game ends but so far, the terrible fps and crashes is a huge let down for me.

Update: a recent update was release addressing much of the framerate issues. Personally, I still get some drops in framerate here and there but not so much anymore. So that is a plus. However, the game still crashes. Especially during cutscenes. (Spoiler warming) As of after the recent update, the first crash occurred during the cutscene involving Sun Jian transfoming and then again after defeating Xiahou Dun.

I do want to say, this game is vastly inferior to Nioh 2. The only thing it did better than Nioh 2 was having a bigger area to explore with more verticality allowing players to land surprise attacks if they take their time exploring a little while punishing if you decide to run instead. Other than that, Nioh 2 still surpasses this game considering the fact both were made by the same devs and Nioh 2 is old as hell. Avoid this game until goes on sale and play Nioh 2 instead.

latest edit: 16 hours in, there have been ~30 crashes thus far in my playthrough. cannot recommend this until technical issues are fixed
tl;dr on technical issues: really unacceptable for a triple A title to have these sorts of issues on launch. the last time i remember having this little fun on launch was diablo 3, and we all remember what a dumpster fire that was.
final edit: as of 1.03, it appears the crashes on my system have been addressed, so i can rec this game again

now, once you can actually PLAY the game, it's quite fun. the core mechanics add a new spin to the existing souls formula: the parry is more generous than in sekiro, but to capitalize on it, you need to follow-up, either immediately with an expedited attack, or by utilizing your growing spirit gauge, so it makes up for easier execution w/ a subsequent execution check.

do i like this game more than nioh 2? definitely not in these first 8 hours. what team ninja did with nioh, especially nioh 2, was put the onus on the player to be as technical and effective as possible with their offense as possible, which gave it a niche within which to excel in the genre. with the removal of stance swapping and other mechanics from nioh, and with this new focus on defense (with many bosses taking negligible damage unless you properly parry them), wo long competes directly with sekiro, and doesn't quite rise to the challenge due to one critical flaw - boss design. at least 3 out of the first 4 bosses leave much to be desired, and are some of the worst ones out of the games i've played in the soulsborne genre (bloodborne, sekiro, elden ring, nioh 1/2, strangers of paradise). it's hard to say if it's because of my comparatively low specs and frame rate, but the animations/attack patterns just are way below par compared to those in fromsoft games, or even compared to those in nioh 1/2.

however, the core system is still fun enough that i can recommend this game to those who enjoy the other souls-likes from team ninja, or are just looking for another mid-tier soulsborne game to play. perhaps my opinion will change as i get further and encounter more enemies and bosses, but for now, i can only give this game a 7 or 8 out of 10: minus 2-3 for boss design and technical issues and plus 7-8 for a fresh and solid take on the core souls combat formula.",1677863399,1678404396,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

2nd Update: Beaten most of the ""Hard"" mode fights without friends or AI and the game is still rather easy. My buds agree its just not much of a challenge and game ends up feeling like dynasty warriors (press X you win). Its not that bad but its not Sekiro in the end that is for sure. The bosses honestly never get that crazy, even on hard the patterns are the same the bosses just have more health and you take more damage (artifical challenge). Strongly agree this is not a 60 Dollar game, do not get unless on sale

3rd Update: Initially gave the game a thumbs up but have changed to thumbs down, the game is just unstable. After the patch a friend and I lost progress on a Hard mode map and had severe lag. I have lost data because the game crashed and it has a stupid method for saving. Now that my other friend has lost data while helping him I can not recommend the game. 

Initial Review:
The game definitely has some issues with performance, I have a 6800XT, friend has RTX 2060 and another has 1650. All of us crashed at different points in the time we played, we all noticed severe lag while playing together. Enemies would rubber band all over the place and it made playing a bit rough.

Certain levels such as the ones with the fire in the burning city really impacted my friends systems. It was fine for me (mostly) but even my friend with 2060 had issues with certain environment items.The fire in particular was pretty rough. 

we all agreed that when the game worked it was fun and combat was pretty satisfying, but we also noticed it wasn't all that hard, besides Lu Bu, lu Bei and maybe final boss there was never any crazy challenge. The game does have a difficulty increase after beating game so will run again and see how that works.

we wanted to like the game but with the length of the main story we agreed that 60 bucks isnt the right price, I'd say wait for a patch and a price drop before getting. Maybe at 30 bucks and some optimization it will be a solid buy.

First of all, I had no technical issues at all, I've started playing after the mouse fix.

I felt like they were making Nioh 3 then managament wanted to get in on the Sekiro success train & changed the game midway.

I'm convinced that this giant failure is a result of bad management, not a bad dev team at all.

I absolutely hate the morale system, more time you spend killing smaller fry, stronger stats you have for final boss. If you rush through it, boss can 1-2 shot you easily. If you clear the entire map, your reward is an easy boss fight. Your strength is only valid for that mission/map alone though, you'll have to farm morale in the next mission too.

-The only game atm that somewhat resembles Sekiro's combat.
-Implements RPG elements (e.g., char creation, weapon types) that were absent in Sekiro.
-Martial arts and wizard skills being tied to spirit (i.e., stamina) makes the combat more fluid as casting is not reliant on MP/spirit emblems that require the player to chug potions or hurt themselves to replenish.
-Most bosses deliver the Sekiro experience. 

Cons:
-Button mapping. I do not know why they thought that mapping deflect and dodge in one button was good. Double pressing deflect by mistake can cost you esp when you were aiming for a deflect. Would have been better if it was similar to Sekiro where deflect and block were mapped together.
-Inability to cancel out of ""light attacks"". Weapons have long combos with some (e.g., swords, spears) having multiple strikes within combos. Some of these multiple strikes happen as early as the second ""light attack"" trigger (e.g., spears) and the inability to cancel mid attack via deflects or dodges can be annoying esp if you didn't intend to commit to the attack. 
-Enemy lock-on. I was spoiled by Sekiro with enemy lock-on prioritising the closest (and hence most dangerous) enemy. Manually having to switch lock-on among enemies back-and-forth is an extra step of annoying micromanagement. 
-Enemies, esp mobs, can be too slow to attack (I acknowledge this might change in NG+). This takes away the rush of exchange between the player and the enemies.

There were abilities to mix and match for each weapon that made everything fun and customizable. With Wo Long there is no customization, no experimentation. You fight with what you're given, the martial arts all feel so slow, sluggish, and boring. The blue and red bar is just stupid, the wizardry spells are so underwhelming it HURTS.

They could have EASILY just used Nioh 2's formula, which was PERFECT, and made it Chinese themed. New weapons, new techniques, keep the stance switching. Like...come on, man. This is just depressing. I was so excited for this game and it just turned out to be a sad ripoff.

Measly 25 hours for a semi-completionist playthrough (46/51 achievements), not just because there are less missions than in both Nioh games (and most of them feel smaller) but also because the game is incredibly easy thanks to the retarded morale system; you'll always end up with a higher morale level than the boss and therefore a big advantage. That stops in ng+ where you'll almost always be at a lower morale level than the boss, who's then more likely to just one shot you if you aren't using some tanky build. Weapon variety and movesets are shit; there's 13 different types of weapon but really it's more like 4 or 5 (1h sword, dual swords, axe, staff/spear), with some having slight changes. RNG martial arts is a terrible idea, and most of the ones I was stuck with were useless. Most of the magic beside weapon enchanting felt pointless to use; most of my playthrough (as a Water Phase user) my deck was just Frost Lance for Huo Shu and other weak enemies, Alacrity Haste for if I needed to backtrack for a flag or something more quickly, Aqua Blink which I didn't even really use, and Ice Weapon which was at least somewhat impactful. The enemy variety is pathetic, and some are just reskins or straight up rips of Nioh enemies. ""Sekiro but only use mikiri counters"" is the best way I can describe how all the boss fights end up.  Also, because the game focuses so much on upgrading gear instead of dropping gear, there's no replay value or anything because your build is finished in the first 5 hours.

The game is playable regarding optimisation, but its design/experience is barely mediocre at best.
Yes, the fighting mechanics are somewhat fun, but nowhere near the sophistication or polish of other established games.

The most ""hooked"" I was the entire game? When the druid lady was tossing me some random lines about her childhood while exploring a bamboo grove. Yeah, nah.

1) The story and area design are as generic as can be. Red stringy glow = bad. Demons bad. Demon Qi makes people go bad and stronk. NPCs are mostly the same personality. Cheerful self-obsessed honor-dudes.

2) Mini-/Bosses are utterly boring pushovers and/or DBZ level of useless screaming while you end the fight before the are done buffing. I just first tried the last three major area bosses and do not feel anything. No I was not over-levelling/farming. Just exploring the areas as much as necessary to fix the morale ( wtf? ) at a reasonable level to progress to the next area.

3) The fight itself has no structure aside from ""fill up your posture, hit him with spirit attack, repeat until crit, repeat"". It's all just really broken RNG as well. Sometimes you parry the big bad ( they start to glow red - scary! ) critical hit after which they are supposed to be dizzy ( not staggered for critical, but enough time for a heavy/spirit attack pushing them more to being crit'able ), yet RNG just rips them out and lands on another critical move, while you are left with a full focus bar ( the bad posture rip-off from Sekiro ) having to parry another needlessly ""intense"" anime-sequence full of moaning ( not the good kind ) being screwed out of any reward, as your focus bar cannot be more than full.

4) Did I mention, there is no animation cancelling? No? Well - there isn't. So fights lack flow for the most part. When in doubt a more defensive choice will be rewarded, as it does not lock you in an animation, that will guarantee damage taken.
If you know all the opportunities in an enemies move-set already, it gets better, but at that point the fight should be trivial already anyway.

5) Every reward/drop is just a randomised loot box. Nothing special about any of them, no ties to the world/surroundings/enemies/NPCs living there. Just a roll of the dice. I just stopped picking them up, as the first weapon with semi-decent move-set from the early game did the job for the entire game.

6) Upgrading is done by one resource for weapons/armour respectively. No infusions like in Souls to change the weapon somewhat fundamentally.

7) They spam you with upgrade materials and admit that their loot is garbage at the same time! - ""How?"" you ask? By giving you the option to insta-select all items below a certain ""rarity"" allowing you to disassemble them all at the same time, showering you in upgrade materials, which you then can drop to a little demon-panda ( which is not bad, because it's a cute panda..? And the Qi is not a problem either? O_o ) who gives you other useless random crap for it.

8) The level system is nonexistent. I just skilled what was scaling well with the one weapon that was semi-decent and never really challenged by anything and then just full on dumped all the points in the one stat with the best scaling once I saw there was nothing relevant happening anyway.

This is NOT worth 70 bucks, nor 100 with any DLCs to come, nor 30h of your time. No, this is not ANYTHING like Sekiro and you need to be REALLY bored to put up with 85% of it, to experience 15% fun.

I would recommend buying this at no more than 20 bucks.
For the sake of a whole community, I really hope Nioh was on another level.

PROS:
Smooth Rewarding combat
Great weapon and skill design
beautiful sound design
Satisfying platforming
great build diversity

Cons:
World map isn't nearly as intuitive as in Nioh
occasional game killing glitches
(as of now) cant choose what skills your weapon has (could change in NG+ or NG++
less skills than Nioh
Moral system is a great idea terribly implemented 

Overall i have great respect for what Team Ninja did here, they went out of their comfort zone and it payed off, i am disappointed about their lazy port. However, they are quickly patching it. like i said the over world quest map sucks in comparison to Nioh. I like the idea of having a hub like in Darksouls, but i hate the messy spread out, confusing hub town they made.  i grant this game a very solid 7/10 as of now (opinions might improve during the NG+)",1678368627,1678368627,True,2,0,0.445736974477767944,0,True,False,False

+ bosses are cool and epic, their skill sets and concept are fantastic, I was really amused (Lu Bu <3)
+ solo play without NPCs (sending them away in the beginning of each mission) was fun and exactly what I wanted to get from the game
+ rewarding exploration and fun stealth moments
+ magic is quite based, but having halbert/earth build - found one spell that I included in common use (after sub-mission 3vs1) and that was cool after first half of the game just in melee combat. Later on NG+ added lightning cuz of need for more HP, also had fun using it.
+ NG+ letting to achieve some joy from loot

- feels like side project of nioh/stranger of paradise with simplificated mechanics regarding skill tree and equipment, that is really half-job after Nioh 2 - hopes for DLC addictions
- NPCs start follow you everywhere by default - I was made sending them away on each mission for solo play
- no much difference between weapons in play style
- weapon skills are tied up to weapon, can't be replaced, no actual combos as in Nioh
- needance of collect flags on missions again and again - otherwise one shots on NG+
- no new mobs/bosses movements on NG+ as I found out so far

The game is amazing. As a long time fan of Dynasty Warriors, I really enjoy the Three Kingdoms story and history that this game's narrative takes root in. There might be a light confusion with some characters since they will be referred to by two names (it's an old Chinese thing, look up ""courtesy names"" if you are interested) but the general narrative plot is pretty straight forward. 

The combat feels SATISFYING to partake in. I think this game's combat system is the embodiment of the Bruce Lee quote ""Be like water"". To some people the heavy emphasis on parry/deflect is annoying but I think that it fits well with the time period. It's a literal Wuxia fantasy brought to life.

I'm so tired of the whole ""dodge (parry in this case) the attack strings and then attack"" style combat. You die not because you are bad, but because you've not seen the new attack strings. And after you die a couple of times and seen all (or almost all) the attack patterns, you can easily defeat them, and everything you've learnt becomes useless to the rest of the game. This is making all bosses feel the same, and making the whole game such a chore to go through.

Add to that the worst level design I've seen in a while, and the plot that feels non-existent, there is really no motivation for me to even finish the game.

Right now I'm convinced that even if the current Team Ninja WANT to make a new Ninja Gaiden game, they CAN'T because they've already lost the talent. It's a miracle how the Nioh games found the amount of success they did.

Edit: Trying to push myself through this game in order to be fair with this review and so far can confirm the game doesn't get any better. Some bosses get some interesting visual design (and some moves look quite cool) but the fights themselves are even worse than I thought: all you need to do is to pay attention to the red attacks.

Honestly it feels like the best strategy for the enemies is to not do any of them...

The story feels pointless and just keeps going on and on and on...which makes going through the story very hopeless. The levels get easier and easier which makes them feel even more boring...

1、系列游戏的进步来源于对同类前作在游戏规则设计，同类动作框架设计现存瑕疵和缺点的不断改进，而卧龙相对于仁王两代前作，除了降低化解难度之外，几乎没有任何规则和结构上的新意，完全是在仁王的框架之下进行规则阉割简单换皮和更换故事背景的小学生完成小作文作业水平的低劣制作，程序BUG之多，妖魔类与日本传统妖魔类文化杂交之广，不深究中国元素本源就生搬硬套的粗糙做法实在领人难以看出制作组在本做作品上的任何诚意。是典型的看你喜欢投其所好靠着以前的品牌名声劣质制作赚一把是一把的下流商业行为。

2、仁王系列固有的设计缺点在于过分强调少数单位动作类的框架设计，很难承载越来越多格斗单位同时对打的场景，而这帮人往常设计的游戏锁定机制的问题也在于此，现行最主流的很多实景动作游戏对于这一问题的解决办法是完善非锁定状态下的格斗体系，以弱化锁定状态下针对多目标的操作局限，但毫无疑问忍者组的这帮人一直也没有真的能解决他们这一系列这个设计上的最致命缺陷。而卧龙除此以外，也没有从其他方面超越仁王2，只是一部平庸无期的作品。

3、主机游戏设计者的傲慢显露无疑，既然你看不起PC游戏用户，既然你固守主机阵地，你做好主机游戏市场就是了，然而这帮人看着日益发展的电脑优势又不禁贪心不足的要来赚PC用户的钱，但他们甚至都没有在自己的测试中测试键鼠配合的实际表现就把存在严重系统优化问题的游戏上市，这种看不起你还要套你钱包，套你钱包还要你跪着把钱包上贡给他的态度，简直令人呕吐。日本传统被世界认可的匠人精神至少在他们这帮傲慢的人身上是一点都没有体现。",1678354832,1678354930,False,6,1,0.472875386476516724,0,True,False,False

But I will continue to play for a few more hours in hopes that the game changes my mind on something.

Combat feels bad. Sometimes you will try and attack someone but your character as this really wide turn radius - so you and the mob you are trying to hit will keep attacking around each other but nothing will connect. Similarly attempting to parry some moves I feel like I am accidentally moving out of the way of attacks instead of landing the parry.

Bosses all play out the same way (so far) - wait for them to do a move where they glow red, parry it, hit Y, repeat until dead. The tutorial boss felt especially bad. The first phase can be stunlocked from 100 - 0. But he is a health sponge so It feels like a waste of time. Then his second phase introduces you to the real boss formula of the game. Parry Red Attack > Hit Y > Repeat until you charge meter (which can be used essentially as a free parry. The tutorial boss, charging the meter and using it seems to end the fight with a cinematic.

Earlier boss fights tutorials will just sit in the middle of your screen for the entire fight.

Story seems to be non existent - you just seem to be a guy and things seem to keep happening. Not really sure what my aim is other than going forward and killing shit. And not in the dark souls way where things are cryptic. And there is a lot of story telling and world building in non conventional ways. You just run in fighting, people show up, shit tends to happen around you, then you keep runnin' and keep fightin'.

Level design seems really linear. Fight through a level, boss, get a cinematic, get teleported to the next level. repeat. Any sense of world just doesn't exist.

But this is not Nioh, it's Wo Long, so I cannot really fault the game for it too much, although I'm still somewhat sad.

Wo Long feels more like Team Ninja's take on Sekiro, sprinkled with a bit of Nioh.

If you buy this with the intent of it being Nioh, you will most likely be disappointed.
If you buy this as its own Game, you might enjoy it if you like deflect-based combat systems.

The game is easy, *very* easy (on NG at least, haven't played NG+ yet) besides for maybe 2 bosses.

Did I enjoy my time?
Yes, I did.

However, Invasions are currently unplayable for me. It's a massive lagfiesta.

The performance is atrocious on my lower mid-tier PC that can run modded Elden Ring on stable 60 FPS. I can run Wo Long on Low settings fine, anything above that is asking for trouble.

A shameful port. If this was the kind of port we would have had if Nioh 1 and 2 released for PC the same time as console then I'm glad they delayed those. 

Otherwise the game is pretty fun, although kind of a tragic situation because fans of the complexity of Nioh are going to be disappointed by how much simpler the combat is in Wo Long, and yet the game is still too complex for a casual player to pick up because Wo Long features a few systems that I've never seen in a game like this before such as fortitude and morale, and I witnessed someone stop playing because they were too confused.

This game feels like Sekiro more than Nioh, but more accurately it feels like Team Ninja's version of Sekiro, and that was what I was expecting after seeing the original demo footage, so I'm quite happy with the game. Definitely not the masterpiece of game design that Nioh is, but also quite unique and nowhere near being just a Sekiro copycat. I find this is also the easiest soulslike I've ever played, and coming from Nioh 2 that surprised me because I think Nioh is a very hard game and thought Team Ninja was going to make it super hard.

This game desperately needs some technical patching however. Graphics settings revert every time I close the game so I have to change them each time I play(I turn off all the options in the screen effects page as well as ambient occlusion and that fixed the graphical flashing). The game doesn't auto-detect what kind of controller you use either so you have to manually pick the layout in options. (xbox and PS layout being the only ones, 3rd party controllers get rekt)

I recommend the game if you're willing to put up with the technical issues for now. It's no Nioh, but it's still a fun action game that seeks its own place outside of Nioh.

Edit: I forgot I wanted to add one last thing, the co-op and pvp in this game is terrible. There was a reason sekiro got rid of all the multiplayer elements of previous games, they don't work, and in this game they probably should have been scrapped too. Hilariously bad netcode aside, it's better played solo or only with the npc allies who are so bad you might as well be solo. It's weird to say wo long is trying to do too much here considering how much Nioh does, but this stuff is so unsatisfying to play with.",1678142836,1678343080,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

for the most part they have enjoyable maps, it for sure turns into more of a tool for increasing morale and the pattern is more noticeable at the end but still fun

for build variety, its not elden ring levels but it is cool picking a set bonus and basing your build around that, still very solid

The story is forgettable and the characters are mid but there are some cool moments and I'm not one to really care for the story so it was fine for me

There are an excess of items given to you, but if you don't like inventory management, just ignore everything except for your main weapon and armour and upgrade them

enemy diversity is disappointing, it would elevate the combat to 12/10 as there would be more moves to learn = more progression and feeling of mastery so that takes a point away

and the final point taken away is the PC port, no its not as bad as people say it is but I did play the game on the lowest settings because even though I could run it, I didn't want to risk any fps drops, the mouse was cringe but got used to it (and now its patched), KBM is fine if you are willing to mess around with the keybinds

Now let me talk about some of the issues I had with it. Now does it make the game less enjoyable? They are just annoyances.

Bad Stuff.
1.Long loading times. I swear the game feels like it takes long times to load levels. I don't remember Nioh 2 having long load times. Also sometimes blackscreens appear before a cutscene plays out and it a bit distracting.
2. Online connection or latency issues. Joining people from across the world is really bad because they will space jump. Enemies space jumps and just make it unplayable. Needs better pairing.

The game needs a bit of optimization to reduce loading times and others things. I use a controller so I am not going to discuss that and had no impairment of my view of the game. 

Overall the game is fun and enjoyable.

Not that great of a story to be honest. It's just the historical era adapted around the original story surrounding the main character's quest to defeat an enemy sowing chaos in the country during wartime. If this sounds familiar, it's because this is how Nioh 1 and 2's stories were generally done. Too many characters, hardly any of which are memorable with the little screen time they have. A lot of character archetypes were recycled, with the main villain being mostly the same as Kelley with his role in the story. Same presentation style of seeing other people's history or goals within your mind. Though, the focus of these types of games is the gameplay.

[h2]Gameplay[/h2]

[h3]Combat[/h3]
The game breaks away from Nioh's combat system that was inspired by the Souls-like genre and Team Ninja's former series Ninja Gaiden. It integrates a new bidirectional action resource system that forces players to make more meaningful decisions in a battle.

They introduced deflecting, which people have been attributing to Sekiro's parry system (I have not played or watched Sekiro, so I have no say in the matter). This aspect of the game borrows from Nioh 2's Burst Counter mechanic that makes a huge difference in how long a boss fight takes. With deflecting being linked to the action resource system both positively and negatively, combat can feel daunting at times with the risk factor but very satisfying in success.

Unlike Nioh, spells are now infinite but restricted by this new system. This was a risky decision on Team Ninja's part given the validity they gave to mage builds in Nioh 2. Players coming into this game will be disappointed by the fact that spells cannot be used as a primary means of engaging enemies. However, their Virtue/Element counter system greatly changes how one can approach bosses or various types of enemies. Where a boss uses a specific element, you can utilize a spell of the element that counters the boss, nullifying a few of their attacks completely. The game provides a mix of melee combat enhancing spells, utility, or damaging spells that can help you throughout a mission or in a boss fight.

With the overall combat system being very different from Nioh 1 and 2, there is much players will miss from those games, but it doesn't mean this game is more restrictive than its predecessors. Though it will take former Nioh players time to get used to the new way of playing, those who understand and master what this game has to offer will find the game as enjoyable in the combat aspect. I cannot say the same for those whose focus was on build variety.

Lastly, there is an major addition to the game restricts how a player progresses through missions. Morale/Fortitude which is raised by placing flags in their fixed positions in each mission. What's so bad about it? To put in perspective, an enemy 5 or more Morale above yours is more likely to two-shot you, even if they are generic NPCs. A boss is more likely to one-shot you. Although one can use the combat system to lower an enemy's morale rank, there is little room for mistakes in those situations, forcing players to backtrack and find other flag spots to lower the damage they take from the boss of the mission to last longer in fights. This encourages more map exploration and discourages rushing to a boss. At least a workaround is to run from one flag spot to the next to save yourself time from fighting one skirmish after another.

[h3]Variety[/h3]
In the first few hours of gameplay, players will notice very quickly that the variety is small. There is no where near as many variants as there were in Nioh when it comes to weapons and armor. For buildcrafters, this is probably a red flag already. For players who couldn't stand the amount of loot they got only to trash most of it in the previous games, they will be relieved to see less inventory management is needed in this game. You may end up sticking with the same weapon for several missions and upgrading it after each main mission.

Enemies do not vary much at all. They might use different weapons, but there are very few human enemy types and maybe a little more than a dozen types of demons. This quickly contributes to a sense of boredom as you see them over and over again. You know which ones are pushovers, which ones are annoying, and which ones ought to be avoided temporarily.

[h3]Audio & Music[/h3]
Music is somewhat on Nioh 2's level, but it falls short with some boss fights. I'll recognize which soundtracks I liked, but there were very few with the rest not being so memorable. This time around, they didn't have any variety when hearing and seeing different characters thoughts as they did with Nioh 2.

Audio is...passable. I haven't seen players use enough of a variety of spells, but I don't hear a whole lot of different things. They all fit their situations, but the only satisfying ones are deflects and Fatal Strikes. I also liked my staff sound effects. Reminds me of Tonfas from Nioh 1.

[h2]Conclusion[/h2]
This game is not for all players who strictly look for Souls-like games or players expecting this to be like Nioh. Like Nioh, there is something for everyone when they look at their options, and the combat is satisfying for people who like the concept of deflecting and countering a bosses kit. But for people looking to hack-and-slash enemy after enemy, they will most likely be disappointed by this new combat system that requires more attention to reading the enemy or utilizing the 5 Virtues/Phases/Elements to make boss fights easier.",1678337140,1678337180,True,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

Some of the bosses/Larger creatures are fun, and it reminds me of Elden Ring/Dark souls with learning the mechanics, but its not all of them. There are a few that are just utter let downs. Too often after a fight I thought ""Oh. That was a boss? That's it?""

The game is okay at most, mostly a repetitive experience. The bosses seem to be way easier than most souls-like i've ever played, like i'm breezing through them. The gimmicks become boring after you use it all the time, its just dodge, light attack, and heavy attack there is nothing else. The magic is something i'm iffy about, while its very unique you don't get a lot of choices you'd get in like Nioh. Your stuck with 4 spells and you can't get anymore for your moveset, maybe they could implement the item wheel you got in the Nioh games? The morale system is a bad decision, i don't want to grind morale just to fight a boss, while most of the time you get the required amount when you get to it, some people just want to go fight the bosses instead of running around and putting down flags. Another thing is the hub world, i was hoping for something akin to Nioh, like just going to the mission select screen after you beat a mission with all of the assets in one place so i don't have to load into another battlefield just to customize myself and upgrade my equipment.

上記スペックで配信しながら攻略している最中でのレビューです。

◆良いゲームかそうでないか
良いゲームです。コエテクさん十八番の三国志ものをうまく死にゲーに落とし込めています。某死にゲーをオマージュした弾き要素に、仁王の要素を上手くミックスできていると思います。ラスボスまで普通にプレーできるかなぁと感じております。ではなぜお勧めしないのか。最適化です。そもそもPS4で動かせるゲームなのにも関わらず、RTX2060が推奨スペックに指定されていることに疑問符が浮かびます。マップもそこまで入り組んでいるわけではないし、広くもない。敵AIが強力かと言われればそうでもない気がします。のにも関わらず褪せ人の英雄になるゲームの推奨スペックのはるか上を要求されます。また、他のゲームではほぼ当たり前にできるもの（コントローラーとキーマウ操作のボタン表示、入力時即時切替等）ができなかったりと少し前世代的な部分を感じることもあります。

◆難易度について
そこまで難しくはないと思いますが、覚えゲー感がすごい。ボス戦は基本すべて弾くくらいの覚悟で挑まなければなりません。強いというよりめんどくさいとなる感じです。ガード不能の攻撃をいかに弾くかが決め手になるのですが、それらの攻撃は大体ほぼワンパン。よけたらよけたで削る手段がなくなるのでタイミングを覚えて弾くしかない。めんどくさくなってきます。楽しいんですけどね。でも倒したあとに、「やったー！！！」ではなく、「あーめんどくさかったこのボス」となる方が多いのではないでしょうか？死にゲーに慣れている人ほどこの感覚になると思います。また、NPCと基本同行できるとはいえ複数戦になるとほぼ勝ち目がないので、１人１人釣るのですが、僕はアマナの祭壇を思い出しました。シンプルに面倒です。

◆まとめ
コエテクさんにしか作れないゲームだと思いますし、実際CS組は楽しく遊んでいる印象を受けます。難易度のところで散々言ってますが、PC版を勧めないという話で、ゲーム自体は面白いのでCS機で買うというのはアリだと思います。まぁでも、、、もっと良いゲームにできた気はするんですよね、、、仁王作ったチームだから、、、。その意も込め低評価です。


◆3/9 追記
あれからゲームを進め、仕様を理解してきましたので難易度について改めてレビューです。結論は、理解すればそれなりに面白いです。
士気ランクという、ステージ内の旗(篝火的なもの)を解放していくことで上がっていくステージ内レベルのようなものがあります。この士気ランクが敵と近ければ受けるダメージが減り、離れていると場合によってはワンパンです。これはボス戦にも適用されるため、マップの探索が必要不可欠要素となっています。どうやら、士気ランクが高い敵を倒すとより良い装備品をドロップするそうですが、僕はこの辺のシステムをまだよく理解していません。士気ランクが近いと受けるダメージが大幅に減るため、ボス戦などもかなり楽になります。ただ、少し分かり辛いシステムだとは思います。このシステムを採用するならキャラのレベリングシステムは必要なかったのではないかと感じます。面白い要素だとは思うのですが、
ゲームデザインにあまり沿っていない感じがしました。惜しいなという感じです。人によってはこの仕様を理解すれば1週目はかなり簡単に感じられるかもしれません。結局どっち路線に振りたかったのか分からないという点で初めてこのようなジャンルに触れる方にはお勧めしません。死にゲーが好きということであれば、プレーする価値はあるゲームだと思います。",1678035725,1678335698,False,97,29,0.646252274513244629,0,True,False,False

There's not a lot of equipment variety that can be called ""unique"" for yourself without looking like someone's clone because while you can get their gear, it feels weird to be wearing the same armor Zhao Yun is also using.

The story isn't that long. I am writing this review from a basis of ""having finished the base game and not tried NG+. Additionally, I didn't do a lot of the side quests, but they're not that long either, maybe 10-15 mins tops compared to a story mission's 45+ minutes. 

On the subject of the setting itself: It's during the fall of the Han dynasty or the events near that. There's NO Three Kingdoms being established during the course of the game, but you do get to meet the prominent actors of the period.

Additionally, just like Nioh 2, the game's plot disjointed as fuck--you go from 194 AD to the next part which is 200 AD without any context on what had happened in the 6 years. I do hope the DLCs build up on the story which the ending kinda shows leaving gaps for it. At least in Nioh 2, the 3 DLCs made sense in the overall plot of the entire series.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]
26 hours and I didn't get bored with the lack of ""stances"" and ""combos"" from Nioh--they are sorely missed though. There's a considerable weapon variety that varies on the generic combo (two spear types that attack differently but may share the same martial arts) and martial arts. 

Martial arts or something like weapon ashes from Elden Ring exist in the game to replace combos and stances. Some martial arts in this game are pretty useful--useful but not required--and I reckon that the ""bland"" ones might have application in PVP. Yes, this game as invasion like your standard FromSoft game.

Lastly, on the subject of the levels. The story missions are quite lengthy at around 45+ minutes because the game encourages exploration to plant banners at designated areas. If you rush to an area, you can get mopped by common mobs because of the difference of the morale between you two which a banner helps negate or if you are on a roll by killing and not taking certain special attacks. They also added a jump button to flex their maps verticality which is pretty meh if you ask me. The high ground attacks helps in dealing more damage against tougher opponents but I wish it amounted to something more.

[h1] Thinking Out Loud [/h1]
Honestly, I wish the Three Kingdoms content was fleshed out in this game. it makes me think they're saving up the rest of the events on a potential sequel. I don't think the DLCs will touch a lot of the three kingdoms stuff judging from the names of the DLCs. 

Do I recommend this game? Not for the current price, no. Is it a bad game? Not at all. This is one of those reviews that wish Steam had a ""middle ground"" verdict.",1678331213,1678331213,True,1,2,0.487804889678955078,0,True,False,False

The enemy variety is pretty mid tho, so far I've met what feels like all of the enemy types so and this leaves me steam rolling the levels as I know all their patterns. Although, This wouldn't be that big of a deal if it wasn't for the morale system. Morale is a system similar to leveling but level specific, throughout the level you'll find major and minor flags that boost fortification (minimum morale) this will usually cap out at 20. However you can boost this to 25 by playing well (getting kills without dying). 

Every boss caps out at 20...
Because of the lack of enemy variety making you steamroll the level you'll always be morale 25 by the end. Meaning you do insane damage to the boss and they do damn near none. This is unfortunate as most of the bosses have sick designs/attack patterns and most likely you and I play these games for the bosses.

Pros:
-Combat is amazing and deflection feels evolved from Sekiro's version
- First boss really tests players and shows them what to expect later setting expectations, doesn't hold back. If you can't beat first boss and rage quit, you won't handle rest of the game. 
- Simpler then Nioh/Nioh 2, its a con for some but I love it. 
- Multiple weapons/PVP/2 forms of coop. Imagine Sekiro but had many weapons and pvp invasions...
- NPCs to aid you in the level and also build up rep with them for nice gear rewards
- Great boss designs
- Weapons feel different enough to fit all playstyles

Cons:
- Same enemies often show up in every level, not a lot of variety
- First boss will make many rage quit and turn away because this game doesn't hold your hand. 
- PC port problems for some

other stuff
creating builds in this game is both easier and harder than nioh games, we have ally npcs which you can upgrade their bond with cups of cordinality and get their armor for a build but if the armor and weapon you want is for an enemy npc, oh boy...
first of all there is no smithing texts like nioh, so you need to grind that enemy for an atleast 4star armor and weapon,
second of all, the morale system fucks you up, because if you want to get a hard boss's armor, first you need to find all the flags and then go fight the boss, otherwise you are basically fucked by the boss, so yeah morale system really really sucks for build making in the end

as for the spells, i feel like the number of useful spells are pretty low in each category, and caster builds are almost impossible with the spirit system, because every cast is negative spirit and you HAVE to attack for getting your spirit back up

the bosses in this game are not that great, I really appreciate that most of them won't kill you with 1 or 2 hits if you are almost the same morale level, but they really don't pose any threat to any person that has clicked with the combat

the story telling in this game feels like, the story is being told to someone who already knows it, like I don't know anything about this historic period of china and game acts like I should be suprised by seeing some of the NPCs and doesn't even try to explain or show why they are important or powerful

the enemy variety really really sucks, i feel like this game has even less enemy types than nioh 1 and that is sad, one of the biggest strengths of nioh 2 was it's wide variety of enemy types and that you almost never got bored of the combat going forward in the story

and lastly keybinds for dodging and deflecting was really really weird, it won't hurt you as much but when you get to the late game and you need to deflect super fast combos, it gets ugly fast, so you need to press the deflect button multiple times but not so fast that triggers a dodge, this keybinding is fucking dumb

[u][b]Story: 4/10[/b][/u] The story was honestly pretty bad, but it's not [i]terrible[/i] if you're into the Three Kingdoms era of Chinese history. I'm a big Dynasty Warrior fan and it felt like this game was just playing another Dynasty Warriors but a souls-like version of it which was cool. Has all of the famous Dynasty Warriors battles for the most part. The story is definitely not Wo Long's strong point though, and you should not purchase this game expecting Elden Ring level of story/lore. This is by far the game's weakest point imo along with the HORRENDOUS English voice acting. 

[u][b]Gameplay/Combat: 8/10[/b][/u] Gameplay loop is enjoyable but gets repetitive after about 15 hours. It's the same as Nioh; you go to a new instance-type area, clear it, kill the boss at the end, rinse repeat. If you liked how Nioh does it you'll like it here. I personally prefer the perfect parry system of this game and Sekiro over Dark Souls and Elden Ring so I enjoyed the combat overall. 

[u][b]Performance: 6/10[/b][/u] I didn't have really any super major performance issues, but I did have some pretty bad FPS drops in some areas and the game crashed my GPU a couple of times throughout playing it. I also had to disable certain display adapters in device manager in order to properly get 1440p resolution which was strange. Other than that not really any issues though. 

[u][b]Mob Diversity: 6/10[/b][/u] Mob diversity is to be desired. They have about 5-6 different big mobs that are more difficult throughout the game and the rest are your usual grunt fodder. After about 10-15 hours of playing I started to get bored with the mob diversity as I was just fighting the same mobs over and over and over again in every mission. They do sprinkle in some mini boss fights here and there but it's pretty rare.

[u][b]Bosses: 7/10[/b][/u] Boss fights were great but a little too easy. I felt Sekiro bosses were way more difficult than Wo Long's bosses. This is probably due to having companions fighting with you to take boss aggro and breaking Boss posture being way too rewarding. Bosses typically die in 3 posture breaks. It's pretty easy to become overpowered with the gear and weapon upgrading system too, you can absolutely crush any mob/boss in the game if you funnel everything into 1 weapon/gear set. 

[u][b]Music: 9/10[/b][/u] Music was fantastic and I thought added a lot to the game. The composers did a great job. 

Overall I'd say I recommend this game, but it's cutting it close due to the price point. Only 20 hours of content for $60 is pretty hard to recommend (again I did not do side missions), but I did have a good time overall. I'd say pick it up on a sale if you can or if you're a big Sekiro person it's probably worth it no matter the price.",1678313512,1678313864,True,3,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I really enjoyed my first playthrough, took me roughly 50 hours as i tried to do all the main and sub missions. 

It has many similar mechanics than Nioh (the loot, fast combat, weapons, skill/magic systems) and introduce some new or reworked mechanics like the Red glowing unstoppable attacks (from the Yokai in Nioh 2) that you can counter for a riposte and massive damage (and a crucial/fatal attack).

The combat feels so good, like any soulslike you start weak and vulnerable as you learn the game and its mechanics but after a third of the playthrough you become much more powerful (and skilled) and by the time you reach the end you can kill everything without too much problem (the level 100 mission - the trial - is awesome!)
Some bosses are easier than others (of course and depending on your build and playstyle) but most of them are really fun to battle and some of them REALLY awesome and tough!

I would totally recommend Wo Long if you feel like learning the game properly and if you´re into Soulslike in general.

I play with a controller so i cannot say anything about the K&M input but the controller works well. 
I had some framerate drops but not too bad for a freshly released game prior to the first patch.
It did crash a lot of times though during cutscenes and sometimes for nothing when i was doing some inventory management...annoying sometimes but heh, i'm no dev and i have no idea what it takes to fix it. I just play the game and don't assume it's garbage just because it has a couple of issues. Or i would wait for a couple of patches then.

Anyway, really good game once again from Team Ninja (i loved both Nioh games, Ninja Gaiden and the Final Fantasy they made)...those are totally on par with the FromSotfware games.

First off, yes, there's a MASSIVE learning curve compared to the Nioh series and other Soulsborne/Soulslike titles, and going through that is key. The difficulty spike is apparent from the get-go. Unlike Nioh 1 and 2, Dark Souls, Bloodborne, etc, Wo Long forces you to use EVERY tool in your arsenal if you want to win. It's paramount to understand this. You're not forced to kill bosses via the parry/riposte system as the final hit like Sekiro, which people seem to misunderstand. Additionally, yes, dodge and block are the same key, and you'll use up a lot of your Spirit Gauge (your combined mana/stamina/skills gauge) if you just dodge like crazy at inopportune times (I'm dodge-heavy in DS and Nioh, so this took a lot of getting used to). This game is punishing, and probably the most punishing Soulslike(-ish) I've played. First boss will positively kick your BUTT. Like the first time you face Onryoki in Nioh, it's meant to force you to quickly learn and utilize every fundamental skill in the game, and if you don't, he'll wipe the mountainside with your face. Just be glad you're not in a tiny room on a boat. 

Now, though it doesn't do a lot of damage, you can quickly refill the Spirit Gauge by LIGHT ATTACKING. It's actually required to do so. What does this mean? The game forces you to go on the offensive, but you have to do it smart otherwise you'll get schwacked pretty quickly. So, unlike previous games where you've got ""cheese strats,"" (such as using ninjutsu with Nioh, yokai abilities in Nioh 2, or spells/miracles in DS and Elden Ring), you've got to know when and how to block, attack aggressively, dodge, and parry ALL the time. If you don't, even at a high level, you'll get taken out by mob enemies. The Morale system is a pretty novel idea, and I think it's executed well know that I know how it impacts the difficulty. Again, unlike others in the genre, it allows for consistency in difficulty. If you think that, just because you become high-level, that you'll be able to power through levels unscathed without maxing out your morale, you're in for a rude awakening. Every time you die or get hit by a critical attack, you lose Morale Points, which effects your stats. Likewise, if you face an enemy with higher morale than yours, the fight is significantly more difficult. It's cool, and keeps you on your toes even on NG+ making replayability that much better. Once you learn and practice the system, which will take a while (so I hope these tips help), the gameplay actually makes a lot of sense. 

Story-wise, unlike with Nioh where I personally know quite a bit about Japanese mythos and history, I know jack squat about China's, so the story centering around the Romance of the Three Kingdoms was new and refreshing for me. I also liked the main villain quite a bit, who actually has some personality unlike Kashin Koji from Nioh 2. If you played Nioh/Nioh 2 (which I strongly recommend if you haven't), the story is written, narrated, and acted out in a very similar manner down to the Divine Beast/Guardian Spirit Division movies. 

Graphics and visuals: much like Nioh/Nioh 2, which I appreciate. Varying environments and beauty to be found all-around. 

Music: top-notch and fitting. 

I can go on-and-on about the differences between Wo Long and Nioh, but frankly, enough people already have, for better or worse. Remember, Team Ninja specifically pointed out that Wo Long is NOT Nioh, so I'd recommend everyone be open-minded when it comes to that statement. I'd also recommend this: like any Soulslike, don't try and play this game with a keyboard and mouse. It's not meant for that, so just go get a gamepad, already. 

There are a few stability issues, and I have had sporadic occurrences where the game crashes. That said, that happens on my PS4 with other games, too, so it happens. 

If I had to make one, singular gripe, it's that you can't access your item boxes at the Battle Flags (think Nioh's Shrines, Bloodborne's lanterns, DS's bonefires, or Elden Ring's sights of grace). If you want to restock ammo or consumables, swap gear which you've deposited so your inventory isn't cluttered, or do just about anything along those lines, you've got to transport back to the village in order to do so (there is no world-map like Nioh, but rather a hub area). It's annoying, and I really hope they patch that. That said, unlike Nioh, when you move through a main mission -- haven't tested this with sub-missions-- you can transport back to the village, then back into the mission, without losing progress or Genuine Qi (amrita/souls/etc.). When you go back to the mission, you'll start right back at the last Flag you rested at, which is nice. 

All in all, although there are some elements I miss from Nioh/Nioh 2, I'm extremely happy with Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty. Again, take the time to learn its mechanics, because I can honestly say this game, and the teams behind it, deserves a lot of credit for the world that's been created. I'm damned-sure looking forward to the DLCs.

The usual Team Ninja issues (such as enemy variety) are in this game again. There was an update that addressed the mouse issue. I haven't tried it for myself so I'm not sure to the degree it's been fixed. The performance issues are still present, however. My big gripe was the co-op where you would be forced to watch the cutscene. Now that that is fixed, I feel incentive to actually keep doing co-op. From this, it seems like Team Ninja is being diligent in dealing with present issues. 

If you're used to bad ports, I'd recommend it at this point; It's still rough, but it's playable.

Original review below:
Game is great, I'm loving the actual game. Port is terrible.

It plays more like Sekirou than Nioh or other soulslikes, but it's not quite that either. I didn't finish Sekirou, but I played enough of it to know what mechanics I disliked.

Wo Long's combat is oriented around parrying while managing your ""spirit"", a gauge that increases when you attack and parry and decreases when you defend, dodge, use an ability, or get hit. If your spirit gets too negative, you experience a guard break. If you raise your spirit to the max, you can unleash a very powerful spirit attack to punish your target. I personally find this more enjoyable than what Sekirou had to offer, as you can do more to alter the flow of combat with your attacks, abilities, spells, and parrying than you could in the aforementioned. It may not be for everybody, and it's very different from Nioh, but it's fun.

However I won't recommend the game at this time for a couple of reasons. Obviously looking at other reviews there are players with performance issues (I've had some minor graphical bugs but it's smooth and perfectly playable) and others who can't manage with kbm controls (honestly just buy a controller, that's what these games were designed for) and I'm certain those will see some improvement over the year. But there are other glaring problems and quirks. 

The UI in regards to equipment management is a large step back from Nioh, certain context options are missing from some menus and there is currently no way to compare two items beyond memorizing the stats of one of them. You can transmog your armor but you can't preview the result. You can spend points on spells you can't cast (the game will warn you about this if you unlock the spell directly, but if you unlock something deeper into the spell tree it will only warn you that you're about to spend multiple points). Quest-giving and notable NPCs in the hub area have no marks on the minimap to draw attention to them. The netcode struggles to keep up with the speed of invading players and the game is NOT balanced for invasions.  Graphic options reset themselves to default every time you launch the game. There's probably more things to mention, but I think I've made my point.

When (and hopefully not if) improvements are made to the UI and performance fixes are rolled out I'll likely change this review to a positive one. Either way, I think I'll just finish the base game before uninstalling and going back to Nioh for NG+.

EDIT: First patch has dropped to address some of the graphical issues and kbm controls for those who care. Changing to a positive review since this was pretty prompt, but I'm also putting the game down myself for the foreseeable future. There's simply not as much variety in the gameplay and build potential that I had hoped for.

//Old Review//

Steam yet again doing a disservice by not allowing a ""mixed"" review option. This game desperately needed some more development time and a quality check before being released.  I'll start with the bad. 

-This game has many, many graphical issues and crashes. As I play with a controller, I do not have any M+KB problems. These problems still do exist.

-Within the 13 hours that I have played, I have never actually closed the game on my own volition. It has instead crashed on me, and I've decided that it isn't actually worth continuing and I went and did something else. There has been a crash on nearly every single boss cut-scene. I have had crashes when using stealth kills. I've had crashes defeating bosses which is the most aggravating out of all of them.

-There is a problem with the ambient occlusion that results in a very obnoxious flickering effect. 

-Volumetric fog reduces your performance drastically. Just turn it off.

-Graphical options will not save when you change them and reload the game after crashing. A work around for this is setting your graphical preset to ""Custom"" and it'll actually save it... maybe.

Do note that this game, behind all of its horrible performance issues, is actually good. Core gameplay and systems are totally fine, if a little less than what you might be used to if you are returning from the Nioh series. I'd like to describe this as a more accessible Nioh 2 with a very fun Block and Parrying mechanic. I just wish I could play it for more than 45 minutes before it crashes.",1678213831,1678298935,True,0,0,0.518725395202636719,0,True,False,False

Patch 1.03 experience:

- No more white flicker bug
- Significantly less frame rate drops when looking around on some areas
    - There still a slowdown for a second or two but I think its due to streaming of objects in the background
- 52 FPS to 60 FPS (capped) improvement when Volumetric Fog is set to High Quality. There's still frame rate drops to 40s and 50s somewhere, so I still recommend lowering this setting to Standard Quality.
- Mouse movement improvement, though I primarily play on controller.

Still, there's room for more performance optimization which I believe they should deliver considering their patches and support with Nioh 2 Complete Edition for PC.

A patch was just released claiming to fix a bunch of issues, but as I've already beaten the game and have no desire to go back, I'll never know the current state of performance, crashes, and other various technical issues. As such, I'll only go over the gameplay side of things, which is still rough.

The morale system is the single worst designed feature I've ever seen in a souls-like. It essentially adds difficulty options to the game without anyone realizing it. It's made any discussion surrounding boss difficulty completely poisoned as you've no idea what difficulty that person was playing on. We're they on hard? (13-15 morale), or were they on easy? (20-25 morale).

Critical attacks (the red attacks) are too powerful. They're uninterruptible and unblockable. You have to parry these attacks, but the issue there lies in the fact that you're animation locked in everything you do. If you press the attack button and an enemy decides to start up a critical attack in that moment, you're screwed, there's nothing you can do. This is fine for bosses, but it's too much for regular enemies. Clearing out trash becomes too much of a pain when any enemy can suddenly do half your HP, and two enemies timing their attacks can one-shot you. The game would be more fun if you could animation cancel into parry. Right now, it just feels way too slow as you're risking death by attacking, and have to wait for the sleepy enemies to hit you first.

The camera is unbearably jank. Giant bosses with tiny arenas will cause your camera to freak out constantly, whipping back and forth, causing me nausea most of the time. Smaller bosses will jankily fly around the screen at the speed of sound, causing the camera the same issues as with bigger bosses. This is on top of the forced camera smoothing (I'm using controller) that I'm sure will never be fixed, as it's a nausea inducing feature.

Gear is completely useless. I picked up my first four-star set of gear and the hundreds of gear pieces I've picked up since then have been useless. When opening a chest and getting a three-star piece of gear, I'd actually sigh; yet, you have to check everything in case the developers decided to leave healing upgrades lying around instead of useless gear. Somehow, I still prefer this to constantly swapping out gear for higher numbers like in Nioh.

That's the main stuff that really annoys the crap out of me, but I have loads of other issues with the game. Even ignoring the dozen crashes I experienced and loads of other technical issues, I'd probably never play this again. Nioh 1+2 never really innovated in any meaningful way, but they managed to copy FromSoft's formula in a way that was fun, but Wo Long is just a complete bastardization of Sekiro's systems. I would highly recommend picking up any FromSoft game over Wo Long.",1677908422,1678297761,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I hate the game mechanics, the slow mp with very low stamina, the ui and it's lack of general components that EVERY SINGLE OTHER GAME HAS!!!

it's almost the same with wo long...
but specificly about the game, I'd say
I enjoyed the story well enough to keep me entertained, eventhough it was very simplistic: bad guy doing bad things, you make friends, grow stronger together and defeat bad guy with the power of friendship (highlight would be a certain npc with a temperament that is too big to fit his own shoes... if only he was like that too when he joins the fight, oh well...)
love mc's and npc's character designs (it's just sad that in the late stages I just can't find any gear that is better than what I already have), I enjoyed discovering the world eventhough it was in stages and not open world
the monsters... a delight, as usual... 
love the many varieties you have to put down your enemies... magic, basic strikes, heavy strikes, some funky martial arts stunts, counterattacks or away from danger with a range weapon, it's also cool that the companions chime in and help fight them...

but it gets infuriatingly irritating when they stand between you and the opponent and your strikes miss but the opponent hit you... or when they push the opponent out of the way from your heavy attacks >...<
it's also maddening when you can't pin your opponent down and every strike hits nothing but the opponent isn't positioned well to face you so they run around you -.-
and why the heck can't I choose where I want to go to next after finishing a stage? why am I sent straight to the next stage? and if you finish the stage you chose, you get only 3 options: repeat stage again, go to the stage where the main story continues from or go to the hidden village -...- whyyyy
I also hate that you can't start using all magic you selected right from the beginnig... gotta build up points first by hitting or dodging opponents, only after the threshold is reached can you start using them -...- urgh

and I see the complaints of a lot of ppl and agree, the game needs to stay longer in the oven... but I'm still stuck on 50/50

When you get the timing of the deflections down, and all the combat seems to click, it is incredibly satisfying. It is one of the easier souls-like games, in terms of difficulty, however it is not too 'easy'. 

There were some performance issues, but they seem to have been addressed by the most recent patch, (1.03) and they claim to have fixed the mouse support, another large complain by the community attributed to many of the negative reviews. (I use a controller, so cannot speak to that fix, but the controller input is very responsive, and I have had no issues)

If you like flashy martial arts, and feeling like an invincible hero by nailing your deflections of attacks, there is no more enjoyable game than this.

Deflection is also mapped to dodge, lmao.
Game Runs like shit on a 3060. Honestly fucking unreal. PC gaming is dead. These last few ""AAA"" games have proven it. (They updated the game twice since posting this. It runs a bit better now.)
Deflection SIMULATOR.

EDIT: Beat first boss, very annoying they throw in a tutorial during this boss and you end up glossing over it because you've gotta focus hard. Well in second phase a new icon shows up where your martial skills are. You press R1 + Square or Triangle to do those. So seeing a new icon appear there in the midst of a boss fight and the NPC yelling at you about your potential in that moment and then you obviously spam R1 + Circle because it makes the most sense. You even do an animation that confirms it in the moment that you're doing it right but of course, you're not. 
I was on my 3rd attempt when i got him to 10% HP and then I never reached that for the next hour and a half of attempts. When suddenly... I noticed on one of my attempts that you have to press Circle + Triangle when you get to that point in the second phase. Pressing those magic buttons at that time ends the fight. Straight up ends it. Frustrating as fuck to be honest. All that hardship when I could've ended the fight on my 3rd attempt had the buttons been properly fucking labeled like the rest of the skills. If you hold R2, it shows you the face buttons for each skill, same with Martial skills but not this fucking Divine Beast bullshit. That gets an icon in a place that clearly should've been a Circle. Yes im mad, this was UX/UI bullshit.

The game is meh though in all sincerity. Magic feels weak with no impact or damage. Martial Skills are cool at least since you can get weapons with different skills. But the Loot is boring and simplistic.
Tried Co-op as soon as i could. Summoned someone who helped me stomp through the second level, they looked very lagged, zipping around my screen. Enter the 3rd stage and attempt to join a co-op session and I was met with a crash.

Is the game good? Hell yes. As a fan of the ROTK series I come at this from a different angle. I really enjoyed the story so far and while it's not re-inventing the wheel it takes the demon motif and applies it well to the quasi historical story line for the period. 

Combat is fast and furious, learning how to deflect is the key to beating bosses and bigger enemies. With no stamina to worry about it's more forgiving to people who aren't basement dwelling troglodytes like some of these reviewers who have rated the game poorly. 

If you are having 'PC issues' you are likely playing on a toaster. Sucks to be you I guess? Is the port well done? No, not really. The UI for menus is a little awkward because of it. Mouse controls are not a problem unless you are an idiot. Of course you can feel that it was meant to be played with a controller, but the kb and mouse combo work well enough. Stop complaining and touch some grass.

TLDR; people who don't like this game and rate it negatively are morons or elite snowflakes who cannot or will not see the world in shakes of grey. Is the game awesome? Yes it is. If you are a fan of NIOH you will enjoy this one too.  If you are newer to 'Souls-like' games you will also find this game approachable as well.

Honestly, coming from Nioh games, I expected to hate this game. But I have to say you probably should approach this game on its own merit. I will expalin in comparisons though. With dark souls too, since they brought Bloodborne producer and it shows. Also be aware this game is pretty easy.

+Combat has very solid core. It's focused on fundamentals. Gone is the complexity and freeflow feel of Nioh combat where you approach encounter on your own terms. It's more like dark souls, where you take turns to attack. But, you are also entirely responsible for those opportunities with deflects and deflect counterattacks. There are also several systems that enforce counter play. Like stronger virtue negating weaker virtue. For example, if an enemy has fire buff, you can hit him with ice damage or water related debuff and his buff is gone. You can do the same with spells. See fireball coming your way? Send an icicle as an answer. You will even see appropriate kanji flash on the screen. General combat is fairly simple though. Normal attacks don't deal much damage, their purpose is to generate positive spirit, which you can spend on other actions. Spirit attack powered with positive spirit will pierce guard and often is a nice combo ender. Deals a lot of spirit damage too. Which you can follow up with fatal strike. Fatal Strike is also powered by spirit and the main source of your damage. Martial Arts or weapon skills don't consume entire spirit bar however, so you can use those to apply debuffs, deals spirit damage, and minor hp damage. Yeah, as it stands right now martial arts don't deal damage either. Deflect is the main defence and also a mechanic to create windows of opportunity. Just hold block while deflecting, in case you mistime deflect. There is butterfly dodge (has i-frames) and normal roll too (doesn't have i-frames). Deflect Counterattack switches weapon while parrying and also regains a lot of spirit. So does Fatal Strike btw if you're in negative spirit. Jumping attacks have two versions too. And you can jump off enemy heads as well. 

+Boss design. Gameplay wise, I think this game easily has at least 3 bosses that are now my favourite boss fights of all time. Yes, even comparing to Nioh 2. And the fact that you can deflect anything, even stuff like lightning bolts, makes these fights very fast and dynamic. I can't praise Team Ninja enough in that regard.

+Level design is honestly just ok. It is better than Nioh's due to verticality and different approach. You can sneak up on huge majority of enemies during levels. And fatal strike on unaware enemies deals a lot of damage.

+Companions. I found companion system to be pretty nice. They have rare banter and are pretty capable. Provide passive benefits and make you feel less lonely. Also easily dismissable too. You get the despawning branch the first time you access Reinforcements menu. 

+Character design is great. Both humans and demons look great. But you know, TN has the best artists. So that was expected.

+Upgrade system. You just stright up upgrade your weapon like in dark souls. from 0 to +9 and you have endgame weapon. So don't throw away your favourite if you have one.

Now to the mixed part.

+-Morale system that gates spells and gives you scaling. I finished the game as lvl 1, so I didn't even unlock wizardry. But I have to say, I'm not a fan. It incentivizes exploring, but levels aren't that interesting to explore. And at times it feels like you have to plant every flag to have a good chance at boss encounter.

+- Visuals are a mixed bag. Sometimes game looks really good. Sharp and nice image. Sometimes it also manages to look worse than Nioh 1 LMAO. I don't know what happened, I guess bad lightning work, despite textures being improved.

+-Music is not distracting or annoying, but absolutely forgettable. I can't recall a single tune the moment I turn off the game.

+-Story. It's disjointed. You're shown a bunch of events and character's reaction to those. It's not very coherent. A lot of characters got a very different spin too, but it's based on RotK, which is historical fiction anyway.


Bad.

-UI and QoL. This is straight up degradation. I'm sorry, but what the fuck happened here? I haven't seen such godawful UI in ages. First, nice job ripping off dark souls. What a fucking ape of a human being thought that placing HP and Spirit bar in the middle screen and making them grow in size was a good idea, without even any option to turn that off or put those someplace else? Holy shit this is terrible. Also remember how in Nioh you could hold RB and RT to spend 10 or 100 points into single attribute while leveling? Gone. Remember how you could lock, destroy, favourite, etc equipment in Equipment menu? Gone. Now for whatever fucking reason you have status menu here. And guess what? The same fucking status menu is doubled in another menu too. When you change visuals of your equipment, you have to pay for it first. No free preview. Also when you want to change the look, you have to undo that appearance first and then apply new one. There are so many stupid ass confirmation prompts on everything which you can't even disable. I don't have fingers the size of fucking elephant foot. Why these even exist? Arrows and crossbow bolts don't auto refill upon praying at the shrine like they did in Nioh. I have 3 000 arrows in storage and have to buy new arrows during mission. Gear comparison is gone too. When you sort things in inventory it doesn't save it like it did in Nioh. It resets to ""date of OBTENTION"". What in nure-onna's scaly tits happened?

-Translation is very bad. That's par for the course, was the case for both nioh games as well. But translating from japanese to english is very hard, so I'm not gonna harp on that one.

-Fashion is a bit of a let down, not much variety in terms of visuals for both armour and weapon. 

-Enemy variety. It's less than in Nioh 1. Which is to say it's really bad. Humans, demonized humans, a handful of demons. pretty much it. Outside of bosses, there isn't really any variety. You will see pretty much entire roster in the first like 5-6 missions.

-Loot system. Oh boy, another shitfest that gets apparent only once you reach NG+. Don't even know where to start. Martial Arts are all pretty much garbage damage wise. Find something that makes you jump or blocks hits, so you have stuff for utility. Now, the problem is with discovery system. You see, you learn effects only once you discover them. There is a tab with Status Icons that gives you descriptions of what buffs and debuffs do. You just have to use them first or see an enemy use those. Now, that applies to loot too. To loot some piece of gear you have to find it first. Why is it bad though? You fight yellow turban bandit. He drops his bandit gear. Now you can loot that. You fight yellow turban champion. He drops his gear. Now you can loot it too. You level up Zhao Yun to maximum loyalty and he gives you his gear. Now you progress to the next stage with demon tigers Changgui. Now those Changgui can drop both their loot and also yellow turban bandit, champion and zhao yun gear too. What do you think happens when you clear entire game and get like different sets of gear discovered? It makes farming graces basically impossible, because anything can drop anywhere and loot pool is so diluted you will have better chance of winning a lottery. So, yeah, have fun with that.

Overall the game is definitely very rushed and unrefined. Core game is actually good, it's just feels like every other aspect is covered with diarrhea. Maybe sequel will be better, if it happens.",1678283958,1678288806,True,5,0,0.595645368099212646,0,True,False,False

About 15 hours into the game and I'm seeing a broken messy port that has no business being this expensive, especially since I took a leap of faith and went for the deluxe edition. I meet the recommended system requirements and I'm experiencing so many performance issues, so much stuttering and so many crashes, even on all settings at low and on prioritise FPS mode, which makes the game straight up look like the messy behind of a sick farm animal. 
Even trying to run the game at an FPS above 60 causes the game to run slow-mo, and the game cant maintain 60fps as you move through the world, causing a feeling of nausea at times.
The amount of times I have turned around and seen a blank world slowly fill up and repopulate, or the amount of times i've had to replay a segment or a boss fight because of crashes Is a huge downer and a put down. Its frustrating having the game work against you not through difficult yet rewarding gameplay, but through bad performance.
I love the combat, very sekiro-esque while not being as difficult, I also appreciate the level design and item and enemy placement, really well crafted world. The 5 phase element system is quite interesting even if most of the spells seem dull and boring. I love the fact that we can hunt all the battle flags in a level and be rewarded for it with a slightly easier boss fight. Conversely if you wish to make a boss difficult, you can ignore the flags and rush the boss, works great both ways!
I love the mission style of the game, and the fact that we can replay missions as many times as we want. I like the companions even if their A.I seems to be controlled by a 5 year old on his first video game, useless, but honestly kinda funny.
The loot system is a bit confusing and the amount of equipment we receive is overwhelming, but the respec system makes me hopeful that I will try out all the weapons at least once each on a replayed mission run. The sheer variety of weapons and marshal arts is astounding and must be commended.
I am most comfortable playing games with my mouse and keyboard, so their strange m/kb controls cock-up hasn't sat well with me either. But its just another problem and I have learnt to compensate for it in my playthrough.
The enemy design is amazing and I love the way the bosses feel unique and indomitable on the first run of the mission. The boss fight haven't disappointed me till now, however I am at the time of writing this review, stuck on a boss at the beginning of the 3rd part of the game.
This boss Zhang Rang has a cool but annoying gimick, but is otherwise not terribly challenging. The reason I am stuck here is because the game inevitably crashes during his fight once he re-summons his cronies, or stutters and lags, causing me to die without putting on much of a defence after being beset on all sides while I cant move or deflect.
I have high hopes for this game and ardently look forward to the day I can change this review to a positive, but that seems to be a long while off, so I shall spend the long wait by replaying Dark Souls 1, or 2, or 3, or Sekiro, or Nioh 2 all with fully functioning m/kb support.

Edit:- 08-03-2023

Does that excuse the developer for not porting the game correctly? No.

If you're gonna bring it to PC, it should bloody work with the systems intended controls. It'd be like porting a game to Playstation and expecting you to play it with the fucking tv remote.

Anyways, if you like souls type games you' ll definitely enjoy this, but get it on console, or wait for a sale. The PC Port doesn't deserve your money.

I don't think I could recommend this game. I probably won't even finish it.

The boss fights are just way too dumb. People can probably play with two buttons.

The boss fights goes like this: You stand 100% still, parry/block all the small attacks, and wait for the critical move where the boss glows red for like 3 seconds beforehand. You parry that specific move and attack back exactly one time. You stand still again essentially repeating this process.

The normal attack moves contribute so little to the fight that you can just ignore those. Just wait to parry the red move. 80% of the time in a boss fight you are just waiting for him to make that red move, other moves are trivial to parry/block. Watch a movie while waiting, IDK. Once you understand this, the core of this game just naturally dies.

Meanwhile the small creeps are annoying as hell. You are forced to go certain routes in order to put down certain flags. If I want to play Hitman, I'd do that. I don't want to sneak around try to take down 5 stupid creeps one by one. Also good luck if they started to follow and attack you as a swarm of zombies.

This is just lame.

The upgrade systems are too complicated and unnecessary. There are so many progression systems implemented in this otherwise simple game, it does NOT make sense.

IDK what else to mention. The story is... wait there's a story in this game? I mean there are cutscenes... but story? Not really.

Performance is crap half of the time. I randomly drop to 60FPS on my 3080Ti. I'm not even factoring this in. Also I play on controller, not factoring the often mentioned terrible MnK control in either. I dislike this game only based on gameplay.

To the developers: If you want to be soul-like game, be soul-like game. If you want to be ARPG, be that. Just don't take the worst of both worlds. It's like putting plain spaghetti and plain white rice in the same bowl and call it a dish. WTF?

Really I'm not complaining a game being too easy or hard, that's a bit dumb. It's about making various weapons, moves and progression systems rewarding, instead of including so many things that in the end are just irrelevant.",1677929913,1678269159,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I havn't even played 10 hours of Wo Long Fallen dynasty and I'm already bored... 
I'm changing my build every mission to try new playstyles but even doing that it's just a very shallow game as it is right now.

The game tries to make you think otherwise with a lot of different system but it falls really short because of a few different things: 

  - The game is very unbalanced (from itemisation to price in shop to enemies health to the overall challenge , the game just isn't ready right now)

  - The game is too easy (this is a parry game just like sekiro except there's no enemy variety and bosses are either giant beasts that telegraph way to much or human enemies that have a very small pool of attacks but the fight tends to drag on too much)

  -There's someone following you on most missions, you can't disband them and they are pretty strong.

  -Group fights are just bad, you have to lock on to an enemy to fight properly but when you do you can't see the other ones behind your back so it ends up being a mess. Sadly there's a lot of those....

  -performances are hit and miss, some crashes, some frame drops, and I have a bug where the screen flashes white sometimes.

It also looks great and there's a few good music themes too.

So even on the lowest settings, you can expect stuttering or slow down in the cutscenes.  The AI is also not the best for helping out.  Other players are still your best bet but, the AI is there and some of them are decent at surviving and keeping attention.  Just don't expect damage from them.  As for the actual gameplay, I haven't noticed any issues there yet.  The game has also crashed on me a few times when loading in to help other players.  Those issues aside however, the game is very fun.  

It feels great to play and the QoL changes for Co-op make this probably the best souls like for those who want to co-op.  You can just turn off PVP invasions entirely, and the Co-op which goes up to 3 players, lets you just invite your friends through steam, everyone can interact with everything in the world instead of just the host, and no one has reduced healing or anything messy like that.  You can also pick each other back up if you go down which is amazing.  No more messy resummon every time a player dies.  Granted, most of that's only for the Co-op mode.  If you respond to summon requests like a normal souls like, then it's much more of what you'd expect.  Invasions are dependent on whether the host turned them off, and as a summon your healing is reduced.  As well as your time in their world is limited if they don't decide to pick you back up.

As for the more nitty gritty, compared to other souls games, you only have 5 stats to level up.  Each is tied with an element of some kind and determine different things, in addition to scaling damage on weapons which typically scale off of 3 stats.  Weapons and armor have a ""rarity"" system but the rarity doesn't affect the raw stats of the gear, only the ""slots"" which provide rather minor buffs when enchanted.  Like a 5% damage mitigation buff while you're attacking specifically.  However, the rarity system is there if you like to min max your gear/character.  The game has a heavy focus on parrying as well.  Blocking attacks will not work out well for you if that's your primary form of defense.

Moving on from there, each weapon has 2 special moves, and there's a lot of different classes of weapons.  They all feel good to mess around with too thankfully.  The ranged combat and spells feel lackluster imo but I haven't messed around with those much so take that with a grain of salt.  The stamina system is also rather unique.  Basic attacks and parrying properly give stamina back basically while everything else costs it more or less.  Which promotes this hyper aggressive playstyle where you're always on the offensive and have to react to parry everything they might throw at you.  Trying to play defensively is much more difficult cause the enemies rarely give you enough time to collect yourself.  However, with the AI or other players to pull aggro, it can give you some breathing room.",1678260933,1678260933,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

I buy this game even when i see negative review at the time i buy as Mostly Negative
because i'm a super fans of nioh game (around 400 hour++) 
I have faith in Team ninja that they will made a Great game and this game is very good
in my opion the Negative review bomb come from 2 thing.

1.Key board and mouse not work for this game because of bad programming(I think they fix this soon)

I have experience several game crash RIGHT AFTER BOSS BATTLE and i need to re-do again. All in all, its not a bad game, 6/10

****** After completing 100% achievement
I think after all i still feel more towards Sekiro.

-Combat 8/10
Combat is smooth and you can you different combo e.g. wizardry + special skill + basic/heavy attack. however, the wizardry to me is pretty inefficent as the baisic / heavy attack + special skill can finish enemy in 1 combo. And the rythym of battle make me remind KOEI RTK series, it feels good like you are a god but after some hours it become less rewarding. On the hand, Sekiro combat feeling is consitent througout the process and i enjoy every battle i will say. 

-Boss Battle 8/10
I would say some is pretty interest, my personal favor is the final boss [spoiler] the teen and white tiger [/spoiler] . On the other hand, there is annoying one [spoiler] Lu be and the dragon [/spoiler], they just keep fly around and the locking is not working well keep spinning around. And there is quite a formula of winning, you can just play passive and wait for boss red ultimate, which is most the case is easy to catch and it punish the boss hard. If you had played Sekiro, usually this strat wont work as boss like owl have quick recovery for the Stand bar so you have to play a bit aggressive which is ultimately rewarding.

-Exploration 6/10
I will say map in wo long is fine design. However my problem with the map is, the item the reward you for explore is too cheap , most of the time weapon or upgrade material, so after knowing that those are really not important you are most likely to walk slowly and feel the map. Though i get the all flag all collectable achievement, i don't feel reward except for the title

-Graphic 5/10
this is the worst part, i feel like i am playing the PS2 era RTK romance game. The environment simply don't immerse you into the game, which in Sekiro you can just stay at one place for a while and chill. My average FPS is 45 though i am using a 3080 Ti spec. Sometime there is white edge on object. The character facial model seems a direct copy and paste from PS2 RTK game

New review after playing for 20 hours.

Let's start with the goods. The goods is that combat feels close to sekiro especially with the parry and sometimes can be really satisfying! 
- The character creation is also really good, it's nioh 2 level.

-------------------------------
Now the bad!
I feel conflicted, cause I actually preordered the deluxe edition, thinking if it's the developers of Nioh, it can't go wrong. Boy was I wrong, and I've really started realising it now.
Besides combat being satisfying and char creation getting good. The combat gets boring after some hours, cause you realise that there really isn't that much diversity. 16 weapons? feels more like 3 or 4 cause many of them feels the same and it's really starting to bother me.
I know it's not a Nioh came, but man, it's really a huge step down to the depht that nioh had. Who knows, maybe in NG+ or with the release of DLC we'll have more variety and an incentive to switch out weapons more, but for now... doesn't look good.

After the first boss (which imo was super fun, but also I can see it's super unfair and really bad to place that as first boss lol), the rest was a breeze. Now there were a few semi challening ones later on, but none really came close to the first boss.

In Nioh 2 I really loved the graphics, it looked really juicy, that game is i dunno how many more years older than Wo Long, but man.. How the heck did they mess up in the graphics department with this one. Besides the graphics being a step down, there's also all these bugs and graphical glitches, like MAJOR stuttering/lag, as well as my char sometimes turning transparent as well as flickering white, which only now, REALLY annoys me.

In the beginning I wanted to support this game, but it has some major flaws, and if they don't end up fixing a lot of it, especially the performance, then the game will die out soon.

I did have my fun with the game and I'm still gonna complete it and maybe even update my review after they fix the performance issues, but so far it REALLY isn't worth the price. Wait for it to drop down to like 25 Eurors or 20, it's not worth the full price and I learned a rough lesson in never preorder games. Ceeept if it's from Fromsoftware.

TL;DR Game is fine, but too many problems that weighs down the gameplay and enjoyment, plus price is too much. final rating 5.5/10
- go play Nioh and Nioh 2 instead",1677873527,1678244651,False,1,0,0,5,True,False,False

Comments:

The combat is simple enough to grasp, but very satisfying. The key component of this is the implementation of the Spirit Gauge system, which encourages a balance of offense, defense, and evasion in order to maximize damage output. The animations are very flashy and link together in a way that is also very satisfying. Performance wise, at present, it runs fine for me on a 6650XT and a Ryzen R7 3700X, I have not noticed any real detrimental performance problems. A controller is certainly recommended. The voice acting for the English actors can sometimes feel a little overly dramatic in their delivery, but I suppose that is to be expected from a Chinese-to-English dub; it feels very Dynasty Warriors-esque in that regard. Overall, if you are a fan of FromSoftware games or have enjoyed previous Team Ninja entries into this genre, this is absolutely worth looking into.

Edit: I'm adding to my review that while the game is certainly  recommended, I've been contending with a multitude of technical problems with the game that absolutely need to be addressed. Among them are: Cooperative Multiplayer with 1 person is fine, but an additional 2nd cooperative ally renders the game practically unplayable with the amount of latency it introduces. The game frequently crashes resulting in loss of progress, particularly before or after cut scenes. Even when I successfully get in and out of cutscenes, a lot of times there is nothing but a black screen for me, and so I miss out on being able to view the cutscenes. These, in addition to some QoL functions native to NioH would make this an excellent entry into this genre - as of right now it is only okay.

One level was the area where before you fight Lu-Blu; it was dropping to like 40's. Having the camera facing in a certain direction caused it.

Nioh version 1.75, but in China, three kingdoms. I have a 2080 super and a i9-9900k. I can play at 60 FPS 1440 with everything on standard settings and FPS prioritized. I have had a few (like 4) crashes over my 15 hours of playtime. All of which have been from load screens. 0 Data loss since auto save.
They simplified a lot of Nioh mechanics for those who cried that there was too much loot to manage, you could run through most of the game spamming one weapon art etc. Personally not that big of a fan, but I haven't gotten to end game yet which is where Nioh games shine. tbd. Game is worth a buy, just isn't as good as Nioh 2 imo

Update. Chapter 4 will crash a lot. Again mainly during loading screens, but easily 15 crashes in that chapter alone.

Final update. Total game take about 30 hours to beat main story & optional maps. Most bosses are easy and can be beaten the first time you encounter them. Team Ninja clearly focused on game pacing and not depth of mechanics (not a critique). The parry system is responsive, parry windows are obvious with both visual and audio cues. Very few enemies have delayed attacks or feints that mess with timing (think of the delayed Elden Ring swings most opponents do). Also when you have to parry 5 critical blows from a single enemy in sequence you look like and feel like a bad-ass. Spells are okay, I normally use them to as a punish after I get a critical blow on a boss for free dmg. Not sure if you can actually go cast main since you only have 4 slots which is fairly lame.

The deflect system is amazing, and gives more freedom in engaging bosses for me than Nioh 1 or 2 ever did.

The new invasion mechanic is a welcome addition, but doesn't really feel very fleshed out, and it would appear that the net code isn't too great for this game, which brings me to the next section... 

Where this game falls off is in it's presentation and its current state. There are many performance issues with the game, and it most certainly should have spent more time in the oven. The PC port is rightfully being shit on right now, so take that into account until they release a patch fixing most issues. I've had semi-regular crashes and a large amount of graphical glitching so far. Enemy variety is worse than Nioh, and you'll be encountering the same enemies throughout the game.

Armour and weapon levels are somewhat relevant but the morale system is king, it creates a nice progression through levels without making you feel like your gear is ancient, you can use the same equipment from the start to the finish of the game pretty much.

There are no redeeming qualities in this game to even consider it. It tried to combine nioh and sekiro, but attempt was unsuccessful and we are left with abomination of a game without any identity. So lets list some of the major flaws.

-Enemy AI is beyond dumb, does not react to you at all, just spams block and roll after 2-3 hits everytime.
-Cant break posture with normal attacks, have to wait for deflect counter into heavy attack, usually most enemies are dead by that time and it makes combat very stale very quick(might be a spear thing, and hammer with heavy focus on spirit dmg might change this)
-Companion AI is even worse, they do absolutely nothing most of the time and die if they try because all enemies have overswings
-Companions are locked to certain missions, so fun grinding that for loyalty bonus
-Gear is oversimplified to the point where you can complete the game without a single upgrade with whatever weapon/armor you find
-Your ranged weapons do not draw arrows from storehouse
-You cant send items to storehouse during the mission, only from blacksmith
-Vines for traversal
-Bosses for regular mobs(can they stop making this trope already)
-Cutscenes, cutscenes for everything
-After finishing a main mission you are sent to next mission instantly, so in case you want to upgrade you then got to go through additional loading screen to the hub and one more back to the mission
-Technical issues, crashes, freezes
-No real build variety since they all going to play exactly the same

Pretty sure I forgot something, but it was an overall a terrible experience and something i would like to forget as soon as possible.

You throw it in their face and say there's no need and you'll buy a full pack of apples.

Several hours later you come back and yell at the merchant because their apples aren't quite as fresh as you expected and they aren't orange. The merchant looks at you confused while still nursing a broken nose from the sample apple because said apple is exactly like the ones that were sold.

Imagine what a terrible person you'd be for doing that.

Welcome to the review section for Wo Long! For some reason a whole bunch of people collectively decided to throw that demo back in the merchant's face and complain when the product wasn't what they imagined!

Including the demo which plays and performs the same as the main game (it's literally the first two levels) I've clocked approx 50h so far and finished the main campaign, perhaps people should give it a try before complaining that the game doesn't play as expected or perform well on their system. 

Game is exactly what was led to expect from the demo - I cannot stress this enough.

Naturally as a port it isn't as smooth as PC native titles and needs a bit of extra power or tweaks to get it running as expected. Could use a patch but it's more than playable unlike some other games (MHW Iceborne launch, ugg). Honestly no issues on my side here, spent a few minutes in settings and it runs great while looking just as good as the demo if not better. Graphics could be better but overall it's good enough. Can safely say that it's pretty average performance for playstation ported games from the last few years - however don't be mistaken, I would take these slightly rough PC ports over having to buy a playstation and online subscription any day.

In terms of technical issues one of the shadow options was giving me some minor flickering and the graphics quality needed to be set to ""custom"" manually before it would save changes. I also occasionally get crashes but this appears to be related to loading in and out of pvp matches as an invader - maybe once every 3-6h unless I restart but I have yet to lose any progress since they're always on loading screens and the game constantly autosaves.

PVP is usually laggy and likely tied to the hosts hardware along with internet, have had matches were it's flawless and others where it's unplayable with both sides teleporting everywhere unable to hit each other. I'm thinking it's partially tied to hardware as it's usually the same few levels that always lag with both host/invader having problems. Meanwhile I've never had a particularly laggy invader show up in my game but get it frequently when invading others.

Also use some common sense here, saw a surprising amount of reviews complaining that their 5-10 year old low-mid tier CPU/GPUs were having issues... umm... yeah, that's what happens - even if compatibility wasn't an issue a PS3 can't play PS4 games either.

If we got a PC Bloodborne port of this quality I'm pretty sure we'd still drown under the positive reviews despite the complaints that it doesn't run perfectly and has crappy keyboard and mouse controls.

Speaking of, other reviews also keep mentioning poor mouse and keyboard controls which was never more than a footnote in most other souls-like games since they're clearly designed for controllers. Really confused why it suddenly isn't acceptable this time... every game in the series plays poorly with KB/M as does the demo, that's just how these games are. Gotta use the right tool for the right job and I'm not going to lie here: if someone insists on using a hammer to do a screwdriver's job while complaining that screws aren't hammer compatible... WELL... maybe that's their problem.

Really odd to pick this game out of the pile of soul-likes to use as the hill to die on for KB/M support in the genre. Even if it's worse than average people make it sound like this is the first one to have bad KB/M support.

Controller works great, smooth and responsive although there seems to be some input queuing which takes a bit of getting used to - having extra attacks queued up which stop my evasions has sucked. I will admit this is a personal problem and I'll accept getting good as a solution, already making progress but what can I say - I like mashing attack when doing a string of attacks.

In my opinion the combat isn't quite as fun as the Nioh titles so far but it's still very good and even feels slightly better when you do things perfectly. Overall gives me extremely strong Sekiro vibes without fights being locked to an extremely specific routine. There is actual choice in the moves and weapons and strategies you can use during battle which is much more reminiscent of the Nioh and Souls titles, essentially being slightly less tight than Sekiro but without being locked to the rails of its precision choreographed sword fights.

Having all abilities tied to the stamina-like morale bar has been very interesting as well in both good and bad ways. Essentially having unlimited casts for skills and spells is extremely liberating but is taking a lot to get used to after Nioh1/2 where it felt like you never had enough until extremely late game or min/maxed builds. This is both good and bad and the only real complaints I have are the annoyances you get when using high end spells and speedrunning missions for loot. Speedrun a mission without hitting flags and you won't have high morale which makes the boss rougher while also not allowing all of your spells to be used.

Personally I feel like the moral rank requirement to use the wizardry spells in a run should be straight up removed after beating a level once, needing to go through half the run normally to be able to cast things like haste or stealth sorta negate the whole point of them. If you're farming a boss for specific drops and need to go through the whole story mission for each chance at loot - it's going to be a real long grind without speedrunning it. Nioh2 you'd just toss up the running charm and invisibility before zooming straight through the whole level once you got the path down, either that or just use the amazing crafting system to keep rerolling for the exact loot you wanted.

Getting to pick specific companions to summon is a nice touch as well, might seem dumb but bringing an NPC buddy along as an option is pretty fun to me even if they're kinda detrimental and get me killed more often than not...

Character creator could use some tweaks but it's still top tier and beats just about everything else aside from Code Vein in that regard. Won't lie, Code Vein had issues but regardless of how much you liked it - that character creator was next level as long as you're fine with its anime style.

As it stands now I've started NG+ and am fairly disappointed that it's not as good as Nioh yet in this regard. Unlike with Nioh where you keep scaling up with additional upgrades and gear levels here you just unlock a final 5* gear upgrade tier which doesn't give the same sort of ever increasing progression. Essentially higher tiers of NG+ are just fighting stronger and stronger tuned enemies while you are getting minimal extra boosts from an increased level while your armor/weapons remain stagnant. HOWEVER Nioh only got their amazing NG+ systems added with the DLC so I'd bet we're due for the same thing, won't count on and will consider it a negative for now but I will hope for it.

I've had a whole lot of fun so far and am most likely going back to replay Nioh 1&2 once I play some more and hit my progression wall in NG+.

Overall a very welcome game and I'm looking forwards to putting significantly more hours in. Usually I wouldn't review a game early like this and typically skip writing positive reviews entirely but gotta put in a good word when it's due to help offset the flood of nonsense.",1677857440,1678213658,True,9,0,0.574160218238830566,0,True,False,False

Performance is currently unoptimized but for the most part still gives you good enough FPS to enjoy the game. I can run is at 120 fps but capped it at 60FPS for other reasons I'll explain later.
Game has crashed on me about 10 times in the 27 hrs I have played so far. I also get some stuttering and some white flashes once in a while but not very often.
The thing I dislike most right now is the online Co-op is horrible. My buddy and I desync like crazy and I mean BAD. The world enemies don't take dmg then die 5 seconds later or teleport 10 feet away or my buddy will run at sonic speed clipping through walls.

Honestly it's hrad to say if I recommend the game or not at this time. On one hand if you play with a controller and like Nioh 2 / Sekiro then I'd recommend it as long as you don't mind playing solo and have some minor game optimization issues.

If this is something that will be a deal breaker I'd wait a month and see what people are saying. I guess for me I'd still recommend it as for me it's such a fun game and i'm only just getting to the half way mark with NG+ to do after.

This game will really be on the fence imo on if you should buy or not. If the DLC's are anything like they did with Nioh 2 then 100% you will have hours and hours of content to pay with.

I really wanted to enjoy it, but I just can't. The game's combat systems doesn't feel intuitive or well thought out at all. Upgrading my weapons and leveling up my skills doesn't make me feel any bit more powerful, it all hinges on the overinflated morale system. You can find flags and rest points to prevent your morale from dipping too low, but the aspect of exploration doesn't feel worth it outside of that, and if you don't, then die to a tough mob (or boss!) then good luck getting anything done. I didn't experience the technical issues as badly as some people, but after 20 hours the combat just stayed past its welcome. 

The only two things I found that feel remotely impactful on the flow and outcome of each encounter is, ofcourse, deflects and then status effects but not in a way that feels like i'm engaging with the game. My strategy didn't change, it was essentially deflect > spell/item 
 > deflect spam until i achieved the desired status and then just deflect over and over. Melee attacking just feels useless and like a waste of time outside of weaker mobs that end up getting bodied under my excessive Morale.

Technical issues aside, the game pigeonholes the player into a single playstyle with little room for customization or deviation from what the developers intended. It's uncreative and stale.

Unable to play at 120 FPS for some reason since the game turns into a slow motion movie. 60 FPS was fine how ever.

Disappointed with the difficulty of the game as it was way too easy compared to the Nioh 1/2 series. Can't believe that dirty casuals are crying and saying that the game is hard.... These people should stick playing their beloved LoL and Fortnite games. Nioh 1/2 and Wo Long is not for them. 

The pricing is strange for the game, I pre-purchased it for 27 USD and now it costs 60 USD. The game is too short, way too easy and and has much less mechanics and possibilities compared to Nioh 1/2. I believe this game could have been done better. In all honesty game is not worth more than 30 USD.

Non the less, Team Ninja was able to create a good fun game that I enjoyed playing, albeit being short.. I did like the new idea that they are trying to push merging parry/deflect system like it was in Sekiro and flow of game that was is Nioh.

If you try to play the game normally without doing that and end up dying and lose your morale, you will need to farm it all the way to max before attempting a tough enemy or boss again.

TLDR: Wait for a few patches if the occasional FPS spike is a turn off, otherwise buy if you liked NIOH/Sekiro/the demo.

Gameplay is fantastic, somewhere between dark souls and sekiro in terms of combat, The itemization is exactly what you'd expect if you're familiar with Team NINJA's earlier work. Story's also plays out similarly, but delving into Chinese folklore/history. 

As for performance, there are issues, but they're nowhere near as bad as reviews are claiming. I've had a few issues with FPS spikes and a single crash so far. Issues that will probably get smoothed out in the next couple patches, but playable now.

Despite the performance issues, I was initially hopeful and was even having fun. Somewhere around the 8-10 hour mark the glaring flaws began to take their toll on my enjoyment, and Wo Long turned from an 'interesting game' to an 'annoying and boring game'. 

My primary gripe would be the singular button that solves all problems in the game. Deflect/parry. Every mechanic, every attack, every dangerous thing in the game except a rolling log, you can parry. That's the entire game. There are no boss mechanics, there are no kill orders, no secondary bosses, no interesting multi-phase fights. Just easy or hard attacks to parry, and once you have got the timing down that's it (unless your input gets dropped due to frame lag). 

Since you are parrying ALL the time, and that is the entire game, you will soon run into the problem of your dodge key being bound to parry. Double tap to dodge. Sounds great, right? Well, you're parrying multi-hit boss attacks all the time later in the game, so you're hitting your parry button rapidly and guess what happens when you hit the parry button rapidly? You dodge. Pitifully stupid and annoying game design.

The third major issue, and it's not just a nitpick, would be the ability to hold down your guard button and also parry at the same time, which means you can (and should) just turtle behind guard along your entire adventure in the game. It's so boring, but its so strong that it makes no sense to ever not be guarding. There is no risk/reward involved in deflection of this type, just guard up and try to fish for parries to build your spirit gauge. The LEAST TN could have done would be to reduce or restrict the amount of spirit you gain while parry fishing in guard status. It's so tedious, just like guard-dodging in Nioh 2 where you should ideally be guarding while dodging 100% of the time to avoid getting gibbed if you mis time it. Sad stuff. 

What absolutely blows my mind, is that having your stance broken out of a guard actually regenerates your spirit from zero, faster than not being hit and not doing anything. It is entirely viable to generate spirit for spellcasting by having your guard broken on purpose just to get it all back, since its safer for your HP bar than attacking in many cases. Wild stuff.

What they should have done was bind parry to guard and have it be a window at the beginning of a guard, so their dogwater game wasn't so easily trivialized. I don't know how they didn't figure this out through playtesting. Dodge should be its own button, and its own type of defense that rewards good timing. They had the perfect mechanic from Nioh 2 to use here, with the feral spirit afterimage. They could have had the enemy striking your 'afterimage' and becoming 'unbalanced' as a way to generate spirit in Wo Long, along with parrying. There I just made your game 50% more interesting. It was so simple. Come on!

Overall my impression of Wo Long is wasted potential, wasted talent, wasted time, and a regression in game design that failed to incorporate lessons learned from Nioh series in favor of desperately chasing a trendy gimmick (parry spam). I couldn't wait for it to be over. Oh and the enemy variety is horrible also. There are legit like 8 different enemies in the game, and they don't even bother to reskin them or mix it up. 

I don't even want to call this a B team cash grab, it's more like C team were told to copy Nioh and make it chinese, but also make it Sekiro oh and sprinkle in some dynasty warriors. 

Other gripes:
-Trash loot. Everything is boring and the stats don't matter except for Power gain on X or Haste on X or Damage reduction on X. Put on heaviest armor you can equip and face tank it all with earth barrier. Low rarity gear once again only exists to be sold or scrapped. Only thing that matters really is defense and physical damage resist. Get that earth stat up.
-Stupid hub. The hidden village is a regression from the overworld map in nioh 2. I don't want to load into a zone and run around on hanging vines just to get to the blacksmith or mess around with character resetting. I don't care about your dumb and cringe chinese hidden village BS with souless NPC drones standing around doing nothing.
-Random martial art skills on weapons. Doesn't make sense. Why would martial arts be linked to the weapon? I should be able to select what martial arts set I want to use with a given weapon. Absolute trash game design mean to prolong gear grind artificially. Could have been made interesting by unlocking the martial art by using the weapon you found it on to become familiar with it, but nooooo. I used the same axe for almost the entire game, because it was the only one with the two martial arts skills I wanted to use, on it. Amateur hour at TN. 
-Menu devolution compared to Nioh 2, you can't compare gear side by side (????????????) and upgrading/changing stats on stuff (even though its pointless) takes way too many steps.
-The last level is pure cancer in an unfun and uninteresting, unmemorable 'just get it over with please' way that is severely disappointing. It was like the game was sensing that I was tired of it, and decided to annoy me on purpose, that is to say I felt actual animosity from the level designer directed at the player, who he would know would be tired of his shit by this point.
-Spirit summons are crap and boring. There area only two good ones. The healing dragon and the horse thing that gives you 'slow on martial arts', both are extremely overpowered and outshine the other totally pointless summons. You'd think TN would have learned their lesson about 'slowing' effects working on bosses or difficult enemies, but they didn't. 

""Wow Balm it sounds like you really didn't like the game, why don't you just go play Nioh 2 if you prefer it so much?""

I'm going to. I don't even care to attempt NG+ on Wo Long, I'd rather go start a fresh playthrough of N2 since it has superior and varied gameplay in every regard. I sincerely hope TN pulls its head out and steps up their game for the DLC. I'll be paying close attention to what they do with NG+ progression, since there is a small but real chance they can redeem themselves with expansion of the game systems and gameplay.

""But TN games only ever get truly good in NG+(++++)!""

I don't care. The NG experience was so painfully stupid that I just don't care. I don't care about the weird Chinese characters who act like I should know who they are, or the 3K setting which acts like I should be familiar with it, I don't care about any of it. There aren't even any hot demon girls like Kasha or Neotengu or Tate to care about. Why didn't you put a Kasha analogue into the game, TN? Easy points you missed out on.

[b] The elephant in the room: [/b]
This game got review-bombed on the first day of release, mostly due to KBM being non-optimized. There are also people claiming there are performance issues but apart from slight stuttering and flickering in some areas with a lot of effects.
Other than that, so far I have not encountered a single crash nor startup problem.

[b] The gameplay itself: [/b]
You probably have heard of this already: If Nioh/Nioh2 was the Dark Souls of Team Ninja, then Wo Long is the Sekiro of Team Ninja. And that is true. As much as I love Sekiro, I have to admit I prefer Wo Long over Sekiro due to the fact that there are other weapons and you can freely change the build on the go. You can also save multiple builds and switch them with a click of a button. How convenient!

Deflecting attack is a big part of the gameplay, and if you have never played Sekiro before, this might be a bit difficult. However, the deflect window is fairly generous and once you get the rhythm down you are basically good to go for the rest of the game.

The story itself is typical Team Ninja/Koei Tecmo style, where you get some cutscenes, go into a mission, and more cutscenes to explain the history/story. Personally it is not my favourite storytelling style, I don't really mind it nonetheless.

[b] TL;DR: [/b]

Id like to lift the good things first and I do enjoy the combat system and the satisfying deflects.
There is a decently interesting level system that will help you in some aspects but wont severely limit your playstyle.
The coop works very well (except on crashes, more on that later).
Now for the bad things:
The games looks arent that great, they couldv been alot better.
The Performance is garbage (i have a 3080 and even if that isnt cutting edge i still see tons of dips in performance)
The camera movement is terrible (specially when aiming a bow etc)
Mouse support is non-existant, i played the full game KB&m but had to use target-lock to get by.
Some bossfights are just not designed for target-lock, They spin around you and the camera cant really keep up and sometimes bosses fly while putting stuff in the ground so that you get hit by stuff you cant see,
Other times the camera puts you on the otherside of a wall leaving you blind while fighting.
Even if all of this above couldv made me give it a pass and not drop a review the main issue that made me come here is the stability of the game.
It crashes, ALOT.
Some maps are worse than others and iv had up to 20 crashes in one map, at one point i got hardstuck on crashing on loading screen so i had to create a new character only to get out of the crash loop, only to crash on startup 10 times so i had to verify my gamefiles.
This being bad enough if you crash in Coop, ALL progress you did on that map is gone, so you and your friends have to redo that entire map and its not uncommon to crash on the cinematic scene after you defeat the end-boss of the map, this shit pissed me off on a whole new level.
Quite frequently during coop you can ""desync"" and you will see eachother and enemys run all over the screen with no clue who is doing what or who is fighting who, altho relatively easy to fix by usually both standing still for abit it can come at bad times and just in-general lowers the quality feeling of the game.",1678188849,1678193296,False,8,0,0.500430703163146973,0,True,False,False

If you are interested but unsure why this game has such a bad rep on steam ill try to explain it and give you a way to find out whether or not you want to spend the whatever bucks it costs in your country on this game.

Lets start with the most legitimate criticizm of this game; Performance. There is nor sugarcoating, its bad. On my  pc i have to put everything on low and use the in build ""performance"" mode to get some frames, this is very bad when there is fire or it rains, two things team nija loves. i get 40-60frames then, but the game looks like GTA San Andreas and it can be distracting as hell. I dunno if the console versions run better if thats the case and you own a console, maybe get the game for consoles.

The next big part people dislike about this game is...
""This is not Nioh""
This is dumb on so many levels. The important part is, this is not Nioh 3, its not even a spin off. Bloodborne is not Dark Souls, neither is Sekiro. A Studio is allowed to diversify their games, i hope we will get a Nioh 3 since that franchise is simply one of the best games ever but this game doesnt try to be nioh it tries something else. Speaking of Sekiro, the next problem for people is
""deflect/Parry is boooring""
""no builds""

For problem one; if a game that wants you to parry instead of roll around the floor is not your cup of coffee...maybe dont buy such game? My problem with that is, the game has a Demo. You can play hours of the game before buying it, try it out, see if the gameplay loop is something your into or not. Its fine if you dislike this sort of gameplay, but its not the games fault for pushing it. Especially since it allows you to test the game for free, for hours if you want to. 

Problem too, its true, build paths and combat are simplefied. There is less incentive to really go hard on a build like you would with Nioh which has really crazy builds and progression. In this game i can only slightly change my playstyle around something like for example in my case, i picked the weapon with most spirit damage (poisture if you are coming from sekiro) and use the element which can make you take much more of said dmg (earth) and then i imbue my armor and Weapons according to it. The game still has different weapons, and armor sets, armor and weapons can have up to 4 effects to slightly diversify your experience. 
Combat is also simplefied in that the game doenst have the kind of combos that nioh does, which made weapons feel much more distinct.  
Considering all of this things, the game is incredibly fun. Might actually be my GOTY since i love the romance of three kingdomes the stupid story is somewhat endearing to me. The gameplay loop might be simpler and more straightforward but its hella stylish and hella fun. Ive not finished the game yet since i do every side quest etc but im already thinking about another playthrough.
Deflecting feels, sounds and looks cool, the characters are enjoable, armoe and weapons are transmogable so you can be stylish as hell at all times. it might be easier than Nioh and less complex but that doesnt have to be a bad thing, its less RPG and more akin to an action game. As i said before, get the demo, test it and see if you jam with it. I took me actually a while for everything to click but since that moment i wanted to just play this game day in, day out.

Im not here saying people should not critique the game, but saying its not a different game or acting as if ""sekiro´d nioh"" is by design a bad thing is just stupid.

Don't waste your hard earned money on this game thinking it'll be Nioh 3 or that it'll scratch that Sekiro itch. If you really want to try it play the demo or get on Gamepass.

[b] Gameplay [/b]

You'll be spending most of the game spamming light attacks to build enough gauge to do one of three things, a heavy attack, a weapon skill (Martial Arts), or cast a spell (Wizardry). In between doing these things you'll be parrying attacks as to not die. Rinse and repeat till the credits roll. It's fun for the first hour or so but gets repetitive quick. It also doesn't help that loot isn't abundant or builds aren't that unique, which both are a step down from Nioh 1&2.

[b] Port Quality [/b]

Horrendous, of the 20+ hours I've played I encountered a dozen crashes, constant flickering, GPU artifacting, missed inputs, and frequent microstutters. Also the game looks worse than their previous games (Nioh 1&2) and runs worse too. It's like they didn't even QA the game on PC.

[b] Story [/b]

It's there I suppose (also the cutscenes ran at sub 30 FPS for some reason).

It's mediocre at best
story is based on the good'ol three kingdom so i cannot fault them. Historical nihilism, what can i say.

combat's okay, deflect's pretty cool but that's all that there is, half the martial arts are pretty much useless and on top of that, the set martial arts on a weapon are RNG based which REQUIRES you to farm for the ones you like.

Boss fights are pretty cool visual wise, but some of the bigger monsters just arent fun to fight with, most of the enemies can just be easily dealt with with simply guarding and deflecting red attacks, there's no depth to the combat

NPC are pretty much useless

one of the worst PVP implementations, cheaters everywhere, divine beasts spam (the invader does not have divine beast, you gotta start from zero), latencies, and half of the time the invaders would be running around looking for the host because there's absolutely no indicators of where they are, in a big map at that.
the flag system is also stupid in the invasion sense, it should have been that if the host does not kill the invader they cant take the flag, not vice versa.

on top of all that, at this stage the game has got sh*t optimization, Slow-motion bug at 120fps, stutterings, audio dis-sync

firstly the gameplay: the concept of a sekiro style parry system in a rpg system like this is good on paper but the execution was lacking in a lot of ways, mostly in that it doesnt expand beyond attack, then parry outside of the magic system which doesnt allow for much in the way of creative building but ill get back to that later

the leveling system: the 5 individual levels being based off of the five phases is a really creative way to explain the different ways of leveling stats but realistically its just a way of masking a really bad rock-paper-scissors since all it does at the end is make your element really strong against one element while being countered by another, but also just being kinda basic against anyone else

the rpg system: man oh man where do i start, it feels like a lot of the rpg systems for this game were tacked on because they wanted it to be like nioh but it just doesnt work right now (if ever) because you can get all of the fancy endgame gear and it all only still gives you incremental stat bonuses instead something like niohs graces that gave you altered gameplay effects

the story: i wish i could say that the story of the three kingdoms they set up was at least something to write home about but it isn't. the story as written is all over the place and skips over a ton points in time only for it to be over as quickly as it started.

the world and boss design: the world itself is designed pretty well and for what its worth is very pretty the bosses however a lot of the time left me saying either ""thats it?"" or ""what a bullshit gimmick""  because they had all but 2-3 attacks that they would use and sometimes an ability that they would spam leaving you with no time to actually fight the boss

the magic system: cool in theory but most of the spells are either objectively weak attacks with little to no buildup on elements, a sweeping version of the same attack (daring today team ninja?) or enfeeblement spells that just dont do anything to a majority of the enemies, another big downside is that despite having over 50+ spells you still get only 4 slots at any given point in time (fucking seriously guys how are you going to give us this many spells and make it such a god damn haste to do ANYTHING with it) it was so annoying to deal with that i eventually just stuck to using 4 spells after chapter 3 even when they werent good for the area because it got so annoying constantly having to switch my spells out for others (and i know about the battle sets, but the point still stands that i shouldnt have to save a SET of spells when i should just be able to take them all the ones i want with me at any point anyways)

this game has a lot of potential to be great  but as of right now it falls flat on its face in almost every way and i hope that the DLCS coming at some point make it better but im not going to hold my breath on it",1678170956,1678170956,False,4,0,0.540816307067871094,0,True,False,False

*Update*
Still poorly optimized but I am no longer upset about the mission thing, Deflection windows are less forgiving than Sekiro but it is also a little more simplistic.  Invasions seem interesting but it really messes with my multiplayer connection when said invasion is happening, sometimes I will have someone in the broken spirit state and go for the kill, suddenly, they deflect the attack and finish me instead, acting as if they were never down in the first place.

Im getting 60 to high 70 fps on 4K resolution and prioritize resolution mode. If i set to FPS mode, im getting 100 to 120 fps and on 4K. My specs: i7 12700K, RTX 3080Ti, 32 GB RAM. I went in and set the graphic setting once and the graphic is buttery smooth.

Next and which is most vitals: im not a fans of souls-like game or difficult game. The one and only souls-like game i played is elden ring. I had 80+ hrs in it, and more than 70% of the elden ring bosses i beat it by community carry me including final boss. Its impossible to beat elden ring boss if u are newbie to the genre even early game bosses. However, i only spent 1 to 2 hrs (adding demo time) to beat the first boss in Wo Long. The next few bosses i died ZERO times and beat it without death. The first boss is a tutorial and deflecting skills mastering. If u can beat the first boss, u will be considered mastered the deflecting system; the remaining boss will be easier with some exceptions. Hence i would say Wo Long is newbie friendly because even red powerful attack u can parry, With the morale system u can grind normal mobs a bit to increase it before boss encounter. Every time u successfully deflect, u can feel the impact and metal hitting metal sound is awesome. 

Wo Long is better than elden ring in terms of stats distribution where u can min-max ur stats to ur play style. U can also use magic spell along side with melee build and doesn't have the feel of ""choose magic or melee"". 
The combat is super fast, dodging and parrying is fluid and not clunky at all. 
Although this is not open world, there is still sense of exploration to find chest and flags. U must go off the beaten path to find these, as some is hidden in location that is far from where u should go. 

Lastly character customization is very robust , u can make the most beautiful lady or handsome warrior. Ur character will appear on all story cut-scene and sometimes its close up shots.

All 5 phases are the same as each stat of  a dark souls game, but each one has its own spells. You need to spend level ups to get health/carry weight/attack damage/stealth/status effects etc. But for each level up you spend in a phase, you are throwing 4 attributes away and losing access to their spells, so its not black and white. Wood is health for instance. If you level up anything but wood, you have significantly less health than a wood user. This leads to very flawed boss fight mechanics that certain players can completely cancel out or ignore. For instance, fast attacking bosses that flinch on being hit, can be over powered by the 0 flinch earth self buff. However, the very next boss may be a lightning boss that removes that mechanic and flys in the sky away from you.
2nd Morale system. Ah the mechanic that leads to the flawed version the game is in now. Each player has a morale level that starts at 0(or the party hosts level in online), and builds up for combat kills, parries, flags, but goes down for making mistakes in combat or dying. It caps out at 25 so far, and each enemy unit spawns with a preset number. What does morale do? The higher your morale, the higher your damage and lower your enemies damage to you. The problem? Enemy bosses that spawn with 20+ have been designed under the idea you will be around 20 or so when you reach them. The levels you spend in health/defense and or using healing mean nothing when you get bopped from 15 morale down to 10 in a boss fight and now you do less than half damage and take double. Or you go in with 25 and the enemy boss does nothing and you can completely ignore every mechanic.
Boss mechanics.
One boss, is a cloning wizard, who starts with himself and 9 clones(or so didn't count) of himself. He spends the entire fight running away and throwing ranged spells that stun you, and so do each of his clones. You must find out which is the ""real"" boss as they all stun lock you, but also kill him as he attempts to flee constantly from you through his own minions that body block you, push you, flinch you, and damage you. Each clone can even use the ""morale decreasing attacks"". Did I mention the boss has ""unflinching"" buffs and ""increased resistance"" buffs from each clone. Great.... oh and lightning counters earth so the ""unflinching"" buff you apply to yourself is instantly removed in this fight. 
You cannot push this boss without being stun locked without specifically altering your entire build for it.

So sad to see people reviewing this game so poorly when its SO GOOD!!!

PC PERFORMANCE:
As far as PC performance goes I have no issues other than a rare crash. The game auto saves so frequently that even when it did crash I would lose no progression or lose very little. That being said I run a very beefy PC with and I7-10700k and a 3070ti and was able to run the game on max settings at 1440p.

GAMEPLAY:
love the soulsborne games and have played through all them all. However, I tried Nioh back in the day and could never get into it and avoided Nioh 2. I didnt even know this game was coming out till a few days before it realsed. the day before launch I downloaded the demo and took a try, I expected like Nioh I wouldnt like the game. But after dying to the first boss maybe 15 times I was hooked! As a soulsborne player it took me a bit to get used to the parry mechanic and not just rolling around. But once I took the time to learn the mechaics of combat I fell inlove, Im even expecting im going to play Nioh 2 after now! The spirit gauge is a great system that give the combat some push and pull. you can play safe and keep your spirit gauge in the blue, or like me you can play at deaths door praying I dont miss the next parry. This game has extremley fun fluid combat if youi take the time the learn and appreciate it.

LEVEL DESIGN:
Each level in this game was so much different from the one that followed it. Each level i started felt so much different from the last and they each even had little gimmics special to that area. Each zone look beautiful and really unique that I quickly felt myself immersed in the game. One thing people complain about and I do agree on is the limited enemy variety. early bosses become stronger enemies later in the game. That being said I dont think its as bad as other games or takes away from the amazing experience.

I could write more and more, but ill finish this review off by giving you guys my pros and cons of the game.

Pros:
- Great challenging gameplay
- Fluid rewarding combat system
- Interesting spell and spirit system
- Fortitude/ Moral System
- interesting and fun boss fights
- Great level design

Cons:
- May have bad PC performance
- Loot is constant and seems tedious
- confusing min maxing stat system
- Small pool of enemies

Gameplay, Storyline, combat is excellent.
I play keyboard and mouse with no problem at all
Only problem i have is while playing mouse and keyboard i cant switch weapon during the fight like controller do. But still it does not ruin any of my gameplay.
Hope they fix this in the future so that keyboard and mouse players can enjoy the game even more

Tons of equipment choices.
Great effects.
Many different playstyle.

This game is easy af please make it harder.

Satisfying and innovative combat that rewards active learning and quick thinking in the heat of it.  Once you achieve the state of flow there really isn't anything else like it on the market.  Loot and crafting mechanics are much more tolerable than Nioh because the amount of random variables has been reduced.  Playing a team ninja game on M+KB is like playing an RTS on controller and if you try to make it work you deserve all of the pain you receive.  Didn't have any noticeable stuttering or FPS drops but did have frequent graphical bugs like flickering in the user interface or on characters/environment.  PvP has a lot of potential as the pvp combat feels very good when you get a good connection, feels very manageable compared to something like souls or elden ring invasions because damage numbers in wo long are small.  The stability needs to be improved and the mechanics surrounding it need work, such as the queue needing to be manually refreshed if you fail to find anyone, or not having any inkling of where the host is when spawning in.  Another minor complaint is ammunition not auto-refreshing from storage when you rest at a flag, which heavily throttles Water builds, as ranged weapons are one of the main things they get bonuses to.  The only other complaint that could maybe be squeezed out is enemy variety suffering late-game, but all of the powerful enemies are enjoyable enough to fight that it hasn't been a real detriment to enjoyment.

As for me, the game is running just fine without any of the frame-rate spikes the majority of reviewers are dealing with. 

i5-9600K, RTX 2070, 32 Gb RAM and I'm running the game off an SSD.

With that out of the way, how is the game when it's running as intended? 

This game comes from the developers of Nioh 2 and takes some very obvious inspiration from FromSoftware's Sekiro. This game emphasizes parrying with precise timing, and the use of special abilities in the form of ""Martial Arts"" to break an enemies morale, opening them up for flashy finishing moves. And when you get the flow of combat down you can pull of some really satisfying combos between your basic attacks, ""Spirit"" or heavy attacks, martial arts and a ton of different spells you choose from. 

In exploration the game feels exactly like Nioh 2. You're encouraged to find extra hallways and rooms that contain chests in order to find gear, items to upgrade your gear and other usable items. You end up getting a lot of items dumped on you and without prior experience in Nioh and other soulslike games, you'd probably struggle to figure out exactly what the most optimal gear set is for your weapons and playstyle for quite some time. Item variety is fair, though you end up with quite a few more items that don't suit your character than stuff you'll actually use most of the time. 

The story is there; I started skipping most of the cut scenes after Chapter 2 though. It's not that interesting, but maybe if you're deep into Dynasty Warriors lore there's something there for you, since the game seems to take place in that Dynasty Warriors universe what with the Yellow Turbans being the main bad guys up to the point I'm at right now. 

Overall this game is definitely not a knock-off version of Dark Souls, Sekirio, or Nioh 2; But it's definitely going to feel familiar to anyone who has experience in any of those games. The gameplay mechanics are well polished and I think if they can address the performance issues early this game could prove to be an extremely fun experience for anyone who's a fan of good souls-likes.

I think this game falls short in a lot of ways. In general, I would recommend this game after it becomes optimized for the PC for a quick casual play through. The story is fine because its tough to mess up with an adaptation of romance of the three kingdoms, my only gripe with the story is that some characters, other than the protagonist, feel very forced to stay relevant in the game. You are just there staring at the story and all of a sudden there is a scene with someone you forgot about and says exposition...

 compared to Nioh 1 this game feels more unrefined and it had a lot of quality control skipped. For example, you can't compare gear. In a game where you can pick up the same item with different stats 5 times in the same battle. You can only check your storage/upgrade/sell at the blacksmith, in the village, after travelling with the flag, after loading the main battle, after watching the long cut scene. Nioh 1, you finished the level after the cutscene and then you get to the map and you can choose the blacksmith. In general managing and using the inventory is a big hassle. 

The game is generally difficult to play, it has a very steep learning curve if you never played a souls-like, even if you played Sekiro or Nioh I still think this game would be difficult and sometimes tedious for some reasons; combat itself feels dull after you finish the game and want to keep playing. It's light attack a couple of times to build blue Qi and the heavy attack to either decrease their max Qi or they die for enemies or repeat until the boss dies. Speaking of, you feel very plain compared to the characters you fight, Zhang Liao, for example, has a sword as a base but when he summons his (animal) he starts attacking and uses the sword as a lightning spear and you just have your weapon and just standing there. Your special moves and magic suck and they got me killed way more than they did damage or were useful. I gave up on using magic after getting the fire level 40 magic move and the problem, for me, was why waste time using spells while just attacking does the same thing better.

I like this game overall, even after all of this, the level design is better than the 2 Niohs and has more memorable levels and music. Characters are sometimes very and have some weird pauses but I guess that is just the standard for ROTK games. I hoped for more characters to have a unique design but that didn't happen. Also the fact that the game stops when Shu, Wu and Wei are going to start their fights disappointed me. Hopefully the DLCs will make up for that and I hope they fix their various PC issues 

My conclusion is that this game has a lot of flaws that can be fixed with patches, damage numbers need to be fixed, stealth is messed up, both damage and detection. Magic is too risky while having negligible damage and very short buff duration. Using your (Beast) is very meh compared to both Niohs, no spectacle and you don't feel like you just summoned your (doragon). I think this is what happens when you make a monster hunter like game and a souls-like at the same time.

Positives of the game:
-Putting down a flag revives your bros, fill your hp and dragon tears, and doesn't reset enemy spawns until you bow to it. And, it saves the game so when the game crashes you don't have to do everything again.

-1st Lu bu fight

-You are the only person in 2nd century China able to deflect attacks, until....

-You are suspiciously silent.

-You are the 4th sworn brother.

-The villain is like eggman but he is not obsessed with a blue hedgehog.

-Kodamas are now demon pandas that always give you an accessory even if you give them a 4 star +9 weapon

After much play, I can definitely say the game is going in the right direction, but needs a lot of polishing. 
Small little quality of life absences adding up makes you wonder why they didn't take a leaf from Nioh 2.
Things like ranged ammo not auto-refilling from resting at flags (especially when you can have hundreds in the storehouse) and the storehouse itself only being accessible from the blacksmith.

Not being able to go to the travel map after a mission and having to go back to the main hub. Item Refashion not having previews of what you're about to put on and having to undecorate an item in order to change it to something else. Among other things.

And while I wonder if the endgame truly is meant to be a grindfest, the drop chance from this games Divine equivalent in NG+ might be a bit too low, especially when crafting does not exist.

A little more control over being able to swap martial arts on weapons would honestly go a long way, ultimately.

Overall other aspects of the game are honestly solid. I didn't talk about performance because honestly others have and I think with time the game will come into it's own, even with the rougher start.

Plays just like a souls-like would, only with a heavy emphasis on parrying - which you cannot do on PC with the game's current optimization.
I like the story a lot since i am big sucker for Chinese myth/romantic tales of the three kingdoms and the yellow turban rebellion, and i also like martial arts and the kung fu fighting style with their respective weapons.
Combat isn't fantastic; with a keyboard and mouse i struggle at fighting more than 1 enemy at once with the camera controls and the lock target switch shit, but once i'll get my controller i'll update this review...otherwise, the combat is a real let-down, coming fresh off of a nioh 2 playthrough. No more combo rushing enemies, very repetitive attack sequences are making me spam parry and light attack, and combine that with the fps issues its almost impossible to play well.
I like the weapons, but since they gave up on the skill tree and the special moves that the nioh 2 weapons had, i tend to forget what i like a second ago and just go for stats and versatility.
As for enemies, i think i am past the 3rd boss, maybe, and i have only seen 5-6 enemy types with slight variations between them. As it is chinese myth we're talking about, with the romanticized heroes and the spirit things that were in nioh 2 as well, i would have really enjoyed it if they had put in the effort to make the enemies human rather than add in those grotesque demons that are almost made in one color only, or two (dark brown and red), which makes me fail to admire them since the colors blend in so well together.

On the down side there is a few things that hurts the game in my eyes, first dying doesn't really have the effect like most games of this type (Odd complaint I know), Normally something is lost in games like that even if you are careful you can recover them. Losing this little feature oddly enough removes alot of the tension from fights, and to a degree diminishes the excitement in those fights. Another thing is the enemies and bosses don't aggro the NPC's helping you, this needs to be restored even if it's rather easy to pry them off of your NPC help. While alot of people are complaining that the poor keyboard and mouse controls are an issue, games like this has never been great in that area. If this is an issue for you, use a controller, it's a simple fix. Lastly there are times when the character feels like the are moving in water, they get slow and sluggish, not sure if this is an FPS issue of something else but it needs to be fixed.

I feel like KOEI made a game perfect for a particular group of people and I am definitely one of them.

Everyone complaining about initial release bugs, I want to ask why its problematic in this game, but Dark Souls was fine? I'm sure they'll work it out as they go.

The story is a bit weird if you don't have any grounding either in Chinese mythology or exposure through games to some of the stranger aspects of Wuxia stories, some of this will be a little strange. Having said that, its not so difficult you won't be able to follow along.

Keep in mind yes, technical bugs exist. Sometimes the graphics flicker in and out. It occasionally crashes to desktop. Luckily the game has frequent save points. This means you don't risk losing more than 5 minutes of progress if you get beat by a player or challenge a mid-boss and fail spectacular. I keep online interactions on because unlike some of the souls/likes, its been interesting and enjoyable even when I lose.

Those fearful that the item used to summon helper NPCs being a consumable, they drop from enemies and they're found pretty easily, so the amount I had consistently increased over time.

I feel like once the tech issues get ironed out I hope more people give this game a shot. I am hoping it doesn't get review bombed into oblivion before then.

Also, unlike Souls games, remixing your character becomes a free exercise after area 3 in the story. I really appreciate that the game has opened up the opportunity to try different builds and options the way they have. You can still beat every enemy and boss with whatever load-out you personally like best, but its nice to try everything the game has.

I don't know that I will spend hundreds of hours in this game, but every hour I have spent with it so far(~16hrs) has been a ton of fun. I look forward to beating it and seeing if there is any kind of post-game or new game+ content.

If tech issues are a problem for you, maybe wait a month or three. Or later for a sale.

It's easily the most approachable souls-like game I've played, without being watered down (like Jedi: Fallen Order). The deflect timing is tricky, but you can hold block AND deflect, so there's wiggle room. I've found it easier to figure out bosses in Wo Long than in Elden Ring. Play the demo. If you can get past the first boss, you'll be fine. The PC port starts with most graphic settings far too high, creating terrible graphic performance. You'll need to do some manual config setting.

Long Version.

The level designs do a good job of not forcing a ton of repetition if you die. Critical enemies stay dead, and ""battle flag"" checkpoints tend to not be far apart. 

The ""Morale"" system is pretty ingenuous. It's a leveling system that applies only in mission, usually starting at 1 and going to 20. It creates a scaling curve through the entire mission. It helps encourage exploring the level both to be at par for the boss, and it gives a noticeable buff versus enemies in earlier areas of the mission, making back tracking to look for items much easier.

For players familiar with Nioh 2, gear, leveling perks, and the magic system is simpler. Weapons no longer have skill trees. Equipment rarity indicates the number extra perks, not overall damage / defense, and can be upgraded easily, alleviating droughts of bad RNG. Overall, this makes changing playstyle super easy. I've totally reconfigured my character because my current approach was getting beat by a boss, and that's not really something I could do in Nioh 2.

The PC optimization complaints are legit, you will get stuttering, massive frame drop, and screen flash with the default graphics configurations. After about 30 minutes of messing with settings, I've been stable 60 fps @ 4K on a 3070 for 10+ hours of game time. It was tedious, but not worth negative reviews. Drop **everything** to low settings, turn off all additional graphic process, then turn things back on / up settings and check frame rates hold. Keep ambient occlusion off, that consistently produces screen flashes.",1678136097,1678136097,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Spirit (poise) is used to cast spells and use weapon special attacks which is unique and fun. Spirit can be increased past baseline by landing normal attacks and deflecting incoming attacks or spells. This makes for a really engaging give and take flow to battle.

Performance is good, I'm on an i7 8700k and a GTX 1080 and I maintain 70-90 fps at 1080p on high settings. Ambient occlusion is broken though, with it on there are occasional white flashes on the screen, so definitely turn that off, makes no real noticeable difference in appearance. Also every time I restart the game I have to turn off ambient occlusion as it is re-enabled which is annoying. I have experienced the occasional crash, usually this has happened in the hub area when interacting with NPCs.

Visuals are decent, unfortunately the art direction on the first couple maps is pretty bland and monotone. All around the environment visuals aren't really anything to write home about, but character details and looks are good.

Map layout is good, with plenty of nooks and crannies and alternate routes to explore, this is not like Sekiro or other games from FromSoft, it isn't one large interconnected map, each map is its own contained thing. The flag (bonfire) system being linked to an in map leveling system is a cool touch. The more flags you claim the higher your moral gets, you can also increase your moral by killing enemies and deflecting critical strikes. Enemies have a moral as well, the higher their moral is compared to yours the more damage they do to you and the less damage you do to them and vise-versa. If you are good enough you could rush through to the end, or you could take the time to explore the map and find all the flags to even the playing field.

As for story, if you aren't at least a little familiar with the lore surrounding the Three Kingdoms period of Chinese history you will have no idea what the hell is going on and have a lot of trouble following the story. If names like Cao Cao, Liu Bei, Lu Bu, Dong Zhuo, Guan Yu, or the Yellow Turban Rebellion mean nothing to you, well you're gonna struggle a bit. If you played Dynasty Warriors then you will be right at home.

I'm writing this review as a fan of Souls like and any form of media that takes place in The Three Kingdoms period. This game stood on the shoulders of 2 Nioh games, and it's not surprising that going into Wo Long I had some expectation, expectation of a Nioh like genre on top of the Sekiro style deflection gameplay. As someone who has explored every corner of the main story, and witnessed the ending, I sadly cannot recommend Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty. 

Let's get the elephant in the room out of the way, yes the game absolutely has performance issues, and is prone to crashes, but 80% of the first week reviews have already mentioned that, and I don't want to be a parrot. 

Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty heavily relies on the excitement and the flashiness of the combat. Rare do you have so few categorized weapons, yet each of them felt unique, thanks to the well choreographed animations and the updated graphics. Some areas and cutscenes can be extremely beautiful, almost on par with FF7 remake, during the ending battle where they stood on the rooftop with the sunset, and some can look absolutely abominable. If you enjoyed watching your character obtain guardian spirit after every major encounter in Nioh, boy then I have a game for you. Every single time, it plays the absolute same animation over and over again, repeating the same cycle of ""Xiau Xiau had a sad life, but dedicated himself to bring peace"" Then some mythical ancient Chinese animal flies into you, repeating this 50 times.

The parrying mechanic instead of dodging was very intense and fun to master, but once you've learned how to properly deflect and dodge, it is extremely easy, the first boss can attest to this. Many complain about the jump in difficulty on the first boss, but nonetheless thinking back, it was a pretty neat way to make sure that the players have learned the basics of combat, thereby preparing them for what is about to come. The bosses themselves have moves that can be quite easily read, and you'll learn the window of when to deflect their attacks quite fast, thereby making the flow of the fights between the normal enemies and the boss encounters extremely fun and well adjusted, once you've mastered the combat. The combat of this game solves the issue that Sekiro had. The R1 and deflect META. In Sekiro, due to the limited resources that you can't gain without using a consumable, R1 and deflect the most reliable strategy. But Wo Long, has it's merit giving you gauge to manage and let's you use all kinds of abilities in the middle of a encounter, to replenish said gauge, you merely need to land a hit or deflect, thereby making the flow of combat absolutely amazing, and I wish other games would ditch stamina and finite combat resources.

The environment and area design is extremely uninspiring and dull, the “scary” corruption on each map can just blend in with the entirety of a normal chinese forest, that’s how dull it is, might’ve well not have been there and nothing would change. 

If you enjoyed the Nioh story, you'll be right at home. Because it's a copy pasted storyline of you trying to stop an evil man from doing an evil act. If you expect the full Three Kingdoms story line to be played out, like I did. Sadly you might have to wait for Wo Long 2. This game goes as far as Battle of Guandu, merely stepping it's toes into the middle of the Three Kingdoms story. The performance of this game does have me a bit worried that Wo Long 2 wouldn’t be a thing, or it won’t get the same treatment as Nioh 2. Sadly, the only aspect they wouldn't down right copy and paste from Nioh, was the massive abundance of sub quests. The sub quests in this game are a biggest disgrace I've ever seen. 70% of the sub quests are the same as the previous main quest, but this time you have to run in reverse, back to where you previously were. For a price as much as $59.99, you would expect a lot of content and a time sink of a game, or maybe a storyline that takes place from the start of the Yellow Turban rebellion to the rise of the Sima Clan. I don't blame you, because I thought the exact same.  

We can go on for hours about how flawed this game is. It can clearly be seen that they've put too much effort into the combat, and almost nothing else. This is most likely a conscious decisions in preperation for the sequel, which they've already teased.

Personally, I find this game more difficult than Nioh 2 but it's just as fun. The combat is smooth and easy to learn and there are comparable details to Nioh 2, so much is memorized already. 

The flaw I've seen is that the game has very little combat freedom compared to Nioh 2. I don't feel great using the other weapons when I picked up Dual Swords and many bosses demand specific ways to beat them. While this can be fun, it's annoying to figure out.

Unique Combat styles 
Jolly Co-op 
Game allows to redistribute all stat points at a certain point, free of charge.
Challenging and rewarding boss fights.

Cons:
Stuttering 
PvP is hit or miss
Wo Long will randomly force close between 1-3 hours of playtime
Constantly connecting to people who with a terrible connection
 
Conclusion: 
If you enjoy co-op and just playing thru the story with challenging but rewarding boss fights, then this game is for you. If you don't want PvP you can disable it.


 If you came looking mostly for a PvP experience, this may not be the game for you until PvP is re-balanced.

It is a bit sad to see Wo Long with mostly negative reviews, but most are justified. Poor m&k controls, screen flashing, crashes (only had 3 myself through first completion of main story, and two were during cut scenes.) Frame drops didn't affect me very much, can remember 3 times was noticeable though (All lightning related).

However, I truly enjoyed this game. Most fun I've had for awhile in a game, being a Dynasty Warriors fan for a long time does add some bonus points as well. Game is challenging enough to pick up, but doesn't take long to become adept enough to make your way through the game. I was able to ignore most stats and item passive buffs throughout most of the game, didn't start paying attention to them until the last 1/4 of the main story when I really started to experiment with counter building bosses. A lot of wizardry combinations to be utilized if you take a moment to look at them all. Was able to pick up the game mechanics and details pretty easily, and a useful tutorial menu is available whenever you need it.

PvP is a bit wild, I've invaded a healthy amount of times to try things out. Connection has been stable, except for ONE map. I don't know why it is only during this ONE map, but connection absolutely laughable in it. Teleporting host and companions, dealing no damage for a few minutes, always at max-negative spirit. A real interesting experience. But, as I said, it only happens on ONE map for me. Still plenty of areas I haven't invaded in yet. PvP seems to either be a spam fest, or just staring at each other to see who gonna get deflected first. Shamefully, I always forget about wizardry spells in invasions, but when i do remember, they have the ability to completely change the energy of the fight. I've enjoyed the PvP for the most part, 1v3 fights are the normal sadly. (at least in my experience)

I really enjoyed the story as well, I've consumed my fair share of Three Kingdoms media, and I am more than happy to add this to the collection. Having knowledge about these characters before hand add so much more to the story. I was constantly trying to figure out how they had chosen to handle certain event, or waiting for a character to make their entrance into the plot. Very satisfied with how they went about everything and the relations the character have with each other.

Highly recommend if you can push past the valid negative reviews, or just wait for a few patches. Haven't played the Nioh games, and only a little Sekiro, but people should stop comparing to the Souls series and Elden Ring.

A lot of players are comparing it to Nioh, Sekiro and other soul like games. In my personal opinion and game experience, they should not do it because this game it's a new  and does not have any Linked historic to the ones above except for Nioh Productions.

Game was clearly designed for a console -- if you're on steam you know this, it's nothing new. The NIOH port to PC was not great and always felt wonky to me. This feels fine.

      The morale rank system is the biggest front. From what I can tell, the morale rank system is a level system inside of levels. Sounds odd, but, to explain, the level starts you out at morale rank 0 and as you kill things it levels you up. Simple. The issue is that your enemies have this rank as well. It makes them stronger and you weaker the higher the disparity in ranks is. So if you have recently died and you lost a good chunk of that rank then that enemy you were on par with hurts 3x as much as it did previously. 
       This is an issue when it comes to dealing with bosses because, obviously, you will die. A lot. so now the boss does more damage and you do less... It just ruins the fun of attempting a boss and failing to run back into it and just have an even steeper hill than your first time trying.
        Oh btw, the rank you lost can be regained, but only after killing the enemy that killed you... So you see this rank is a horrible addition to a game like this. I have played all the dark souls games, sekiro, and nioh games, but this system was the worst design choice for this type of series. It needs to be removed or act like it did in nioh and you can pick it back up like a souls drop. As it is now it is just awful to deal with.
         Also, that totally made up system that makes enemies stronger and only seems to be there to harm the player, has all the cool wizardry spells tied to it so you can't use that cool fireball spell you waited for 30 levels to get until you are a certain morale rank to use it. The system is the antithesis of fun and I do not understand why it was ever an idea in the first place. 
          I hope the reviews are being watched by Team NINJA. If they want to keep this system then make the spells not a part of it.

Before I write anything else, if you think you might be interested in Wo Long - download the free demo and try it for yourself! Thats what I did. I have a ""middle of the road""/lower end gaming PC (Ryzen 7 5800 processor, Nvidia 3050 GPU, 16gb RAM) and I have ZERO ISSUES running this game on high settings.

Review:
As a lover of the Nioh franchise (400+ hours between the two games), and desperately hoping for Wo Long to be the spiritual successor to those games, I am happy to say that: I love Wo Long! (and I'm only writing this review, my first, to offset the undeserved negativity).

The game itself is exactly what I was hoping for, and more. Wo Long brings a new, exciting story and beautifully designed setting with fresh lore, told through a familiar dark fantasy flavor - this time in Three Kingdoms era China, which so many beloved books, movies, TV shows, anime and video games are based on.

Combat has been streamlined a bit from Nioh 2 (no stances), but the fast paced, fluid and flashy attack sequences are still the bread and butter of the game. A new resource - spirit - evolves the ki bar from Nioh and produces a builder-spender flow from which stance-damaging heavy blows, martial arts special attacks, and magic an be used. This keeps combat furiously fast paced and aggressive. The parry-riposte system which is drawing many Sekiro comparisons, is simply the next iteration of the burst attack/counter system from Nioh 2. The RPG and Diablo-esque elements of the Nioh games has also been pared down, which is not entirely unwelcome, however the variety of stats and armor set bonuses remain. It will be determined in the future if and how this element evolves with DLC/NG+.

There are some quality of life regressions in the HUD and inventory management, and sub missions are presented in an obtuse way and therefore are easy to miss; however the game is a massive success. When I first heard that Wo Long was to be Team Ninja's ""Sekiro"" entry, as Nioh was their ""Dark Souls"", I was worried that all of the flexibility, freedom and flavor that was designed in to Nioh would be lost, with a high stakes parry simulator being all that remains. Thankfully that fear never materialized. Wo Long remains a multiple-approach combat system where fearless and relentless attack, dodging, blocking, and ranged combat remain viable alternatives to the parry minigame.

The attack animations are captivating and stylish, heavy attacks feel satisfying when they connect and posture break an enemy - lining them up for a critical hit. Martial arts bring additional flavor and power to your combos, and the magic system further enhances your offensive and defensive capabilities. 

In terms of difficulty, it is similar to the Nioh games. If you choose to use ALL of the tools available to you, the game is considerably easier than if you sit on one particular aspect of the combat experience. If you have no experience with Nioh, there will be a rather steep learning curve that is front loaded (IE the game actually gets easier as you progress deeper in to your playthrough and NG+). If you're a veteran of Nioh (or the souls genre in general) this game will probably feel average, if not easy for you. Personally, I don't mind that at all. Bosses have taken me roughly 30 minutes each to learn and take down for first kills, playing through blind. And I know there will be walls later in the game that will be much more difficult. 

In terms of volume of content, howlongtobeat says story and side missions should roughly take 30-40 hours, which would be comparable to the Nioh games. I'm almost 10 hours in to my file and I'm already satisfied with the product enough to justify the $60 price tag. I suppose I will come back to edit this review once I've fully completed the game, and later DLC.

I can only hope that Team Ninja follows the same DLC/NG+ format as with the Nioh games, bringing more weapons, systems and progression with each release.

Horrible optimization, random crashes on nearly 45 minute to hour long missions with tons of secrets you then have to regrab only wasting more time. Randomly not saving progress so entire changes to build have to be redone. Gameplay is simply deflect spam over and over. PvP is desync'd and so is multiplayer. No real complexity to combat as much as it is memorizing the rhythm and tempo of enemy attacks just so you can deflect anything coming at you and maybe get to punish if two or more enemies aren't charging up critical attacks on top of you to chain you with or without the i-frames from the animation of deflecting one of them.

I don't care about mouse and keyboard support since I use a controller for all of these type of games so that's a niche issue that doesn't pertain to me.

I just don't think the game is there and well thought out compared to its predecessors. Story is very... odd at times with how it does time scaling for its pacing.

The game doesn't have the best graphics still but it's not bad. Gameplay is much more fun without the performance issues. If you enjoyed Nioh or Stranger of Paradise you'll probably enjoy this. 

If you're a souls veteran like me you might find the morale system a nice feature as it gives you an incentive to defeat enemies rather than running past them as you grow stronger the more morale you build up.

Deflecting, whilst a pretty basic combat feature, does feel satisfying and doesn't really come with the downsides of soul shield in SoP or parrying in Souls games as you can use it against ANY attack, though this does make it a little too good once you're familiar with enemy movesets.

Plenty of nice quality of life things like the ability to freely respec at any time from the main hub area which is great as the different wizardry spells require different stat distributions, allowing you to experiment with whatever build you like.

NB -  Shame on the people complaining about m&k controls when these games are NOT designed or developed to be played that way. Just because it's on PC doesn't mean you should play with m&k, I find it crazy that anyone needs to say that in 2023...",1677865961,1678124135,True,1,0,0.46495172381401062,0,True,False,False

Ce jeu est basiquement Sekiro et Nioh qui ont eu un enfant. Au début je lui donnait 8/10, mais avec le temps et en jouant à Nioh 1 pour la première fois, je me rends compte qu'il manque un petit ""oumph"" que Nioh fait beaucoup mieux. 

Premièrement, le jeu est une version plus simple de Nioh. Le système craft est beaucoup plus simple, il n'y a pas de concept de ilvl alors tu peux build up vers le meilleur gear assez rapidement si tu trouves du gear 4 étoile.  Le combat est beaucoup plus simple, le timing de parry est assez forgiving.

Deuxièmement, c'est un Nioh/Souls-like assez mashy par moment. Il manque le côté un peu plus lent et stratégique d'un Souls/Nioh game. C'est plutôt un gameplay action/réaction fast pace, ce qui donne l'impression de gameplay mashy.

Troisièmement, d'un point du vue positif... J'aime beaucoup le design des boss. Les combats sont vraiment intéressants. J'aime bien le système de moral aussi. J'ai adoré retrouver les personnages historiques que j'avais initialement connu par la série de jeux Dynasty Warriors, c'était assez nostalgique à ce niveau.

Pour finir, je n'ai eu aucun problème de performance alors ma note sera basé sur le gameplay particulièrement. Je dirais que ce jeu mérite quand même un bon 7/10, je ne regrettes pas de l'avoir acheté à plein prix, mais j'aurais aimé qu'il soit un peu plus complèxe comme Nioh et n'importe quel Souls game.",1678120709,1678123259,True,0,0,0.487179487943649292,0,True,False,False

Things I liked: 
- Story is decent, i like it a bit more than nioh 2 though I grew up with Dynasty Warriors so there are some bias there
- Combat is amazing, I feel like a kung fu master with all these deflects and attacks against mobs and the bosses. 
- Weapons and armor is a lot more simple to upgrade then the Nioh games 
- Played on a controller cuz one look at a game like this and ofc you wouldn't think ""Ah this looks like it's playable with a keyboard"" 

Changes I don't like: 
- The game engine they use for nioh 1-2 and wild hearts and for this needs to be changed, it's getting dated. Their success is being held back with all the performance issues. It's about time they released a game that did not derp out on release 
- The flickering needs to be fixed. It's March 7th as time of doing this review 

Others: 
- Can't speak on performance issues much. I play on rtx 3060 with amd Ryzen 7 6k series 
- I recommend trying the demo for gameplay, in terms of performance I'm pretty sure it's a different build from the main game but don't quote me on that lol 
- Overall all I'd recommend this game. My top game for this year believe it or not. combat is so good.",1678120686,1678120844,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

Scaling is also pretty interesting as it orientates at your stamina. Personally i think its a upgrade from nioh, both visually and gameplay.

Problems:
the game have performance issue. I got crashes and frame drop. Team ninja gotta fix this $h!t. But the fun outweight these negativity. Most of the time it run fine. Btw, dun play nba 2k, carX or pes/fifa with a damnmouse n keyboard. just a suggestion.

No chrashes, not a sinlge frame drop. It seems many have the problem, so I guess waiting for 1-2 patches might be the safest option if people don't want to take the risk.

The Game: 

- Gameplay: THE highlight of the game for me. Combat is absolutely fantastic, fun and flawless. I never had so much trouble with a first boss in this kind of games, but after getting the hang of it the sword-play feels amazing. I'm about 2/3 through the main story and it still keeps me on the edge. Parrying for me is on point and I never felt like the game is at fault when I died or got hit.
Little negative point in my opinion is the talent tree with some active spells and buffs. It doesnt feel that enganging like in previous games. Also never really had the need to use them and you could simply ignore it, especially since the sword-play is really fun.
Also the morale system is a really greadt addition for each level which incents you to explore the map and don't rush to the boss. Fresh air compared to your classic collectibles and can have some nice interactions with bosses or even normal mobs which were given an artificially high morale level

- Story: Your typical Nioh experience. Nothing really great, but ok. Fans from the Dynasty Warriors games will get an extra treat, because there are many known figures and some nostlagia might be triggered.

- Ui: If you played Nioh, you will feel at home right from the beginning. Similar loot-system, blacksmithing, additional skill tree, map and misson design.


Apart from the downgrad in talent and skill tree (in my opinion), the game is a step forward in every aspect from the Nioh games with sword-play/gameplay being it's strongest point and one of the best in it's genre.

Don't get me wrong, I am all for being honest when you dislike a game or when it doesn't perform well, but at the same time, I have so far really enjoyed my time with this game, whether it was when I tried the demo or when I eventually started playing the actual release. 

Most of the negative reviews seem to revolve around three different things: 
- Performance
- Controls with KBM
- The first boss

Now, on my PC (GTX 3050, 16 Gigs of Ram) the game performs quite well with no stuttering or crashes. I used the recommended settings and don't have complaints about the performance. 

I am playing this with a controller, as I always do with Souls-like games, whether it's Dark Souls, Nioh or anything else, and I do like the controls. Combat is fast paced and fun, and if you practice your deflects, it feels like a dance, rather epic, even early on. If I am fighting a new trash mob or boss, I keep guarding to figure out the attack pattern and rhythm, which is a nice, safe method to learn new encounters. 

Now, the first boss... I did fight him a couple of times in the demo and I read that he was slightly nerfed for the full release. My reactions aren't as good anymore as they used to be 20 years ago, but I still managed to beat him. Yes, it did take me about two hours, but - for some reason, every attempt was FUN, even when I failed miserably, so I never felt frustrated or angry, because fighting him was just fun.

It was a good preparation and I felt like I had really learned something from it, mainly regarding deflects. For phase 1, I was being quite aggressive and gave him no time for breathing. When he did a red attack, I deflected and punished it. 

For phase 2, staggering him was not an option, so I tried different approaches. Some attempts with deflecting his attacks went well, but I found him a bit harder to read, so I eventually took it slow, kept my distance and punished pretty much only his red attacks... and after 2 hours, he went down. And throughout those two hours, I never stopped feeling like the whole thing was FUN. I sometimes do get frustrated on tough bosses in Souls-like games, especially since I am not as skilled as many others are. Here, every attempt felt fun, like a dance where I could try different tactics, and punishing his red attacks felt very satisfying. If I'd have to make a comparison: I found him to be easier than, say, Margit from Elden Ring... another tough first boss. 

I am now in zone 2 and I am very much looking forward to fully exploring the game, trying different weapons, spells and builds and encountering the other bosses. 

So far, it feels a bit simpler than Nioh (2), and I am enjoying it a lot. I will update my review when I progress more. 

So I am sorry for all those players who have problems with the game's performance or dislike the controls with KBM (maybe I am wrong, but I always felt like these kinda games are meant to be played with a controller, but I guess there is a huge amount of people who prefer to try them with KBM), but I really don't get why this game sits at ""mostly negative"", when I am enjoying it a LOT.... maybe I am just lucky for not experiencing a bad performance and for playing it with a controller?

Performance fixed. See below. 120 fps cap now, was 60 in the demo.

[strike] Sadly I have to give it a negative review in hope that the issues get fixed. I'm a big fan of the other Koei Tecmo games especially Nioh, but this performance is unplayable. Some people are lucky and have no issues, but others like me even with a high end PC (3080, 12700k, 32gb RAM) have bad stuttering, fps and latency issues. I spent hours in the demo trying many fixes, some of which I tried with the release version and nothing helps. I heard the issues would be fixed on release, but they were not, it's actually worse. 

I also only bought the game because I can get a refund within 2 hours of play time if the issues aren't fixed, so I wanted to test it. I won't refund if it gets fixed. The game itself is great. [/strike]


[b] EDIT: Fixed the game by disabling E-cores! [/b]
I have a 12700k, 3080, 32GB of ram and I had been having a ton of performance issues, stuttering, FPS drops. Turns out it is an issue with E-cores.

As a Nioh fan I expected a lot of this game. I bought and played the game in spite of the terrible reviews. I figured that everyone was complaining about the tutorial boss that was pretty challenging, until you figure out standing still and learning the deflect timings gets you the easy win.
After you get past the initial barrier to entry (tutorial boss) you can finally somewhat enjoy the game. Coop becomes unlocked and you can play with a friend. Yay!! There isn't enough of that these days so I was excited. You then start crashing and having de-sync issues when playing coop. That is when the rose colored glasses I was viewing the game through started coming off. I ignored these things at first naturally.
After beating a few missions you start thinking wow this game is kind of easy. Once you understand the combat system things seem to be a lot less challenging. You have your spirit gauge (Posture bar) and the morale system. Spirit gauge was cool at first until you realize that everything you do negatively effects it. Strong attacks, parrying/deflecting(however you refer to it), Martial arts (weapon arts/skills), wizardry, and blocking negatively effect the spirit(posture) gauge. Also the dodge input is the same key as the deflect input which i think was a terrible idea.
The morale system i think is what mostly ruins the game. At first I found it enjoyable; but the further I made it in the game, I realized it was a good idea but a terrible implementation. Not sure if it was just balanced incorrectly or just a bad addition all around. When you get to the Zhang Rang boss fight all you are thinking is, Why did the boss become unfairly hard? Dude literally spawns in about 12-15 versions of himself that all attack at the same time with melee attacks and ranged spells. Too many to deflect in fact. It becomes a game of chance and RNG to win. Me and my buddy struggled through that fight to then go to the following mission where you fight Lu Bu.
This is where the morale system really punches you in the face and team ninja says thank you for supporting us and playing our game sucka! At the start of the boss fight(if you manage to get there with 20 morale) you are significantly weaker than the boss. You can deflect his perilous attacks and do a decent amount of damage to his spirit(posture) but he does WAY more damage to your health and posture. This is supposed to be even: mind you, seeing as how you start with 20 morale and so does the boss. You can deflect 100 hundred attacks as well as land 100 then finally break his posture to get a finishing blow. Did I mention this glorious finishing blow does about 1.8% of the bosses health in damage? I forgot to mention the fact that you have to break his posture once to get him off of his horse then the boss fight can begin. If you do not manage to pull of all 100 deflects and attacks in time he just hops back on his horse so that you have to repeat the process all over again. Every once in a while you manage to break his posture twice and enjoy the benefits of your juicy MASSIVE 1.8% damage before you can go back to dying. At this point you have probably already used all of your heals and have effectively taken 35% of the bosses health.
You then say to yourself, ;Nay I can do this it just comes down to patience.: You and your buddy struggle and struggle for an hour to beat him until you get him to 20% health. With a renewed sense of confidence you decide this is actually doable. Then right as you are about to beat the boss someones game crashes. Oh yeah, when that happens the entire progress of the lobby is over and you have to repeat it all over again.
I figured at first it was just people complaining about the first boss. Come to find out that the game is terribly unbalanced, the morale system was a stupid idea, de-sync and disconnect issues cause you to repeat entire missions, and team ninja stole my money.
I have loved every game team ninja released but it seems they have reached the pinnacle like blizzard and cdprojekt red. They figured screw it, these idiots will buy it and sadly they were right. Only question is will you make the same mistake twice? This experience makes me deeply question whether or not I would buy Nioh 3 if it were to be made.

A lot of complaints about KB+M not being good, but I use a controller to play it, and it plays really good.

Trying to play the game at 120 fps often leads to some noticeable fps dips from 120 to 70 but if you lock the game to 60 fps the dips never occurred for me and it was super smooth from there on out. 

I had 2 crashes total in my 12hrs so far, game would go non responding in a cut scene, but game has checkpoints at flags so you don't lose full level progress and booting back up and jumping back into the level was fine. There is a single piece in one of the later stages (lightning bolts and fire) that cause fps to really suffer, game went to about 30fps during that section, but it is a small part of the larger stage and was easily endured for how great the game is everywhere else.

The only real performance issue I'd say I wish could be addressed is load screens can be rather long, but that does not hamper gameplay.

I will straight up state, there are issues with optimisation leading to framerate stutters and the like, but I imagine like with Nioh 2 it'll get patches that improve it's optimisation as the game ages. If you absolutely can't tolerate these issues and don't wish to lower the graphics settings you could simply wait.

As for the gameplay? I love it, it feels like it has taken the Sekiro system and made it's own expansion in some regards on it, particularly with how magic and martial arts(special moves a weapon has) link into it as a currency rather than being limited.

This encourages aggressive gameplay but based off a few experiments I've had with various weapons, it seems you can still easily play a more passive playstyle if that's your style. So I think there is even on release at least a good enough amount of variety for you to tailor how you play to your own preferences.

The short of it is, the gameplay itself is very solid while being a departure from how Nioh worked. The game as of 6th of March 2023 has optimisation issues being a port but I do suspect in the future these will be fixed.

If you are uncertain, I'd say wait a bit for when some patches come out.

 While its fun it's just plain just familiar faces of three kingdom doing their things and an old guy with a power of a Demonic QI trying to destroy the world.

The game currently runs likes shit and i am running it on medium settings with a 3080. At random the frames drop to still images every second and then goes back to 60 or so fps. The game is very poorly optimized, I have only played for as long as I have because of the combat. I have constant flickers on objects and characters making the game overall look terrible. By far the worst ""battlefield"" is the one on the river, My game crashed 7 times on that map and the many assets and building were completely missing. the river section was terrible with wonky hit boxes on the boats leading me to fall into the river basically killing me. 
 The combat itself is fun and when you deflect every attack and that huge finishing blow it feels great but I have to say the combat needs to slow down or at least allow me to stagger the larger enemies. I get they are large and all but after 2 or 3 swings I would like a chance to actually hit them. most if not all of the damage done to bosses and enemies is when you break their posture, you almost never get a chance to actually hit them and if you do you leave yourself open to get hit instead of parrying. It could be the weapon I am using, dual blades for the win, but this shouldn't be a problem. The hardest fight for me so far was Lu Bu but only because every time he would be close to breaking he would jump on his fucking horse, there was a also a glitch where when I would posture break him he would instantly recover not giving me a chance to fatal strike. 
I feel like the morale system needs a rework, you can fight any of the enemies on the map regardless of morale but sometimes you are thrust into unwinnable situations because of the morale difference, I know it incentivizes map exploration but it can be really aggravating looking for a fucking flag for 20 minutes because it was in a section with nothing else to even go looking over there for. I know for the most part it is for completion sake to do it because most bosses are really easy, the only bosses I didn't do on the first attempt was the first boss, the cow boss and Lu Bu. But once you get to high morale every enemy is paper for the most part and it seems to me the it makes the bosses into paper. I feel like in every area it should be based off level instead of morale, it would be more consistent especially because level is already taken into account and it incentivizes actually doing the side missions. 
The companions are so stupid its unbelievable, they are constantly getting in the way, there shouldn't be body collision with them because they always manage to get between me and the damn enemy preventing me from hitting them leading to me getting hit instead. I usually let them die so I can continue without them because of how much of a hindrance they are most of the time.
The game is also missing a lot of quality of life such as item compare and proper tutorials. several mechanics are very poorly described such as the spells and spirit attacks. weapon customization is also very confusing, I can remove a stat and embed a new one but why can't I embed certain ones? The game feels very confusing at times and can leave you very frustrated when you spend a bunch of resources just for you not to be able to do what you wanted. 

Like I said before the combat feels very good, fast but good when it works. the game needs a lot of stability patches before I would consider playing it again.

PC has minor optimization issues (I run it on Ultra, 60 FPS, on a 3080). I've crashed maybe 3 times since I got it, and haven't had any FPS issues except when the game has been running for like 30 hours because I forgot to turn off my PC.

My complaint about this game is literally that it's unfair in an unfun way in certain missions.

See comparatively, the SoulsBornRing games and Nioh is unfair in a ""Learn and get better"" Kind of way, which is fun and interesting. But this game just outright is obnoxious. 

You can learn the fights, sure, but then sometimes the game will randomly decide that a perfectly timed counter actually was a frame off from being perfect, so it doesn't work and instead you get wabbajacked by a fucking rampaging Lu Bu or something. Othertimes it seems like you can perfect counter everything in the world. I admit sometimes I don't hit it PERFECTLY, but there are plenty of times where it feels, looks, and historically works like I should, but then... It just doesn't.

Ignoring that, and refocusing back on some of these missions, There are missions where you go in and fight certain enemies that are hard enough on their own, but unlike other missions, THESE missions won't let you bring in ANY allies, Online or Not, and suddenly you're getting juggled around by 2-3 high powered super leveled enemies that will take hours to master in a small arena with barely anywhere to run. Not one at a time either, all at once. (though I suppose you could ignore these Side Missions and opt to just power level up into the hundreds then come back and probably be fine, but wheres the fun in that route either?)

Ultimately, the game has been a fun experience, and I'm legitimately not seeing any of the Optimization issues that others have been saying there is. Generally, it plays like a Dynasty Warriors Souls Game and I am so down for that and hope we can see more games like this and Nioh.

First up, the issues for the game are overblown.  The negative reviews I;ve seen seem to have a commonality in that people don’t like the mouse and keyboard inputs for now, and some people were not liking the mechanics, and that there is no build diversity.

None of these reviews I’ve seen has pierced 10 hours.

The gear in the game will be very familiar to you if you did Nioh and Nioh 2.  I think Wo Long is better because you can pick what stats go on what gear specifically, and you’re limited only by another currency for gear specifically that allows for this.  You accrue this resource by recycling all the gear you don’t want.  See a cool rare ability for a weapon, but it’s on one you don’t use?  Recycle that weapon, or pick it off individually and put it on the one you do use.

In this way, it’s pretty easy to have more expansive builds than Nioh 2, especially in NG+ when the gear gains an extra star/rarity with the new difficulty and the slots are all opened up.  Making a build has never been easier.  Furthermore, enemies in Wo Long are easier to stamina/poise break – via breaking their stamina bar.  You can spec for this.  There is no Discord/Confusion as there was in Nioh 1 and 2, however there is full and complete stacking of status effects, simply split into either being positive or negative.

As far as the magic goes, it is the most dynamic system I have seen in a game thus far.  Elements interact on the fly.  See an enemy mage casting a fire spell at you?  You can counter by launching a water spell to completely cancel it out – the only thing that matters is matching the element, not the strength of the spell.  When it comes to selecting spells for your build, you will be generally angling for how your playstyle will grow over the course of the mission.  So while your bigger spells won’t be immediately available at the very start, they will be there over time.  The game seems to push you to have an overall style or goal rather than a specific playstyle in mind, which keeps the player agile in their approach to missions and playing.  The game doesn’t want you to become complacent.

On that, the Morale system.  Others have mentioned this, that you can get flags over the course of a mission, but Morale also grows when you attack and kill stuff.  If you get hit with a big hit, which is always telegraphed, then you will lose Morale.  So with this mechanic in mind, it’s pretty simple to get mid to high morale very early in a mission with the use of items and just attacking stuff.  If you lose that Morale, it’s for one reason only:  You got hit with the big telegraphed attack.  You can mitigate this by either using the parry/deflect, or by dodging, or by moving, or in some cases even just jumping, or you can even use a weapon art that moves you out of the way, or there’s this ice spell that teleports you, or there’s an earth spell that moves you rapidly.  You get the idea; there’s a lot of ways to prevent being hit by an attack that will lower your Morale.  The fact that people are struggling says far more about their ability to get good than it does internal game mechanics, which thus far has allowed for near perpetual deflections back to back, putting the player in direct control for moments like initiating their very own Daigo Parry against any enemy in the game.  Furthermore, anything that can interact with the player can be parried.  Spells, logs, rocks, arrows, fire jars.  Everything can be parried.  If players are unsure about how the timing works or are unconfident, here is a hot tip:  Hold the Block button down and work on your parrying through that.  If you miss your timing, it’ll hit the block and you will still take no damage.

I have had a couple crashes, but the worst that has happened is it has put me back at the start of the mission I was in, but with everything I had piocked up.  No inventory loss, simply a minor inconvenience.  I don’t know why these crashes occurred, but figured they will be patched at some point.  For graphical glitches, I might see one white shutter occur once every three to five hours.  Apparently this was due to the game trying to render the mouse pointer.  The fix to this was with the use of multi screens:  Move the pointer over to the second screen, then alt-tab back into the game.  Presumably this will be patched later, however I didn’t see this as much of an issue at all.

There are invasions ala Dark Souls, however you can turn these off in the menu.  Huge plus for that alone, really.
I’d say the game is good.  I’d recommend it to anybody that can work out how to parry, and isn’t offput by new games with new mechanics.  Wo Long is it’s own game.  Those expecting to unmask the game like a Scooby villain to find the same games they find Wo Long similar to aren’t really giving this game a chance to really shine.  Which is a shame for them.

If you played Nioh or Nioh 2 but bounced off because you found it too difficult or complicated, then this game is probably up your alley. It's much more approachable and feels like a simplified and streamlined Nioh with a big emphasis on parry's that was clearly inspired by Sekiro. It plays well, the action feels good, and it's challenging but fair. When you get into the grove with the parries it especially feels nice.

Caveat: If you loved the complexity (the stances, weapon leveling, and specialization) of Nioh or especially Nioh 2 you will be let down by Wo Long. You can switch weapons and armor at will, the magic has very little limitations (you don't have to specialize into it), weapons don't level with you, etc. It all together leaves you feeling kind of hollow, that your character has no real personality or uniqueness, just a generic ""good at everything"" protagonist. On top of that there's a large emphasis on companions and they also dilute your character and end just sucking some of the fun and challenge out of the game.

All around, it's fun but overly simple and feels like it lacks some soul (pun not intended). Try the demo for sure before you pay full price, or pick it up on sale.

The game itself is very fun. I'm a big fan of Sekiro, and I didn't mind Nioh. There are some user experience things that should not be occurring. For example: When I boot a game, I expect to be able to set it to my resolution. This game gave me an issue where my virtual display driver (for remote work) was being selected at launch and wouldn't let me set the resolution above 1080p? Once it was disabled the game pulled the correct one and I could change it just fine. There is also severe lag in coop. It almost seems like depending on where you are in the game, and how much combat you and your teammates are doing in the area causes some serious latency. You can have up to 3 people in the missions, but we found that if only 2 are in the mission, the game runs fine.

Seeing lots of reviews about performance and even seeing the specs that are struggling. As far as performance lag, I have had minimal issues (some FPS drop with fire and lightning everywhere), and I'm seeing complaints from people with better specs than me so I'm not sure what that's about.

Also... It's called a controller.

Crashes:
- only a few crashes but the only boss fight that i got crashed on was Aoye had to repeat the boss fight again so i could unlock reset stats Tip: use lightning

Story:
 - If you're a fan of the Three kingdoms / the fictional dynasty warriors games story you'll like it since you get to see a few characters implemented during the yellow turbans uprising and the tyrant both are respectable to be corrupted with bad energy like in  Nioh.
- Wo long just feels like a Nioh 3 with a different name with a few updates but i would consider Nioh 2 more.

Gameplay:
( People play differently and the difficulty will vary with others)
- Combat if you are coming from sekiro its somewhat like that but also you need to attack on openings to keep that stagger bar up or deplete the boss's bar by waiting on critical blows (patient gaming)
- Staggered bosses you can freely attack them twice or three times and use your riposte after for max output dmg 
- Deflecting there is a slight signal for critical blows (red flash) of when to time it but you can also always keep holding block and wait to deflect or jump low sweeping attacks
- Gameplay overall is more of Nioh 2 with adjustments added and removed but kept the character creation.

Would recommended?
- I would still recommend for those that are a fan of the story but if you want to play something similar to this but in a corrupted history in japan Nioh 2

Wouldn't recommend?
- due to the steep price range on most koei games i recommend getting the game with discounted price or just wait for updates.
- There is a DEMO option  try it first if the 60$+ tax is worth your time

But with Wo Long, we are exactly, officially breaking even on good will. Everything good done in Nioh 2 is either gone or done worse in Wo Long, and in its place is an onslaught of new mechanics and ideas that exclusively detract from the experience.

But is it only bad relative to Nioh 2? After all, Nioh 2 was really good. Well, then let's compare it to every other Souls like game. It has more mechanics to keep you down and waste your time than Demon's Souls, it has a worse early game than Dark Souls 2, it lets you lose more overall progress at once than Dark Souls 1, and it has worse deflects than Sekiro.

Edit: Well after a few more hour I retract what I just said.... This god awful game is so much more than just shitty.

Gameplay: Quite basic actually.You just Wait, Parry(or atleast try to while getting assaulted by the whole combo set of whatever you try to murder),attack. Thats it. All the other bullcrap is basically and utterly useless dont waste your time. you can do more but at this point just go play Nioh 2 you'll feel way more rewarded for your time. 

Control: The most frustrating thing I ever handled. The game try to be fast and nervous but you are constantly stopped by the fact that each input is locked and cannot be canceled so get bent half of the time you try something and the enemy decide to go balistic for no reason.

Difficulty: The level to the boss is 90% of the time harder than the actual boss.the level isn't that hard either.

Story: Stopped to care after the 3rd chapter. 

Level Design: Nioh 1 but worse. The game sometime try to do a DS moment by hiding something to kill you but its so badly done its kinda sad to see. 

perfomance: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHAH (Bonus dumbness point:Game Physic is tied to your framerate..yeah..in 2023).

[b]My review:[/b] Great gameplay, incredibly fun. Excellent tutorialising. Somewhat of a step down from Nioh 2 so far -- less interesting itemisation and fewer build options, no real talent tree (just options for active spells). But I enjoy the parry focused gameplay a lot. Hoping for expansions or a Wo Long 2 that brings back the Nioh 2 build and itemisation complexity.

If Nioh 2 is Diablo 2 + Dark Souls, Wo Long is Diablo 2 + Sekiro, except with less interesting items/sets/builds. So if you really love that kind of Sekiro parry ninja god gamer feel then I think you will like Wo Long. If you were expecting the same insane itemisation/builds as Nioh 2, or if you hate the parry focused Sekiro style gameplay, then this might not be the game for you.

Unfortunately the game has some significant issues with optimisation/performance bugs, with FPS spikes and microstutters during boss battles (and particularly their critical attacks) which removes some of the fariness from the fights. There are also some other minor issues like slightly less QoL than Nioh 2 and annoying minor visual glitches (white flashes here and there). If you're not completely addicted to the game by playing the demo, then wait for a patch!

Unfortunately a lot of the negative reviews on Steam are either exaggerating the issues, are complaining about the Keyboard+Mouse issue specifically, or are literally just misinformation. Let me address some of the negative comments here:

[b]KBM issues:[/b]
Obviously they should strive to have the best KBM controls as possible and it's disappointing they didn't... but 90%+ of people should be playing this on controller and won't be affected by this. If you're a KBM player, you definitely have to wait for patches.

[b]Misinformation/questions from other reviews:[/b] (The comments were locked on these reviews... almost like they don't want the misinformation challenged).

[b]Why is the first boss such a steep jump in difficulty?[/b]
[b]Why did the game get easier after the first boss?[/b]
The first boss is a really basic skill check. He doesn't do anything special but the fight REQUIRES you to get good with the deflection mechanic. You will probably have to attempt the boss many times, however, the entire fight is DESIGNED to up-skill you on deflection. The first phase is super simple and lets you practice deflecting attacks and critical attacks over and over. The second phase is the exam, have you learned deflection well enough? If you fail, you need more training, so try again starting at first phase and get more practice.

Once you're past the first boss you will have the qualifications to get through the rest of the game while having a LOT of fun, because deflection feels so good and is so highly required throughout the rest of the game. If you cheese this boss, you will likely have a lot of trouble with the rest of the game because you won't have been upskilled on the deflection mechanic.

This first boss is actually genius design AND INCLUDED IN THE DEMO, so no one has to waste their money before seeing if the gameplay style is for them or not. So, why is the first boss harder? Because it's both a skill-training + skill-check fight to make sure you'll enjoy the rest of the game afterwards. There are other skill-check bosses that are quite hard, but not every boss is like that.

[b]Why can't I disable tutorials?[/b]
To be clear the game features short popups that explain game mechanics. Without them you would literally have no idea what is going on in the game, or how to do anything. I have not looked to see if you can disable them, but it wouldn't really make sense to do this.

[b]Why am I receiving tutorials for things I was already taught?[/b]
You don't. This never happens. Unless you mean the little info messages that appear during the first few missions. Those are there because you're struggling at that mechanic and the game wants to remind you/up skill you on that topic so you can get through the rest of the game without frustration. These disappear permanently after you're past the first small story arc.

[b]Why are the tutorials repeating when I die?[/b]
Because you clearly need the help, the tidbits are there to make sure you have the mechanics down before they let go of your hand and throw you in the deep end. After the first arc the info snippets stop appearing.

[b]Why does this game sometimes eat inputs?[/b]
I've only experienced this during FPS spikes / microstutters, which is a major optimisation issue and the main reason I recommend waiting for patches. If you're claiming it happens outside of FPS spikes then... that sounds like ""oh, it's not me, it's the lag!"" kind of excuse to me.

[b]Why did they think boss three was good?[/b]
Do you mean Feng Xi or Zhang Bao? It depends on how you count bosses. I assume you mean Zhang Bao since he is a mage-type and so the fight is more interesting than a duel with a swordsman or a fight against a big monster.

What was wrong with it? It was a fun encounter that I beat on my first attempt. I'm suspecting this reviewer cheesed their way past the first boss and didn't actually do the intended upskilling on deflection that the first boss was designed for. The boss is trivial with deflection.

I could understand more if you were complaining about Zhang Rang (8th or 7th boss depending on how you count) whose fight is really long and a bit annoying due to the mechanics of the fight. But neither is particularly hard or frustrating.

The only encounter I think is worth complaining about so far is an optional sub-mission we're you have to 1v3 3 NPCs, which is a very unfair feeling fight that really encourages cheese.

[b]When am I going to be able to recreate my character? That thing I was told I would be able to do at the start of the game.[/b]
Once you're past the first arc of the game the NPC for it unlocks. 

[b]How does morale benefit enemies?[/b]
This is explicitly explained in the tutorials you were complaining about.

Morale is basically an ""within stage"" levelling system that resets when you go to new stages. It raises when you kill enemies, deliver critical attacks, and gets lowered when you die or take a critical attack (or too much damage). When your morale is low and theirs is high they will do more damage to you and you will do less damage to them. 

This mechanic is a way to (1) encourage stage exploration to gain morale and increase fortitude rank and (2) to codify the classic Soulslikes ""this is the wrong direction, you're supposed to skip this badass monster"" thing. Most stages have explicit ""hard"" and ""easy"" paths which are indicated by the monsters morale levels.

[b]Why was fortitude not explained?[/b]
Fortitude was explicitly explained in the tutorials you were complaining about. Fortitude is the minimum morale rank that you will drop to when you die. It is increased by finding the flags.

[b]Why was morale for the player poorly explained?[/b]

If you're lucky enough to have reached a certain flag before crashing, you'll be sent to that flag again with the same progression you had at this point (lost at least 15 to 20 levels just due to crashes.)

Coop has been a nightmare as well, since it's the same pattern regarding crashes, you'll be sent to the last flag you did before going into coop, thus, if you crash before finishing the area, you have to do it all again.

Sometimes, crash happens in the middle or at the very beginning of a boss fight, and most of the time during the never ending cinematics, sometimes 5 of them in a row, giving even more chance for you to go back to your desktop.

The gameplay feels really good, until it really doesn't.
The tutorial and first level felt great. The ""on rails"" experience of running through a level and learning that some foes you need to come back later to beat was well done and fresh in a game genre that often runs on obscurity and surprise to make a player regret taking on an enemy they shouldn't have. The morale system isn't perfect, but it works for this first level. The first boss is an extremely well done tutorial boss for a souls-like game. 
On par with Elden Ring's Margit The Fell Omen, the boss has well telegraphed moves that help the player ease into the mechanics of the parry/deflect and the spirit bar that is so integral to the combat. A-la Sekiero before it, a player can choose to rush down an enemy and defeat them via their health bar, or take a defensive approach and instead deflect until the enemy leaves an opening for a big hit. Every thing you do either builds or spends spirit, if your spirit bar runs out you are left stunned and your opponent can get a punishing attack on you, often ending in your defeat. However, if you manage to deplete your opponents spirit bar via pressuring them and not getting hit in return, you can land a devastating attack, killing most small enemies and dealing a large amount of damage to a boss.
The games level up system supports these two vastly different gameplay styles as well, choosing to specialize in pressuring opponents with massive attacks, making your deflects cheaper and/or stronger, or even focusing on the rather extensive magic system in the game. No matter what you pick though, you will still fall into the core rhythm of deflect, punish, repeat; especially against the bosses in the game.

However, the game falls short quickly after the tutorial. The morale system becomes quite stale quickly as you are forced to look around the maps to find hidden banners that raise your ability to fight the boss at the end of the zone. Your gear and your level matter very little in relation to the morale level of yourself vs the enemy you are fighting. When you are fighting things on your level, the game feels great. If you are fighting things above your level it is like you turned on hard mode; you don't do any damage to them, and the deal massively increased damage to you. While it is technically possible to defeat the boss at morale level 0, it would be quite a long endeavor to do so. Similarly, if your morale level is higher than the bosses, it becomes significantly easier as you deal increased damage to it and attacks that should be punishing glance off you for reduced damage instead. There is still some skill involved in defeating them mind you, but you are given a much easier time if you go in at a high morale level.

The Co-op also appears to be suffering some massive issues. In single player, you move through the battlefields at your own pace, able to drop in and out as you need to. So long as you don't leave the battlefield, your progress is saved and you can continue from the last flag (bonfire) you unlocked. To initiate coop, you must start brand new on one of the games maps at morale 0 and run through with your allies, solving the level as you go. No progress is saved on any person's part, even the host's, until you defeat that zone's boss together. Should you encounter one of the many game-breaking bugs that coop currently suffers from, you will be forced to start again from 0 morale and run through again. One such bug that is especially game breaking was a bug which caused all players to be unable to rest at a flag to reset the instance and the players' health. 

TLDR; The game has some massive problems, especially with its coop, but overall it is an engaging game with a very fun and well made combat system that rewards mastery without being too punishing to learn.",1678063243,1678063243,True,2,0,0.541984736919403076,0,True,False,False

Updating my drivers turned the display issues into crashes.  As this game is not currently in a playable state for me, I cannot recommend it and have requested a refund.

Update:  My refund was denied as I had exceeded Steam's 2 hour policy.  I have submitted another request pointing out that the problems do not reveal themselves until after the player has defeated the first boss, and pointing out that I had left the game running at the title menu.  I am disappointed that so many games are released in unfinished states and at the people (bots?) who defend the people pushing for it to happen.  A lot of them got really mad when Elden Ring was highly regarded and continued selling long after its release date and I had really hoped that maybe they would see that From's patience is the key to their success.  They aren't perfect and neither is that game, but look at how confident they are in barely talking about DLC for over a year.  They know when they are done with the product, it will be worth buying and people will buy it.

Story - 2/5
Holy shit it's so fucking boring. I understand that these games (Nioh included) follow real events in history and use the characters as a basis. Nioh 2 actually had a great story about the corruption of power and amrita corrupting a dear friend, whereas in this its just ""oh yeah, people want power"". No nuance, no character, no progression. Simply ""This is the corrupt guy  now, go kill him"" over and over. It's not cringe bad, but fuck me is it boring as all hell. How are you gonna take the Three Kingdoms and turn it into a snoozefest?

Gameplay - 3/5
The moment to moment deflection is pretty fun. I went in expecting a full blown souls-like, but this game feels more akin to a crossbreed between Sekiro and Dynasty Warriors. The game is fast, bordering on hack and slash speeds, whilst still being punishing and requiring you to have quick inputs to deflect enemy attacks. That's where the praise ends.
Everything else about the game is fucking BAD. The leveling system only has 5 different categories to level up in, these include your damage stats and utility stats on the same upgrade bar. It can work in more minimalist games (Ex. Lucah: Born of a Dream), but in this game it really isn't good. The loot system is also cursed.
Loot in Nioh and Nioh 2 work like that of Diablo-- different weapon types that have differing buffs attributed, rarities, and level. This game has only rarities and buffs. Whether or not you're on the first level, or the last level, as long as you find the weapon type you like, and it's of a high rarity (all rarity does is make it so you can put more of the embedding buffs on it), there is never a reason to swap. It's not like dark souls either, where there are only a specific amount of items, so it feels like it didn't know what the game was wanting to be.
Magic in this game is entirely useless. The only magic spells I used in the entirety of the game were Ice Weapon (I used duel straight swords, and Halberd) and the healing ability found in the earth tree. Everything else hits like a wet noodle, and requires a ton of spirit, and has a long cast time. I don't need magic to be overpowered like it was in Nioh 1, but in this game it feels worthless.
The difficulty is also pretty laughable. The levels themselves are challenging, especially due to the innovative Morale system, but the bosses are so incredibly easy it's insane. There are a total of 23 bosses in the entire game, and I beat 14 of them on my first attempt. Of the 9 others where I didn't, the max amount of attempts it took me, was 6. Nioh 1 and 2 have fantastic and challenging bosses, whereas these are major let downs. To give some credit though, I am extremely experienced in the genre, so that may play a part of it.

Style - 5/5
This is where the game absolutely shines the brightest. The game has a fantastic feeling of inspiration and it oozes with style. Team Ninja wanted to incorporate their style of gaming (particularly Nioh style gameplay) whilst also making it feel like a chinese action movie (ie. Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon) where everything is super flashy, and over the top. From jumping in the air and slamming down onto enemies with these crazy camera angles, the game definitely hits the mark there. 

Quality of Life - 3/5
It does some things great, and others dog shit. Rather than having a map system, it's categorized into main missions and submissions, as well as your village with blacksmith and the likes. So far, sounds fine! The problem lies in the fact that if you complete a submission, the game gives you three options: Repeat submission, return to main mission, and go to village. Holy. Flying. Fuck. Let me just CHOOSE which mission to go to, since I now have to load into either the main mission or the village, just to choose a different mission and go through an additional loading screen. But, on the other hand, there are nice things such as unlimited and free respecs, so you're more than able to play around with differing builds, which I think is a nice touch.

PC Port - ?/5
So this one is divisive. I know a lot of people are having difficulties with optimization, as well as the lack of KB+M controls. However, I play with a controller, and I only had minor graphical and optimization issues (the game crashed twice, textures would vanish and then reappear (this occurred once), and once where the game had a stroke and was flashing a white screen every couple frames, but I restarted the game and it fixed the problem.
Other than those issues I was able to run the game at (an unstable) 60 FPS, with a GTX 2060 Super, so it's not like I have a top of the line PC. So although my issues were minor, and didn't take away from my enjoyment of the game, I am sympathetic to the plights of people who are having major issues. 

Overall - 3.5 (maybe 4 once some changes to the game balance are made, and maybe DLC is top notch, idk)/ 5
Did I enjoy the game? Sure. Did I like it? Yeah I guess. Is it as good as Nioh 1 or 2? No. Is it as good as Elden Ring? No. Is it a decent game that's overshadowed by other games that do everything it did, but significantly better? Yup. So if you're like me, and you're a total Souls-Like junky like me (over 2,500 hours accumulative across different souls-likes), this is a worthy entry into the collection.

Is a bit different, from Nioh, but after getting used to the spirit and countering system, not bad.

Overall, so far I'm liking it.

For the other reviews thumbs downing it, I really don't think a mostly negative score is fair in this case, at least to me, I suppose if your games must run at 300 FPS at 4k then sure, whatever.
Me, I personally don't like games running past 60 FPS, I have a gaming rig, but I don't like to run it into the ground for every game out of hoping it will increase its longevity, so I haven't noticed the performance issues.
Also I planed from the start to use controller only, so can't comment on the mouse+keyboard issues, controller seems to work fine.

The only REAL problem I've experienced, and its a weird one I never have with any other game, albeit minor:
When the game is running, some of the input from my mouse is... intermittent? If I alt-tab to use discord or google, sometimes it just won't register I've left, or right, clicked, and have to sometimes spam it a few to take. Verified, after closing the game, that its the game somehow causing this, even more odd since I only use controller, so guess its hooking in mouse and messing up the clicking input no matter what, even off screen.
While this is an odd bug, It's not game breaking or major, in my opinion, bit alarming sure, but that's about it. No other bugs that I can think of, well, aside from if you use a save/rest point and cancel too fast you get an error code, but it doesn't really effect anything, just use it again or go off on your way.

Overall I'd say its worth a buy, though, guess 60 / 80(deluxe or +season pass) is a bit steep for a indie/alt flavor dark souls franchise, but meh, any franchise that gets popular eventually goes AAA pricing.",1678057100,1678057100,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For me, Sekiro's parry mechanic just wasn't quite manageable, this game has it perfectly dialled in. The combat here is the best I've ever seen in a Soulslike, hands down.

However... The performance here is a disgrace. It feels like the game we are playing on PC is the console version, not a port. Appears as if dynamic resolution scaling is forced even when I select 'prioritize resolution'. I am on a 3080 with an r9 ryzen cpu, normally play nioh 2 at 4k with dlss quality and everything maxed out and get 95-120fps. This game gets between 38-60fps @ 1440p, 4k is totally broken and the forced dynamic resolution scaling means that if I attempt to play 4k, it legitimately looks worse than 1440p does (lesser performance in 4k on my rig seems to force the dynamic res scaling to be more aggressive)!

A few tips. If your game goes into slow motion sometimes (not slideshow framerate, literal slow motion, you'll know if you experience it): Change your fps limit to 60. 120fps limit seems to be broken and causes this slow motion issue sometimes (not always).

If you get white flickering/flashing, disable ambient occlusion. Seems to fix issue for now on my pc (but some have not managed to achieve this result when changing the setting so beware).

Team Ninja, as someone who has basically put each of your kids through college by now, can you do me a favour: please patch this game for shader pre-compilation, DLSS, and general performance optimization ASAP. Please fix the awful textures, I have seen so many textures in this game that look as bad as minecraft, or psx era games. Then in other locations there are spectacular textures! Fix the horrible pop-in. Fix the weird hyper-aliasing of the edges of shadows that has been a problem in your engine since at least Nioh 2. Get rid of the shocking TAA and whatever other effect makes this entire game look so blurry and lacking in crispness. Give us options over which antialiasing (or none) that we use. Allow us to totally disable dynamic resolution scaling. Fix 120fps mode. Add VRR support.

Nioh 2 was a great game, and you guys have such perfect combat mechanics. However, Nioh 2 already looked dated upon release, and somehow Wo Long looks considerably worse! You guys need to work on your graphics, performance and optimisation now because these issues are getting in the way of your otherwise fantastic games.

Please also put out a public apology for the terrible state of this and many of your other recent PC games and promise that you will never again release a pc title without properly testing it and acting upon feedback. I really thought that months of demos and feedback would have avoided this terrible mess. I'd be embarrassed if I were developing software within a team which did that much public testing and didn't act on such glaring issues which were widely reported prior to release.

I will recommend this game to fans of the genre, but this game should be so much more accessible than that and I think it could bring a lot of new players in, if it weren't in such a terrible state.

P.S. For those wondering if the loot overload problem from Nioh 2/Nioh is present here, no, it is much improved in my experience. I have played through 13-14 hours of the game and never once had a full inventory and needed to spend time selling garbage items. Nioh 2 would have seen me doing that about 10 times by now lol. The inventory management and interface are still similar to Nioh 2 (which is to say, not incredible), but the loot overload is not a problem now and so far.

Most annoying things though are controller icons are default PS?... big L. And if you run any virtual display adaptors or VR device drivers. Would suggest temporarily disabling them, having them enabled will default your resolution to 720p and disable additional graphic settings (e.g. volumetric lighting etc.). KOEI better fix this :/

Some Recommendations:
- It seems the graphic settings don't get saved. Go to:
""\Documents\KoeiTecmo\Wolong\Savedata"" and Edit the ""graphics_option.json"" with a Texteditor. That way the settings will get applied.

- The game tries to reach the FPS you set in the options - and it has a weird slowdown if your rig does not reach your set FPS. I highly recommend to set it lower then your lowest framedrops. Only by setting it to 30 FPS I managed to fully get rid of the slowdown. Playing at a 30-FPS-CAP feels far superior instead of 60, even though my rig usually avaraged 50 FPS.

- Coop is nice - until it isn't.
Shared progression, loot, chests, healing, and so on is incorporated nicely, albeit terrible explained. But if one player experiences the before mentioned slowdown, or one player doesn't have the most stable of connections its terrible. Teleporting enemies, desyncs and worst of all: A disconnect forces everyone out of the session, even the host.

If you're lucky and not experiencing any of these issues, there is a great game to be had.

This one is all about parrying, schmoving between the enemies attacks and keeping up an offensive when just a couple hits can net you a death. While a whole lot more simple than Nioh in terms of core gameplay, they make up for it with a higher variety in enemy attacks and more interesting boss designs.

There are things to dislike, such as having something of the equivalent of an estus flask compared to just a healing item that you just find (Think Dark Souls vs. Bloodborne healing item). As you play, that flask will upgrade (both in amount healed and how often you can use it), giving you a false sense of having gotten better, when in reality you just had more attempts than before. It's a type of progression I personally just really dislike.

And yes, the game does suffer from poor performance, crashes and graphical glitches, things I really wish weren't here at launch but I can't be bothered to be put off because of it. I'm sure in a month or two those will be gone.

If you come here after playing the demo and were expecting more of the good ah combat you´ll be disappointed. 
This game is a huge step backwards from Nioh, combat is shallow, sluggish and not engaging at all, since the game forces you to parry every single opponent which is terrible design cause if you actively attack you just die. Weapon variety is lacking ´13´ different melee weapons is a stretch with actually only 4 different styles, 1-handed sword, dual-wield swords, axe/hammer and spears. 

I´m writing this review right now while looking at a frozen screen listening to my character attacking all the time which his annoying as hell. Was really hyped to play this today, but all I got was frustration and boredom. 

If you like slow as hell games with no actual offence and a forced playstyle then this is for you, if you wanna play your own way then maybe wait for this to be on sale or sth. I´ll still try to finish this game, but I won´t be having fun...

It tries to mix the core of Nioh with Sekiro and drops the ball on both fronts frequently, bosses that feel like they belong in Nioh and end up just being not very fun to deal with due to them not giving you much to parry or lower their spirit gauge with.

On the flip-side some bosses feel really good for their parry game but they ended up dying in like 30 seconds, leaving not much of a impression or satisfaction, especially towards the end, the game becomes incredibly easy to win, I was able to defeat most bosses in under a minute without getting to parry or break enemy spirit much.

Another disappointment is the lack of impact builds with gear have, I initially decided to try to make a build, similar to how I tackled Nioh 2 and quickly realized it does not do much for you in the normal game, I tried to make a status build, but it honestly barely made a difference compared to have burn status build-up or not, and having bonus damage with or without.

Lastly, performance issues for now, it's a 50-50 if the game runs alright for you or not, the game can randomly decided to crash.. A lot, or have a day where it behaves, me and a friend both had constant white flashes on the screen, some stages more then others.
And online netcode feels horrible if your connection is slightly off compared to how it was on Nioh 2.

And with that, get this game on a 75% sale, it's worth about 20 - 30 EUR at most, it has it's fun moments, but it's definitely 10 steps backwards from the previous game, play the Demo and make sure you really are into the game's gameplay, it does not change at all from the tutorial to the end besides getting considerably easier in the endgame.",1678043645,1678043723,False,3,0,0.546109497547149658,0,True,False,False

I mean - yeah, it plays more arcade than Nioh 1-2 and have some optimisation problems, but the core of the game could be really fun! That one thought drove me to buy this game.

But after returning to this world and its mechanics I started noticing everything you need for a simple win is to press two buttons: counter and attack. Of course, the system has magic and beast spells, but any battle can be finished even without them. Once again, counter and attack - that's all. If feels like we returning to ""good old days"" of endless unforgiving QTE-moments, the Ninja Blade days. Somehow, it's worse.

Any simple mechanic can be done well and the counter-attack is not the exception. However, parrying in Wo Long is not so smooth or interesting like it was in Nioh series, Sekiro or Metal Gear Rising (another arcade action in which you have to manually choose the direction for your counter attack).

Maybe the animations used for perfect counter attack in Wo Long are good? Kinda yes, but no. They become repetetive and boring after you see them Every. Ten. Seconds. Because this is the way to complete the game.

Co-op barely works in this state as both characters massively desync and teleports around the map.

Combat has been dumbed down to just trying to parry everything before you can hit, you can only have 4 spells with you in any battle. The spells have been streamlined so you learn everything by default, while being very underperforming. 

The items and cosmetics have been downgraded to very few different kind of weapons or armors. Set bonuses aren't that interesting. 

Having a main hub wouldn't have been such a huge problem if it was performing well and had any kind of interest, the only thing you go to there is the blacksmith - which should have been in just a menu.

Stop with the Nioh comparisons they arent even fundamentally the same game?? Nioh requires patience this game you can just go balls to the wall. God yall are annoying as shit. Also like Sekiro?? Have yall never played a Ninja gaiden game???

The 'tutorial' boss is hard, that's no lie.  Only advice I can offer is: This isn't Elden Ring, that playstyle doesn't translate well.
A lot of people seem to be misreading this game's name as ""Nioh 3"", instead of ""Wo Long"", which you'll note is a different thing.  I imagine I'd also be disappointed this game wasn't Nioh 3 if I thought it was Nioh 3.

Performance is fine, I'm running on 1440p, it looks great, and I'm having no issues that don't stem directly from my 7 year old GPU and criminally low 16gb of RAM.

As a person that LOVES the Nioh series (despite its shortcomings). This game is a downgrade in my personal opinion.

The parry mechanic, altho nice and rewarding sometimes, becomes annoying, as I find regular attacks to completely lose usefulness on certain bosses and  elites. I found myself saying why. Whats the point of putting myself in a bad position when I can  just sit back and wait too parry and deal more damage without the risk, especially considering the bosses vary from, horribly unfair, to trivial.

My one biggest ""grinds my gears"" peter griffin moment, is the Mother F*****g spirit system. 
If you played Nioh and enjoyed it, I doubt you will like this system.

It's slow, clunky, puts you in S*** positions for not much damage when spending meter,  or putting yourself in a position to be stunned... It's just so bad... 
They take away all the cool combos and stances from Nioh, give you 1 spammable auto combo per weapon, and multiple different moves on different weapons. Problem is, why would you use the moves? theres no reason. You parry an enemies attack and sh** on them in 2 hits without putting yourself in a long animation waiting to get hit WHILE putting yourself in negative spirit  state so you can get stunned.

They take the creativity out of Nioh, for a more Sekiro esq feel. With even less variety or offense.

If Nioh is melt or be melted. Wo Long is wait or be waited.

Just my opinion, maybe I'm in the minority here and the terrible port made the game mechanics feel worse than they actually are.",1678037024,1678037024,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

(i play soulslikes with controller its honestly better i argue like a racing wheel can be for a driving game IT JUST FEELS RIGHT.)

Edit, After progressing through most of the game now, comfortable with all mechanics and what the game has to offer. 

[b]Combat[/b] is about rhythm, when you're on time each deflection and counter attack into a fatal strike feels absolutely fluid. i recommend turning off auto target functions as it will lock onto another person before the fatal strike at times and this will mess up your flow.

[b]multiplayer[/b] definitely has its connection issues right now but i have both positive and negative experiences as of v1.02. Ill summarize it to if you're unlucky its a poor connection with rubber banding. Both Coop and invasions.

[b]story & lore[/b] feels a bit shallow i believe we have a handful of NPC quests to chain. collect notes/shells/keys/pandas/alcoholingrediants, but i dont expect some really good reward either for completing them, just wishing these felt a little more special but i do like that its there. 

[b]conclusion[/b] I do think this game is worth it for the souls like fans who want a fast paced co op game to play while we wait on Elden Rings DLC  i think it will really shine once its optimized as a PVE story mission grind alone and invasions become more of a thing to hang out and do with friends if you were into that in the other souls games.

First and foremost from what I have been able to play of this game, I have to say, I am absolutely into it. I grew and in my early preteens I was allowed to have my own Hollywood Video rental card and some of the games I had most happy memories of were Dynasty Warriors mostly the first three games. I also was a fan of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Chinese myths around those times. So please take what I am saying as not some steam hater with too much time and memes to deal with. I am someone who was this game to succeed on a self serving level. 

The Good: Combat is fluid and quick paced, this may be a souls like titles in it's difficulty curved and boss fights, but it is it's own with the fluidity and character building. I happen to love Elden Ring I am not normally a huge Dark Souls player(though I do enjoy them and respect them, especially the lore, and tend to fall into action rpg and fantasy games as probably one of my favorite genre types. One thing this game does in witch I would Elden Ring to do, is make it co-op in more than just a single instance or fight, you could theoretically play the who game with someone as far as I can tell from what I have done so far. The character is from the games such Dynasty Warriors and from Chinese lore such as Guan Yu, Cao Cao, Sun Jian, and more minor but no less enjoyable figures from these stories are in the game and this is a plus for me. Graphically the game is a good looking game I would not consider it as advance as some games that are currently out but it definitely does snatch from the immersion for myself. These is rpg mechanics such as attribute points, tons of loot, and options to upgrade and re-enchant your gear that I really like. These are some of the bigger positives that were released in this game. 

Negatives:  Unfortunately this game was hit with something I despise to be done on steam and pc applications/clients... releasing a game that virtually unplayable for many buyer's that have system requirements met and even for those who can play a big(like myself) suffer from radical fps drops going from 115 to 55 and back. Also people and friends disappearing and zig zagging like the flash on speed across the screen while you are trying to fight a mob of elites. Also, I had the luck of having my screen turning into a distorted swirl of color where I could not see anything besides my character ahead of me. I know others have their own variety of awful and my nerdy gamer heart goes out for them just the same. This is unacceptable and believe I know you are not the first to release and shit storm of bugs in a new 60$ game. All of those at fault need to take accountability and do better and granted sometimes it is out of the dev teams hands as far as when things get released even. I do understand it is not as black and white as some make it seem, and to those forcing the release of unfinished games I say ""Good Day SIr.... Good Day"" 

For asking the big question do I buy this title, write it off, or wait until some fixes/patches?
Depends on you and your enthusiasm for this title. If I was giving my advice to a friend I would say keep your ear to the ground and wait until this patches come rolling in and then place your bets.

SO what is morale. Morale is their system of difficulty basically. If an enemy has your morale they are difficult af. If they have 1 level higher morale they are even harder. If their morale gets to a certain point they're impossible to fight due to the damage they do and how little you do to them (one enemy you can find on the first level where I got to a max of 8 morale had between 10 to 20 morale and was super fast and killed me in like 4 attacks, I had my cheat program running so I put on god mode to kill it... I played all of Nioh 2 without cheats on PS4 and most of Nioh without cheats here on Steam, I started using cheats late in the game just to level up I believe.

If you already enjoy action based RPG style games like Nioh, Sekiro, Elden Ring etc. I would recommend this game. It would be subjective to state whether the game is difficult or not, it definitely has its challenges which can be overcome with practice, learning the various systems in the game and finding the right build(s) for you.

Various systems implemented in this game are not very intuitive so it would be recommended to watch some guides for combat, leveling, gear etc. for people who are struggling. What is useful to know is that you can explore and read back on the various hints/tips provided throughout the game which should provide more clarity as you progress and gain experience playing.

Combat in this game is quite fun and entertaining as you play through and progress throughout the story as there are many different weapons you can experiment with to see what you like. If you're not sure what build type is for you, try experimenting with different builds/weapon combinations to find what you like. Its also helpful to know that you can eventually respec your skill/class points if you feel the need to do so. Also, having multiple gear sets/loadout sets is a plus for easily switching between your different builds.

ONLINE MULTIPLAYER in this current state is absolutely horrendous. I tried playing with a friend and at this current point in time, multiplayer with friends is unplayable; unless you love teleporting around the map and playing hide and seek during the boss fights. It was a feature they intended to include and is poorly optimized, they need to FIX THIS ASAP.

I would rate this game a 7.5/10, if they can fix the MP sooner rather than later, i'd say it would deserve an 8, maybe 8.5/10.",1677976611,1678028816,True,1,0,0.405073642730712891,0,True,False,False

Combat wise the game is notably faster than Nioh 2 in pacing/speed.  The 1v1 focus is pretty hype/thrilling with the satisfying parries, counter attacks, and being able to jump around the field and do aerial attacks.  The music/boss themes are tight.

The movesets aren't as huge as Nioh and nor does it have the same level of customization for the movesets, but between the four spells, grounded normals/heavies, 2 specials per weapon, and your ultimate/super mode stuff, and weapon switch attacks + other build skills, you've got plenty to mess with imo;  definitely still leaps and bounds over FromSoftware's Souls games and Sekiro.

 The loot drops are way toned done in drop rate is something else I noted.

I tried the keyboard and mouse controls and beat the first boss with them to see what all of the complaints were about, but they work for this game.  I'd say they're just not well optimized for defaults; you can change your binds of course to make them smoother.  Mouse sensitivity being a bit weak when set to max sensitivity is probably the worst thing I've noticed and maybe the walk button bind (better to just block and move instead of that weird thing).

I mainly play with a controller for these types of games, but I don't think the keyboard and mouse controls are that bad.

Time has come for yours truly to provide a small, yet much needed MORALE BOOST for Wo Long, since the current ""Mostly Negative"" consensus going around is truly heartbreaking. Performance issues aside (this one's just controversial overall, with varying opinions), I personally don't think the game is as terrible as people make it out to be. And let me get this off my chest: if you think the game is bad, it just simply isn't for you. I'll go one step further and say you lack patience. You lack the patience to learn what must be learned and absorbed to be a better player.

I was gonna write this review in a few weeks, but after watching snippets of Asmongold's 4-hour stream and losing some brain cells, I couldn't wait. Watching him rushing tutorials and running around spamming attacks expecting enemies to not attack back, all the while bashing the game for having ""too many unnecessary mechanics"" and enemies having ""different timed attacks""... I came here for a field day with this one. That's just a skill issue. Fortunately, most of his viewers were calling him out on it so there is still hope in the world. As a Souls-like and Nioh-like veteran, I find this game to be such an underrated gem that should be more appreciated. It combines mechanics from beloved games like Dark Souls and Sekiro, while trying to stay innovative with progression depth like Nioh. With the character customization coming back from Nioh 2, we have the perfect game to scratch that itch, ladies and gentlemen. Team Ninja outdid themselves this time around, and the world needs to know it.

[b]Note[/b]: As of writing this review, I've completed 23/51 achievements. Running Fire/Wood/Earth build with Sword/DS + Spetum with the occasional Polaris smash when I feel like whacking things with a big weapon.

[h1]Positives[/h1]
[b]Combat[/b]
So, this one is the one that I think everyone is picking sides on. I never want to resort to elitism, but I'm not gonna hold back on this one. Truth be told, all these soft scrubs who think they know Souls-like and Nioh-like games but complain about difficulty and mechanics in Wo Long being garbage need to sit down and get good. When I fought Aoye, I rinse-and-repeated while learning the fight and had such a good time realizing that all the deaths were on me. Whenever I died, I knew that I was impatient during that run and my timing with counters was off. There was never a time that I blamed the game. When I finally beat Aoye with less than 2% health, ally down, and no more Dragon pots, the feeling of satisfaction was immeasurable. The game is PERFECT in this sense. It gives you what you need; it gives you the levels, the gear, the specs. And it punishes you for not knowing the ins and outs of what Wo Long is about. It's mind boggling to me how people who claim that they have beaten Sekiro are complaining about Wo Long. Wo Long is the closest thing we have to Sekiro at this point in time, and the openings for counters and the gear/stats makes it so much more forgiving than the prior.

[b]Character Customization[/b]
This one gets a mention simply because it gets overlooked at times. Just a shoutout to Team Ninja/KT for giving us such an amazing character creation system since Nioh 2. Keep doing what you're doing and please never take this aspect away from your future titles.

[h1]Negatives[/h1]
[b]Wizardry Spells & Weapon Skills[/b]
I have yet to play on a deeper level to have a full opinion about this category, so consider this point pending. As of now, the spells and skills in the game seem lackluster and not game-changing enough. It may vary on playstyle, I suppose; but for myself, I tend to stick to the combat basics (morale, counters, critical blows, etc.) quite significantly so casting spells mid-combo is more or less an optional choice that doesn't feel needed. The spells also seem to heavily rely on stat boosts from gear so without the proper optimization, offensive and utility spells alike such as Elemental spells and Absorb Vitality aren't as helpful to me as I'd like them to be.

[b]Story[/b]
So the storytelling style has always been pretty much static in all of Team Ninja's games. Even in the DoA and Nioh games, they have this style with directing cutscenes that leaves much to be desired. It's this elusive aspect about it... but I always feel like I'm left wanting more. More of a fleshed out story with deeper interactions between characters. In comparison: whereas Dark Souls and Elden Ring have a tendency (as noted in my Elden Ring review) to keep things open to interpretation and vague while having an incredibly deep lore with so much going on in the universe, Nioh and Wo Long seem to have trouble fleshing out the world and characters itself, being limited to a one-time experience that lacks substance. Unless I'm missing something, I would love for them to explore deeper into the Nioh and Wo Long lore and perhaps even have them be intertwined somehow.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
[b]Final Verdict: A+[/b]
Let me be frank, this game isn't for everyone. Know your limits. Test your patience. Learn to love the game for what it is. The game isn't designed to be easy, although for myself personally, I think the counter window is a GODSEND and makes the game a cakewalk. Also, I use a controller but I'm praying they add some proper updates for those who are so insistent on playing with K&M. But to each his own. And to the people like Asmon who just like to **** on the game without actually putting in the work? Get good or piss off.",1678022490,1678022964,True,10,0,0.560084939002990723,0,True,False,False

I am not too far in, like 18hours, spent a lot of time in Tutorial to learn the game and played the demo before. 
I never tried any of the Souls games, Elden Ring, Ninja Gaiden, Sekiro or Nioh without controller and never would so I can´t say anything about that. 
Performance wise I had and have not much trouble. There was some tweaking and fiddling needed to get constant 60FPS out of the game and I had to lower my resolution. The game is just not meant for 4k curved but that´s fine with me. It´s not that looks ugly.

The combat system is different to say the least. Coming from Nioh it felt a bit bland at first but it has it´s own unique flow and once I got used to it, it felt great. I haven´t tried too much magic yet but it looks promising. The revenge system is a nice addition and the whole game feels like very punishing if you mess up. Great game for no-hit runs for sure! 
Story wise it´s like Three Kingdoms, so yeah, totally down my alley! 
Inventory management is ok. The biggest flaw so far - in my book - is the fact, that the game doesn´t save your sorting choice. So I have to sort everytime I want to sell/compare items. But I hope this will be fixed at some point. The followers/summons are nice for some banter lines but to me they are mostly a burden because they mess up enemy aggro and make it harder to get your combos done but since they are optional, I don´t mind them.

Nah, it's a good game, but it's too 'simple', the combat, the spells, the parry system that gets boring in the first 10 hours.

I liked Nioh because it gave you a range of types of game styles that you want to play.

Want to be a ninja? Nice, go get the ninjutsu, and the ninja weapons.

Want to be a Wizard? There are several onmyo spells you can use.

Want to be both? Why not? Just put both.

Besides the performance issues... [I have an RTX 4090, and I don't know why the Nvidia drivers are giving the occasional 'flash' to the screen on all maps, it's quite annoying.]

Besides the combat issues... [The game's mechanics are a little bit of everything Sekiro, Nioh, DS, but by trying to be everything, it failed in the basics. Was it difficult to just place the postures like Nioh? Each posture offered a very wide range of possibilities, that was something unique to Nioh.]

Aside from the parrying issues.... [Let's be honest, parrying sometimes is cool. In games focused on that style like Sekiro it's good too, because they knew how to do it well... BUT in this game? That's annoying! Just set the life bar and stamina equal to DS, the spirit system is really bad, and it limits you to a single playstyle, PARRY!]

The game is very good, inferior to both Nioh and Sekiro, but very good. He's having fun, and that's what matters.

Do I recommend the game? Of course, if you have the money to spend, and a beefy PC to run on because of the optimization issues.

Personally? I would also recommend it, if you're like me who've played all Souls like, Elder Ring, Nioh, DS, etc, etc.

And if you want a new Souls Like Triple A, I would recommend it.

For the general public?

Nah, the whole set of gameplay itself, will quickly bore you, not to mention that anyone not used to Sekiro will suffer in this game, because you NEED the parry to progress.

Ugh, this Parry system I can't swallow, this is an RPG, for God's sake, give me other options! I want to defend too! I want to use defensive spells! Different Weapons!

Forgot to mention that it has very few weapons compared to Nioh 2.

Chinese culture is rich in its own weapons, was it difficult to add more?

Anyway, in summary, it's a good game that tried too hard, and failed miserably, but it's still a good game, for anyone who is a souls like fan like me, and is thirsty for new types like that, try your luck, for those who only here for the Streamers and Tiwich and never played a Souls like, would recommend you guys play Nioh, Sekiro, DS first, or even Elden Ring, so give this one a try, they made things better than this specific game.",1678005275,1678005275,False,3,0,0.497809231281280518,0,True,False,False

Which is a shame because it feels like there's a good game in here somewhere.

I just can't find it because every time anything starts happening on screen the game becomes a slideshow.

And this was after telling the game to prioritize FPS over Visuals.

WTF?

(Continued)

Okay I've got some time in the game, enough that I feel I can give my feelings on it... Minus the horrendous performance issues.

First, Sekiro can go to hell, no seriously... Go to hell Sekiro. I hope Sekiro never inspires its parry centric shit combat into another game ever again, lest we get another tragic Wo Long, where the entirety of the combat effectively boils down to ""parry the enemies 'red' attack... Win"". With practically every other option in combat being slaved to this central combat ""mechanic"".

Let me give you an example.

One of the enemy types in the game is a big stompy demon ogre thing, fights with a hammer and there is also a variation with two glaives.

I myself have a glaive with two martial arts skills ""baked into it"" one is a twirly slash attack, the other is a twirly slash attack followed by a thrust. They look cool, but they're worthless, in fact they are so bad I never use them, ever.

Why? Because doing so means I will get hit and take damage, and there is always a better option.

Here's an idea of how combat breaks down with this ogre thing. (I think they're called ""Demonized Officers"")

You run up to the officer you start a combo, the ogre thing has super armor so he begins to swing at you. At this point you block, or if you have time parry... But you have to be careful not to be TOO invested into the attack or you can't block or parry.

Which means... You guessed it, poking... A LOT of poking.

poke, poke, poke.

Those martial arts I told you about? I can't cancel out of them, so if I start one, I'm locked into the entire animation. The result? I get hit, every time, while doing MINIMAL damage.

So during the course of my poking, which is doing almost no damage to my enemies health or spirit (stamina) I'm basically just waiting to play the hidden QTE game that serves as the ACTUAL combat system in the game.

You see enemies will use a powerful attack where they turn red, it can't be blocked, only parried or dodged. Thing is, if you parry this attack it does an ENORMOUS amount of spirit damage, such that most enemies are just outright ""broken"" by it.

Then you can immediately follow up with an execution style attack that almost always kills the enemy (except bosses) or at the very least does enormous damage.

Thing is, this renders ""traditional"" combat (ie, playing the game) completely pointless.

There's no value to fancy combos, there's no value to martial arts, there's no value to ANY OF IT because every time you fight a tough enemy they will have super armor and you'll have to just poke at them until they give you the chance to counter with a parry.

As for normal ""weak"" enemies... None of it matters there either, because they tend to be so weak that just mashing the attack button will send them on their way to the afterlife.

I just, don't understand the appeal of this kind of combat. Why render normal attacks SO ANEMIC and put 90% of the power and outcome of a fight into ""parry the red attack"" glorified QTE rubbish?

When I say normal attacks are anemic, I mean they are practically WORTHLESS. Every boss I've beaten it's been a matter of waiting and playing defense while the boss thrashes around like an angry toddler until they finally try to hit you with their ""QTE"" red attack and you counter it and deal a quarter of their health.

Attacking them at any other time is POINTLESS because you WILL take damage. They WILL hit you.

The only openings you have to damage the bosses are after countering their ""red"" attack and that's the fight in a nutshell.


It's just dancing around their random thrashing waiting for the red attack so you can ACTUALLY deal damage without getting your teeth kicked in.

And this strategy is so effective that it's comical.

Meanwhile my attempts to eschew this strategy for more ""traditional"" combat simply results in me dealing utterly anemic damage to a boss with super armor before getting flattened. Mind you, I'm morale fortified up to the bosses level AND my weapons are as upgraded as they can be.

...

They built their entire combat system around this singular gimmick and it's shit.

They probably thought it was brilliant but when you pull off the paint, what you're effectively playing is a QTE event where you press the button at the right time and win. Nothing else matters.

Just ... Why?

As many other reviews have already mentioned, Nioh and Nioh 2 are both superior to this game.

Their combat is better, more interesting and can't be distilled down to a single button press at the ""right moment"".

Nioh isn't just a bunch of poking while you wait for a single attack that, if countered, is basically ""I win"" while dealing next to NO damage otherwise because the entire game is centered around that mechanic.

At first I thought this was a good game with bad performance, now I'm realizing it's actually a mediocre game with bad performance.

Speaking of useless, the companions they give you to help? Are absolute trash, they can't even fight two standard soldier type enemies. As for bosses? They exist to be a 15 second meat shield before going down and disappearing, (Don't try to rescue them... It's a trap).

It's not that the game has NO redeemable elements. It's just that there are so many design missteps and so many technical issues and so much to just... HATE about it.

It feels like a tragic case of ""almost, but not quite.""

If you're going to get it, get it at a discount and hopefully after the technical issues have been addressed (assuming they ever will be).",1677897814,1678001572,False,6,0,0.503835856914520264,0,True,False,False

- Bad performance, fps wise i'm fine but the game crashing after a '' beat the boss '' cg is common.
- No mouse and keyboard support. Borderline unplayable without a controller
- Invasions are barely working atm. Can t prioritize finding your own region irl on it, so ping issues, performance issues, crashing, invisible ppl. It s in bad shape, even if when it works it s great

PROS:

- The game is great. In the start i thought it was a downgrade from nioh and a budget sekiro pretty much but the game does get better and better.

I mainly bought this game for the purpose of multiplayer, and in that realm, mostly the PvP, and I can say as someone that has 1500 hours in Elden Ring and 1k hours in Dark Souls 3 (most of which in PvP for both), while the PvP combat itself could be better, I see a lot of potential in it. The main positive of it though is that this game has some of the best incentive to take part in the optional multiplayer modes I've seen in a game of this style. Co-op is probably the best way to farm accolades in the entire game, and nets you a ton of genuine qi while you're at it, so helping others is a genuinely very viable way of farming. Invasions, while the connections can be dubious at times, also has large incentive in the fact that you get lots of accolades for winning, but also 2 random pieces of the enemy player's armour, making it also a genuinely viable way to farm.

I never usually like reviewing games within the first couple of months, but these review bombs are total nonsense. I'll start with its flaws so the expectation is set.

I agree with the negative reviews regarding the 30fps cut-scenes. Its not a huge deal but it set a tone for when I first hopped into the game. Definitely needs to be revised to meet the standards of current game optimisation, they could get away with it in 2015, but not now.

Game could use some patches to get rid of bugs and fps issues but ITS LITERALLY ONLY BEEN OUT FOR 48 HOURS!! This is not the first game that is buggy on release! While I wish games released flawlessly all the time, but its a pipe dream to expect that.

As far as the large amount of reviews claiming poor KBM support, clearly  they have little to no experience playing souls like games. These games require a controller whether the KBM support exists or not. I struggle to understand why this game specifically is cherry picked out of all the souls like titles for that issue. Just plug in a controller and you will have a great time.

All together, I find the game play to be awesome! It is very similar to Sekiro but with tons of different weapons/skills that diversifies different play-styles like most traditional souls games. The combat is challenging and can be hard (as you should expect coming into a souls like) without the use of artificial difficulty to cheat you out of a win. Being able to play the entire game without ending the Co-op session is also something I've always wanted to see in Fromsoft titles, without having to install mods. 

I fully intend to invest a lot of time into this game and likely attempt to get the platinum. Don't listen to these people review bombing because its not the game they wanted it to be in their perfect world. That's not the games fault.. that's your own fault.

TLDR: Game needs a little bit of time to buff the bugs out, hopefully they make the cut-scenes 60fps, and most importantly... Plug in a controller and quit whining.",1677996588,1677996588,True,5,0,0.536222875118255615,0,True,False,False

I haven't had a ton of issues in terms of performance luckily, besides like 3 crashes which still isn't great. So I guess I'm getting lucky with that issue. My main issue is the combat, its kinda bad. It looks really cool and probably would have been amazing, but it has some pretty big issues with it. 

The main reason I hate the combat is the hyper armor the enemies constantly get. I mean just constantly, they will either just have natural hyper armor or get it through special attacks. The special attack system is pretty cool, but when enemies spam it constantly or they do a special attack while you are in the middle of a combo it's aids. Also you would think you would get hyper armor during a special attack since enemies do right? Wrong! When you do a special attack you can be knocked out of it by any attack, you also can't animation cancel out of it so once you do a special attack you have to commit to it. Meaning that if you do a special attack and the enemy does one then your attack will not knock them out of their special attack unless you kill them. If there attack hits first then you get staggered. You would think you would get hyper armor during special and knock people out of their hyper armor, almost like the focus attacks in Naraka Bladepoint. But basically they decided to just fuck the player over.

You can parry the special attacks, in fact I have found myself (if getting my ass handed to me) just turtling and waiting to parry. Its boring but it works, just do that until you can get a lethal attack and rinse and repeat. The games combat could have been so much better If they would have done some other way to counter the enemies hyper armor but the only way to do it is to parry. It really just forces the player to play a very specific way, and it kinda blows. It feels like they tried to make the combat fast paced and yet somehow achieved the opposite. With the main goal to focus on defending until you can get a lethal attack to trigger. 

Everything else is pretty mediocre about the game. It's a really cool idea and i want the game to be good, but it's just not. I feel like the combat system needs a complete rework or overhaul really. Even the posture system or spirit system what ever you want to call it kinda sucks as well. I have parried enemies only for them to attack me again before i could even recover from parrying them. It just doesn't feel good. I like them systems in place but they way they tried to get them to work together is pretty lackluster and sloppy. The system overall just feels gross.  

I hope something gets done to improve the game. I think the idea is there, but the execution of it was sloppy. Almost feel like they rushed the combat system at the end of development to try to push the game out or something. Like they were going to do more with it but ended up releasing it with an unfinished combat system. The hyper armor thing pisses me off greatly, I feel like the original plan was to have the special attack break it. I don't understand why they don't. They do extra damage to to spirit bar especially if you have yours built up high in the blue. But still I am baffled at how bad of a choice that was on the devs part. 

I would rather fight the invader enemies because you can actually stagger them and the fights feel more fair on how the hyper armor works. When I fight invaders it feels like that is how the combat is supposed to work and the normal enemies feel like a hollow shell of what the game was supposed to be.

All in all the game has potential, but I don't think it will live up to it sadly. I don't want a refund I just want the game to be good, hopefully modders will tweak things in the future, or the devs will. I ain't gonna hold my breath though...

There are technical issues for sure with the launch (minor stuttering issues on my end at max graphics, 4k resolution and 120 fps, with a 3090 GPU and other top tier PC specs), but I suspect those will be patched in short order just like other PC port titles from this dev.  They also added a deadzone to the mouse, which is silly and unfortunate for those players who feel the burning need to play on keyboard and mouse.  That said, the game is meant to be played on a controller, and functions fundamentally better on controller similar to other titles from this dev (and true of any souls-like genre game).  

TL;DR, great game, great fundamentals, the minor issues are just that and largely avoidable.  I'm looking forward to playing more of it.

1) Crashes sometimes when starting the game, and sometimes when a cutscene is about to start.  Annoying, but hasn't happened to me during a save or anything so I haven't lost any progress.

2) The game will randomly go in slow-mo which makes for some very frustrating fights.

To counter the other key point the negative reviews are saying, the people complaining this isnt Nioh 2 are probably the same people who complained that Sekiro wasnt Dark Souls 3.

The Sekiro comparison isnt all that bad either. combat is a lot of dodging at the exact moment an attack lands like Sekiro's parries leading to one side or the other being staggered to perform a finisher.

Is this the game to finally dethrone Dark Souls. No of course not. But it is a really fun wuxia inspired soulslike set during the Romance of the Three Kingdoms and maybe its personal prejudice but steam is lacking in either good Three Kingdoms games or good fantasy China games and this is both of those.

Performance on my system is mediocre. Volumetric fog is very taxing on all systems. At the time of this review, I recommend everyone turn this off until there is a patch. On high graphic settings I am hitting the 120 fps cap around 80% of the time with a dip to ~90 fps.

I have not used a keyboard+mouse for gameplay. IMO with a game like this, you should be playing with a controller. I understand that people have their preferences and I'm not here to argue. The developers should have a done a better job with KB+M controls or just had a disclaimer saying that the game should be played on a controller.

I've been enjoying myself with this game. This game is difficult. Don't cry because the game is too hard. I do not like my companions (because some of them just make the game too easy) and I disable them when starting a new area by using the Willow Branch. This game relies heavily on knowledge of enemy movesets. You will be parrying/deflecting almost all attacks.

PROs
• A satisfying parry system that will make you feel good when you pull it off
• Can finally jump, verticality is well used in level design and is refreshing
• Spells are more diversified than Nioh
• Loot drops are more focused and less of pain to manage than Nioh

CONs
• An absolutely un-optimized abysmal PC port
• You cannot be a true mage. Mage spells do little damage on their own and are meant to be auxiliary to your weapon
• Pruning of a lot of depth that made Nioh so good customization wise. No weapon trees, no stance switching, uninspired affixes on items, poor equipment variety
• Morale system is restrictive and punishing. Can't use spells until you reach morale thresholds every time you start new mission. Replaying such mission puts your morale back to 0. Morale goes down when you get hit by special moves
• Graphics are hit and miss. Some levels are enjoyable, others lack vibrancy, color and feel empty. May be due to PC port though.

I am invested, I will keep playing, the game is lots of fun, but it has too many issues.

The worst so far:
- Several crashes in a certain level, and hopefully only there
- A burning, lighting infested level where even with one of the best graphics card and it being only used at 35% capacity the game will not even keep 60 fps at low settings, and jump down to below 40 in spikes.
- The game relying way too much on CPU compared to GPU, I do not know how or why, but it hardly seems normal compared to other games I played, it swamps 60% of the CPU and so that reaches 100%, but graphics card has so much more to offer.
- Settings for graphics and potential others get reset after restarting the game.
- Having on Ambient Occlusion makes the screen blink white several times.
- Other medium and minor stuff.

TLDR; Bugs, crashes, mouse/KB issues (I don't use m/k, but the problems are there for those that do). The loot spam is pointless with fixed stats for a given armor/weapon type. MISSING combat arts, soul cores, burst counters, stance changing,  unique user selected move sets for the different weapons. All with NOTHING to make up for the removed mechanics but a parry system that will be your only useful tool no matter the weapon you use. It really feels like this game was the proof of concept for the Nioh games.

I'm 20ish hours in. While the frame rate has been fine for me, I have a better than average computer and only ever play on 1080@60Hz, so I'm really not pushing the hardware at all.

First, the PC bugs. 

Ugg.. I have seen the ""slow motion"" problem where everything slows down. Not frame rate drops, just ""slow"" movement like the game is running at half speed. This happened twice mid way through my play through so far. Restart/reboot seemed to fix it both times.

White flickering. Apparently the Ambient Occlusion in this game has issues. If it is enabled (it is by default) player, character, background.. well everything models flicker white. After hunting down this issue with the googles, and turning off Ambient Occlusion, it does fix the flicker (almost entirely, I still see a rare flash of white textures now and then), it brings up the next bug...

Graphics settings don't save. Turn off motion blur and forced to disable a setting to work around a flickering bug? Well, do it every time you start the game because it won't persist for some reason.

Crashes. Up until the 20 hour point, I ""only"" had 2 crashes. One crash occurred during the cut scene immediately after a 30 minute boss fight forcing me to kill the boss a second time (curse you squid cow). Now however, I can't even get the game to load my save. During ANOTHER post boss fight cut scene the game crashed to desktop. Now, I've tried restarting/rebooting/using healing crystals and nothing is letting me get back to my characters save. I can start the game mess around with the settings, but I crash to desktop when my save loads. Lovely.

I don't play ARPGs with mouse/keyboard but the poor state of affairs there surely needs to be mentioned.... yet again...

Ok, so that's the problems, now the actual game play. I don't ""hate"" the game mechanics, but I'm very underwhelmed. The only real ""mechanic"" is timed deflections (parry) after which you can counter attack. And that's pretty much it. Anything else is a waste of time.

Magic: Well, they have it, but for a lot of the spells you can't even cast them early in a mission because you have to unlock points as you play through a level. Once you have the points available, it uses a large portion of your ""inverted stamina"" resource, making you perfectly ripe for a miss timed deflect to get stunned by a trash mob. Also, the spells are pretty short duration and not super powerful anyway making them pretty unnecessary. So, magic gets a fail.

Gear/Loot: Well, in this game, all items of the same type have the same stats. So there is no reason to wait for RNG to give you something better. While they can have different passive abilities, defense, resists, etc, are all identical. This makes the pile of loot you get pretty pointless. So, if you hate the loot spam of nioh games, you will still have it here, but with no reason for it to even exist.

Weapons/Mechanics: Do you like spamming light attack? Well I hope so because that's what you will be doing. There aren't really any combos to speak of in this game. There are no learnable skills. ""Martial arts"" are RNG abilities on weapons. There can be 1 or 2 depending on the weapon rarity and for slower weapons they are useless. For faster weapons you can get off a ""martial art"" during combat, but slower weapons just leave you wide open to attack for several seconds. Think to the Nioh ""Spin to win"" axe move without the ability to animation cancel. In a twitch based reaction game. Also, there is very little variety in the weapon types. It comes down more to slow vs. fast than any real move sets. So, weapons in this game are a fail.

Level design: Like most Team Ninja games it's a glorified level tunnel with a hub. The ""hub"" in this game is a little more integrated, but it's pretty much what you would expect if you've played Nioh. Level design gets a pass, although nothing new here.

Bosses: The boss fights are pretty fun all in all. Very standard Nioh'esque fights. Other than having to do nothing but stand in it's face waiting for a move to parry, the bosses seem ok. Bosses get a pass.

Graphics: They are fine for what they are but won't blow anyone away for sure. Graphics get a soft pass.

So that pretty much is it. If I didn't know the time lines I would SWEAR this game was the proof of concept for Nioh. The mechanics are so dumbed down, that you would swear THIS is the much older game. I'm not sure who they are trying to target with this game. Is it the people who complained that the Nioh mechanics were ""too hard/plentiful"", because they've pretty much thrown everything away that fans of the Nioh games really enjoyed, while adding nothing to replace the missing mechanics.",1677984408,1677984408,False,1,0,0.46875,0,True,False,False

Me and My friend live at seperate parts of the world, Him Canada me United Kingdom, I expect some issues, but however after coming from Nioh 2, we both played from Chapter 1 through to the Final DLC of that game, we were coming over into this one, and now we cannot even begin to play this game, the optimisation for Co-Op is not working so great AT ALL, yet when he says hes helped people through summoning instead of Co-Op he said it works fine, so I cannot say if this is a issue from us playing together, or using Co-Op feature, but do not buy this game right now until a few more patches are released.

Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty is by far one of my favorite games of 2023. The game has such a strong start with it's fast paced game play. It immediately throws you in the battle with a great surprise at the end of the first level. Learning the new controls (GAMEPAD RECOMMENDED) is absolutely fun and engaging especial the new moral system. The high risk and rewards are what make battles challenging and worth fighting enemies with higher moral then you. Exploration has improved immensely from previous titles such as having more open spaces to travel (Jumping around everywhere). Finding secrets, shortcuts, and new enemies is what make exploration worth the time. The combat in Wo Long is very much inspired by Sekiro with it's rhythmic parrying and dodging system. Think of it like Nioh meets Sekiro plus jumping. The martial arts are pretty fun and handy when it comes to stressful situation. It helps space out you opponents when fighting multiple enemies at once dealing more critical damage when successfully struck. It's so satisfying when you perfect parry a strong attack. The new spells are tied to your elements which offer multiple different way to help you in battle such as having faster spirit recovery, tougher armor, projectile spells and much more. I'm currently still playing this game while writing this review so it might change when I finish it. (obviously)   

Unfortunately, Wo Long suffers from optimization issues on PC. Don't bother playing with mouse and keyboard. It's completely unplayable and broken. A gamepad is highly recommended here. The frame rates are staggered and choppy which can disrupted game play and be bothersome. It really saddens me that this game is being reviewed bomb due to the poor performance on PC. I completely understand the outcry and negative reviews with this game. 

Overall, I would wait for the developers to fix and patch this game before purchasing it unless you have a decently powerful PC. Note I am playing this game with an RTX 3080. (not flexing here)

I have played most of Nioh 2 and was a little overwhelmed by learning curve of the stats and build craft mechanics along with the weapons themselves. This game does not have that issue. The weapons are very simple and build making has been heavily streamlined, for better or for worse depending on what aspect of these games you prefer. If you like Sekiro like me you will probably like this game as well. It takes a very similar core concept in deflecting everything in an almost rhythm game style pace and adds builds and weapon types to it.

Performance: I'm running a 3080ti/10850k so take this for what it's worth. I have everything at max on 1440 res and i'm getting between 110 and the max of 120 fps. No stuttering or skipping. Best release performance wise I've had in awhile. Obviously judging by other reviews this isn't the average experience but most of that is also the M+KB controls which are by all accounts horrific. I'll quit playing souls games before I use anything but a controller anyway though, so I'm not holding it against the game. Also they'll fix it. Everyone seems to forget the Nioh 2 launch was a train wreck too.

Gameplay: It really is like Nioh and Sekiro had a beautiful lovechild. There's 2 things that are especially cool that you don't see often/ever. First is no stamina or magic bars. All you've got is your spirit gauge. Quick attacks and successful dodge/parries/counterattacks fill it. Heavy attacks, magic, and martial arts(special attacks) lower it. It's a negative to positive bar that at rest will go back to zero. No needing to F with any magic potions. How they did the stats is the second uncommon thing. No str/sta/mag/etc. Based on the 5 elements. Each element is good for a few weapons and stats AND an entire spell tree. No matter what kind of toon you  roll you'll have a whole tree or 2 of magic that you'll be specialized in and it doesn't even cast any MP! It's really cool. 

Difficulty: Yeah it's hard. You'll be gitting gud or not progressing. I play most of the souls style games but it's always a trudge for me, I'm not one of those psychos beating the bosses with an f'ing DDR pad or anything. That being said the prologue level was admittedly a bitch. I probably died 30 times to the miniboss guy you didn't need to fight and 15 times to the first boss, who was a bastard and had a second form. The miniboss deaths went very quickly, the killing the first phase on the boss did not. It's all about breaking their spirit meter because you do CRAP damage to them unless it's the final attacks when they're staggered. Reminds me of Sekiro in that. Breezed through the second level(1 shotted the boss) so it's not all as bad as getting to the f'ing title screen. No deaths on the first submission which is where I am now. The level design is very similar to Nioh. Mission based. Traps abound(one of my favorite parts.)

- Progression is very limited. You have stats, Spells (you can buy all of them relatively quickly but only equip 4 at once) and a very simple Gear System. You quickly run out of things you can to to improve your character, which, compared to Nioh, takes away a big part of the motivation to play through it multiple times on higher difficulty levels after beating it.
- The level design feels like a step down compared to what i remember from Nioh 2, which itself didn't have great level design. The main village looks like someone created it in 20 Minutes with some leftover assets.
- There isn't enough enemy variety
- Many bosses were disappointing, but there are a few really good ones i dont want to spoil for people interested in the game.

I only needed 75 minutes to realize this combat system would get stale after a few hours, with constant parry spam/baiting bosses. It's such a huge step back from Nioh 2 in terms of flow, customization, and style that I'm downright confused. 13 weapons means.. only a simple x-x-x combo at most, with maybe putting in a martial art (which are random drops for weapons btw, instead of being able to pick what you want lol), magic feeling slightly better but with it being completely locked behind morale it makes some of them absolutely unusable until you clear enough of the level, missing transformations from Nioh 2/1. 
I understand that it's trying to be a different game from Nioh 2, but when the combat is this much of a disgrace with lack of complexity that the previous games had makes me question if getting 3 more weapons (a total of 13 weapon varieties compared to Nioh 2's 10 weapon varities) was worth losing almost all of their skills/skill trees with temperable buffs that can be changed at will (skills can't be lol). With that, inputs cannot be cancelled in ANYWAY from my knowledge. You input a martial art but get hit stunned out of it by the boss? You bet your fucking ass you're going to be using it after your not stunned anymore. You see an attack coming after you attack twice? Too bad, the half a second to second delay to block means you got hit. This isn't as prevalent as in Nioh 2. Magic/Ninjitsu felt much better in Nioh 2 compared to the magic system here. Only 4 at once? Nioh let you have up to 12 all hot barred. I understand limiting magic if it's super strong, but here it doesn't feel that strong, perhaps because I didn't spec into it, but even then magic in Nioh 2 had it's usages even if you didn't specialize into it..
The Story? Non existent. Fucking trash, couldn't tell you what  happened because of simply how bad it was. It didn't excite ot interest me with constant time jumps, character jumps and a disjointed story. 
Transmog for weapons/armor is a huge step back, you can't see what it looks like b4 applying it for.. Some reason I suppose. 
Parry system is cool, but even their last major game didn't overly rely on 1 mechanic to deal with bosses. It may be a major point for their bosses I suppose, but there's not flexiable. If they wanted to be like Sekerio, they failed.

Basically, this game took a few things from Nioh 2, DS, and Sekiro and tried to copy them but failed ultimately. Sekiro's parry system felt enjoyable and the bossfights felt tight compared to these bosses that either never use parryable moves (first boss has a common issue of not using Red attacks when NEEDED to defeat him other than getting a few hits as possible) spam them, or act as they finally should. 
Asked for a refund, but if I don't get one I'm going to at least try and get my money's worth from this disappoint of a game coming after Nioh 2. It was simple a follow up, and they somehow fumbled it.
EDIT
Decided to play Nioh 2/Sekiro to compare. Holy shit does the combat feel much better in both games. Parrying/dodging is a separate button, my inputs aren't fighting between the two (thank christ, one of the worst things in Wo Long is parry/deflect on the same button). Boss fights that don't rely on certain attacks to parry to be able to do damage, running around waiting for a certain attack ain't fun guys. The loot, albiet it so fucking spammy as I'm NG+2, feels much more rewarding when I get green drops that I can combine into stronger weapons and then being able to temper almost every single thing in their applications. No weird ass Morale system that gate keeps you from fighting certain enemies in a level. Bosses although can be stance broken easily, don't rely on me spamming parry on them (punishing the red attack that hopefully they attacked with) waiting for max spirit hitting triangle and then repeating. No annoying companions that are little more than eye candy getting in the way of combat. Bosses that don't seemingly rely only on parrying as a core mechanic and no other way of interaction,  With that, enemy variety is really important; however both games fail at this imo. Enemy variety remains a team ninja problem though, Nioh 2 wasn't exempt from this and playing Nioh 2 showed me that these devs really didn't learn from their lack of variety in their first and second Nioh games. 

Something I didn't touch upon was builds. Wo Long, builds? What are those? I didn't get super far in the game, but even a few hours in to Nioh 2 you can start building injitsu/Magic/ki attack builds on your items to help you in combat. In Wo Long, they copied this same idea but with lack luster weapon trees, magic/ninjitsu cbominations combined WITH soul cores it feels as though a big part of what made Nioh 2 so successful was completely ignored. Loot itself is worthless in Wo Long, with most gear being the same no matter what other than special effects/martial arts minus looking baller as fuck compared to Nioh 2's armor.

Onto why I played Sekiro as well. I take back what I said about them copying DS, because they really didn't even try to. They tried top copy Sekiro and then sprinkle in some elements of Nioh 2  to attract fans from that series but failed horribly. Sekiro is overall a better game in terms of graphic fidelity, combat, story, sound design and music. Sekiro may be a game build around it's parrying mechanics, but they felt responsive, sounded simply fantastic and even then did not only rely on abusing it's posture bar for victory in boss fights compared to Wo Long; where the only thing I felt like I was doing was just filling a bar, parrying and then hitting triangle. 
Seriously; this game is good if you've never played Nioh 2 or Sekiro. My recommendation is play this game if you haven't played either but even then get it on sale. Otherwise you aren't missing much, just a failed rehash of game concepts done much better in previous games. Game is worth it on Game pass, or 25-50% on sale.

I don't really have a problem with the kb+m problem because I use a controller for pretty much all these types of games, can't really imagine playing nioh or sekiro on a mouse and keyboard, but if you don't have a controller (or don't want to use one, I guess?) then maybe skip this one or buy one chief. 

Yeah, the story ain't that great. It seems to just kind of throw in characters constantly, and it also doesn't help trying to keep track of it all when there's like 6 guys with the name Zhang.

So i dropped the game to lowest everything apart from resolution. Just to play the game at tip top form,

There are flashes in the game white flashes often if you don't play with lower settings on some option, it is fixed once lowered but it shouldn't be like that obviously.
If you play with custom graphic options the game will auto restore it once you die or restart or load up to a new area.
You have to pick one of the actual settings it provides for it to stay that way-.-
There are fps spikes where you see a stutter and when this happens the GPU goes to 100% usage.

You can really make many types of characters there including hot or cute female girls, which is lacking in many western AAA games. The downside though is the female chars has animation of a men. During cutscenes, they stand and act like men but not female. 
Biggest problem of this game is it has great atmosphere, but terrible immersion. It keeps telling you that you are at war, there is these morale flag system, the background is showing a war torn area with cutscenes showing a war with troops, however once you are in game, all these troops are gone, major general shows up as invasion figure. All that really makes you feels a huge disconnection of what the background is base on. I will say team ninja at the current moment has higher ability to execute their vision, however I really don't think this is what Koei should do for three kingdoms, perhaps them and omega force should collaborate and really refine the dynasty warriors franchise.

The Good: Gameplay is really good. Fast paced. Bosses get frustrating at times. Lots of build variations and possibilities. Decent amount of enemy variations. Deflection is probably one of my favorite game mechanics in a minute. Transmog fashion souls. Gigachad weapons. Tig Bitty characters. It's the greatness of Nioh and Sekiro combined.

The Bad: Was getting a weird fps drop during snake boss fight that normally didn't get that made the boss 5x harder than she should have been. The online only works about 15-20% of the time the rest of the time it is so laggy and desyncy even with my 10 ms 1gb down 200 up connection it is unplayable most the time.

The story, as far as I've played, is nonsensical. Maybe it'll make sense later on but for the first 2 to 3 hours, you barely make out what's going on before you move to a new area.

overall, Koei Tecmo/Team Ninja need to start optimizing their games before release, because this is just unacceptable.

First, this isn't a ""soulsborne"" game. The control scheme is nothing, nothing like any of the souls games. This is a Ninja Gaiden game with a Chinese Mythology costume on it. In that note, it's not a bad game. It reminds me of playing the old ninja gaiden games on xbox.

on that, this game pisses me off to no end. the bosses are no fun, and I don't like zugzug builds in any game i play. This time I was thinking of giving magic and sword play a go like crouching tiger hidden dragon kung fu. No. Magic is terrible. Absolutely terrible. I sunk all my points into Water to get the icebolts and unseen form, completely useless. Fighting the monkey was like shooting frozen peas through a straw. It was miserable, and no matter how many times I was able to counter the stupid thing, something would happen that would completely break the game and take me by surprise. 

*MONKEY FIGHT* this stupid thing will sometimes do 3+ crit strikes in a row, and if you have a camera on him and you time your parries visually, good luck, you're going to need some sort of clairvoyance to beat it. I even sat there for an hour just not even moving only parrying, and maybe it's because i'm on steamdeck, sometimes my guy wouldn't even react he'd just sit there. Learning to time in this regard is useless, because also if the game visually lags, the enemies still attack. This boss shouldn't be this difficult at lvl ""5"" and my character is lvl 12, though i put  most of into water until i realized it sucks. 

Execution of this port is not fun to play, and it was the game i was looking forward to this year. If you want better game play and story look at GuJian 3. Better Chinese mythology, better combat and exploration.

It's okay; it plays like Sekiro end game, and your weapons = how fast or slow you parry/ deflect.
It has some issues with objects flickering in and out of existence and other things. Currently, 8/10, waiting for hopefully fists to become a weapon.

--------------------------------------
A phenominal title held back by the issues of the port.
Lets start by stating the elephant in the room.
The port is not good. It's the typical Koei Tecmo port. Stutters, bugs, light issues, flickering...
I can go on. This has been a issue with Koei for years now. Ranging from their Musou/warrior games to their fighting game title aka DOA.

Now, ignoring these things.

The game itself is fantastic, the Three Kingdom era combined with dark fantasy is just awesome.
The combat is a combo between NIOH and Sekiro.
The levels are pretty much the same like you can expect from Team Ninja.
The story (atm) is ok. But is set in a fantastic dramatic period. The Period where Dynasties in china fell.

If you like souls likes, like Sekiro or NIOH and want a fun rpg with some fantastic combat.
Then WO Long is for you.
For now if you want to wait for fixes. I would wait
if you cant wait, just get it.
It's still a phenominal game sadly burried a bit under the tons of technical issues.

Loot is extremely simplified but still drops like a torrential downpour and is still loaded with +2.3% Tax Bracket.

Worst thing for me is co-op is very minimum viable product.

The game is just so addictive. It's very fast paced and the combat is so smooth. I love deflecting and staggering enemies. It just sends dopamine throughout my brain. Not to mention the animations are great!

Boss battles can get easy at times, since once you knew the perfect time to deflect to stagger the boss you pretty much beat them, human enemies are easier to read than monster enemies.

Love the time period too. The Three Kingdom era lends itself well and ancient China is awesome. The story is actually good if you have prior knowledge, as the main con would be if anyone comes in without any background info about the time period or the characters then you would have no idea what the fuck is going on. Like they don't explain who the Yellow Turbans are, who the Warlords are or why the Han Empire is falling. But as someone with prior knowledge and absolutely loves the time period it is done amazingly here.

The first two chapters take place during the initial Yellow Turban rebellion in 184ad and then it continues on, currently on chapter 3 which is set during the eunuch take over of the Imperial Court which is what leads to the collapse of the Han and the Warlord period which then culminates in the Three Kingdoms being formed.

Overall this game is basically Nioh 2 with some Sekiro and light Dynasty Warrior elements. The game has a morale is tied to each chapter, you raise it by defeating enemies and exploring and raising flags. Higher morale means you deal more damage and take less, enemies also have morale levels.

Performance is great, much better than the demo, in the demo I had to play the lowest settings and barely got 60fps. Now I can play the highest settings and get stable 60fps.

Combat feels great once you get use to the parries and deflects. Story is lacking but I don't really care... I play souls like games for the combat and challenge. Co-op seems to allow story progression for all party members, so that's a plus.

Only gripe, online co-op is baaaaaaaad. Constant lagging with party members and enemies zipping from place to place. It's on and off but about 50% of the time playing with friends, the lag occurs. When it's not happening, it runs flawlessly for us. We still managed to get from the second map all the way to around the 6th map even with the issues though.

I just got into the third area, and look forward to whatever happens next. This is a great game and you should totally play it.

Do not buy this game expecting ""Nioh 3"", anyone who makes this comparison has 100% never played one of them. There is no stance switching, no ki pulsing, the combat is extremely shallow (not bad, just shallow) in comparison to Nioh's. You're missing the huge variety of attacks, dodges, and skills that you had access to in Nioh. This game is very simple comparatively, the only variations being skills that are locked to weapons. Even the ""Living Weapon"" mode of this game isn't anything like what you see in either Nioh or Nioh 2. There is basically nothing about the gameplay that makes it a comparison to Nioh.

It's still very fast combat and it's fun. Most people are talking about performance issues so try and find a benchmark (of the released game, not the demo) from someone with a system similar to yours I suppose. The demo of the game ran extremely bad for me (and it was 60fps locked), but the released game has made it run basically perfect for me.

There are a few bugs, I've fallen through the ground once and been stuck in a wall, but it's rare and most likely won't affect your actual gameplay at all.

Only reason I'm leaving this review at all is to, once again say, THIS GAME IS NOTHING LIKE NIOH OR NIOH 2. Any reviewer who says this is a moron. If you're only looking for a sequel to Nioh, don't come looking for it here, but this is still a fun game.",1677933236,1677933236,True,0,1,0.454757452011108398,1,True,False,False

Since wirting a review should always start with a positive you're now able to jump form inside a mission to another mission to farm materials/levels or the ""hub"" to respecc (without costs this time) or upgrade your gear. 

Combat, while fun, is thinner than Nioh because you're not stance dancing anymore. Instead you're managing your and the enemies spirit (stamina).  Weapons don't have skill trees but come with actions like a lunges, heavy thrusts etc.. 

Rewards are definetly a step back from Nioh 2. For example I liked the loot explosions in the Nioh games. In Wo Long you just get stuff listed at the edge of the screen. No satisfying drop sounds upon beating a boss only an empty arena before the games loads a cutscene. 

With decent amount of gear comes the pain of not being able to directly compare two pieces. It's pretty much the same interface as Nioh 2 only with a third of the screen being empty. 

I can't really say much about the performance side of the game other than it doesn't save any graphical changes you make in the options. You pretty much always have to change them when starting. This is esp painful when (as some report) the games crashes for no reason and options being bugged so you have to change them everytime.

Currently there's much lacking and/or missing to make it a good game.

Is it worth your money or time? Play the demo and see for yourself. The demos' content is the first two levels of the game with the option to transfere progress should you decide to buy the full game.

Regarding the issues one can read in the negative critics here on steam I for myself can't agree with them.
I only have/had two issues:
Starting a new game for the first time resulted in a black screen with weird sounds which could be solved by installing a VP9 decoder from the Microsoft store. The second issue is that the game does not recognize I have a 144 Hz display and caps the frame rate at 60 FPS but I think this will soon be adressed in patches.

I'm so tired of lazies developers who are not capable to do a respectable PC port... It's not the first time since the start of this new year and it's really boring...

I paid the game 70€ and I can't accept that the game :
1. crashes
2. display PS5 keys than keyboard keys !!!
3. and MORE importantly than the camera is broken...

The game is : 
- still cutted in mission
- the level design is meh
- ennemies are placed like no one will place ennemies in a game... 
- IA still stupid since their first Nioh... 
- what are these textures?

I'm so *** tired of Team NINJA... 

I have a question for all the people who have left a positive opinion on the game: Did you pay for the game with your money or did your parents buy the game to you?

Are you OK to pay 70€ or 95€ for a game who has so many problems?

Respect yourself... 

Do you want a better game than Nioh 3 with a better universe and better parry system and a true system ? Go play Sekiro. Sekiro is a game with more depth than this game... and only for 60€!

This game is a shame and don't deserve a price highter than 30 or 40€...

Games are always sold more expensive but not optimized, it's crazy...

Forspoken, Wild Hearts and now Wo Long... Who's next?

Asking for a refund.

As soon as the bugs are patched this will be a resounding YES from me. The port for this game is horrible, constant artifacting, slow downs, texture pop in, and crashing on loading screens. Give this one some more time in the the dev's oven before purchasing. Also to address the issue between KB+M and controller, DO NOT PLAY THIS ON THE FORMER. Like most souls-likes, this game was developed with gamepad in mind and it really does show. That's not me saying that you should only play with a gamepad, I think it should have been clear to focus on the KB+M controls to make it a smoother experience. Now, this game under all the bull is amazing. Combat is fun, builds are extremely flexible, systems are well in place. Going through this gives me nostalgia for Dynasty again.

Lets start off with this game is not going to be an easy one, its actually quite hard but enjoyable you can't just walk through everything and everyone. its a Dark Souls game through and through. But that being said its a Three Kingdoms based one, with a neat story and tons of fun things to do, a must have for any Three Kingdoms fan.

Pros:
- Three Kingdoms baby!
- Upgrading system
- Level system
- Dark souls style
- Lots of ways to play
- Beautiful graphics
- $60 pricetag not $70.. 
-  Enjoyably hard
- Chinese voices
- Lots more

Cons:
- First boss in tutorial is quite the beast
- Fell through the ground in a few spots
- Targeting issues
- Morale system is kinda lame
- Parry system is fun but taxing at the same time
- Jumping needs a fix
- Controller support works, but had some minor issues, also heard other issues in discord from others


Overall, this game is worth the money but I know alot of people are having a hard time with the game, its not as bad as many will make it, the game itself is wonderful and fun, I would highly recommend it and support it.

Okay, now with specs out of the way--the game runs like butter, consistent 120 FPS with only one setting turned down: Volumetric Clouds to Standard, everything else maxed out, granted I'm not out of the first area yet, so performance might change, I don't know yet. Yes, I have a good build, not many folks are going to have these specs. My advice--temper your expectations on the graphics settings. Turning some down a bit isn't going to kill your enjoyment, and yes, it sucks if you're rocking a 3080/Ti and having to tune the settings instead of just flipping it to ultra, hell I have a 4070Ti and had to tune one setting down, to those running at recommended specs, that's the guarantee for 1080p/60, so if you're running anything above that, you'll definitely need to fine tune it.

A bit of transparency--I use a controller. I've learned that just because I'm gaming on a computer that always using KB/M is limiting the enjoyment I'd get from some games, and for those complaining about the crappy KB/M support--if you're running a fairly decent build, investing $60 into a controller isn't going to hurt you, hell you can get an old Xbox 360 controller for dirt cheap these days. With the Dual Sense controller the game is super responsive, everything responds instantly, making this game a blast to play. 

Okay, onto my thoughts on the game--so far I'm not far at all. I'm at the first boss, and man does this game kick ass. It's like Dark Souls on crack, and I love it, and I'm not even a DS fan, loved Elden Ring, but couldn't find the same luster for the DS series. I threw myself at the first boss probably a good 10-12 times before I decided to take a break for the night, but I'm anxious to get back in and try again tomorrow. 

So, take my review with a grain of salt if you will, but personally I think the negative reviews are mostly overblown, and while I understand about the KB/M issue, not every game on PC has to be played with KB/M.

- Flashy screen: there are some side maps that has this issue. when you progress further into the area, the screen begins to glitch. also, my computer has RTX2060, i7 10700 and 32 rams, so I don't think it the hardware issue.

- Crash when invade: I experienced crash when loading into the invading area once per three invasion attempts.

-FPS inconstancy: random frame rate drops.

-Multiplayer connection issue: I think some of you might also experienced seeing your friends or hosts gliding around in extreme speed.

There is nothing new about this game, its like ""Nioh 2"" but a super-substandard-version. The graphics are not that great, and on PC it doesn't even support my monitor resolution (3840x1200),.. just like crappy Wild Hearts.

The controls and game-play aren't the best, and by the way, this is another game where you cannot block attacks, instead you have to time and parry (deflect) enemy attacks. You will end up frustrated from dying many...many...many times... I mean, this type of mechanic is a ridiculous implementation to lengthen your playtime because of lack of real content and creative mechanics on the developers part.

Unfortunately, I got caught up in character creation mode (which is relatively, the only decent thing about the game), and spent much longer than I should have (much longer than the 2-hour refund window) and now I can't refund the game. Take my advice, and keep your money in your bank account for better games.

For the stutters, much of my issue seemed to fix itself (not completely, but well enough) by opening the Nvidia control panel and limiting the FPS of the program to 60.  It isn't silky smooth, but is an improved performance on my end.

The mouse can rotate the camera, but it's behavior resembles dead zones with slight mouse movements, causing an extended delay that either fails to register subtle movements, or will cause you to over correct  and causing your hand to move all over the place for what feels like minimum movement.  

This game is best played with a controller, but if the performance and controls with the mouse irk you, feel free to wait before making a purchase.  The pc port is not well optimized at all, so much of the negativity is well-founded.

With those issues out of the way now, this review will move on to the merits of the game.  Slick movements, forgiving parry windows, and a (simplified) combat to Nioh, there are relatively few complaints I can give for Wo Long.  Still some of the best character creation in a non MMO, modded Skyrim, or some of Illusion's CaC modes (Koikatsu Party and Honey Select have excellent character creation).  Character models look good, the environments look pretty good, and the game has a much better look than it's spiritual predecessor Nioh 1 & 2.  Will always be fun to see what other's create, and with the sharing system you can get many ideas for your own characters in no time.

Combat is where Wo Long can really shine.  Given, it lacks much of the depth of Nioh, with no weapon stances, loss of some diversity of builds and no learnable weapon skills.  If you have recently played Nioh and loved thew game's depth you aren't going to find it here.  The motions however, feel much the same.  

Wo Long relies much more on t he ability to deflect and parry attacks (similar to Sekiro); however, you could get by often with relying on blocking or anticipatory dodging.  Parries are highly recommended, but with extra tenacity, you could forsake the deflect mechanic often.  If you wish to dive into parries and deflects, the window of time allowed to perform the action is much more forgiving compared to the parry skills learned in Nioh.  

Combat can look very stylish when you pull off the parries and mix in martial arts, then back off and cast some elemental skills to build up an elemental attribute on your opponent.  The Critical attacks an enemy performs functions much like a burst counter from Nioh two.  Many enemies have long animations on an initial blow that can make parrying the attack easier.  My main problems with Wo Longs combat does tend to stem from the martial arts, and parry animations.

The martial arts allow you to use special attacks based on the weapon you have.  The problem with the martial arts is that the arts equipped to a weapon are completely random.  Since the game lacks the skill progression of Nioh, it can be difficult to feel a sense of character growth.  I feel tying the martial arts to your weapons was a bit too much of a streamlined approach to combat setup.

I wish the enemies showed better response to the parries from time to time.  In typical Koei-Tecmo fashion, enemies can often attack relentlessly, and an initial parry can practically open your character to attacks from a quick combo from an enemy.  The tiger demon is a common example as it is a fast enemy that has a 5 hit combo with it's claws then stands on its hind legs, to deliver a powerful frontal stomp.  If you parry the first attack, get prepared to hit the parry button again as the enemy decided to keep swinging anyway.  

All that said, when the combat clicks and you find your grove on the battlefield, it is one of the most enjoyable experiences you could find in an action RPG.  Wo Long utilizes a jump function splendidly.  Allowing for chances of stealth flank attacks that can bring a satisfying attack that adds to the visuals of combat while doing major damage.  It isn't on the levels of DMC or Ninja Gaiden, but the combat remains some of the best within the action combat genre.

The morality system offers a nice way to grind a stage or give a potential challenge for others by allowing you to grind each stage to max morale to give a leg up on the enemy boss, or attempt to  challenge yourself by remaining at low level.  Morale will impact the damage you do and your ability to resist damage as well.  As you find the battlefield markers to raise your banner, you build fortitude, which will be your starting morale point should your character meet a death.  Search them all to build a high fortitude to limit morale grinding later, or do you aim to keep it low so you can endure the hardships of a challenging boss at low morale?  The options is yours.

The loot in Wo Long is much more simplified than the loot sets in Nioh.  I can understand the agony of grinding equipment in the vain hopes of getting something good (farming bosses for weapon skills and smithing texts made Nioh more repetitive and a chore).  Worry not, Wo Long has alleviated much of the concerns of doing hours of treasure hunting.  Loot isn't as numerous, and you can find decent look fairly quickly with some skill and a dash of luck.

That said, the effects on your gear will be nonexistent to the point of barely needing anything more than high attack or defense.  Many of the effects on equipped items is likely to increase certain aspects by 1-2%.  Seriously, that makes looking for gear with a particular element all- but worthless.  Give some more meaningful attributes in character gear Team Ninja!

The music is Chinese ambiance, so it will likely be pretty hit or miss.  While I can enjoy traditional Chinese music, I can admit there are times when the songs will be underwhelming.  

The Story, is also hit or miss with very little attachment to characters.  As a fan of Dynasty Warriors, I was really happy to see many of the character models in this game.  But if you are not an ROTK enthusiast, you may get little from the story of the game.  Much of it also feels samey to something you here in Nioh.  

While flawed, the game is too fun to pass up.  It may be an easier nioh-nite, the conclusion is the Wo Long combat more than makes the game engaging.  If you can manage the controls and some stuttering, this game could well become a new favorite for any looking for an easier adaptation of Nioh.",1677916628,1677916628,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I have a 4080 and 13700k and I still experience frame rate drops, running mostly on medium/low quality. That is pretty bad optimization, especially with only having moderate graphics. They didn't spend much time optimizing for PC clearly.

However, I have had a ton of fun with this game as I'm someone who enjoys a challenge. If you enjoy Dark Souls, this is similar but less ""memorization"" of abilities and more reaction-time based. The bosses/enemies have weird delays on their attacks and too many moves to reliably memorize them, so you'll have to rely on quick reactions with little to no indication at times of what combo is coming...which can be fun if you like a challenge, but is really unfair and I can see a lot of players not enjoying it due to this.

There are a lot of systems that don't get clearly explained, but I personally enjoy the flag mechanic. Essentially, you get flags in each level to make yourself stronger in that zone, which helps to strengthen you before the last boss. Many of these are optional, but getting them will make your fights much much easier. The tradeoff is time vs difficulty. However, the game doesn't really explain this mechanic well (like many things) and it will be confusing for the first few hours.

- The gameplay relies heavily upon the player being astute on button timings and quick thinking, this can be difficult as it also suffers from graphical stuttering and inconsistent framerates.
- Black screens as audio persists in the background to screen resolution malfunctions
- Game time was spent periodically having to hide and adjust graphical options to try and salvage some mediocrity to the games child like tantrum hiccups it'd have.

The game as a whole is not ready for savouring the playability that has come from its predecessors. The reviews are indicative of the fan base this franchise has created and trounced their passionate players into questioning their reasons to follow them.

The level design is just right in scale and atmosphere, and the enemy design and encounters are some of the best in the business. 

The challenge feels just right, and although death may be frequent, it never feels unfair or beyond your control.

The port is not as bad as many reviews will make you believe, but definitely has a lot of room for improvement, mainly regarding optimization and bug fixes. The game runs at a rock solid 60fps for me with all settings maxed, however Ambient Occlusion had to be disabled because it caused a flickering issue.

Gameplay is great. A hybrid mix of Nioh's counter and equipment system and Sekiro's combat system. Storywise, Three Kingdoms is always a great backdrop, but it got the full Nioh treatment. 

Burst counter from Nioh 2 returns, and Divine beasts are reminiscent of Living Weapons mixed with Soul Cores. Game is quite fun. The equipment system isn't as robust, neither is the wizardry compared to Onmyo and stances, but it still holds pretty well. 

Performance is fine. I'm playing on a 3070 laptop with no stutters or issues on 1440p. Update your drivers. I played Nioh 1 on KB/M and switched to a controller instead for Nioh 2 and this, so the whiners for that can also SMD.

It's a a great Nioh successor that goes its own route, with tight and swift combat that rewards quick reflexes, a much improved magic system from Nioh, and an amazing Divine Beast mechanic that makes the choice feel meaningful and cool. I played with the Chinese audio and English subs for the immersive experience, and I think the Chinese VA's have done an amazing job. 

The loot system is also much improved, with fewer rarity tiers but vaster choices within that tier, with randomized weapon arts that make each one feel unique. Each weapon type has distinctive play styles and flows, and the animations are gorgeous. They even nailed the classic wobble on the spear! Each piece of gear looks beautiful and is a joy to use. 

The stat being built out of the Five Phases is both unique and entertaining, and the spells all feel much more distinctive from each other, unlike Nioh. The game rewards you for both interweaving spells into combat, as well as learning enemy weaknesses. There is also a mechanic in which each element can ""counter"" another, which results in an enemy being depowered. 

All in all its a worthy Nioh successor and I am excited to finish the game, and eagerly await DLC!!!",1677912082,1677912082,True,1,0,0.514563083648681641,0,True,False,False

To get performance out of the way, it could be better, but if you're gaming on controller and at 1080p 60fps (like me), you're going to have a good experience about 98% of the time. I'm on i7-10700k, GTX 1080 with 16GB RAM. Steady 60fps with very rare frame drops. Set volume clouds to low, set ambient occlusion to off (to fix flickering). I have all other settings on max. There is one early boss with a lot of hair which was rough on FPS, aside from that it's been nearly flawless.

The gameplay loop is pretty similar to Nioh. You take on story missions and side missions, find loot and level up. There are multiple magic and weapon options to use. Gear drops with random rarity and effects. You will be able to upgrade gear and swap out effects. You can swap gear appearances too.
The level design is large and sprawling. If you prefer a simple point a to b level design, the level design may be frustrating. I like to explore and find treasure, so I'm okay with it.

The combat is inspired by Sekiro, but it's kinda more its own thing to me. Parrying is important, but there are so many combat options that parrying isn't emphasized as much as it is in Sekiro. Combat feels mashing-heavy, and it is technically as there is no stamina system and many enemies can get stunlocked by attacks. However, you can't cancel animations so it's important to sometimes hang back and observe tougher enemies to find your openings. 
You can bring CPU allies which is a mixed thing depending on your preference. They can get in the way, and they get knocked out often, but they're good at taking aggro which helps when you need a breather in combat.

Overall, I'm having a lot of fun with Wo Long. It takes ideas from other similar games but it sort of becomes its own interesting and unique thing, once you get into it. Also, the presentation is very cheesy, don't take it too seriously.",1677911079,1677911079,True,1,1,0,0,True,False,False

First off, I don't know why everyone is supposedly having performance issues, I've played for 10 hours thus far and only crashed twice and have no framerate or stutter problems in the least bit. Sometimes the screen flashes white though for some reason, it's easily ignorable as it's only for like a half-a-second. Unfortunately the only two crashes I've had are at post-boss cinematics that result in me needing to fight the boss again sometime, which can be frustrating.

My largest dislike for this game is how parrying is so much more vital. I've played and beaten all of the Dark Souls Games, Bloodborn, Elden Ring and Nioh 2. Furthermore, I beat both Elden Ring and Dark Souls 1 solo without any summons. However, I've never been one of those parry lord players, I'm a simple sword-and-board player, so if you aren't big on timing, bosses and the unblockables that most enemies spam are going to rock your world... and not in a good way. 
Despite my two crashes, and the struggle to adapt to the games much more fluid, millisecond timing parry system, I'm enjoying it greatly. Though I must admit, when you're fighting a boss and you get like 5 consecutive parries in a row in the span of three seconds because the boss is trying to go ham on you, you feel utterly Bad***... Then you don't get the next parry so you die.

The game is great, while I cant account for performance problems because I don't have them, I can't recommend the game enough.

If you played the demo, you can transfer the saves they say. So you boot up the game, and they asked if you want to transfer, you press yes, it crash..... This is going to be good isn't it.

[h1]DELUXE ED [/h1]
They gate all the artworks & OST behind their app, meaning you can't look or listen outside of opening Wo app. This is a straight up scam imo, any devs who does this does not deserve your money. 

[h1]QoL [/h1]
In Nioh, you can actually see the desired armor on your character before you transmog it, here you get to see a little icon, so stupid. Then after you transmog and realize that it's not the armor you want, you used to be able to transmog immediately to another design, here you have to ""revert"" to original design first, and then you can start your next transmog. 

If you access the lore screen to read about characters, the description is placed in a small square with the words immediately scrolling up without you being able to control them. So you either read them super fast, or you wait till they repeat the scrolling from the bottom, utterly stupid. It wasn't this case in Nioh. 

In Nioh, you can immediately press a button to lock items and select multiple items simultaneously, here you can't. You ca't select multiple items simultaneously, and if you lock, you have to press the item and choose lock options 1 by 1. 

Also, run is stuck on L3, you can't opt to use the usual hold X to run etc. Either you use L#, or you change all other more important button to L3. 

You cannot compare armor/weapon stats side by side like you did in Nioh. All weapons are now grouped together instead of separately, all backwards thinking. 

In Nioh, you can actually use/check item straight away while you are in the temple, or even in the shop. Now you have to go out of the temple/shop to do that.

Summary: Every QoL they have done in Nioh is backwards here. 

[h1]STORY [/h1]
Nioh does not tell it's story very well, but it's very much worse here. They have the bloody 3 Kingdoms story here, a great story in which they can just retell, even with still images, but no, it's all very jumpy with 0 context. You just meet new npc in one mission and they are gone in the next. Even if you know how the story unfolds, you are left wondering what is going on, when did this happened, where is this etc. You have to fill in a huge gap with all your imagination. If this is school, you will get a straight F for this kind of storytelling. 

[h1]CAMERA INTERACTION. [/h1]
Nioh doesn't have cinematic camera when talking to npc, but at least you can control them and you can move your character. Here, you get locked into the most awkward ugly angle, not close, just awakward angle, with your character blocking the npc etc. They just rotate the camera slightly from whichever angle you initiate the dialogue with. The camera is locked, and your character is also locked. Terribly redundant. 

[h1]MAGIC GATING [/h1]
Here you have a morale system, in which you need to kill enemies and put up flags to raise it. Unfortunately, magic is also gated behind it, which means there is a minimum morale required to use magic, so if you want to speed run to the boss without raising flags, you will have tons if not ALL magic unusable. A really stupid system, whoever implemented this should be fired. 

[h1]MOUSE CONTROLS [/h1]
Not much need to be said of what many has mentioned here. It controls like shit when it doesn't in Nioh. Absolute garbage. 

[h1]REDUCTION OF SKILL SETS & EVERYTHING [/h1]
Well.... Nioh has tons of skills you can use, average 10 per weapons, here there's only 2. Of course this isn't nioh, but even the controls have been nerfed badly. While in Nioh you can cancel skills and respond to the situations immediately, giving you control & satisfaction, here you cannot cancel your skills at all, making using it very risky. Not only when you use skills you consume your spirit (stamina), getting hit also consume your spirit, so you are left with 0 spirit and cannot do anything on the next attack...Super dumb. 
In fact some have tested that you actually do more damage just by doing normal light & heavy attacks. 

Everything here is about parrying, your dodge and whatever else is useless if you don't parry. Your spirit unfortunately, recharges very slowly, so if your spirit hit 0 (deflecting, dodging, all action uses spirit) you really cannot do anything but run. Whereas if you can parry, you don't need to do anythign either, just parry and light attack, then enemies' spirit will break, and you deal a big finishing blow. It's less complex than Sekiro where you have 3 types of counter you need to be aware of, here PARRY is god. You can parry everything, even gas, magics & traps.

[h1]PVP [/h1]
So yeah, pvp is busted too, because once you parry opponent is staggered and you get free hits, so why bother attacking? Just bait parry. 

[h1]UI [/h1]
It's crap, you have your health bar following right below you at all times, and it grows, and you can't change it. Who even approves this? 

[h1]PC PERFORMANCE [/h1]
I don't need to elaborate here, what you read on other reviews are mostly true, it's crap. 

[h1]GRAPHICS [/h1]
It's also crap, PS3 quality, modded skyrim looks better than this. 

[h1]CONCLUSION [/h1]
I could list on more but I'll stop my rant here. This game is made by interns and probably have 0 QA. Is it fun? Sure, there's some fun in here, but they actually abandon a great system that they have made in Nioh and produce this jumbled up scrap. 

It tries to be a hybrid of Dark Souls, Nioh, & Sekiro, but performed absolutely worse than ALL of them. This will be my last purchase for TN.

All the downvotes seem to be related to control issues, but, for real, who is actually going to play a dark-souls-like game with a keyboard and mouse?

As for the performance issues, they seem varied based on setup. Personally I've only had minor framedrops in the first minute of entering a new world, and then nothing afterwards. It's not optimal, but it's not game-breaking for me. Also, performance and graphical fidelity are not always connected. It's definitely a bad port, but it's still a fun and challenging game.

The combat is really fluid, reminiscent of Sekiro in my opinion. I will say that it feels to be missing some elements that made previous TEAM Ninja games great, as with Nioh 1 and 2, which had a lot of stuff to do within levels, which in Wo Long is boiled down to simply finding banners to boost your strength within that level, at least for the first two parts, but presumably for the majority (if not all) of the game.

The game is a lot of fun, the implementation of the Spirit Gauge which sort of acts like your Posture in Sekiro and another meter to do special attacks (so the juggle between the two is good fun) adds a lot of variety to the combat.  Speaking of combat, it's fast, fluid, and exhilarating.  Can't wait to get further into the story.  I'm having fun so I guess that's all that matters.

With the first few bosses, you feel like you have options. Your normal attacks do enough damage to feel impactful, you can stagger them with your hits, and the deflect system rewards you for good reactions similarly to how good a parry feels in ye olde Dark Souls. However, it quickly goes downhill. It becomes Sekiro, but worse. Diet Sekiro if you will. Fighting bosses turns from a dramatic tug of war to sitting back, playing defensively, and waiting for the boss's literal posture bar to break so you can do some damage. Does that sound familiar?

If you like that sort of gameplay, this game is probably for you, HOWEVER...

There's also the issue of an absolutely abysmal PC port. Not only does this game barely hit 30 fps on my 3060 with settings tweaked, but there are an abundance of graphical glitches, stutters, and even crashes to make the experience worse.

I generally don't care about graphics myself, and can deal with some crashes.

I couldn't even invade ONCE, the game crashed every time I tried. No wonder I didn't get invaded for 6 hours straight, I'd be shocked if most people even could manage it.

Also most of the negative reviews are because Mouse and Keyboard controls aren't optimal. Not really sure how people are still trying to use M+K on the 20th souls-like game but here we are I guess. If the negative reviews turn you off though it is on Gamepass if you want to try it. 

It's a fun game if you like other Team Ninja games or want something similar to Sekiro but with the RPG elements in tact. The parrying is pretty addictive and weaving in wizardry in your combos can be pretty fun too. It's flashy and hopefully the performance gets improved in patches. (People often forget that Nioh 2 also ran pretty bad at launch. Same goes with the last 3 Fromsoft releases, but people online have an elephants memory when it comes to stuff like that.

Difficulty is all over the place. I must have made at least 30 attempts on the first boss, but then 4 bosses later I haven't struggled at all, often beating every subsequent boss on the first attempt.

Performance is a mixed bag. My 13900K + 4090 system runs [b] significantly [/b] better than my couch gaming setup which uses a 5800X3D + 4090 with the 5800X3D system stuttering a lot.

Can't recommend game for the following reasons:

1. Netcode seems pretty bad. Both my friend and I live near eachother (same city) and have the same highspeed internet.  Despite this, enemies and your partner tend to teleport A LOT. Make combat damn near impossible at times. For a souls like game, you can't have punishing enemies just using instant transmission'ing all over the place and smacking you around!

2. The game can crash out of nowhere and cause you to lose A LOT of progress.  We beat the 2nd Boss and I had to let the dogs out so the game was just in idle (no enemies around, safe area).  When I came back the game was closed completely and my buddy said the game disconnected him when my game crashed. When we logged back in, the level was incomplete (started us back in the beginning) and it was as if we didn't beat the boss at all...

3. Performance is rough.  I set my game to 60 fps at medium settings and I have a 3080TI. The game constantly dips under 30 fps (3400-1440 monitor).

Combat and movement are fast-paced. attacks are spammable but you will be rewarded for knowing what you are doing and punished if you don't. And assuming you can master deflection timing, you can create your own windows of opportunity instead of waiting for the one boss animation that lets you get some hits in.

However, nobody should buy this game without playing the demo first. The demo is the start of the game and I believe progress carries over. That being said some things to keep in mind.

This is a controller game. Not kinda a controller game, not controller preferred, just like Nioh it's clear the devs don't care about mouse and keyboard, that is simply not the game they intended to make. Do not buy if that is a deal breaker.

It is poorly optimized. It runs fine on my system but frame rate will drop super low occasionally. graphic settings tweaks help, but there is no excuse for that on high-end hardware with these graphics.

Glorious souls-like gameplay in ancient China (with Sekiro-style deflecting and combat that rewards aggression like BB). The tedious RNG loot is back from N1+2, but it's *significantly* less oppressive and easier to just ignore if you want.

M+Kb controls are garbage, which is baffling considering Nioh 1+2 apparently had decent M+Kb controls. Optimisation and performance are also extremely dodgy for most people, particularly with Nvidia cards (I've not had any problems beyond the occasional texture flickering personally, and going into Windows settings at System>Display>Graphics Settings and telling Wo Long to specifically target your graphics card can solve a lot of issues). Like all PC performance issues, they seem to effect people to completely arbitrary degrees, but for Wo Long it definitely seems to be more likely to be crap. I highly recommend trying the demo to see for yourself how the game runs on your own set up (and you can transfer your save from the demo into the main game).",1677894914,1677894914,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

When I played the demo I had some FPS issues here and there, but they weren't unmanageable. Other than that, the skybox in the first zone after the tutorial flickered slightly. Playing the full release, surprisingly the performance for me has been much better. I've rarely had any FPS drops, and the skybox in that area wasn't flickering anymore. In its place, various textures began flickering, and at times even the entire screen will flash white. Other skyboxes in a few of the zones were still flickering.

In the demo, I originally wanted to play in Chinese. I'm in China, I want them to speak Chinese. The vast majority of the voice acting in cutscenes did not exist, and even several other sound effects were missing. I had hoped that would just be a demo issue, and that by the time the game released the next week it would be fixed. It wasn't. The problem still persists, and even when switching to Japanese or English, the voices are missing. I've heard other people report this issue differently, some saying that Japanese worked fine for them. Speaking of which, I've heard tons of people were having (in the demo) and are still having (in full release) massive performance issues with stuttering and frame drops. Some of these people have much better PCs than I do, so it isn't a hardware issue.

If this game came out and worked like it was supposed to (textures not flickering, voice-acting playing correctly, optimized in any way shape or form to function on PC), this would be a recommendation. As previously stated, the gameplay is good. It's quick, smooth, and a lot more digestible than Nioh 2 from the get-go.

Overall, if you're comfortable with using a keyboard and mouse to play games, the controls in Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty may be a big issue for you.

Gameplay is nice. 
Combat is a combo of nioh and sekiro. You can deflect attacks with good timing, and it's as satisfying as ever to hear the clash of steel again and again and again as you deflect a combo.

currently there is a demo, try before you buy is alsmost strange to see these days. 

Morale system makes sense so far. Discourages skipping too much and limits when you can use your spells.

Bad stuff:
PC port is awful. Cranked everything to high and anything further than maybe 5meters away is still blurry. Tried on RX 6600 xt and had to ""prioritize fps"" for decent fps. That would have been ok, if the game was better looking. Lets just say it LOOKS like something a 6600 xt should have no problems with...

some of the bosses seem a bit too easy. I've played a lot of soulslike games, and I NEVER oneshot a boss I haven't seen before, but here I've done it twice. Perhaps it has something to do with the morale system. Maybe high morale makes fights too easy.

Heard the mouse and keyboard support is bad. Haven't tried it, part of me still thinks it's a joke that anyone would torment themselves with that in a game like this. That said, if you port a game to pc, you really should expect KB+M players and be ready to accommodate them.

At times the animations look like something from a much older game.

Spend about 5-10 minutes changing some key binds and you'll have a properly working game. 

Haven't had much graphic issues, the game stays steady around 90fps. Most of the graphic settings can stay on low imo, I didn't notice much graphic difference high vs low, but I did lose fps the more I turned on high. In the end, the only settings I have on high are ""texture quality"" and ""shadow quality"", the rest are low or off and it looks practically the same as if all of them were on. The only other setting recommendation I would make is changing the graphics mode to ""prioritize FPS"".

All that aside, the game itself is solid. Slightly less difficult than a typical souls game, but still has that challenge to knock you on your a** more than enough times. The story and cut scenes are well done, and who doesn't like Samurai themed game play. It shouldn't be on the player to have to make so many adjustments to have a stable game for MnK, but if you're willing to sacrifice 20 minutes worth of misery to fine tune the settings, there's something very playable underneath.

Requested a refund and came back to the Page in the Store to see Peoples reactions to that game and I'm pleased to see that a lot of people seem to agree with me, that this game is just BAD.

The developer tried to Stuff Sekrio and Elden Rind together in the most horrific way possible. The damage that Mobs and Bosses deal to the player is insanely high, meanwhile the core mechanic of the game revolves around a deflect mechanic with a tight window. So you have to take risks but the smallest mistake results in a one shot or so much damage to the player that it is nearly impossible to recover. You don´t have a safety net like the resurrection in Sekrio and its far more punishing to fuck up the deflects. 

Overall the game doesn´t feel polished, i´ve encountered a few graphical issues and fps problems along the way, but those have not been that major. I cant speek for the whole game but the first few Areas looked quite ugly, despite the game having decent graphics. Everything just looked extremely muddy. 

The last MAJOR point are the controls. It´s insane to me that the game shipped in that state. You can barely adjust any of the controls. DEFLECT and DODGE are on the same button [B on an xbox controller] which feels super awkward. It happened quite often that i tried to dodge but instead i deflected and vise versa. I baffles me that you dont have the option to map this key function to another button, like the block button for example, like in Sekrio..

Reading through reviews of this game, I was hesitant to purchase but pulled the trigger anyways. I am glad that I did. Plays like a mashup of the Ninja Gaiden series evolved with some of the Nioh mechanics. The story is what it is so far, but the gameplay is great as is the performance. I think everyone complaining about the performance of the game is trying to play it with a potato. ""Let's complain about a game that was made in 2023 while trying to play max settings with a computer built in 2015 that was midrange then.""

Overall it is a recommend, but do not expect a GOTY contender here.

Comments on this are enabled and i will edit this if i run into problems later on. PC specs: Ryzen 9 5900x, Radeon RX 6900 XT, SSD, Ultra-Wide 144 monitor.
I really do not see why people are upset. All this talk of the keyboard and mouse inputs being strange is wacky. Here's a thought, bind your controls to different buttons, I've had to do this with all souls games, DS1 ,2 ,3 , Elden Ring, Sekiro, and nioh 1 + 2 as well, and ive never played a game on pc where i haven't had to do that. As for performance, like every game for pc you should be editing your settings, when i booted the game everything was on low, so i changed them to compliment my hardware, again something I've had to do for every pc game. Game looks better than nioh 2, and i have literally no problems with this game's performance. No tearing, lag, frame drops, or anything else. I could see people with older hardware having a tough time, but anyone with a 30 series gpu shouldn't be having any problems, and remember that there are so many different hardware pairings developers just can't plan for them all. The controls are a lot easier to use compared to nioh, as there is no stance swapping. The camera is fine, just change the camera's actual sensitivity settings in-game. Great blend of the Sekiro deflect mechanic and nioh feel, but in their own unique way, and the spells are a really great addition to the overall combat and feel of this game.

Don't know about M+K problems and frankly don't care, buy a controller for this type of game. 

Performance is iffy here and there, with weird light glitches on interactables as well as some framedrop which doesn't correlate to the utilities the game is using (I sit around 60-70% of my CPU (11th gen i7) usage and 65-85% of my GPU (2070GTX). 

There's this problem that other people have been addressing where if you set the max FPS above 60 it has a breakdown and the game runs in slow motion, and can confirm this is a big issue. I had a similar problem with Wild Hearts on a more extreme level (it was doing it no matter what max FPS was set to), so I think Team Ninja f***** up their engine sometime recently and are trying to find out just exactly what they did to it, seeing as they never had these issues in their previous games.

I'm playing with a KBM since the game launched and have cleared the 4th main mission. The game is being review bombed for NO GOOD REASON. The port needs some polish yes but it is FAR from being THE WORST port. When it comes to KBM, the mouse camera sensitivity isn't the BEST but it's FULLY FUNCTIONAL. The only time it's actually crap is when you aim your ranged weapon. Other than that, the KBM scheme is actually decent. 

As far as game performance goes, I've listed my PC specs and game settings. There is 0 stuttering 97% of the time. I've clocked in a few hours now and the performance has been consistent. It's running way better than the DEMO as well.

Review bombing needs to stop. The port isn't the best or as good as the Nioh games but it's far from being absolute dogwater. I've also tested this on my second rig with a 1060 GTX and it ran well on similar settings at 720p. Definitely doesn't deserve to sit on Mostly Negative.

I'll alter my review accordingly, should that change.

I expect poor performance and janky controls when games release, because they usually improve as time passes; we live in a time now where this is fairly common practice, but developers have the ability to rectify these issues after their game's initial release, so I'm not super stressed out about these sorts of things.

I followed the advice of others and have it focusing on fps mode and turned cloud down from high to standard.

Moving on, level designs are of nioh (makes sense since it is made by same team) and combat is like nioh with Sekiro parrying mechanics. There are no stances in this one compared to nioh but you can swap to another weapon and has magic element.

Even going as far as dropping all the settings as low as possible on a rig that really shouldn't require it. Yet it did nothing for the stutters, as I simply shook my head and accepted that the settings had nothing to do with it and there is something wrong with the game itself. 

 For those that had a similar train of thought as I did, attempting to just push through the stutters after getting them controllable. Be warned that the game is built around tightly time parries, with bosses taking chip damage from most attacks outside of their stance breaks. These are telegraphed with a red flash along side their animation. Some of these animations trigger the stutter on a regular basis. Making it an exercise in frustration as you attempt to get through a fight, just to be killed by a unfortunately timed stutter getting you plowed by these attacks that can frequently be instantly fatal if you aren't over leveling or building tanky. 

Avoid until the game has been given a significant series of performance patches. At which point it'll likely be on sale due to poor initial release triggering discounts to push sales in a couple months.

These developers have learned nothing from nioh and have literally implemented the controller's deadzones into the mouse input. If you don't move your mouse fast enough, the camera will not react, regardless of your mouse sensitivity. I have never seen any developer do this (for good reason) and if you didn't understand what's going on here you might actually think that your mouse is broken. The game is completely unplayable on mouse and keyboard. The key layout is also an absolute joke. This has to be a bad trolling attempt by the devs. Deflect/Dodge bound to Tab by default? Ok then.
I know this is a wild idea, but maybe a game should properly support the platform's peripherals on which it is released. Otherwise just make the game console exclusive if you can't be bothered to even copy-paste one of the few dozen (good) control schemes that so many other games have already come up with.

Wait at least until this and the performance issues are patched before you consider playing this on PC.

edit: small update - the game also suffers from a severe bug where the game speed is tied to the relation of your current fps vs the max fps you set in the options menu. If you set your max fps to 120 and the game's fps drop to 90 or lower (which will happen quite frequently) the game will now only run at 90/120 = 0.75x speed. This makes the whole experience super inconsistent since every enemies attack timings constantly change depending on how well your game runs. If your PC can keep the game above 60, you should limit the game to 60 in the graphics menu to avoid this and have a consistent experience.",1677832327,1677858492,False,2641,127,0.889147758483886719,0,True,False,False

Before I go further, I'm not sure people new to Souls-adjacent games - particularly newcomers from Elden Ring who are just now starting to look into games like this one and Nioh - will necessarily find games like this to be an easy adjustment. Classic souls combat is focused on positioning and timing, and gives you ample time to consider your approach and how to deal with oncoming threats. The combat here, like Nioh's, is more fast paced and twitch reliant and expects you to leverage multiple systems to burst out tons of damage while avoiding disruption by engaging straight into it. It's a fundamentally different combat system. About the only similarity with Souls games is potentially dying a lot and leveling up at the resting spots which also respawn enemies.

With that out of the way, this game's easy to recommend if you like action rpgs, [i]especially[/i] Bloodborne, Sekiro, and Nioh/2 in particular. There's a distinct blend of all three here.

Nioh's influence is apparent (apart from being made by literally the same developers) in the looter aspect of the game. So there's a decent variety of weapons, gear, and stats to manage. And every piece of gear has different rarities, comes with different passive/active buffs, and can be upgraded. In addition there are spelltrees for earth, fire, wood, metal, and water styles, and spells can be mapped to R2 + any of the face buttons so that four can be active and immediately castable at any time. Plus you can equip an animal summon that can be used as, uh, a summon, OR as a big spellcast. Like Nioh, you can hotswap between two melee weapons and two ranged weapons, which broadens the combo potential considerably.

Bloodborne had a battle system whose core consisted of balancing your healthbar with aggression. Taking hits would leave some amount of steadily depleting recoverable health that you could recover by attacking enemies, and sometimes you'd get special attacks/animations/bonus damage for attacking enemies during certain time windows. Very risk/reward.

Wo Long applies this aspect of Bloodborne to the stamina system, which is called ""spirit"" in this game. both you and enemies have a spirit gage - essentially two gages, the ""negative"" side (which functions as a regular stamina bar), and the positive/excess side. The Bloodborne aspect kicks in when you land hits: landing clean hits replenishes a good amount of stamina while landing hits that are blocked replenishes a very small amount of stamina. Successful parries (more on that later) replenish quite a bit of stamina.

Once you get stamina, or spirit, into the + side of the gage, you power up special attacks and abilities. So if you perform spells or certain attacks/commands while spirit is positive, the excess contributes to bonus damage and effects. There's more to this but it ties into the Sekiro side of things-

The sekiro aspect comes from there being a parry system, but it's different here. In sekiro, the combat relied a lot on perfect blocking (parrying) to stagger opponents and basically perform a one hit kill animation on them. Bosses would have multiple ""lives"" so you'd have to parry them to stagger state multiple times and administer multiple fatalities.

This game has that to an extent, but it's proc'd off dodging. Here, you don't block to parry. You dodge. Dodging [i]into[/i] attacks (or more precisely being in dodge state when an enemy attack connects) is literally how to parry. It doesn't do that much damage, but it significantly boosts your spirit gage while significantly depleting theirs. The further you get your spirit into the + side of the gage, the more performing special attacks depletes enemy spirit gages [i]semi-permanently[/i], making them easier to stagger and pull off big damage. (If they still live after the big stagger state attack, their spirit gage resets to neutral. So bosses don't necessarily have ""multiple"" lives a la Sekiro here, just a big health bar and essentially a dynamic stamina gage that you're wrestling with for the fight.)

There [i]is[/i] blocking in the game, but like Sekiro, you're essentially punished for doing it. Depletes lots of spirit and the recovery frames are worse trying to act out of a block. That said, the game punishes you the most for ""empty"" dodging (dodging without getting a parry out of it) as it uses by far the most stamina and dodging carelessly while engaging multiple enemies can leave you without enough stamina to do anything with.

My favorite thing in the game is parry weapon switching. There's a ""weapon swap attack"" (in addition to just regular weapon swapping), and timing it so that it occurs when an enemy attack connects triggers a parry while swapping to the other weapon.

So it's a very aggressive, combo heavy system. If you liked Nioh's combat, that's the closest in overall feel to this game. But the Bloodborne and Sekiro influences are also pretty apparent.

The story's...... very whatever, and the quality of lore depth and indirect storytelling that the Souls games are known for are completely absent here, lol. But the setpieces and vistas are decent, and the level design is actually pretty good. Good amount of vertically and hidden spots and loot to suss out.

I guess the best way to put it is that Elden Ring gave us the whole experience. If you sucked at the game, you could go explore, read some item descriptions, grind a bit, kind of experience the game ""between the lines"" and it would all be very high quality, enjoyable, and present this deep and interesting cohesive story lurking in the background. 

On the other hand, Wo Long, like Nioh/2 before it, is targeted toward this weird venn diagram intersection of faster-paced action rpg purists who also can't help but get into min-maxing diablo-style randomized gear drops, who could give **** all about why the story necessitates such indulgent, rampant violence in the first place.

Dude, so I just saw in another review that the controller stick deadzone applies to the mouse camera controls? So if you don't move your mouse fast enough the camera doesn't even move? And dodge by default is mapped to Tab and there's no way to map it somewhere else? That's HILARIOUS.

So anyway, the game's good, runs well for me personally, and the kbm situation is funny as hell. If the game sounds up your alley and you're willing to use a controller for it, it's worth a shot.",1677855268,1677855268,True,2,0,0.500495016574859619,0,True,False,False

Combat revolves around your ""Spirit Gauge"", which works kind of like the Posture system in Sekiro, expect it's possible to increase it by landing attacks or parrying. It can also be used to cast spells, or perform special attacks that reduce the size of your opponents spirit gauge.

I played the demo for around 3 hours on Windows, which ran perfectly on my i5 and RX 6800. It looks like the performance issues mostly affect NVIDIA GPUs, so if you're on team red you'll probably be fine.

It's a pretty good game so far. I tried the demo and while my progress carried over, the achievements didn't pop, so I started over and replayed thru the demo section of the game again. I also played it on game pass. Try the demo, I think it's like 15GB or check it out on Game Pass and play as long as you want, but know that progress won't transfer over to Steam if you buy it.

The combat is a lot of fun and I like the dodge being combined with the parry mechanic and being able to do both at once. There's also 5 different Phases that are like the core stats you put points into when you level up. How many points you have (and your Morale level) determines whether you can cast different spells from each Phase. The points you have in each affinity also boost the damage dealt with different types of weapons that themselves are more aligned to certain Phases than others. It's kind of like the Strength, Dex, Int from the Souls games/Elden Ring, but on top of that, the different Phases can cancel others out. Meaning you seem to be able to cast a spell of a type that counters another Phase and potentially cancel out the spell's effect so it doesn't harm you. I wasn't too sure what that tooltip meant and didn't read it all the way before I skipped past it like a doofus.

There's also Martial Arts each weapon can have that's like a special attack you can use plus a Divine Beast ability that can do different things depending on which one you have equipped. They're sort of like the Yokai Abilities from Nioh 2, I think-the Divine Beast abilities, not the Martial Arts. There's still 2 melee weapons you can equip and switch between (hold the same button you would for casting Wizard Spells and press up or down on the d pad if on controller) as well as 2 ranged weapons and several items you can equip to use, although I'v eonly used the regular recharging healing item. Speaking of that thing, you can find other items in the game to increase the charges it has as well as how strong they are-but you can also have them drop from enemies after killing them sometimes. 

Cause this is also a loot game with a bunch of equipment with different stats that you may not bother focusing too much on until later in the game, but will likely allow for some interesting builds much like the Nioh games' equipment and loot system did. There's probably a lot more I'm forgetting and I think I'm only 3 or 4 bosses into the game on my furthest playthrough so far, but I wanted to write this review to encourage people to try out the demo or the game on Game Pass so you can decide for yourself if you wanna get it on Steam or just keep playing it on Game Pass or uninstall the game and move on.",1677850360,1677850360,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I was hoping it would be enjoyable, having loved Nioh 2 and the Three Kingdoms era because of the Dynasty Warriors games, but it's just not what I was expecting. Now I never played Sekiro and am not a parry master even by Dark Souls standards, but sometimes it feels like the parry system was tacked on in exchange, and punishing those that prefer to dodge or block just doesn't seem fair. I know this is done in exchange for a stamina bar, but it hardly feels like it's strategic at all. Maybe I'm just disappointed at the fact that it's not what I had hoped for in a Three Kingdoms souls like, but it just doesn't feel right. The weapon variety also looks a little lackluster as it's for the most part looks like the same weapon in three varieties. Three different sword types, three different polearms, far as I know only two different spears, and two different twin weapons. Magic also feels lackluster and not very well thought out as it's clunky and doesn't feel very effective.

This is just a quick review after playing for 40 Minutes to give a report on the PC port, since some people have started to do an actual review bombing of the game (Meaning that their reviews does not reflect the actual state of the game and are just here to try to bring sales down) The Demo released for the game had horrible performance issues, but most of them are fixed in the finished Game, The game has a Framecap of 120FPS, so sadly no heavenly 144 im afraid. There are some slight Framepacing issues but they arent as bad as they were during the Demo. There are a few Graphical bugs in the game but nothing that hinders the gameplay.

Usually i wouldnt write a review this early or would give a thumps up for a 70€ Game that has technical hiccups, but seeing that it gets an unjustifyingly amount of negative reviews and there is still no option for thumps sideways on steam i give a very slight thumps up, but i recommend anyone who isnt a big Action RPG fan to wait for either a few more patches or for a sale.",1677833267,1677848353,True,2,0,0.518456876277923584,0,True,False,False

Action games like these are always better on a pad, so even if there is M&K support you're just at a huge disadvantage. Seriously, there are 8bitdo controllers that are as good as the official Xbox one and go on sale very regularly. There really is no excuse. 

That aside, I beat the demo and just did the following mission. If you liked the Nioh games (and Stranger of Paradise if you sailed the high seas) this is the next iteration of that game style. Much like how Team Ninja really improved on the combat compared to the Soulsborne series with the first Nioh, this game improves on Sekiro's posture system. Your dodge is tied to the parry, which makes it feel very much like Ninja Gaiden in that regard. The morale system encourages you to play well and there's a variety of weapons and magic to help you on your journey. 

In terms of the story, this game does for the Three Kingdoms era what the Nioh series did for the Sengoku period. If you're a fan of the Warriors/Musou series, you'll see a lot of familiar faces from those games, although done up in Team Ninja's art style and voiced by new actors. It's pretty cool seeing this version of things, as it's more serious compared to the Dynasty Warriors games. 

Performance could be better, but this release is day & date with the console versions, which is different from the Nioh games which had months of time in the oven. This game definitely runs better than Stranger of Paradise did at launch. That game was a horrible abomination of a port (I imagine we have the idiots at Squeenix to thank for that). I do wish there was DLSS or AMD FSR though. The only other con I can think of is the mission structure. To access the side missions, you have to go to one of the Flags and hit travel to a new area. It would have been better if it just put you in a world map menu as previous games did. 

All in all, another great release in Team Ninja's new style of game. I'm curious to see what elements from these games carry over into the new Ninja Gaiden, which was confirmed a while ago. With Rise of the Ronin set for next year though, I don't think a new NG will be coming before 2025. Nevertheless, Team Ninja keeps on surprising me with each new release.

i think the main issue is the k/m issues. this a no go when it comes to games on pc. most people on pc whether people like it or not use k/m and this was a huge mistep in the launch espoecially after many aired their worries during the demo phase, 

if they can manage to get a patch out timely and i mean within 2 to 3 days i think they have a good chance to flip peoples reviews but any longer then that and im afraid the game will remain mixed for a long time to come. 

the weapon variety is cool and the china inspired levels and story are done really well as someone who is a big big fan of wuxia and cultivation manga and light novels. there are a lot of cool nods though i do find it strange they dont use the terminology of ""the dantian"" rather then what they currently use it makes it rather confusing for people like me lol but thats a minor gripe.

im happy that i dont have to spend 3 hours defeating a boss much like with radahn in elden ring so far the bosses i have fought withc are up to part 3 wich is about 5 or 6 levels past the demo are balanced well and given the choice to ignore the follower system wich makes the game drastically easier the game has great show of challenge so far. ill update my review after finishing it at this point.",1677841573,1677841731,True,2,0,0.493398398160934448,0,True,False,False

Now first of all, let me tell you my fellow Nioh-fan brethren: This game, Nioh 3 is not. It's like Sekiro with a more agressive playstyle. It's good, flashy and the controls are tighter than my non-existent girfriend. It is hard and kinda unique and while it's nothing like Nioh, it HAS some elements of it. The superb character creator is in this game too, so are the spell, skill and gear system. Also the game's vibe is a lot like Nioh. 

Now before you press that ""add to cart"" button, DOWNLOAD THE DEMO and try it yourself. Right now, the game has some major issues, mainly with the performance of the pc version. I won't sugarcoat it: The port is dogsh*t. Flickering,  framerate issues, mouse and keyboard binding is crap. Some players actually report better performance on the full version, than what they got while playing the demo, In my case the performance is the same. It runs like a granny in a wheelchair. It doesn't matter what settings i use, i get the same barely playable dookie fps.

If you aren't sure, don't buy this right now. It's 70 bucks and honestly you'd be treated like a third class turd because you want it on pc. There is nothing wrong wanting at LEAST a SIMILAR experience on pc when you're expected to pay the same amount as our console bros. Get something else while they fix this absolute sh*tfest of a port.

I play on KBnM and have turned the mouse sensitivity to maximum, yes it is a bit spotty when aiming a ranged weapon, but I have no issues with moving the camera. On my 3060Ti with Ryzen 9 5900X I have 0 stutters or frame drops and the game runs very smoothly for me. I hope to see some challenge arenas or something like Nioh 2 had to keep going but NG+ will work for now. I have not beaten the game yet but the combat is fun and there is a fair bit of challenge (depending on the player) to be had.

If you happen to have a controller laying around and don't mind using one then do so as it will improve the experience a bit and the devs do need to fix the sensitivity issue but it is tolerable. However that being said, if you wish to use KBnM and you really enjoy this kind of game or KT and TN games in general then it will be worth pushing through it. This is just my opinion however as I personally do not find it a bother. 

The Story: 
Yeah its a little lackluster in terms of characters not making a super memorable impact, but the lore and story are quite interesting to me. I find myself only forgetting characters because I get very caught up in the combat but that is the main drive of this game for me anyways. Story could use some better delivery.

Overall: 
The game is solid and quite fun to play, even with friends. It has PvP and Co-Op for you to enjoy should you choose to do so. Combat is fluid and fun once you get the hang of it and the many different weapon combos are quite fun to try out. Armor pieces and equipment however seem to have not much use for your character if you have the pre order gear as without min maxing nothing tops the stats of the pre order gear so far that I have picked up, but such is the case with most KT and TN games.

From what I have seen this will really boil down to whether or not you mind using a controller or not, based on the MANY arguments I have seen about it.

I'll edit my review once the devs have optimized the camera controls.",1677829052,1677829052,False,259,32,0.645761251449584961,0,True,False,False

Also I'm only at the prologue but already know what Team Ninja is trying to deliver. Will play further an hope everything goes well. Nevertheless, I write this to also addressing the issue of game stuck at loading screen (loading logo appeared and game stops.) during the demo and also the main game.
Sorry as I only can provide the steps on Nvidia. Open Nvidia control panel --> Manage 3D settings--> Global settings --> Power management mode --> Prefer maximum performance
And on the Program settings add Wo Long, then Texture filtering - Quality --> High performance
Also on my PC I took extra steps. Open settings --> Gaming (Xbox game bar) --> Graphic settings (top right on your screen) --> Reduce latency and improve performance --> On --> restart your PC

I'm on Win 10, potato PC with i5-7400 CPU @ 3.00GHz, 8gb RAM, GTX 1060 6gb. And so far game runs smooth. Might reduce graphics quality in game later.
