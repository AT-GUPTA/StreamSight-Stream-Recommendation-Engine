[h1]Controls[/h1]
The game controls terribly: having to hold multiple buttons for (6 different) special attacks is clunky as hell, a remnant from it's origins as a console game with their controllers - hard to believe that this is the same developers that eventually made MHW's combat controls. 

Targetting ranged attacks feel clunky as hell, with the aimlock being finicky in deciding what your camera's pointing at.


[h1]Game design[/h1]
Having  played a warrior in the prologue, and felt underwhelmed with the anemic combat consisting of randomly swinging your sword at the enemy, I made the mistake of trying the mage, which is even more boring, consisting of keeping your distance from enemies and waiting for bars to fill up. You can't respec your character class until you reach some city ahead in game, which means that I was stuck with the class I chosen for the early game.

Being able to choose 3 skills for your primary and secondary weapons each is interesting in theory, but the game doesn't implement it well in game - from overwhelming you in the prologue when you're figuring out controls and whatnot... boring you in the actual start when you have very limited skills... and then when you learn skills you need to travel to one specific npc, and spend limited discipline points to obtain a skill based on text description alone, because being able to test out skills or have a video of that skill before purchasing them is too much to ask.

Climbing onto monsters isn't well developed, which isn't surprising  when it's never good in any Monster Hunter games either.

The party/pawn system isn't particularly great, to have a full party you need to adopt other players pawns, which may be unoptimized in skills and equipments, or just underleveled because they stagnate in levels (so you have to hassle with removing them [I initially thought I have to clear out their inventories first...] and recruiting new ones) - or you have access to a pawn with lvl ∞, trivializing the  game entirely.

The inventory is a hassle at best, with individual members having an individual inventory rather than simplifying it into a unified one,  especially considering that it is a single player game and there's no reason to have multiple inventories.

Crafting seems to be tacked on and unintuitive as hell, having to find specific items you want to craft requiring you to navigate through the hellscape that is the inventory screen and browse through multiple indistinct plants or rocks. Also the game doesn't tell you that items degrade over time, and you need to put them into inn storages - to which, why doesn't the game just do that automatically?

Quests seems pretty janky, at some point the game tells me that there's a quest NPC at the starting village pier - and no one is there; the game wants me to talk to Heraldo, who isn't marked on the map or in his shop; the game wants me to the witchwood, which the map markers & companion voiceover seems to indicate to be somewhere outside your starting village, when it is beyond the encampment.

Exploration is likely to give you motion sickness, the game's world is filled with pointless dead-ends to explore and doesn't seem to be designed with gameplay in mind. The character's ability to jump is so bad that it's more likely to kill them by fall damage (proc-ing a reset from last save) rather than getting across small gaps.",1708882992,1708882992,False,0,1,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

Climbing monsters is cool too, finding the weak spot, this is something that i would like Elden Ring for example to have.
The world is well built, if we compare to Elden Ring, i think Dragons Dogma still has to improve some aspects of his world.

Dragon's Dogma is a flawed masterpiece, a game that was stuck in development hell and quite infamously had 60% of it's content cut, despite all this Dragon's Dogma still holds up as a fantastic game with some of the best combat in an action-rpg.

Dragons dogma is one of those games that has an intriguing sense of mystery, especially when you consider what was planned for this game. I find myself thinking of shadow of the colossus when I play this not only because we have a fairly small word with not much going on but looking at all the plans this game had and what could have been. I'm grateful that capcom have given this franchise a second chance as the game has so much potential. 

Before we get into why this game is such a cult classic we need to address some of the weaker aspects of this game, again this is mostly as a result of the game being cut down but it doesn't stop the final product from feeling imperfect in some aspects. 

My least favourite part of the whole game is 90% of the plot, it starts with a basic fantasy troupe, you have to fight a dragon that's attacked your city. The game has some really interesting ideas especially right at the end of the game but the vast majority of it is spent running pointless fetch quests which are literally given to you to waste your time, seriously. The Duke doesn't want to fight the dragon and whilst the reasons behind this are actually really interesting it doesn't stop basically all of the main story just being terrible. 

There is also some really underbaked ideas which I won't go into here but feel they need to be listed - 

the openworld is very small and isn't that interesting to explore as all enemy spawns are static, they do change at certain points in the story but that's about it and locations are reused often (and some are just not used at all.) 

Romance, BG3 this isn't. 9/10 players first playthrough will end up with you and some old, bald guy getting it on and you'll have no idea why.

Vocations (think classes.) whilst an incredible addition to the game and one of it's selling points, they are massively unbalanced. Thank god the warrior class is getting fixed in DD2.

However, if you look past all that then what you'll find is a deeply rewarding game with some of the finest action combat in an rpg, the vocation system has such flexibility and diversity that it makes it so incredibly exciting to experiment.

Monster design takes inspiration from all over the place from simple goblins to cyclops to chimeras, you can climb on creatures shadow of the colossus style and stab them in weak spots, seriously amazing stuff. 

Endgame is when this game really shines, it's hard to talk about this without spoiling the best part of the game but it gets deep and rewarding and almost enters the diablo genre without being too much like nioh 2. Also the DLC is fantastic for keeping up replayability with much more gear to grind and fantastic bosses to fight. 

No fast travel in the conventional sense, you put down your own waypoints which are consumable and use consumable items to initiate the fast travel, starfield this ain't, if you haven't planned your routes you will be walking a lot and it's glorious. 

The pawn system is a fantastic idea that bucks the traditional jrpg troupe of a party, whilst the lore surrounding them is odd at best the execution is phenomenal, having your own custom chracters running about whilst also recruiting other players pawns online is so cool.

All in all I really love this game, it's flawed and unfinished but the ideas at play are very unique even if they are borrowed from other games of the same genre. Playing this game evokes the same feelings I had when I played morrowind, shadow of the colossus, dark souls 2 and the endgame nioh 2. This game reminds of all these games whilst still being fresh and unique. 

This game is normally less than £5 and is at the very least a curious experiment from a Japanese developer tackling a western rpg, sure it is ripe with blemishes but if you can move past that you will find a deeply flawed gem that deserves more exposure. 

I really hope we go to the moon in DD2.

What is it, what exactly is the big deal with this unfinished, amalgamation of cancelled Capcom elements that at the very least is- actually fun?  I wish I could tell you.  I've never beaten the main story.  Not once.  Oh sure, I've beaten the big bad dragon in the most scripted and boring boss fight compared to all of the other boss fights in the game (namely all of the other Dragon fights), but have I ever ""beaten"" Dragon's Dogma?  Nope.  Sorry, can't vouch for that myself.  Its honestly because.. not unlike Diablo II from 20 years ago, pretty much the same crap with swapped enemy color pallets after that third act.  

You see, what Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen does to pad out the original story line is by literally filling the world with a dark green smoky sky box, making some of the enemies tougher, placing a new infinite dungeon in the game, and then allowing you to fight GOD after you're done with your adventures on earth.  Is it effective as a narrative driven single-player (mostly) Action RPG?  No.  No I don't think it is.  Dragon's Dogma has no story, no meaningful characters, no NPC's of any value and is an extremely hollow experience from the first hour on.  That isn't to say its terrible by any means, its just not the focus of the game.  Its more about the actual fights, vocations, party forming with ""pawns"" (struggling to watch them accomplish anything on their own) and essentially just farming for items or experience.  That's literally it.  Sure the spells look cool, and the Assassin vocation is great fun, but that's pretty much it.

People love to make Dragon's Dogma look like the coolest thing ever with various clips of people one hit K.O.'ing Gryphons, destroying dragons, or casting giant spells on Bitterblack Isle boss fights, but in all actuality- they are super high level characters obliterating stuff because that's what the ""experience"" becomes no matter what.  Dragon's Dogma is extraordinarily broken and can be cheesed immensely with all sorts of LAME exploits as well as items.  You can literally get end-game equipment in Bitterblack isle right at the beginning of the FREAKING GAME.  Its that ridiculous.  With enough patience and health items you can tear right through the expansion content- grabbing extremely good items if you're fast enough.  

Personally, that is hilarious to me, given how much freedom that people ""believe"" that the game was somehow designed to allow (and totally not just a failure of a rushed project that was obviously cut-down by Capcom last minute) is comical to me.  Heck, its part of the reason I have as many hours as I do.  Its a very fun game to run around in and break stuff, or find interesting items or challenge yourself early on with certain fights, or find exploits, or level up with a different vocation.. its a lot of customization and freedom that many Action RPG's don't actually have (though they like to pretend they do).

The actual map isn't very big.  Gransys feels more like the first ""Dark Souls"" in a lot of respects because you'll constantly find loads of shortcuts here or there to reduce travel time.  OF COURSE the most influential item added to the PC port is that eternal ferrystone, which when combined with the portcrystals allows you to basically travel everywhere (that matters) in an instant, and thank god for that or else mid-game would be unbelievably dull.  I still wish it just allowed quick traveling anyway, since this gameplay ""feature"" allows you instantly complete escort quests anyway.

So lets talk about those escort quests.  You can tell a lot from the state of the final product with how many of those actually work and behave.  They are basically endlessly recycled, which is fine, but not interesting when they're instantly completed by warping there.  However, there are a few ""story"" related escorts that literally SUCK and waste your time for a paltry reward.  Why?  I have no clue as to why these are even in the game, its totally pointless.  A lot of quests are utterly vacuous and some are just go to point A on map and kill Monster ""Z"" for reward.  Its really unfortunate that this was the system leftover and was CLEARLY cut-down or altered from its original concept.

The other problem I honestly think will turn off a lot of people is just the actual plot, cutscenes, terrible spoken dialogue that often doesn't even make sense within the context of what is happening, or the atrocious attempts at drama throughout.  Sure, there are some special NPC's that have a little bit more of an interaction or maybe some extra quest lines, but a lot of them also have like ONE or two and then vanish completely forever.  Its very odd.  You actually save the *beep boop generic love interest* at some point in the early-game and then she just disappears essentially unless she is your beloved, which means she'll maybe show back up again.  The entire ""beloved"" system is also hilarious, allowing some pretty gross NPC's to be present when you face off the big bad dragon.


All in all, it was a fun and entertaining combat system that always kept me coming back.  To this day I think it has one of the better Action RPG combat systems around, its a shame the rest of the title was clearly under-cooked.",1614023589,1708838771,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I played on Xbox a few years back, so probably at least double the hours when considering what I've got to say. If you want a ""quick"" game to play through, I'd say give it a shot! However, if you are looking for new to you RPG, maybe wait until Dragons Dogma 2 releases and start there. Game here is a little old, but I'd still call it gold.

   You get to craft two characters, your player character and your main pawn (more on that later). Character creation actually makes some differences. Like gender causes certain encounters to go certain ways. You have base stats determined by height, weight and length of extremities. That's more of something to keep in mind when you're trying to optimize stuff perfectly, but you really don't have to worry with it. It's totally reasonable just make your people look nice to look at (or as goofy as you can get) as you will be see them in 3rd person for the whole game. Personally, I still get a good laugh seeing Terry Crew run around and smack stuff around as my main pawn. 
   Its got a good feel to all the vocations (classes). You wanna be big 2 hander gal/guy? Go Warrior. Maybe do some powerful spell casting? Go Sorcerer! Maybe you wanna cast spells, but be a little dexterous with a a few movement options (gotta use the daggers to roll and double jump mind you) try out the Magick Archer! These are just 3 of the 9 vocations you get access to. You get a lot of options for you and your pawn in combat and it's one of my more enjoyed experiences in combat. It's not souls combat, but its still very fun and I would call it engaging. Not only can you just smack around your enemies, but you can grapple little ones and climb large foes!
   While it is a single player experience, something pretty neat is that you can hire other players pawns into your party to a grand total of 4 members including yourself. However, if your friends own the game, no matter the level difference, you can summon them into your party for free. So, if you too want Terry to run around with you, add me when you play the game and get him!
   Game has some good replay-ability to it and has near seamless transition into your next run besides the fact of being popped back out to the main menu after completion of the final quest. Story is easy to follow and is pretty short, but there a lot to the game that you miss out on if you just B line through it. Some decisions give access to other quests while shutting you out from others. There is a lot you can miss out on for not exploring and decisions you make, so that second or nth run isn't too far fetched.
   With all this said, its from a few years back. Graphics are gonna be better with the newer release, Dragons Dogma 2, in March. From what I understand about it, DD2 is going to be basically DD:DA but the way they intended it to be. More vocations, more questing to be done, more graphical quality. Over all, more game. At the price point of about 30$ compared to the 70$ DD2 going to be for probably a while though, it might be a good idea to pick it up and just try it out to see if you interested in dropping that full 70$.

   If you read this far, get it. You're clearly interested since you just sat through all my ramblings. Play this until DD2 releases and goes on sale at some point wouldn't be a bad idea. Waiting for DD2 is also probably a good idea if you don't wanna throw all your money to Steam or whatever key broker you go through.

I liked how you could change classes whenever you wanted. The pawn system was soooo good, the beginning was a great way to show how they worked and it felt so satisfactory to have useful pawns instead of glitchy, useless companions like other games. The pawn system would also allow others to use your pawn so it made me focus on getting good gear for her and to dedicate time to make sure they were fit for others.

The story is actually not a highlight for me, I wasn't a huge fan of it. I loved the ending but throughout the entire game, most quests were forgettable and some were glossed over with no effect to the game.  I also accidentally locked myself out of other quests since I would progress or not find areas with quests until later. The characters within the game were good, a few really shined though. [spoiler] I wish that the game would have explained the ""Beloved"" thing more, I gave Julien so many gifts but because I did the quest with the queen, I was locked with her which was not what I wanted.

Tak, ale tylko jak bardzo lubisz action RPGi. Jest w tej grze tak dużo dziwactw i tak dużo durnych mechanizmów*, że naprawdę trzeba mocno przymykać oko. Ja przebrnąłem przez tę grę, 2 razy przeszedłem post-game, 2 razy przeszedłem DLC (50h podstawki + 50h wszystkich rzeczy po grze), ale wybaczyłem tej grze te wszystkie bzdury tylko dlatego, że ta gra ma 12 lat i dlatego, że zamierzam grać w DD2 i DD1 było przystawką. 

*1. Bossowie/mini-bossowie z miliardem hp, będący gąbkami na DMG (prisoner gorecyclops, daimon2), niektórych bosów przez godzinę tłuczesz po kostkach (nie przesadzam, naprawdę godzinę), bossowie są według mnie źle skonstruowani, każdy z nich powinien być ciekawszy, mieć ciekawszy moveset i mniej hp. Nie mówię, że każda gra ma być Dark Soulsem, ale uważam, że bossowie będący ZEROWYM wyzwaniem i jedynym wyzwaniem przy nich jest czas potrzebny na ubicie - to (WEDŁUG MNIE) zła konstrukcja i niestety wiem, że to będzie znowu w DD2, bo oni uważają. że to jest spoko, a nie jest.
2. Do gry wgrałem z 10 modów, żeby poprawić przeróżne bardzo podstawowe pierdoły (żeby nie oślepiały czary, żeby armor/ubranie miało rozróżnienie w ekwipunku, żeby niektóre czary były trochę bardziej przydatne itd.) - oczywiście można grać w vanillę. ale nie polecam tego, szkoda się męczyć z niektórymi rzeczami. Czy to, że zdecydowałem się wgrać mody to na pewno minus dla tej gry? Tak, bo mieli bardzo dużo czasu (dodatek do gry, 12 lat?) żęby poprawić te pierdoły, a tego nie zrobili.
3. System pawnów (wpierających NPCów AI) - no zabijcie mnie, ale nie cierpię tego, wiem, że jest to podstawa tej gry i jest znak rozpoznawczy, ale nie cierpię tego i w DD2 będę grał solo. Wiem, że gra będzie 4 razy trudniejsza, ale chcę spróbować. Pawny w DD1 były głupie, ginęły w durny sposób, nie chciały używać dawanych im przedmiotów, dawały minimalny dmg - zero przydatności.
4. Questy i części gry, które można zepsuć przez naturalną progresję gry. Staram sięgrać w gry na ślepo a nie z wiki na kolanach, więc takie rzeczy mnie wkur*iają i jak ominiesz jakiegoś questa (który ma follow up i później daje niesamowicie ważny przedmiot) i czytasz później na reddicie, że ""w NG+ to zrobisz"" to szlag człowieka trafia. 
5. System save'ów, czyli najgłupszy system save'ów jaki widziałem kiedykolwiek w grach, naprawdę. W grze jest autosave i 1 slot save'a, więc zero marginesu na błąd, a jak wczytujesz grę, bo coś zepsułeś (sytuacja z mojej gry, jestem na bazarze i misskliknąłem - zamiast zamknąć dialog walnąłem sklepikarza, więc podbiegł do mnie strażnik i wsadził mnie do więzienia, wczytałem grę i miałem checkpointa jakieś pół godziny wcześniej) to cofa cię do ostatniego checkpointa, a nie do ostatniego save'a, więc tracisz X gry. No naprawdę, czegoś durniejszego w życiu nie widziałem. Wgrałem moda, żeby to naprawić, mod i tak nie naprawia tego w 100%, a daje tylko możliwość quicksave'a, dalej trzeba uważać z loadami.",1708729277,1708729277,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I couldn't stop playing it despite having so many issues with it. It is a game that is a jack of all trades, and master of none.

Dragon's Dogma's gameplay isn't good. Climbing on enemies and targeting weak points is a novel concept, but in practice it becomes taxing when you've done the same methods time after time. Playing a Fighter or Warrior in this game is just utter garbage because there's no dodge roll for those Vocations, and there's no lock-on either. Without a disengage ability for those Vocations, the player has to just turn and run to disengage, and without a lock-on using a Shield is utterly janky. 

Dragon's Dogma has a story that is dull and uninteresting, unfortunately. I think many of the quests are fun gameplay-wise, but they're not written well. It just feels like I'm doing things to do them. The Duke's actions in particular are nonsensical, and other questlines feel unfinished, such as Alienore's, which punishes the player for something and doesn't have any repercussions afterwards, with nobody mentioning it.

The Pawn system is the game's iconic mechanic, and it's awesome on paper, creating a custom companion. However, beyond your custom Pawn, the other two Pawns you recruit don't upgrade in level and can't be equipped with better gear. So you end up having to constantly cycle out your other two Pawns with Pawns you find wandering around, because those Pawns capped out in level.

Dragon's Dogma just frustrates me because it has so much potential but the design decisions and flaws really hold it back from true greatness. It's why I'm optimistic for the sequel though.

Its biggest draw is its combat system which blends the dynamic combo potential of Devil May Cry, the weight and variability of FromSoft titles and party management similar to Dragon Age (though you won't get to know your traveling companions as intimately as there). 

There are 9 vocations/classes to choose from and for the most part they play quite differently although there is some overlap between classes which share some weapon types, but most skills are vocation specific rather than weapon specific anyway. They are divided into 3 basic archetypes and colors, red being straightforward tanky melee fighters who can restrain most stunned foes so that their allies can whale on them, yellow being highly mobile units using daggers and a bow variation and able to roll and double jump at no stamina cost (although both abilities must first be learned), and blue being magick classes which tend to be able to rack up monstrous damage easier than the others but have more trouble fighting off enemies alone since their basic attacks are mostly weak and many spells take a little while to cast during which period the caster must stay still or can move only very slowly. Beyond the basic vocations are the advanced and hybrid ones, the former sacrificing some aspect of the base class in exchange for being able to do something else better, while hybrids combine two colors for a mixed playstyle which makes them all incredibly versatile. The vocations and skills for them can be learned/changed at inns and the entrance of the difficult Bitterblack Isle area which was formerly DLC content and is unaffected by main story progress allowing it to be accessed or ignored at any time, essentially being a separate storyline. One cannot use equipment meant for other vocations (e.g. a mage cannot wear plate armor) and hybrid vocations are unavailable to pawns, limiting them to the basic and advanced ones. The one learnable upgrade all vocations can share are augments, essentially perk points up to 6 of which can be equipped, their usefulness varies but there are many more handy ones than useless ones, though some are so useful that it makes little sense for a particular vocation not to use them (e.g. the Warrior's Clout augment for any melee class which simply gives a huge 20% boost to one's physical strength). Stat growth depends on one's vocation on level up and the max level is 200, stats unfortunately cannot be respecced but beyond wanting one's main pawn to be appealing for others, ultimately one can easily play a mage after exclusively leveling up as a melee vocation as damage depends much more on equipment than a character's stats. 

All vocations are capable of grabbing and throwing (but not grappling) small enough foes and climbing large ones, though climbing isn't equally useful for every playstyle. Unequipping primary weapons lets you fight with your fists, and there's a certain ring that can boost the damage of unarmed attacks which can be useful for staff wielders fighting magickally-resistant foes, but aside from that it's ineffective. Yellow vocations can still roll and double jump while unarmed. There are also one-use items such as throwable knives, bombs and magick tomes which can be used by any class (except special arrows which are limited to non-magickal bow users), but frankly for the most part they're more of a novelty than a valuable tool, mostly because they can't be hotkeyed and weigh/cost a lot in large amounts. There is a way to get strong fast by buying copious amounts of throwblasts due to them being stronger than your regular attacks would be at the beginning but that strategy is not recommended for new players. 

The enemy types are diverse and fight in different ways so different enemy types never feel alike unlike, for example, the flying bosses in Witcher 3. The music in this game is notable in that outside battle tracks it tends to play at the moment one enters a new area or during/after a cutscene, after which it doesn't change or loop but fades into silence, but the ambient sounds of any area keep the silence from becoming an uncomfortable one. Any visual aspect of the Arisen and their main pawn can be completely changed by buying a certain endgame item, before then the changes are more limited as one can modify their haircut, makeup, voice and hair, eye and skin color at a barber in the capital or buy a one-use item from the same merchant who sells permanent access to the editor which lets one make a total makeover but disappears and won't be restocked afterwards. The height of a character affects things such as the size of their hitbox and melee reach while their weight affects stamina regeneration and carrying capacity (something which cannot change otherwise outside of a specific augment and certain Bitterblack equipment). Additionally, the torso type of a character is the only thing that affects their sprinting speed, though while this is a useful tidbit to know, in-game it doesn't make that much of a difference that one should sacrifice the way they would like their character to look for it. There are certain tiers of encumbrance and the higher ones are undesirable because they increasingly reduce all movement speed and increase stamina consumption. The personality and to a certain degree the fighting priorities of one's main pawn can also be changed by sitting down on a chair at an inn. There's a minor romance system but it's infamously hard to predict and can sometimes result in comical pairings due to the strange way the game determines one's beloved, that being the person with the highest affinity towards the player they talked to last before completing a certain main quest. All but a handful of NPCs can be your beloved (in short, other Arisens and most pawns). This is unavoidable but has no bearing on the gameplay and is much more of an afterthought than an important mechanic.",1708639193,1708640749,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

By the time the credits rolled I realized I enjoyed the game, not because of the story or the characters, which doesn't make sense in any world, but I did enjoy the gameplay aspects of it. I played as a Warrior vocation and found the combat satisfying and fun, you can feel he weight of the heavy warhammer as you swing around you, toppling foes. 

The game is not intuitive at all as it doesn't explain a lot of systems. I loved the simulated aspects of the game with many npcs having their own schedules as they move around the map. However, it also created some frustrations like not being able to find an npc for the quest at hand because they moved elsewhere at the time at day. 

The game also does a terrible job by not telling you the recommend level for quests. I tried to play safe and even then I came across random enemies on the road which one shot me and took so many hits. Fortunately it was only a problem early in the game, but led to a lot of frustrations.

Finally, the game's fast traveling system is intriguing. You cannot simply fast travel wherever you like in the game unless you out down some beacons, which you have in limited quantity. The problem is a lot of times you are asked to return back to an area you already completed, so if you don't have a beacon anywhere near the area, expect a very long hike with enemies respawning along the path. My advice is to spread out the beacons to cover as much of the map as possible.

The game gave me a lot of Elder Scrolls Oblivion vibes with intriguing world with jankness to the systems. I appreciate it for what it is.

DD:DA has a good story with awesome action sequences. The storytelling is pretty straightforward and simple, but once you played it and saw through the end ([i]Multiple[/i]), you'll realize that it is deeper and well thought. It is by no means one of the greatest but still good.

Graphics is debatable if the game is good. But for me, it is dated. I used mods (ENBs and Hi-Res Textures) to enhance the experience, and Nvidia's built in Game Filter Feature to tweak the game's color and sharpness. As of the time of this writing, my mods still work.

Gameplay is really great! The bread and butter of DD:DA is you can mount large monsters and deal damage especially weak spots. But what makes the game unique is its Pawn System. Pawns can learn from you and they can also be used to aid other players.

I finished the game once in normal mode mostly as a melee character with some magic.
Edit: post 100% completion summary in the comment section.

[h1]TL;DR[/h1]
Though this game has massive flaws it also shines with pure brilliance at times. The biggest issue is that it starts very badly and boringly and it's easy to miss important quests that won't be available later on.

I recommend only if you can accept having to play through first 5-10h of slog to get to the mid and lategame where this game really opens up and begins to be very fun.

Grab it on a discount.

[h1]Description[/h1]
If I were to compare this game to another, I would choose Gothic. Dragon's Dogma in many ways is a reverse-Gothic action-RPG experience. Both games share the idea that you can go anywhere from the start. Wanna fight a cyclops on lvl1? Go for it, see how long you last. Wanna try your shot with a dragon in first 5h of the game when even a group of mangy wolves pose a threat? Go ahead, just keep a save handy to reload to once you get 1 shot-killed.

However, while Gothic had primitive, clunky combat and focused rather on creating a compelling, natural world filled with dangers and secrets as well as great quest design with fantastic character interactions...
... Dragon's Dogma takes the opposite route and focuses on a fun action combat and character progression, while leaving questing, story and world design as a secondary concern. Many quests are boring fetch or escort quests, most sidequests are legit MMO-style 'kill 50 skeletons'.

So, about that character progression... you can initially pick 1 of 3 classes - a mage, a scout or a fighter. You will then have ability to progress to 6 different advanced classes which either refine certain playstyle of the base classes like a 2h-weapon user Warrior class, or mix classes together like a sword-spell class Mage Knight.

Each class has access to it's own sets of weapons but also many passive and active skills or spells. Seriously, even melee classes have a bunch of attacks and special features. Combat itself is action-based with direct control over your character. You can even jump and climb big monsters, which can be useful to target their weakpoints.

You also have a companion, which you can customize just like your main character and you also hire 2 more companions through game's Pawn system, which lets you rent your companion and hire that of other player's.

The story starts with your fishing village getting attacked by an ancient dragon. You show bravery and fight the creature with nothing but a rusted sword and it apparently impresses the wyrm enough to form some kind of forced pact with you. Dragon steals your heart, turning you into an Arisen - a being capable of commanding Pawns as their personal entourage. The only way to regain your humanity is to find the Dragon and reclaim the heart it stole from you.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[b]+ Combat[/b]
Most classes save for a 2h Warrior has a large assortment of skills to use and they are almost always fun to experiment with. Different enemies will be weak to different damage types and react to what you are doing. You can, for example, climb onto a chimera's back to have easy access to it's goat-head, but it will try to bite you with it's snake-tail or shake you off.

[b]+ Big monsters[/b]
Speaking of chimera - it's one of my favorite monsters in this game. It has 3 heads - front of a lion, middle with a goat head sticking off the top of it's body and a tail with a snake head at the end. Each of these heads will attack independently - lion will pounce, bite and claw at you, goat will cast spells and snake will bite and spit poison. Each head is also weak to some damage - snake can be cut off, goat can be killed with physical attacks quick and lion is weak to magic. All of this creates a strong dynamic in a battle. Some classes rely on specific damage types, so you will have to work with your Pawns to succeed.

There are many other big monster types, but most of them are reserved for the DLC (included in PC release).

[b]+ Main story (later on)[/b]
It takes time to get going, but once it does - the story is far deeper than you may initially expect. I especially loved every time the Dragon showed up. His dialogue is unnerving and he is clearly toying with you. He steals the show when it comes to voice acting in the english version too.

Unfortunately you can't switch voices to Japanese without a mod.

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[b]- Running simulator[/b]
The world is big and filled with pretty narrow paths that take a ton of time to travel through to get to each of the points of interest. You will get ability to teleport to the main city for free, but it's not like it's close to everywhere from that place...

Combined with very low weight limit that also makes you slower the closer you get to max AND limited stamina for running - you will fking cry every time you realize you need to spend 20 minutes of walking through monster infested forests to get to a point where you need to talk to someone.

You will gain crystals you can plant into the ground which will create a teleport point. These can be obtained usually at the end of story-important dungeons. Using them requires special stones that are 2k Gold each and limited (although usually they restock in shops every few days or so). In the endgame you will have the money to get as many as you want, but early on? Prepare to run run run everywhere.

This is one of the main reasons people never finish this game - it takes so long to get to the good part AND it requires you to waste time on manual travel.

[b]- Board quests[/b]
All MMO-style quests. Fortunately not needed to finish the game.

[b]- Points of no return[/b]
Some of them are important as they will impact what side NPCs survive and potentially becomes your waifu. There are often difficult to find and will get unavailable if you miss them before progressing through main story.

I recommend using a quest progression guide.

[b]- Waifu[/b]
The game itself chooses an NPC you like the most based on arbitrary stuff. Doing quests for them, giving them gifts and giving them a special-someone ring all contribute to their affinity, but it's quite easy to max out affinity for multiple characters by only doing their quests. If multiple characters are maxed - the game decides who to make into your waifu. WARNING, your waifu may not be female. Yup. Progressive!

I gave ring to my ideal waifu magical girl and still the game matched me with a princess I saved from a tower. BTW it was weird when during the saving animation they threw themselves onto a bed together and the screen faded to black for a moment. Surely there was no time for a hanky-panky when I was supposed to grab her and lead her out of a prison with tons of guards running around, right? Maybe they did a quickie or something. Now that I think about it - that's the only character that sexes you during their quest, no wonder the game was adamant on making her into my wife. Conservative!

[h1]Lowdown[/h1]
I am replaying it in Japanese, maxing out different classes and going through DLC.

I'd give Dragon's Dogma a
[h1]7/10[/h1]
I need to be clear once more - you need to survive first part of the game. And I mean it - survive through it as this game will kill you, make you lose progress (if you forget to save) and make you make your huge hikes again and again.

Once you start being able to survive most wildlife and start building your characters and the story pick up - you will start enjoying it.",1706658644,1708380334,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,4,True,False,False

Don't let my hours fool you, since buying this here in 2012 and not being able to play much due to a potato PC, I've accrued likely hundreds if not thousands of hours across every single release on every console it came out in. I've beat the game so many times, defeated Ur so many times, and learned to min-max and I'm still always finding something new and interesting in the game. Highly recommend it and honestly to me the game doesn't really start until the end but planning ahead and preparing through the story can be taxing since its slow and it seems pointless if you're new to it.

Stay with it, beat it, then beat it again, and again and everything starts to make sense. The game is meant to be played more than once and those missions become super easy and can be completed within seconds once you've learned why some things exist in the game and not explained to you.

Every class I've played as feels incredibly unique and interesting, and their play styles are incredibly different.

DO KNOW that because their play styles are so incredibly extreme some classes might just not feel fun for some people. I usually LOVE playing mages but they really felt painful to use at first playing this game and sometimes you don't get to feel like a part of the action.

I've never played a game where being a mage felt so much like _being a mage_. Spells are impactful and take a ton of commitment, you can literally play a support character for the rest of your NPC party if you want. The upgraded mage class has incredibly powerful spells that take 10-20 seconds to cast and feel like you're actually warping reality: summoning meteor showers, giant spires of ice, etc.

And on the flip side the other classes feel just as unique and incredible, the fighter is pretty quick and agile, with gameplay that emphasizes both his sword and shield, the Mystic Knight is also super unique, able to use both magic and melee together to create this really unique preparation-focused playstyle combined with powerful counterattacks. I haven't even tried the archery-based classes yet and I hear they're incredible.

MY criticism is mostly around things that have been added to make the game easier at the start, Capcom added powerful armor and items sitting in your ""bank"" at the start of the game and in my opinion they just make the beginning less interesting and I chose not to use them for the most part. 

But depending on how you like to play games these boosts could feel like a great addition. Travel can take a _long_ time and fast travel is fairly restricted, but the world is densely populated with enemies, ambushes, bosses, secret areas, shortcuts, and collectables... 

Fast travel is tied to an infinite-use item that you'll be given near the beginning of the game, but in older versions required a consumable (which I personally actually preferred and used through my main playthrough). Even with infinite uses, there are very few permanent fast travel spots and instead you'll have to explore and find these stones you can place in the world to create points for yourself which is a fun bit of meta-strategy.",1708202941,1708301304,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The port to PC made the interface which was already bad in the beginning to the main monster to fight. Actually this gives the game an old-school touch, because obviously there are no interface standards on the pc a porter should adhere to yet in the year 1990 - oh, no, 2016! 
This is a pity, because there are some interesting ideas here, the pawn system, the grapple stuff  (don't try this on your pc, btw) etc. But this doesn't play like a game which is 4 years old, but more like 15 years. Back then it was ok to have empty cities, repetive npcs, a bland story and an idiosyncratic interface as if they are the first to have the idea of an inventory. 
The fighting system is good, but not good enough to make you forget all of the other points. This game is definitely not 81  / 100 but more like 70. 

[Replaying this now, 2024, in expectation of the DD2 I think I didn't do justice to the innovative ideas in DD1. And in the years since 2016 I played so many ports or games which have been designed with consoles in mind first, that I am more used to bad UIs and controls. But it is still a strange mix of good and ugly. And the bugs (after all these years) and the quality of the port makes me sceptical about the PC version of DD2. ]",1483456839,1708254072,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The exploring aspect in this game is fucking 9/10 honestly the way that you have to just walk/run to get to places with no extra horse or teleporting was truly exquisite. I thought it would be horrible but honestly that was one of the best thing about the game, together with combat ofc. It has one of the, if not the best two handed sword gameplay i ever saw in any games and i haven´t tried anything else so i cant tell about the other weapons/vocations.

But for me personally there wasn´t really anything that other then that, which captured my attention. There are very limited armor/weapon sets and what you find on your level 10 has a pretty good chance you will keep it to level 80 if you upgrade it. It really is more like an adventure then RPG game. 
Also the pawn system, although it is interesting, i really could care less about it. You cant really upgrade or level up the pawns you choose, so you have to constantly change them, which in a lot of cases is really good, but like i said it was more an annoyance for me then a good mechanic. 
And im not even gonna talk about the inventory system because, maaan that shit was painful. Every time i looted a group of enemies i had to put the items to some of my pawns inventory cause otherwise i was slow as fudge.

But i would say  7/10 is pretty good score for this game. I recommend it 100% but i dont think its as good as everyone seems to be making it out to be.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen stands as a towering colossus in the realm of role-playing games, weaving a mesmerizing tapestry of adventure, exploration, and combat. The world of Dragon's Dogma is a living, breathing entity, teeming with secrets to uncover and challenges to conquer. From the sprawling plains of Gransys to the foreboding depths of the Bitterblack Isle, every corner of the game world is crafted with meticulous detail, immersing players in a rich tapestry of lore and legend. The atmospheric day-night cycle and dynamic weather systems further enhance the sense of immersion, as players traverse rugged landscapes shrouded in mist or bask in the warm glow of a setting sun. The world feels alive, responding to the player's actions and decisions in ways that feel both organic and meaningful.

At the heart of Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen lies its revolutionary combat system, which seamlessly blends the depth of traditional RPG mechanics with the visceral action of a hack-and-slash masterpiece. Players are empowered to create their own unique play style through the game's robust class system, allowing for a staggering variety of character builds and strategies. Whether unleashing devastating spells as a Sorcerer, raining arrows from afar as a Ranger, or cleaving through enemies with brute force as a Warrior, every class feels distinct and satisfying to master.

The real brilliance of Dragon's Dogma's combat, however, lies in its innovative Pawn system. Players are accompanied by a customizable AI companion known as a Pawn, whose abilities and behaviors can be tailored to complement the player's own strengths and weaknesses. This adds a layer of strategy and depth to combat encounters, as players must coordinate with their Pawns to overcome formidable foes and exploit enemy weaknesses.

For negatives, I have to mention the map is bugged on Ultrawide monitors and to my knowledge still not fixed. There used to be a mod for it but it was abandoned a while ago. Bitterblack Isle is the only DLC which adds a huge challenge to the game but it's enjoyable if you're prepared. It was still somewhat lazy because it uses the guise of a ""maze"" design which just repeats the same areas as you go deeper which is only confusing and an obvious limitation of console technology for game file asset management. You can tell the DLC was made for seasoned players which may be a turn off for casual players which don't want to change their loadout and pawns for a single fight.",1708216629,1708216629,True,2,0,0.530964434146881104,0,True,False,False

Dragon's Dogma fails on that end pretty hard.

I hear all the screams of JRPG fans, where tons of pointless NPCs make for better towns, large towns make for better realism, tiny stat upgrades make for rewarding experiences and quests that are far above your power-level lets you know the world is tough and you need to get stronger.
All of these things make for a drag of a start.
From the tutorial of fighting a cool creature, and then the sort-of rush to get to another cool creature... The in between sucks. It's incredibly frustrating to try and explore, only for the game to tell you, ""You can't be here yet. Or you can run if you want.""
Look up ""Lost and Found Dragon's Dogma"", and there's immediately discourse on the missions. If you can't deal with something like that, the game ends here for you. Hope you had a fun read of this review.

For every idiot like me who read that, and wants to keep pushing... I can tell this one is a rough diamond. The cities are rough to deal with, the escort quests are boring, the travel from place to place means you are walking if you don't make use of the honestly unexplained ferrystone/portstone stuff.

This individuals will also name their character Guts and there Pawn Casca and will tell you how original they are and how you should not play as a Mage.

-Some of the smoothest combat I've seen in this genre. Good sense of tactical importance.
-Fun and weird NPC interactions, great for stress relief and some aren't half bad in terms of writing.
-Enemies feel good to fight and for the most part have interesting weaknesses that reward you for thinking on your feet. Monster design is great in addition to this and seamlessly reveals weakpoints even without pawn intervention.
-The UI and inventory management is easy to use and concise.

The game is more clunky than I remembered, and quite some game design choices I don't like. But the rest makes up for it.

Do note that you can only do some side quests for a limited amount of time, so it's easy to miss out on a lot of stuff like a whole section of the map and meeting characters!

The game is quite punishing in some aspects and doesn't hold your hand as much as more recent games, but I don't mind that. Also, the game is more about the adventure than about the story imo, so don't expect the best story telling.

Pros:
- Interesting combat
- Good Pawn mechanic
Cons:
- Quests are boring and have lots of running
- Main plot is clumsy and sometimes cringy
- Stamina system prevents pleasant exploration
- World feels empty
- User interface is hideous
- Lots of grind
- Pawns lack intelligence

The beginning of the game was pleasant and promising up until the moment when you have already run through the world map once. After that the quests just forced you to run around the map several times between 2 spots. The main plot tries to be epic, but it consistently fails. The world by itself is huge but just filled with packs of mobs and you have no other option but to fight them, as you lack stamina to run through all those empty spaces. 
Moreover, grind is a must have, as the final quest is around 20 times more difficult than any other quest or opponent that you have encountered before. And bosses are just sponges for damage. 
Pawns are designed to help player, but not interfere. Maybe, for some playstyles they would suffice, but not for all of them.
So, the first around 20-30% are fascinating. Then it gradually becomes worse.

Lastly, if you are worried about spending to much time going back in forth from location to location.

Dragon's Dogma is one of my favorite games ever. It is in incredible game that should have been way more popular than it was but for some reason it was a cult classic. Those who know know, you know.

The combat is spectacular, imagine fighting really strong enemies, with a party, being able to climb on the enemies and do even more damage. You can be really any kind of character you want, a dual blader theif kind of person or a warrior, cleric, mage, and then once you level up you can pull in aspects of whatever other classes you like.

The story is interesting although a little slow-paced in the start, but its built that way so you interact with the world and level up before continuing. The game is punishing to those who fail to prepare. You should sleep in an inn or campfire before heading out on a journey. And you should have a party with you and not go alone. 

The world-building is incredible and you easily feel immersed in this unique and gritty fantasy world. There is a sense of progression with all the moves as you level them up and get stronger, enhance your weapons and armors etc.

I can't gush enough over this game. You do not need to play this one to play Dragon's Dogma II when it comes out. It has been confirmed by the developers. Dragon's Dogma II will probably be the better game, due to upgraded graphics and better fluid controls but this game is definitely worth a play if you love good games and action RPGs.",1707574960,1707574960,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- I already owned it on GOG, but the game lacked important patches and online features, and I had to buy it again on Steam.
- Broken ultrawide support. I think it was originally letterboxed, then Capcom dropped the ball with the current implementation. Mods don't work either. I ended up creating a custom resolution in the driver to get a 16:9 letterboxed image at max resolution.
- Although Capcom can't (or rather won't) deal with these problems, they are always happy to introduce new DRM.

As for the game, I don't think I can recommend it to new players, especially right before Dragon's Dogma 2. Obviously, if your childhood was all about Dragon's Dogma, this might be the greatest game you've ever played, but right now it feels very dated and has quite a few questionable design decisions, some of which are so lame they've practically become memes.

The game is not without its flaws, no game is perfect. Vocations obviously aren't really balanced, and anyone who has played the game for themselves knows exactly what I'm talking about, but at least all the different classes are viable for gameplay. None of them are so bad that they're practically unplayable, there are just very clear and objective imbalances among the vocations. In addition, the start of the game can feel like a trudge and with the cart-escort quest required to progress past the tutorial stage, it can put a lot of players off from becoming invested. 

However, once you get past the first half-hour of the game and get to the capital city, Dragon's Dogma becomes a masterwork of a video game title. Incredibly voice acting, solid progression systems compounded with great RPG mechanics, unique and dynamic monster encounters and quests, and the innovative combat make this game one of my favorites, even after a decade has passed since its release.

Absolutely incredible, way ahead of it's time (2012), and with Dragon's Dogma 2 right around the corner, there's nothing wrong with playing the first game and experiencing the cult classic for yourself.

Edit after 100% completion:
Underrated masterpiece.

A 2012 game which delivers THE BEST combat experience in the arpg genre up to date, a mix of soulslike and DMC-like gameplay that's always engaging and, when crawling the corridors of Bitterblack Isle, challenging and satisfying.
With these premises, if Capcom can improve on the pawns IA and deliver an immersive openworld experience (no quest pointers? limited fast travel? I'm so friggin' hyped!), the sequel coming out soon is going to be a strong contender for GOTY 2024.

The progression really felt good, not so fast and not too slow. But people might want to understand and be patient because the traversal in here were slow (especially in early part of the game), we will walk a lot in here but sprinting outside safe zone will consume stamina, not only that the world may seems empty at some part, it might be tiring for some people but for me its not really a problem.
Whats good about Dragon's Dogma is the combat system and pawn system. The combat feels really satisfying, many vocation (class) to choose from and some of them are mixed class. Sorcerer in this game have an amazing skill, not a simple elemental shooting but you can summon a meteor rain and tornado at high skill that has a cool effect! You're rarely got the chance to do this in other RPG game.
Dragon's Dogma has a good replay value since it has many side quest that will affect how the npc will act as you progress through the story. If you're done getting to the ending you can also try speedrun mode later on! There are many things to do even after post-game. I really recommend it!

Even though I enjoy exploring the map, sometimes it gets tiring, especially if you end up dying and having to go back to the home screen to load the save, because retry is not always the last save. As the game only provides one save, you can lose hours of progress if you press retry in a hurry.

The game is poorly optimized for PC, which is normal coming from Capcom, to solve UI problems at high resolutions you will have to use mods and even with SSDs the loads are slow and having to go back to the home screen every time you see dying is a pain.

Having said that, it is fun. It plays similar to a Souls game combined with hack-and-slash games and Shadow of Colossus all tied together with a very intuitive party management system. I feel the devs wanted to do so much more (and probably will, in Dragon's Dogma 2!).

The gameplay is fun. This is some of the best combat I've felt in a game. That part doesn't feel dated, which is good. It could easily fit in with today's RPG's. Where it does fall off is the story. The story is so generic ""old dragon came back to kill everyone"". The parts where it is interesting (the whole Arisen aspect) they don't expand on it enough and you have to just accept that your character has this history with the people in the kingdom and villages you come across. Basically, you don't develop a relationship with characters. Sure, good RPG's don't need that (Elden Ring doesn't, for example)...but the game almost acts like it wants you to. Plus, the whole Pawn system with your party sets you up to develop relationships with the characters - but that never happens. This make role-playing fall off a bit. It takes about two hours to really get into the groove of the game and understand that quests are kind of supposed to come up randomly and you progress as you want in that regard...it's weird because with all the tutorial boxes the game gives you - the devs didn't weave it into a quest, really. You kind of are told to go talk to people. That could be a great idea if people didn't have one or two sentences to say (i.e., many NPC's feel like JRPG NPC's)

The other iffy aspect of the game is the traversal...though I won't come down on that too much because it is an early open world RPG...because of that it comes with some of that jank I mentioned: thing things like loading screens whenever you enter a village, questionable village placement, awkward paths, and an open world that isn't vast - just interconnect paths from village to village or forest or cave. 

So, why do I recommend this game? Well, I can't stop playing it. The combat is enjoyable as all hell and you come across it often. Particularly, boss fights are fantastic - you can damage every part of the large bosses and climb all over them. You can chop off the tail of an enemy or the head, or leg. The early jankiness is endearing in a way. The game is humble and doesn't take itself seriously when it comes to story - think Shenmue.

I'm enjoying myself - which is what I look for in a game. Plus, this game is almost always on sale for $5 so definitely give it a try.",1707123112,1707123112,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- the combat (duh it's cap com)
-pawn system (once you understand it)
- very in depth game mechanics and unique mechanics like being able to grab smaller enemies and grapple larger ones
-story themes such as the cyclic nature of life

The early game is pretty rough though especially if you're like me and don't like playing with a walk through guide, highly recommend looking up a spoiler free one though honestly, they do a poor job of explaining some mechanic to the player and others are just obtuse and cause a lot of unnecessary frustration.

Biggest cons to me:
-The story plot wise feels very unfinished with lots of immersion breaking holes 
-Feels like your decisions have no consequences until 1 before post game and 1 after
-Lots of minor QOL changes that would make the game more enjoyable without killing what makes it unique (Vocation load out system, more intuitive quests such as the escort quests, etc.)

Despite it's many flaws I still consider this game a gem and the combat is honestly enough to keep me coming back. solid 8/10

Cons: Repetitive combat, grinding is pointless, loot is horrible, empty world, 80% of quests are either fetch or escort, UI sucks, severely limited hotkeys, inventory management sucks, pawns are pain in the a$$.

In short, this game doesn't take 40 hours to finish. It only takes 10, the rest 30 is just you running all over the map. Lore is close to non-existent. I loved the first 2-3 hours but then the things i mentioned in cons ruined the game for me. 

Some funny things to mention: The BBI DLC becomes available right after prologue but the general consensus for required level to start is level 50. Guess what? you don't usually reach level 50 in the base game unless you get out of your comfort zone.

Overall, this game was promising. It could have been an AAA game easily. Dunno when it went wrong though.

It took me years to force myself to play this, and I've a few tips for people on the bench.
It takes a good 6 hours until the good stuff kicks in, but then you're already a powerhouse. Sell the DLC Monocle and you're off to a great start with enough cash to mess about and level up without fear of wastage. It helped me get over the games apparent quirks. It just plays like a console game, but I'm smashing my way through the menus now, so you'll swiftly pick it up on Keyboard & Mouse .

You will NOT have to run everywhere all the time. About 20-30 hrs into the game you'll get two items that together will allow you to Port around the map. Big locations have Portals you can unlock, and together with a PORTABLE RIFT CRYSTAL in your inventory, you can place it on the ground ANYWHERE and zip back to any uncovered location, such as a big city to stock up. So halfway up a mountain and you're getting hammered, you just run away, plop your crystal down and bob off to the city to tool up, improve gear and level up from the XP from the first third of the journey! When you're ready, portal back - the location you left the Rift Crystal will appear as an option, and now you're ready for the next 1/3rd of the mountain pass. Until you unlock this, it really is a Map unlocking cycle.

There are hundreds of guides, but every one ALSO says just play whatever and however and have fun. You'll complete it no matter. It was designed as a solo PS3 game, so just smash away and see what happens.
The animations are nuts. The pawns you hire are nuts. The game is a bit odd, but its good crazy oldschool odd, if you know what I mean. When what was achieved in this game from 2012 clicked with me, it made many other ARPG's feel like an excel spreadsheet. It's like going on holiday with all the weird kids from school, but you're all smashing the crap out of everything in a ballet of designed chaos of your making. It's simply great fun to mess with.
Questing is a bit crap and things can be failed, and the save system needs your attention asap so you can learn how to spam it, and yeah, maaaaybe look up a class guide, but it wont really matter as it wasn't designed to play with a walkthrough and perfect stats, it was designed to make PS3 players scream ""WTF IS HAPPENING!??!"" at the screen.

Starting with the good:
-This game has very nice combat, animations are fluid, characters are responsive and abilities feel worthwhile and useful.
-Pawns (your npc followers) can be incredibly helpful at tackling tasks your class isn't suited for and supporting you.
-Boss/mini-boss battles are very engaging, the music is engaging, they have interesting mechanics and they allow you to feel how much stronger you have grown since beginning of the game.

Now here is the bad:
-The quests in this game may be the worst of all and every other open world RPG I have played, somehow even worse than modern Assassin's Creed titles. 90% of the quests are fetch quests that want you to revisit places you have previously explored over and over again while providing no interesting story, for the most part, no actual rewards.

I struggle to see how any son of God can actually preserve through these unimaginative fetch quests plaguing the game, even in Skyrim which is also polluted by a lot of repetitive and un-intuitive quests, you at least face some form of attempt at character development, an ultimatum, a reward or some form of return for your investment of time even if its futile. This game? none of that; 
""Oh arisen, I dropped my letter, please find,"" 
""Oh arisen, my son died please find three resurrection stones,"" 
""Oh arisen sickness has struck, 5 herbs please,"" 
""Oh arisen, skeletons and stuff, explore catacombs for the 3rd time please.""

In the rare event you actually have something impactful happen through a quest, you realize its plot value is equivalent to a south park episode, nothing actually happens, hell even the NPCs you kill in town come back a week later lmao.

-Second issue, the game has a small amount of enemies and not a lot of ways to kill them, the combat is really engaging and all but majority of the encounters are trivial if anything, you can just kill everyone and everything with the same combo, save for mini-bosses maybe, the most engaging class may be the archer variants because they actually need to you aim at stuff instead of mashing/holding the same button combo for 30 minutes to get through the same dungeon.

-Class balancing, warrior was my favorite class but its as shallow as a pool, the highest creativity you can display as a warrior is using combat cry to get flying mobs down or using the ladder/catapult sword to launch pawns onto large creatures, maybe distancing yourself from mobs to charge up your attack. Sorcerer is holding down 1 button to watch cool effects come out and kill shit, Mystic Knight consists of 1 cool gimmick and the regular Knight is just ability spam.

Despite the combat feeling very good you run out of room to grow as a player in almost no time, you will use the same combos but with different VFX and more damage from the start until the end of the game.

In conclusion, apart from the cultural value the game offers everything of the game maybe except the smoothness of the combat is incredibly outdated, many older RPG titles despite not delivering on combat as well as this game outdo it significantly in every other aspect, give this a try if you don't mind doing brainless fetch tasks for a few hours to crank up useless rewards or if you want to build yourself a foundation for DD2.",1706905351,1706905351,False,2,0,0.49358975887298584,0,True,False,False

Bear in mind that this 2012 game (that this 2016 expansion re-releases) came out a year after Skyrim's 2011 release, five years before Breath of the Wild, and six years before Monster Hunter World.  So what we have in Dragon's Dogma is an early Capcom overture towards a full-sized open-world game.  It's only quasi-open world, mostly enclosed set pieces of larger-than-usual size.  Instead, they focus more on the action gameplay mechanics.  And, honestly, it's a pretty good trade. Even Elden Ring pales in comparison to some of the over-the-top graphical effects involved in the spectacular moves you'll be doing in Dragon's Dogma, albeit that game has a much finer balance and difficulty curve.

Technically, I've seen worse decade-old compatibility.  I'm noticing a top review right now warns of a new DRM, but I don't think they've even added it to Dragons Dogma yet.  My main problem was it couldn't handle my ultrawide monitor.  It was hard-locked in full-screen mode with most of it overflowing below the screen, so I could not see the controls.  However, once I  hooked up an XBox-compatible gamepad and guessed that [b]I needed to hit the gamepad start button to commit changes to the graphics configuration screen[/b], I was able to get it into to run in a 1080p window.  Then Dragons Dogma: Dark Arisen was fully playable at maximum graphical settings, rock solid and playing well.

After that, I had to get used to Dragon's Dogma again.  It turned out I couldn't start a new game from scratch without throwing away everything I accomplished in 2016.  You get 1 save slot, the freedom to change your character build whenever you like, and that's it.  Fortunately, not starting over turned out to be the right call.  True, the combat is fairly sophisticated, but the Xbox gamepad hasn't changed a whole lot over the past decade, and you can only push the envelope so far with a few buttons and timing.  I was able to re-acclimate fairly painlessly thanks in part to everything close to town being easy enough to steamroll with my preexisting level 40-ish character.

Once I got the proverbial dragon ball rolling, I was surprised at how much of a slow burn Dragons Dogma: Dark Arisen was.  Capcom makes you retread old ground often in this game, like a classic Monster Hunter game.  But there are baddies to fight and loot to find everywhere you go, so it's never boring.  I fell into this flow of constant console-style action RPG, and the time melted away.  There's something really easygoing about Dragon's Dogma.  From the slightly cheesy way everyone acts, the way the monsters are presented, and the over-the-top spells and skills, it's oddly pitch perfect for a dated console video game.  This is classic action RPG comfort food right down to its core.

Overall, I can recommend Dragon's Dogma, especially for that patient gamer price.  Just expect Dragons Dogma to eat a lot of time.  It's surprisingly good at it.",1706673106,1706719825,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

GOOD:
- Combat is fun. The skills and monster-climbing ability make it very engaging.
- Although you have to walk to unexplored areas, journeying to a new location usually felt like a rewarding adventure with unexpected things along the way (at least the first time)
- Fights against big monsters generally felt epic, with interesting approaches to fight them
- Utilizing a party of 4 and upgrading your character felt satisfying
- Nice theme and some OSTs

BAD:
The game sometimes tries to be an immersive experience but some things always make it silly and unrealistic
- Horrible character design. Most NPCs feel really bland and make you feel like you can't wait to leave town and go fight things rather than care about the characters
- Story is underwhelming. Many things go unexplained, which may be nice as you can take it for your interpretation, but it feels like the devs didn't invest into the story
- Dialogue is bad. In quest conversations, this relates to the boring story. Moreover, it's common for NPC dialogue, especially talking with your companions, to give you obvious hints about playing the game which went against immersion and could have been told in a more subtle way
- Too many inventory items with similar effects that just clutter your storage or bags
- Menu could be simplified, navigating it was quite tedious
- Stamina limitation, especially in open world when running outside of combat. The most valuable consumable to me was always a stamina regen",1706211626,1706562426,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Having played it some more hours, I can add some things: You absolutely must do some of the quests in the order that they intended, or you lose access to some key areas. In some cases, especially early in the game, there is no warning about this. The love plot is also clumsy and poorly implemented.

After 8 years of owning Dark Arisen, and many times hitting walls and bouncing off certain aspects of the game, I just recently smashed through that wall and finished the game entirely (minus the expansion content, Bitterblack Isle). 

DDDA has one of the most intricate and interesting class systems - called Vocations - which gives you so much control over your playstyle in a way I find comparable only to Monster Hunter. Do you want to climb all over big monsters to hit weak spots? Strider. Do you want to be big smash man? Warrior. Do you want to conjure the most insane magical spells I've ever seen in a third-person action RPG? Sorcerer. And then my favorite: do you want to play as a hybrid Vocation where you essentially cast spells through your bow? Magick Archer. 

DDDA can be little jank at times, but the feeling you get defeating a big monster is unparalleled, and the structure of the game lending itself to trying out all the Vocations on one save file means there's a lot of replayability. In fact, the game and story are basically designed for it, with its cyclical nature meaning that you finish the game and start back at the beginning with all your gear and levels. 

Honestly so much more to say for Dragon's Dogma, but I'm so happy to finally be able to say I've finished it, and am probably going to be finishing it again at least 2 more times before Dragon's Dogma 2 releases in March. If you are a fan of in depth combat and progression, fighting big monsters, and more than a little bit of cheese, you will want to try this game. 

This game is a masterwork. Can't go wrong.

An incredibly deep game hides under the surface of a product with a troubled development. If this game had gotten more time and funding, it could be one of the greatest ever RPG's. Even as it is, it's still one of the best out there in terms of combat and character progression, even if the production value is a little low at times. 

Plus, it gave rise to quite possibly the best line in video game history: ""I would never violate his Grace's privacy while he violates my lady's privates.""",1622518640,1706534351,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I saw someone equate this game to a classic 1980's high fantasy movie in terms of overall design, and I'd say that's pretty accurate.

That being said, Every Vocation feels unique, and each one---even the three beginning classes---are viable through the end of the game. Combat is absolutely the flagship selling point of this game. Since its initial release all the way back in 2012 or so, few games boast a Character Creation system as deep as Dragon's Dogma's, and the upcoming sequel promises to double down on that depth. 

The pawn system is an incredibly unique approach to party-based gameplay and can bring a ton of added benefit to a playthrough. I for one though, am a sucker for a story and world that i can really, truly sink my teeth into. At the time of penning this review, I am only a dozen hours or so deep into the game with little complete in the way of story. At the present time however, I feel that the pawns' place in the lore of Dragon's Dogma's universe feels a bit tacked on. We're given very shallow excuses within the story/lore for these ever-faithful husks that serve at our whim and charge unflinchingly into the most dangerous of battles. Personally, I'd have liked a selection of well-developed characters, or the ability to customize a full party of Pawns (not big on the anachronistic nature of that name) with some choice in terms of character background---much like the character creation system in Mount & Blade. 

Aside from some dated mechanics, odd story structure and the myriad little gaps in immersion with AI companions, the brutally satisfying combat and unique approach to open world action RPG gaming ensure that Dragon's Dogma remains a diamond in the rough over a decade beyond its release.

Fighting against the smaller monsters (wolves and harpies) suck. They have no dynamicism to them! It's just the most braindead AI with some horribly mixed in QTE attacks that take forever to get done with. And you fight them constantly!

Then, once you get to the human enemies, it's even worse! Because for some god damn reason their attacks stun like hell and do 10x the damage of every other enemy you've seen so far. And you'll CONSTANTLY go up against groups of like 10 of them at once, against your 4. I once had to go up against 3 spawns of these guys in a row, like 30 enemies. Fuck off, das bullshit mang. These guys have a ton of health too so it's like a frustrating grind.

Combat is very very mediocre. I played the fighter class and felt like I was just doing the same shit over and over again with each fight. I just felt like I was mashing buttons, no thought or rhyme or reason to any of this shit.

Throughout my gameplay, I wished many features from other games were present in this game. But there are too many reasons to love this game.

When this game first came out, there were many comparisons made between Dragon's Dogma and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Although Dragon's Dogma was not as highly rated and made a massive impact as Skyrim, it is also an excellent game in its original style.

The Pawn system introduced in this game was one of the most revolutionary systems I have experienced in any game I have played so far. You will create a companion called Pawn, who is always on your side throughout your journey. And you are not limited to having only one Pawn. The Pawn created by other players can join your adventure, as can your Pawn join the adventure of other players.

Dragon's Dogma also has one of the best Battle Systems of all time. There are nine Vocations that players can choose and switch around. Each vocation has a unique and exciting battle style that players can experience differently. Personally, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim has always been my favorite game, but I always thought its action lacked some intensity. There is no doubt that Skyrim is a better game overall than Dragon's Dogma in many eyes, including mine. But as an Action game, Dragon's Dogma could be the best in the Open-World Fantasy genre.

One of my all-time favorites. I cannot wait for Dragon's Dogma 2 to come out.",1706410910,1706410910,True,25,0,0.695194065570831299,0,True,False,False

🌟 Graphics: Still Impressive - For an aged game, the visuals surprisingly hold up. The lighting is top-notch, and most textures, except for some world textures like mountain boundaries, remain appealing.

🎮 Gameplay: Rewarding and Impactful - Every fight feels significant, delivering a satisfying sense of accomplishment. The effort put into battles feels equally rewarded, enhancing the overall gaming experience.

🔍 Quests: Engaging and Worthwhile - The quests, especially board quests, offer great incentives and goals to pursue, adding depth to the gameplay.

🛠️ Vocations: Diverse and Unique - Having played five vocations, each feels distinctively special. The way attributes carry over to new vocations allows for creating tailored builds, adding a strategic layer to the gameplay.

👗 Gear: Stylish and Functional - The gear choices perfectly balance aesthetics and functionality, always aligning with my playstyle preferences.

👥 Pawn System: Innovative and Social - As a big fan of MMOs, the pawn system fills the gap of playing with friends. Creating a personal pawn and recruiting others (including those made by other players) is brilliant. Their AI is commendably smart, often feeling like real players, which greatly enhances the game's social aspect.

🐉 Monster Combat: Thrilling and Dynamic - The giant monster battles, akin to Monster Hunter, are exhilarating. The climbing mechanic adds an engaging twist to combat.

💬 Final Thoughts: A Favorite Classic - ""Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen"" ranks as one of my all-time favorite games. Playing it in 2024, it still offers a profound and memorable experience. With ""Dragon's Dogma 2"" on the horizon, my excitement is through the roof! Kudos to Capcom for this remarkable creation.",1706382464,1706382464,True,1,0,0.510703384876251221,0,True,False,False

~Disregard the mass review bombing, these reviews are about the companies actions. Weather they are bad or justified changes, it should not be a reflection of the game. 

This game, once you get to the capital starts to click and have a very different RPG experience then the other big games. For example it has some similarities to Souls like games and Monster Hunter. As some stands out features: ""Pawn system"", awesome combat, and a really grounded fantasy atmosphere that is more medieval in look then grandiose. It does suffer from age (duh) but it plays incredibly well. Lots of walking but if your smart get stones that allow fast travel for a high cost, so it encourages you to snoop around. 

Its usually on sale, (as low as $6) its well worth that, and if you are uncertain if the squeal will be good try this and then imagine with 2024 improvements.

I wish it had better customization for the controller mappings. currently in order to make activate (in game) and select (in menu) the same button I have to map A on the controller to E on the keyboard (which changes the on screen prompts to keyboard every time I select something). I also set B on the controller to keyboard 'space' on press (so it will let me jump) and controller B on release (so in will cancel in menus).

it's weird and annoying that they make such a big deal about not traveling at night, and sleeping to restore maximum health, but don't have camping mechanics so long journeys are extra hard

I also think it's annoying how hard it is to tell ""clothing"" from ""armor"", but I downloaded a mod and it's fine now

I also wish it had some kind of dodge action, and it would be nice if ""strong attack"" was more useful or interesting.

there are also several things were the in-game explanation is a bit lacking and I have to look them up online to find out what it means. I'm conflicted on the use of archaic language like aught and ser, it's interesting and unique, but also sometimes confusing. not enough to be a problem, but enough I have to take half a second to process what was said. the dragon is kinda ugly imo, but I see where they got the style from and respect that.

This is one of the greatest fantasy RPGs ever made. I've played it a lot more off steam so the hours here don't reflect the amount of time i've played it. This is Elden Ring meets monster hunter - enemies are huge, and you can scale them and climb them to strike at their weak points. 9 different vocations and classes. multiple weapons and armor. Multiple ways to play the game. Sure the plot is meh, and the end game comes too fast, but the real joy in this game is the after-game - the NG cycles and going down the DLC bitter black isle - one of the best designed dungeons that really test your skills. 

This game doesn't hold your hand after the first few levels. The enemies are tough, and if you're under levelled or not using the right tactics, you're going to have a hard time. If your party composition isn't good, you'll get wiped quick. At lower levels, you'll frequently run into enemies that are much stronger than you. But the good thing is, there are multiple ways to resolve things - mostly by running away, or running past, or going at a different time of the day.

For the sake of getting complaints out of the way early yes the game is a bit jank, a little obnoxious and at least slightly janky.  However, none of that really matters.  People remember Skyrim so fondly and I'm like, ""Have you played Dragon's Dogma?""  That isn't fair, the two aren't really that much like one another.  But Dragon's Dogma is an action RPG with great character customization, awesome fights and interesting mechanics.  I liked it so much I beat the original and the Dark Arisen version on X360, then bought it on Steam to play again.  It's awesome.

I forgive anyone who doesn't realize this: the game isn't perfect and it fails to tell you a lot of things about it.  But the fact that you can make yourself a four foot tall child or a six foot tall fat person and have that actually reflect in how you perform in combat is amazing.  The goofiness of the pawn system and even their repetitive banter is kind of charming in how stupid it all is.  Plus, you get to grab onto the side of an ogre, climb up to his eye and stab him in the face or maybe coat him in oil and set him on fire.  The game has an excellent immersive and experimental quality to it that extends to the exploration and story.

My biggest complaint about the game is that the default arrows are really weak.  That might sound like a strange ""top complaint"" to have but in a game with so much variety an interactivity, they didn't trust the player to manage their arrows and have them just do regular damage.  Instead you get infinite regular arrows and they are weak.  The reason this stands out is you can GET special arrows so all the mechanics to ""fix"" this balance issue were there, it just is what it is.  I mostly add this complaint to show that yeah, when your worst complaint about the game is the arrows aren't as satisfying to use as they could be: you are onto something special.  This was a criminally overlooked game and while I don't know the sequel will do it justice, I would gladly recommend any fan of action RPGs to give this one a shot.",1706155913,1706155951,True,1,0,0.495867758989334106,0,True,False,False

Precisou o segundo jogo ser anunciado pra eu tomar vergonha na cara e vir corrigir o erro. Mesmo adorando, eu fui muito injusto com esse jogo. Ok, ele tem problemas, mas que jogo não tem?

Vou tentar fazer uma lista de prós e contras pra organizar o que gosto e não gosto no jogo, e espero que todos os contras (ou pelo menos 100% deles - requer compreensão de ironia pra fazer sentido) sejam devidamente corrigidos na sequência. Ei, Capcom, dá tempo ainda! E vamos começar de trás pra frente!

Contras:

 - basicamente a história do jogo. Não que eu não goste dela, eu gosto - e bastante -, mas é extremamente claro que ela foi acelerada PRA CARAMBA. Tem muito potencial, muitos fios de trama que poderiam ser melhor explorados, mas tudo é bastante superficial. O final corrige um pouco disso, mas nem de longe faz justiça ao potencial bruto do plot.

 - mundo. Ok, é um mapa relativamente amplo... Mas apenas porque te força a explorar tudo a pé. Tem um sistema de fast travel, mas poxa... Apenas duas cidades? Umas dez dungeons? Sim, eu sei que o jogo é produto de sua época e provavelmente teve um orçamento e janela de desenvolvimento pequenos, mas...

 - inteligência artificial. Olha, às vezes é uma negação quando você precisa de um determinado tipo de suporte dos seus pawns (mais sobre o sistema abaixo) e eles simplesmente não fazem o que é necessário, como encantar sua arma com magia sagrada em meio a um combate contra mortos-vivos.

 - we are (NOT) the Dangan. Poxa, retiraram a música do menu original... Eu gostava tanto dela... =(

Se os contras não te afastaram dessa opinião, os prós provavelmente te farão amar a experiência desse jogo!

Prós:

 - mundo (sim). Ok, sei que achei que poderia ser maior e mais elaborado, mas o mundo é gostoso de explorar, especialmente com a dualidade do sistema de dia e noite. Tem uma quantidade relativamente interessante de segredos e locais que só aparecem se você realmente presta atenção onde está andando.

 - combate. Vamos combinar, o combate desse jogo é maravilhoso, seja você fã de espadas, arcos ou magias. As classes tem habilidades interessantes, poder se agarrar aos inimigos grandes e acertar partes específicas para causar dano localizado, arrancar partes de monstros, causar diferentes tipos de aflições... As batalhas contra dragões então? Acho que tirando Monster Hunter (ora, ora), nunca me diverti tanto enfretando inimigos gigantes em nenhum jogo.

 - quantidade de itens. Falo de tudo, de itens comuns dropados por monstros a equipamentos. Há um senso estético bacana nas composições de armaduras, sejam sets ou combinações que você pode fazer. Outro dia vi um cara com uma couraça no peito usando calça de lona e sapato de pano, pra vocês terem uma noção.

 - sistema ""off'nline"". O sistema de pawns do jogo é muito bom. Há um senso de camaradagem e cooperação em usar seu pawn principal e mandá-lo pra outras pessoas usarem, ele voltando então com mais experiência do mundo e podendo ajudá-lo de forma ainda mais efetiva.

 - senso geral de diversão. Se o jogo clicar pra você, você vai amar e vai gastar horas na campanha principal... E na sequência, já irá emplacar um New Game+, pois tem coisa legal que abre recomeçando o jogo. E eu nem citei a área da expansão, que comecei a explorar a pouco, mas tem super cara de ser uma mega dungeon de respeito.

Enfim, é um excelente jogo. Se a sequência for 1,5 vezes melhor, teremos a consolidação de uma franquia com potencial de rivalizar os gigantes do segmento. No fim do dia, é um jogo da Capcom, e o que sabemos sobre os jogos da Capcom?

WTF CRAPcom.

---------------------------

Es un gran juego. Sonidos envolventes y muy buena ambientación. Hay una gran variedad de armas, armadruas, e items.
Existe una buena variedad de habilidades y bastantes clases (como 10), y puedes usarlas a todas, pero no a la vez, sino que puedes ir cambiando a tu personaje de una clase a la otra, e ir mejorando esa clase con los puntos que ganas al subir de nivel.

La creación de tu personaje está bastante compleja, incluso puedes elegir su altura y su voz. No solo puedes crear a tu personaje, sino que tambien creas al compañero que vas a tener durante todo el juego, y luego puedes recrutar 2 compañeros más, los cuales (si los reclutas a travez de internet), serán esos ""compañeros"" que otros jugadores crearon para ellos mismos, pero que tu tambien puedes reclutarlos si quieres. (Me refiero a que tu te creas tu personaje y tu compañero, y luego por ejemplo, otro jugador puede reclutar a mi compañero para que tambien sea el suyo en su historia, pero eso no significa que yo no pueda usarlo más, obviamente).
Puedes cambiar tus otros 2 compañeros tantas veces como quieras llendo a las piedras de falla que te lo permiten.

Hay una buena variedad de enemigos, y los mapas son muy grandes, asi que te encontraras algunos que se repiten constantemente, pero otros que son ""minibosses"" que daran una pelea interesante, ya que puedes aprovechar sus puntos debiles (tipo puzzle) para sacarles ventaja e incluso para obtener drops extra de items especiales.

La verdad que es un excelente juego. Una de las cosas malas que he visto, es la IA. Cuando tienes la tarea de escoltar a alguien, (algun npc), si aparecen enemigos, este no dudará en mandarse entre todos los enemigos y dejarse dañar hasta morir, y asi hacerte fallar la mision. Por supuesto, tus compañeros tambien tienen algunos problemas de IA. Me he visto en el caso de yo estar bajando con cuidado por algun lugar, y que mis compañeros se caigan y se hagan mierda contra el suelo por no haber bajado bien. (Tambien me he visto en el caso positivo en el que cuando uno de mis compañeros cae, otro de mis compañeros lo alza en los brazos y me lo acerca para que lo pueda curar sin tener que acercarme a los enemigos. Esto en el caso de que el enemigo sea un BOSS, es sumamente util y la verdad es genial. Tambien me ha pasado de tener que hacer tareas de ""llevar cosas de un lugar a otro"", pero llevarlas en mis manos, no en el inventario. Y en estos casos mis compañeros agarran esas cosas y me ayudan a llevarlas... Tambien esta genial esto).

Tus compañeros pueden obtener informacion y conocimientos sobre mounstruos para poder aprovechar automaticamente sus puntos debiles, y poder utilizar habilidades que sean efectivas contra ellos. Esta experiencia la ganas haciendoles leer rollos que contengan informacion sobre dichos mounstruos, o luchando contra los mounstruos y probando distintas habildiades que demuestren ser efectivas, o inefectivas. Tu compañero mencionará algo como, ""he aprendido una nueva forma de pelear contra los de su tipo"", cuando aprenda algo nuevo sobre el enemigo.

Otra cosa que no me ha gustado, ha sido el hecho de que ciertas habilidades que solo puedes usar si tienes cierta clase, (como aseisino o strider por ejemplo), tambien estan limitadas por arma, y esto no tiene sentido. Me explico... Si tu te pones la clase asesino, y te equipas una espada, no puedes usar la habilidad de esta clase para rodar, ni para tenr un doble salto. Solo puedes hacerlo si te equipas con dagas, pero por que?... Sigues siendo la misma clase, por que se limita solo a dagas?, joder.

Otra cosa muy tediosa de la IA, es que hay muchos poderes enemigos que aplican estados irreversibles, (basicamente que oneshootean, osea, que matan de 1 solo golpe). Como pueden imaginarse cuando digo ""problema de IA"", me refiero a que tus compañeros literalmente (estoy muy seguro) apropósito se quedan quietos mientras el enemigo prepara la habilidad y se las mete de lleno una y otra y otra y otra y otra vez. He tenido que reiniciar la misma parte unas 50 veces porque los retrasados de mierda de mis compañeros se quedaban quietos dentro del area del poder mientras yo salia y al verlos decía, ""salgan de ahi, salgan de ahi!"", y utilizaba F2 que es el boton para decirles que vengan conmigo. Sin embargo ignoraban completamente lo que les decia, y morian constantemente una y otra vez. (Completamente tedioso y cansino).

Por último antes de resumir mi opinión, debo remarcar que la historia es muy muy mala. Practicamente no hay personajes importantes, y si los hay aparecen tan rapido como se van y no vuelven a aparecer nunca más. El malo incluido. Además, nunca tienes la oportunidad de vengarte de un npc al que estoy seguro de que muchos odiaron... Que te hace quedar como traidor ante toda una ciudad luego de haberlos salvados, y tras esto los vuelves a salvar y termina el juego sin que cambie nada. (Horrible historia, pésima).

En fin. Juego recomendado si ignoras todo lo referente a la historia y no buscas personajes importantes, falla muchisimo en la IA y se pone tremendamente tedioso cuando sucede, lo cual le quita mucha gracia y diversion al juego. Le daria una nota desaprobatoria si no fuera porque realmente el apartado rpg es muy disfrutable. 7/10",1534891309,1706072562,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h3] Summary [/h3]
An older game with some questionable UI and lack of keybindings for some things; however not a deal breaker for me. A well grounded story with side stories to go with it. The map is large and I even left quite a bit unexplored. The graphics, honestly, for me still stand out pretty well; has a charm to it, playing it nowadays. The voice acting from the dragon is amazing, side characters are sometimes comical. It's really hard not to enjoy this game. There's so much content to be explored even after you ""finish"" the game the first time. Has a lot of value and replay-ability. I especially like the fact you can change your vocations (mage, fighter etc) forever, whenever.

[h3] To note: [/h3]
I played this game on and off quite a few times. It was hard for me to get into it, but i really wanted to ""finish"" it before DD2. [u] So, I haven't done a different ending (if there is one(i'd assume there's ""2"" endings)), nor experienced BBI, nor new game+ [/u]. However, upon finishing the game, I believe I'll go back. There's more lore from side quests and from exploring the world in general; so I'd want to take my time. I will say, that as much as I rushed it, one fault of this game is; the level of enemies when you progress through the main story are, for lack of a better word, comically weak. Like, you've put their HP to 0 but they still have really important things to say before they die so they keep attacking until they've finished their monologue. Regardless, this game has a lot going for it, even as an older game.

Wanted to relive the good ol early ps3 days by 100% this rough jewel again but for Steam and by god is it as corny and cheesy as I remembered. Oh how I miss hearing Into Free ~Dangan~ theme during the start of the game, utter shame most missed out on hearing it in the Dark Arisen version.

At the time, this was a very ambitious game that experimented with a lot of new things that was never done in the industry before. Some would argue it was a mix bag though, between the story, conflicting plot points (shameless stolen plot points taken out of Berserk, I might add), wonky brain dead A.I and repetitive/boring fetch quests but the more you played it, the more you'll understand it all blends into a experience that most 3rd person action-dugeon crawling games could never give. There was a time when everyone unanimously hated the repetitive pawn dialogue but even looking back on that, it was truly a unique way of having the NPC interact/react to the environments around you and though those interaction gained knowledge that helped you learned the weaknesses of the enemy, even shortcuts when dealing with various quests. To this day, I still consider the dugeon crawling aspect of Dark Arisen to be the best out of any 3rd person action RPG I've ever played. Truly felt like it took a page out of DND but with a grimdark tone to the atmosphere. Literally the best part of the game that'll have you spend most of your playtime on. 

Sadly, due to the outright brutal nature of the DLC, it's highly recommend you attempt doing it till after you're well into the 2nd play-though and because of this, through the misconception of it being ""artificially-difficult"", most people never got the full experience of Dark Arisen.

My former comments on the game aside, I can not recommend anyone buy games from a company willing to force a shady DRM on customers, years after many of the games affected have last been patched for bugs or content. 


I wish I had picked this game up at (Dark Arisen) launch.
Or, whatever the last stable patch was.
From the mundane ability to mantle up ledges, the way bows and magic bows handle, the way you can climb on and grab creatures, to the way there is 'multiplayer' in what is otherwise a single player rpg...
I am astounded at all the ways this game IS what I have looked for in an rpg.

Dragons Dogma: Dark Arisen is, a fantasy role playing game, in which the player is encouraged to level up a character alongside their own (a Pawn), and build a combat team no bigger than four (the player, the players Pawn, and up to two other players Pawns), and then traverse the countryside slaying monsters of various sizes on a quest to slay a specific Dragon. The player has three classes available to them at the start, and a further six classes (three 'hybrid' classes and three 'advanced' classes) once sufficient gameplay progress is attained. The players pawn can be any of the starter or advanced classes as well, and building a synergistic party is an evolving challenge. Seeking to complete the campaign and all side quests should take no less than 80 hours for a first run, and that's assuming you don't get lost exploring the width and breadth of the land. Without saying too much, the end game leads to a New Game Plus system for as long as a player wants to pursue it, with the additional options to play in a Hard mode or a Speedrun mode.

If any of that sounds good at all, do yourself a favor and pick this game up. I'm probably going to keep playing this until the sequel comes out! :D",1657355996,1705967933,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

At the forefront of Dragon's Dogma is the classic, muddy, saturated grey color palette synonymous with games from the early 2010s. The art style fails to alleviate the drab aesthetic, with everything and everyone (except for a few well-designed monsters) appearing awkward, as if stuck in an uncanny valley state—surprised-looking and robotic in their movements.

Nevertheless, the world and scenery are well-designed, despite being somewhat empty. The writing and dialogue present a mix of strangeness, oddity, and forgettable moments. Each scene feels as if directed by David Lynch (perhaps excusable given it's a Capcom game). The overarching story lacks cohesion, offering an unending list of barely connected tasks until, near the end, a plot is somewhat revealed and abruptly concluded.

The game is plagued by numerous odd design decisions related to inventory management, encumbrance affecting travel speed, extremely limited fast travel, and companion control, among other issues. Despite these drawbacks, a few unique and potentially genre-defining aspects, such as satisfying character development, engaging combat (featuring an interesting but occasionally janky monster climbing system), and the pawn system, redeem the overall experience.

Despite its many negatives, Dragon's Dogma exudes a certain charm—a mishmash of exceptional ideas that, with more development time, could have resulted in a timeless experience. In 2012, it was likely something very unique, but in 2024, I would recommend playing it only if you're interested in experiencing an awkward but charming piece of gaming history.",1705888626,1705888626,True,12,1,0.653402268886566162,0,True,False,False

Combat is chunky and satisfying, and the gimmick of being able to grab, carry, and climb on monsters helps enforce the sense of freedom the developers want you to feel in their grounded, medieval sandbox world.

The Pawn system really did make me feel as though I was adventuring with a group.
Pawns have knowledge to share about quests, areas of the world, and how to fight specific monsters, and it's amazing seeing them use this knowledge in the middle of a fight.

Parts of the combat are fun, but it's pretty clunky and not very well balanced. My experience was that the game started at very hard, then went to really easy after getting the first round of good gear, to boring because eventually enemies had so much health. I ended up dropping it at the final boss because it has literally 10 health bars and limited damage opportunities, but also is pretty easy to dodge. It's a bad sign when I find myself going ""I'm bored, can this be over now?"" after about 30 minutes in the final climactic fight.

The story and characters are fairly bare bones. There were some good ideas in general with the lore and certain events, but it didn't come together for me. I guess I didn't finish it, but if a story hasn't hooked me in tens of hours, maybe there's just not much there.

Maybe this game will land better for you than it did for me. Unless you really think you'll like this type of game though, I recommend giving this one a pass.

Edit: So I beat the game. I gave in and decided to use the wiki and learned that the damage formula is apparently ""damage - enemy defense"" so if you do 210 damage to an enemy with 200 defense, the result will only be 10 hp removed. If you increase your damage by a trivial amount, it actually can multiply what you do the enemy. With upgrading my weapon to have about 4% more total power, and learning of a spell that knocks 1.5 bars off the boss HP, the final boss was trivial. Could I have figured this out with only in game knowledge? Probably not.

There's a kind of cool area that opens up at the end of the game, or more a kind of cool hub with a bunch of generic temple tunnels full of the same enemies you've been fighting the whole time (but with more defense, of course). I spent a bit more time exploring this, but my opinion on the game hasn't changed. I've played quite a few hours, but only a few had me going ""this is awesome!"" and the rest were just hoping that would happen again.",1705467026,1705774665,False,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

The story is not much to go off of, but the game play is phenomenal. You get 3 vocations to pick from at the start with 9 in total, you can swap vocations once you get to the capital which is about 8 hours in casually and 2 if you rush. Character creator is what you would expect for a 2011 release title, but you can turn yourself into Leon from Resident Evil, which is pretty cool. I am not a big fan of the party system in this game, but it is not terrible. You create 1 party member (called Pawns) and the other 2 you need to constantly replace for some other random Pawns that you recruit. The random Pawns do not increase in level while they are in your party which is why you need to replace them. Though you can spend in-game currency to recruit pawns of a higher level. The skill and combat system is a ton of fun, I enjoyed playing a Mystic Warrior with the holy enhancement and Magic Cannon combo, where I converted my damage to holy and shot magic bolts from a magic source that is placed on the ground (floating at chest height) so myself or pawns can smack it to shoot bolts at an enemy for a ranged attack.

dragon's dogma: dark arisen is an hack & slash action-rpg developed and published by capcom. it first released on xbox 360 and ps3 in may 2012, with the dark arisen expansion releasing the following year, about eleven months later in april 2013. we then got ports of the full definitive game released on pc in 2016, ps4/xbox one in 2017, and nintendo switch in 2019. it is set in an open-world environment played from a third person perspective. the visual spectacle is impressive, as the art design seamlessly blends medieval fantasy with dark undertones, creating a world that feels both enchanting and mysterious at the same time. the diverse landscapes, from lush forests to desolate dungeons, showcase the developers' attention to detail. while the graphics may not rival the latest AAA titles, the art style compensates, providing a timeless and visually engaging experience.

the narrative is a tale of epic proportions, rich in lore and intrigue. as a 100% completionist, i relished every little piece of lore scattered throughout the game that i could find. the main story, though occasionally predictable, unfolds with enough twists and turns to keep players invested. i enjoyed how the lore extends beyond the main plot as well, encouraging exploration and discovery of the setting's deep history and mythical creatures. the game also excels in character development offering a wide array of classes and skills. the vocation system allows for versatile builds catering to different play styles. the pawn system additionally adds depth to the entire experience as you can experiment with different combinations of classes and skills, which honestly becomes a highlight of each playthrough, also contributing to the gameplay's replay value. 

the combat system is honestly pretty intricate and rewards skill and strategy alike. the weight and impact of each attack/ability feels realistic, enhancing the immersion. big boss battles against colossal creatures, such as literal dragons, are a true test of one's combat prowess. the pawn AI, while occasionally imperfect, generally provides competent support throughout the entirety of a battle, especially when tailored to complement your character's abilities. 

the game is filled to the brim with quests, both major story quests and side quests/minor content, offering a plethora of content, but especially so for completionists like myself. from escort missions to monster hunting, each quest feels uniquely crafted while also being able to provide a variety of challenges. exploring every nook and cranny of world is not just rewarding like i mentioned earlier, but it is essential for those seeking 100% completion.

dragon's dogma: dark arisen is a testament to the brilliance of action RPGs. my journey through completion was a fulfilling odyssey filled with memorable encounters and awe-inspiring moments. the combination of deep lore, versatile character customization, and challenging quests ensures that every character/playthrough feels fresh and unique. while not without minor flaws, this is still considered by most to be a masterpiece in the genre, and a must-play for any RPG enthusiast. i find it a bit overrated but still think it's a solid seven or seven and a half out of ten.",1705705892,1705706005,True,39,4,0.71850121021270752,0,True,False,False

Warning: Capcom is adding unfamiliar DRM to their back catalogue of games. This corp has repeatedly shown their stance towards mods in their games as well and seem to be taking action. I would caution you against purchasing any capcom product that contains this DRM as it’s unfamiliar, and untrustworthy. For now, if you really want this game, or any capcom game, I would stress that you watch and observe to see what happens in the near-ish future. 

Please note that there is a lot of misinfo circulating about with regards to this situation. Please do your due diligence and research everything and even fact check myself before making a final judgement. I am doing the best I can to sift through the false info and properly inform myself and will update this review accordingly.

DRM is not always a bad thing, if used correctly, it protects initial sales. Then good publishers will remove it later on allowing for better experiences. I am upset when DRM harms performance, which it often does (like Jedi Survivor). I find that inexcusable, poor performance that screws over the paying customer should always be frowned upon. Recently, denuvo was removed from RE8, which is good. But, when it was first added the game suffered many problems which modders had to remedy until its removal. Enigma seems to be capcom’s replacement for denuvo.

Earlier this month, RE Rev was updated and performance was harmed. Shortly after, capcom reversed the update. This is concerning because REV was released almost 11 years ago and the game’s already been cracked (both the pc and 3ds version), as with most older games. This update to add DRM to an old game is incredibly fishy, especially with how it came with no announcement from the publishers themselves. Almost as if somebody was trying to hide it.
Denuvo a very good DRM, since there’s few who know how to crack it, even then it’s tough. Denuvo itself costs ~$5,000 per month for the license, ~$60,000 a year. A game’s sales can’t keep up with the fee forever, and the DRM has to be removed/replaced to salvage income. 

Enigma is $59,920 cheaper. It costs about $400 for initial purchase, and $80 annually for upkeep. Enigma was checked with a virus scanner, and got 34 positive flags, ~%50 of what Virus Total checks for. Scanners can have false positives. The REV .exe will show 1 positive flag (at least for me). This one is easily written off as a false positive. Generally low single digits are fine. When you are getting into double digits, there’s problem. The dev for Enigma has been purported to have a fake address in the US, and the domain name’s been alleged to be bought through a Moscow front (fact check me). This DRM is incredibly sneaky, and according to others, is capable of quietly worming its way through your PC. These factors, even if partially false, are concerning, keep this away from your pc.

On October 25 of 2023, there was a capcom R&D presentation.
“RE:2023 Anti-cheat and Anti-Piracy Measures in PC Games Recommendations for In-House Production”
14:00 – 16:00 ish. The pres states that all mods, unless officially supported, are no different than cheating. Yes, with regards to DRM, all foreign code is considered tampering. But, they go further, and say that mods tarnish the product’s (and corp’s) image as they may be mistaken for legitimate parts of said product. Earlier last July, a tournament competitor in a SF6 match forgot to disable his Chun-Li n*de mod. This is likely what capcom is referencing. But, they’ve taken things further.

Capcom is no newb to “nuking” youtube creators’ channels. They’ve removed content and channels for discussing info that the corp themselves leaked. Capcom has taken action against MH creators, most notably speedrunners. This was because their videos featured mods, some as harmless as to simply aid with running or slightly modify the experience (skins/costumes/fov). Capcom has tried to take down modders’ work as well. Yes, these modders were making n*de mods, but never the less they came after a modder, who’s to stop them from taking things further and coming for everyone else?

Considering the corp’s past and recent actions and statements, it’s safe to say that they are/will be coming after modders. People like to add that Enigma was added to RE5 last year and that no one has had any problems. Even so, ghost updates are sketchy, since there’s no point in copy protecting a long-cracked game. For now, I advise customers to watch, listen, and wait to see what the corp does. We can choose to make it apparent to them that mods are an inevitable factor of PC gaming. I know where my stance is, if I can’t use a pawn editor, then I’ll happily take my money elsewhere.

Thank you if you read this far, I’d be happy if you had any info (legit that is) or comments you’d like to share.

Warning: Pseudo-rant ahead
I have one more speculation (not an allegation or accusation, simply a theory coming straight outa my rear end). I think that modders are beginning to pose a business threat to companies like capcom. 

This corp is known to have a lot of stinker dlcs.
Example:
REV has dlc, 2 fun characters, and 4 more that suck. There’s 2 shoddy weapon reskins and 2 parts packs that boost damage. All of these things are already in the purchased game. This leads to my theory, capcom is scared of modders. We can simply repaint the base G18 and make it look like jessica’s, and have a better gun too. The same goes for parker’s gun dlc. Whip out CE and give yourself the gun parts. For one customer, the corp has lost out of possibly $4. Apply that to a large portion of the consumer base, even more money lost out.

Another, Street Fighter 6. Its dlc has one year character pass costs $30. You get 4 characters..and character colors. Not outfits, colors; and in game currency…which you can earn for free. The same goes for the $50 ultimate dlc, it just adds 2 backgrounds (stages) and some costume colors with a little extra in game currency. You can get so much more for this amount, just look at the steam reviews.

We also see modders making far better outfits for free. The recent Yor update was bad too, just a worthless reskin. So, modders will fix it and make it look better. Both of these scenarios DO harm the their image, it just shows that some dudes in blender can do so much better than a multi-billion dollar corp. 

Their claims about “public order”, I believe, are total bs. I believe this corp recognizes that it churns out dumpster fire (ignoring the rare cases like Separate Ways, which is only $10) and are too afraid to admit that they want money. At least EA is obvious abt it.

The same goes for so many other capcom dlcs.

I love these games, I am a big fan of RE, DD, MH and more. Yes, your writers often suck, but I still love the stories in these games. I love to play them, I have so many happy memories of these wonderful little gems from my childhood. I WANT to support the talented, skillful, and passionate people behind these pieces of digital-art. No not the suits, I mean the programmers, artists, musicians, voice actors, mocap dudes, sound guys etc. But, unfortunately, these people work for a corp who is rapidly growing greedier, and at a scary pace. Soon, they’ll be just another EA, a money vacuum that cares about microtransactions more than making a great experience that keeps people comin back to that game and for more in the future.

Whoever is currently in charge (in my opinion) is out of touch with what customers actually want and will support. I have blacklisted this corp from my steam page, and it will be sometime, if ever, I consider purchasing their products ever again given their recent statements, actions, practices, and routine behavior. 

End of Review.

Many ARPGs these days are ""soulslikes,"" or barely teeter on the edge of being an RPG, dipping 1 foot into a more action adventure or hack and slash combat system; (Like with what final fantasy has become). Dragon's Dogma creates its own fresh system of combat and customization with impressive user experience to boot. 

My only cons are the early game which was a slow trek to get through, and the overall game is pretty short with a small open world. Eventually as the game picks up and you get familiarized with how build-making (Vocations) and combat works and how much customization you can truly have with your character and combat style, its pretty impressive and satisfying. Also I appreciate the focus on limb-destruction when it comes to boss fights. The goal of fights isn't to dodge and deal DPS or tank through attacks like we see in so many RPGs, but to destroy limbs and other aspects of the boss, proceed to stagger it, then DPS race. 

The Pawn system is incredible as well, a system that Square Enix has been trying to nail down with their AI-controlled party for a while, but just hasn't seemed to find their footing. Dragon's Dogma nailed it. I'm excited to see what Quality of Life improvements Dragon's Dogma 2 will have

The dialogue and story is interesting at times, but nothing revolutionary. I appreciate that Capcom went with a more mature tone. You can see how Capcom really focused more so on emulating western RPGs like Skyrim with the quest freedom and design direction, rather than a light-hearted JRPG direction.

Pretty epic action rpg, if you still like games from a decade ago this ones still good. 
Retroactively this should get game of the year 2012, now way TWD got it, absolutely robbed by a mobile game... 
This game is better than Skyrim for sure. 

[h2] Should you play it before Dragon's Dogma 2? [/h2]

The 100% is quite a grind, if you are interested in catching up for the new game I would certainly recommend doing an easy mode play-through. I ran my first save on normal for 20 levels before resetting to hard mode.
In doing so I experienced much hardship and CBT but still had fun. 
This is a game that likely will require you to do your own research to figure out. 
Some of the systems are confusing at first and a lot of the quests can be missed very easily if you don't have a guide to follow. 
If you go in with these expectations it should be fun. 

[h2] Open-World Aspects: [/h2]

The traversal can be a slow process, when you are low level you have very little stamina. But if you hang in there you get access to this cool custom fast travel points system in port-crystals. These can be placed almost anywhere in the world so you can quickly get back from anywhere in the map. As you slowly collect more and more of these your speed in completing quests increases. With some smart placements of your port-crystals you can later speed-run the game in the speed-run mode and its pretty cool to see the progress you made in action. 
The day and night cycle when you are travelling in the early game feels very quick, you can set off in the morning and still be battling through the night to get into some sections. Get used to using your lamp because the game is pretty dark, probably the lack of a moon. 

[h2] The Level System: [/h2]

They have a class system called Vocations, I ran the ranged class for the entirety of the game.
They have access to different item pools and skills, but interestingly you can equip some skills from other vocations when you unlock them. It is recommenced you level up as warrior for their skill of taking less physical damage, do this at the start of the game for a slightly easier time. 
I found this system to be very fun and engaging, swapping my vocation when I maxed it out until i settled on the ranger. 
Depending on what vocation you are when you level up your base stats will level accordingly, so maybe keep that in mind for what your end game build might be. 

[h2] The Bosses: [/h2]

This game has some very cool boss designs, namely the chimera and the Ur-Dragon. 
It also has a cool system where you can jump up and climb all over these massive boss monsters to deal damage in the way of a prison style shank. 
The camera can go a bit wild when you are climbing on monsters but it's still pretty fun. 
The golem and the metal wearing ogres can go on my shit list tho. 
Side note, never do I want to see a flying enemy ever again. Any devs listening, putting small flying type enemies that exist just to stay out of your cross-hairs and to knock you down mid attack is a sin and you will be going to hell for it. Quite frankly its too late to repent. 

[h2] Customisation: [/h2]

In this game when you are creating your character your physical attributes actually matter somewhat. 
The bigger and bulkier you are the more you can carry and the less able you are to be knocked over. So if you are more interested in having a fashionable experience, your carry weight will suffer for it. Which can be kind of annoying but its still cool. 
I found the customisation to be better than some games that came out in the last few years even. 
They have some cool weapons and outfits in the game and if you are stubborn enough everything is viable. 
I beat the game in hard-mode with hardly any useful gear on, only for it to then become dragon forged and still not that great. But hey, it works. 

[h2] Quality of Life: [/h2]

If you are playing this game for the first time on hard-mode then this game does not hold your hand and you will be relentlessly beat into the ground until you learn your lesson. Save early and save often. 
When I was first playing the game with the 2x xp bow (terrible damage btw) I thought the bosses had too much health (they do) and the only balance was to buy 50 throwblasts and use those instead (this is a semi viable way to complete the game) and I wasn't entirely wrong. 
When you first run into bosses they often have a ton of health and in the late game it really feels like the devs are trying my patience. To me there are only two ways you can fight a boss, you are either way under-leveled or way over-leveled. I never felt to be in the right zone for fighting the bosses, even when I was following a guide to do 100% of the main/side quests. But again, I was using one of the worst bows for damage and had not yet discovered the thrills of blast arrows. 
Of all the bosses, offline Ur-Dragon felt like a battle of epic proportion. Well for the first two run throughs then I was resigned to waging the endless war until I could finally get the achievement. (note I was only around level 100 for this and should really have waited to level max.) 

[h2] The Story: [/h2] 

I like the story, the intro cut-scene and playing through the tutorial is all good stuff. 
It has an overarching story that is similarly meta like Dark Souls but is different enough to feel unique. 
If you like cyclical stories about the struggles of mankind then this is one for you. 

[h2] The Endings: [/h2]

For starters this game is very kind in that they allow you to watch the dark endings without having the game complete and make you do it all again, they simply reset you to before the choice is made. 10/10 does not waste your time, the devs know what the gamers want when they did this one. Unlike some recent games that make you sit through the same long winded cut-scenes you just watched to arrive at a not entirely different result. Another cool thing is that because the story is cyclical, you can see other characters who are at different points in their own story having once been chosen like you were.

[h2] The Achievements: [/h2]

I managed to 100% the game in under 100 hours. 
Playing through on hard-mode to begin with was definitely the culprit of many added hours but I have no regrets. If you are looking to 100% this game I will tell you it is very achievable, follow a guide for quests, build a strong vocation.  Good luck have fun. 

[h2] DLC: [/h2]

With very few useful guides for the DLC existing online that I could find, it was troublesome to figure out on my own. Everything is super strong so you really need to be high-leveled in order to tackle it. I had no chance at beating the final boss until I switched to easy mode on my second playthrough and level maxed, even then I had to take in hundreds of blast arrows and strength buffs. So good luck I guess. 

[h2] Crashes and Bugs: [/h2]

I had 3 or so times where I alt-tabbed and came back to a black screen and the program not responding, causing me to restart the computer because even task manager didn't know what to do. I had maybe one hard crash but for the most part it was fine, no actual performance issues. 

[h2] Conclusion: [/h2]

If you are at all interested then it is definitely worth a play-through, I believe it still holds up and is a lot of fun.

This game is inferior to many other games in the genre without mods. Mods made it better. And they weren't cheats (not what I played with anyway). To call mods just ""cheats by another name"" is to blanket statement call EVERY Capcom title a blatant rip-off of other titles - AKA Capcom is incapable of making anything original, only copycat better games. If Capcom is fine with being so reductive of an entire community they should be fine with the absolute lack of respect turned back in their direction right? And in regards to single player games, even if mods do change the experience in a way that alters their vision - who cares? If they cheat in a single player title, WHO CARES? They're only cheating themselves....

Figure Monster Hunter meets Elden Ring.... or something along those lines..
I'd say its a Solid B and maybe A.


UPDATE: I have now beat the game and I must say this game ticks all the boxes for a action/rpg.

I for the life of me can't figure out how this wasn't more popular back in the day.

The graphics are a bit dated but it is so well done I honestly don't think they could have done anything better for when it was originally made.

I just wished I would have known more back in the day about it because I feel like I missed out on years of messing around with it.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Adding drm to an old game is just nuts. So what will we have in our new ones? Terrible choice capcom. 

This isn't part of a review bomb. It's apart of people using the only means they can to speak out against your out of touch decisions. Your failure to see how mods and longevity and player agency is just beyond words. 

I loved playing this on console. I just started my journey back in this on PC. the modding community for DDDA has fixed many of the issues that CAPCOM has left. Issues with widescreen and terrible or unfinished textures. An many other things. But everyone that uses mods is cheaters in their eyes. CAPCOM using a RUSSIAN DRM like ENIGMA which you can look up and see how terrible it is should say along about whats going on over there at Capcom HQ. I want no part of it. Sad I wont even get any farther in this game. It will mess with my achievement percentage now.

It was, very different from what I've been used to and the lack of hand holding in understanding the world, lore and history, including some quests was at the time quite frustrating. However, I would pick it up again on PC years later for the memorable impression it left on me. Dragons Dogma is a title where the action of playing the game outweighs its story elements. Once I committed to beating the game, I found it to be somewhat simple and straightforward. Now in New Game+ and with the expansion under my belt I feel like I have a solid grasp on Dragons Dogma. 

The story is entertaining for me up until a particular point where it becomes very philosophical and begins tackling a lot in a short amount of time. Trying to understand most of the integral pillars of the story is only possible via reading and paying extra attention to details that do not posit themselves along the main path of the campaign. Admittedly, I took to the web after my initial completion of the game to try and understand what I just went through. After some reading, I understood the message even if it wasn't very moving or interesting, personally.  
Dragons Dogma has a number of interesting mechanics and some solid gameplay. That is what brought me back to want to play it unto completion. The story however, is quite complicated beyond the initial slay the dragon and save the world bit, which might appeal to some audiences but I found it to be jamming far too much into far too little of a space. 

I am excited for the second installment to see how they build upon the excellent combat and character handling details, especially the pawn system which is quite unique. If I had one tidbit that I wish they would have improved upon it would be the ""romance"" system. A nearly hidden mechanic that serves very little to no true purpose in the game aside from cutscene differences. Do away with it and the game does not change at all. I've enjoyed romance options in games since Harvest Moon on the PS1 and Dragons Dogma's idea for having significant others for you to interact with is, well, it's weird. Have them join you for quests at the very least.

I tell people this game is like a soft souls game mixed with Monster Hunter. You will enjoy the combat / magic system that is on offer here but as far as story and extra curricular activities go be prepared for mystery and a lot of grinding in order to access the games most difficult challenges.",1705097114,1705097114,True,0,0,0.47413790225982666,0,True,False,False

I decided to revisit this game after seeing some YouTubers review it and hearing about a long-awaited sequel on the horizon.  After actually finishing the game this time, most of my original frustrations with it are still relevant.  I found the story became intriguing way too far into the game.  Overall I feel this game had a lot of neat ideas that were simply presented poorly or half-finished.  Here's hoping the sequel has better AI and storytelling.

Original Review:
This game emphasizes the importance of team building with AI characters but the system is terrible. They constantly get in the way and your only commands to give are ""go"" ""help"" and ""come"". They will run ahead of you and when in tight corridors or dungeons, having a full party of 4 makes navigation a nightmare. There are no options for things like follow distance, aggressiveness, or any tactics whatsoever. 

Another annoyance is how enemies will simply spawn out of nowhere. There are animations for enemies like zombies crawling out of the ground and portals appearing before the enemy does but I have watched too many wolves and goblins just appear instantaneously. Also the ability to climb on large monsters to target specific body parts is ruined by removing your camera control. You are giving control to the monster when you do this, and boy do they like flail about... I don't even bother with this mechanic unless absolutely nothing else works. 

The game does get a few things right though. The combat system and vocation system are very fun. You don't have to worry about being stuck to 1 class in this game. The game world is also enjoyable to explore and the limited fast travelling really makes going beyond city walls feel like a true adventure. 

At this point I am unsure whether or not I should stick with this game to finish the story. It is just too frustrating to deal with dumb AI teammates and enemies that spawn out of thin air. It is becoming less and less fun as I go on.",1595292845,1704958351,False,3,0,0.479307353496551514,0,True,False,False

This game is the skeleton of something [b]Great[/b] or maybe even [b]Amazing[/b]. Combat is fun and smooth. There are ton of skills and multiple interesting classes (vocations) to play as. I also really like the idea behind the pawn system although the ai felt a little janky at times. The story isn't really the best but I don't think it suffers from being a bad story, more from the fact that it's not told in the best way it could have possibly been told. My major problems with the game are how janky maneuvering through the menus can be and how dull some of the open world looks. Exploration is a huge part of the game but, in my opinion, it just wasn't that interesting to look at this world.

It required some vodoo magic just to launch, it requires more of it to save. And if you forgot about it, you can launch the game normally, but you can't save. Game's UI is one of the worst I've seen. 
Basically I've just started, spent a couple of evenings on it, and I'm going to continue.
The couple of bosses I've seen so far were cool. 
It might end up to be a good game, but, man, is it a bad product, so annoying to deal with.

End-game UPD.
So if you're like me, and you've never played this game and wanted to check it after the hype about the second game - don't bother. There is almost nothing good about it. It is more like tech-demo with a couple novel ideas, then an actual game.
Story is almost non-existent. Most of the quests are farm 30 something and escort missions. There are like 5 quests that developed a story, including the very first and the very last encounters with the dragon.
Everything is very repetative. It is like whole game is Elden Ring's copypaste dungeons and nothing more. They reused sevearal dungeon layouts again and again. Same with bosses - there are very few unique ones and you encounter different variations of them again and again.
Bosses aren't too interesting either, very easy patterns, no need to learn anything. They are mostly a stat-check. Espetially considering that you may insta heal from inventory, opening which pauses the game. But if you don't have good stats, you may waste like half an hour spoon killing one boss.
Pawn system is the unique feature of the game. At any point you can hire 3 npcs (pawns) to fiollow you. One you create yourself, and two others - are copies of the ones that other players created. They are nice dummies to distract enemies, but you can't really control them. Just three commands: go, come, help - whatever they mean. So during the easier stages they doesn't matter, it is easy anyway. And in the harder stages of the game they are kind of useless, because the only reliable thing they do is die.
Big spectacular spells is probably the other thing that enjoyers would praise about the game. But how do you cast one? Well, you press a button and wait while it channels. Sometimes for like 10 seconds. And if you get disrupted, ot you had to cancel it to move away from void-zone, well then nothing happens and you have to channel again. Isn't that fun? 

So don't believe enjoyer's propaganda, don't waste your time on this one, and be very cautious about the second game. Wait for reviews, watch gameplay videos. If it will be as clunky as this one then it will be just another boring open world grind fest.",1703358686,1704841234,False,2,0,0.478223621845245361,0,True,False,False

Dragon's Dogma, a 2012 hack-and-slash title made by Capcom, definitely takes time to get used to. It tries to guide you with the missions, but the result of that is often mixed, especially if you don't listen to the quest givers properly.

You might need to give the game about 6-10 hours to sink in. Some people say that this game is a walking simulator, and I can agree with them. You are going to visit point A, go to point B and back to point A just to exchange a few dialogues; this happens often and feels like an inspiration taken from Bethesda titles like Skyrim. So expect a lot of sprinting! It can get annoying at times, especially at the beginning. But after a while, with fast travel, you'll be able to travel quickly.

The combat will feel clunky at the start; wait until you get vocations – they make the combat really fun, and the gameplay smooth. Recruiting Pawns with different classes, watching them fight beside you, has its own joy. For different sets of enemies, you'll have to recruit Pawns with different classes who can help you with a certain enemy type; this will be helpful if you want to choose Hard mode in the game. As a new player, you'll find the enemy types and boss designs to be really cool. You don't have to worry much about having a proper build for your pawns and yourself if you play the game on normal difficulty; you'll have lots of fun.

The story is pretty interesting. However, I think that it might not be for everyone; some bits and parts of the game will feel unnecessary, unworthy of your time, and boring. For me, it's been a fun experience; the story intrigued me especially the end of game. It's just the side quests that can be a pain. You might not be able to figure out and get stuck with them and end up looking for a solution on the internet, only to find out that it's glitched or that you missed a very minor detail. I suggest that you listen to the quest givers carefully as well as your Pawns as they try to guide you almost every single time. 

Apart from some of the mildly infuriating side quests, lots and lots of running; the game is solid, even for 2024. I strongly recommend that you use an ultimate sprinting mod, a mod named ""Don't Blind Me,"" and a vanilla ENB preset, or any of the ENB presets that you can find on Nexus. With these small adjustments, you can have more fun playing this 2012 title over Starfield.

Super excited to play Dragon's Dogma 2. I think I'm becoming a Capcom fanboy.",1704563801,1704783710,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

You can literally climb onto giant monsters, slicing into their: eyes, face, arms, wings, legs or nether-region and sometimes doing this is the only way to get to a weakpoint.

You can also grab and carry, just about anything, which makes those goblins you just killed into deadly throwing weapons; or just carrry an explosive barrel everywhere and lob it at anything you want dead.

The AI companions are surprisingly useful, actually gathering and scavenging resources without command. I can't emphasise how many times I've needed a crafting material, only to realise that one of my companions scavenged it themselves.

The companions also come with really cool stats, that allow different ones to help with quests or guide you around unknown lands, hell they might even know the weakness to that troublesome boss you're stuck on. Since the hired companions don't level up alongside you, it means constantly re-evaluating your team is needed for success. (My only complaint is that they don't shut up, but tbh that's all video game companions)


The way you build characters is great. You have to change and master multiple classes to get your perfect build, using their augments (equip-able buffs) to make your character fit your playstyle.

I'll help temper your expectations when you read my review. Graphically, it will look similar to RPG games of the time. The game world will also feel the same of the RPG games of the time (Example: Skyrim).

What sets this game apart is the innovative combination of RPG elements and action combat elements. You could spend 12 hours as a swashbuckling tanker, then the next 12 you might feel like playing as a supreme mage raining fireballs. At first glance, players may not notice, but this game has part damage (if the intro battle didn't explain already).

As such, you could play as an archer and snipe cyclop's eye and tell your minions to beat TF out of it. Or you can be Guts from Berserk, sweep and slice enemies all around you. Heck, you could be a super nuisance mage with mainly using debuff spells. So many ways to fight and so many ways you can play with your Pawn.

For example, I was fighting a Griffin once and it was just flying around teasing us while we were helpless on the ground. I used my shield to signal my Strider pawn to get launched high up in the air and forced the griffin down with a Skull Splitter. Another battle with an Ogre, my pawn with a skull crusher 2 handed hammer broke it's legs. Allowing me to perfectly hit a fully charged overhead greatsword swing onto it's neck, killing it instantly from 40% health.

Combat is insane. This is why I love this game.",1704526992,1704526992,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-The game has a lot of neat ideas, but absolutely nothing feels flushed out.
-The world is huge, empty, and you backtrack way more than you explore new areas. 
-Basic mobs take forever to kill regardless of how powerful you are.
-Climbing is glitchy at best, borderline suicidal at worst, and generally offers no real benefit.
-NPC's are shallow husks that send you on a lot of escort quests, passive kill quests, and sometimes a story mission. 
-There is no sorting side quests and main quests. They're all in a single log in the order you obtained them.

Here is an advice , If you want to load your manual save do not do it from menu , as doing so will put you back to inn/riftstone save , return to main menu without saving , or dying and select retry to load your manual save , IF it isn't overwritten by auto save .

Alt-tab in fullscreen , high chance to crash
Alt-tab in windowed , some chance to crash if you keep it too long
No borderless windowed
No option to set game running in background when alt-tab
Being a singleplayer game this game lock you to one save file , and autosave is almsot non-existences , you can manual save at anywhere in the game , but loading last checkpoint from the same menu that you do manual save in put you back to inn/riftstone savepoint , this has caused some grief when i play it , i hate this , and i malded over it .
Awkward subtitle if you decide to play the game in Japanese voiceover .
User unfriendly UI , it is expected from console port , but only able to display 12 type of item when you can easily have more than that with no shortcut feature make using tools and consumables annoying .

It's also one of the few games that clearly took inspiration from Souls without just making a 1:1 copy. The online component is an unique take on players helping each other asynchronously, something we only saw again in 2020 with Death Stranding.

Gameplay is fun. A bit of a thoughtless hack'n slash where the gear matters more than skill. It starts off really hard and with the heavy ""wait and punish"" combat, but by the end it allows for some ridiculously overpowered skill combinations. I might be tempted to say that it ""didn't aged well"", but fuck it, I still enjoyed it far more than a lot of modern titles. It's fun, that's something Capcom always put in their list of priorities even in their bad games.

The attention to detail is quite impressive at times, like making heavier characters activate pressure plates faster and taller ones having more reach in melee weapons. The oil lamp goes out if you roll in the water. Metal conducts electricity so every armored enemy is a walking ""please thunder magick me"" sign. There's one quest that allows you to forge the delivery item and ""complete"" the quest twice by delivering it to both people who want it. It doesn't actually change events later, which is a shame, but these things make the game more memorable by itself.

Sadly, the story is a trainwreck. Starts off fine and honestly stays at mostly ""OK fodder"" throughout its play time, but the ending throws it all away. It's clearly not a narrative-focused game, yet the ending tries to pretend it is and... It doesn't pull off gracefully. At all. It's so messy that it makes me wonder if the second game will just quietly never acknowledge the events of the first game, or will ""reboot"" it entirely but this time trying to flesh it out.

Dragon's Dogma is a great game, but also visibly an incomplete one. It's a game where you can see the signs of ""crap, we've blown the entire budget. Wrap it up and release it NOW"", a sign that is depressively common in the gaming industry. It's still a good game on it's own right and worth playing it, but clearly doesn't reach its full potential.",1704394777,1704394777,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This is an old game and the expectation should be low.
The UI is terrible, very confusing and it was build for controller. The PC port barely change anything other than mapping controller button to keyboard. 

The inventory management is terrible too, your character has limited weight. You can easily reach heavy weight just by picking up items in 10min. Unlike elden ring where only equipped armor is count as your weight, here, every item counted and you have plenty of item to pick up. Crafting material, various potion and herb, plenty of gear for each classes. It is a nightmare to organize your inventory.


The redeeming point for this game is the combat system. Here, you fight big monster and the combat is pretty fun. Each monster have weak points and you are rewarded if you can hit them. You can climb the big monster to reach the weakpoint or shoot it with ranged weapon.

I was playing this and wandering a grassy plain when there was a loud skree from above. I turned the camera and saw it. There was huge griffin flying towards me! I dodge rolled out of the way as it swooped in and landed, shaking the ground and kicking up dust particle effects as my controller rumbled furiously.

 My party members began their attack first, hacking at its legs and knocking off a talon which prompted it to take off and flee in response. I acted quickly and grabbed onto its hind leg right as it took flight then began climbing up towards its head, As it ascended far beyond the point where i could survive fall damage, it frantically bagan spiraling and bucking mid air to try and throw me off. My stamina bar was draining fast but there was no going back. 

It was do or die epic gamer time so i persisted in climbing up its huge body until i reached its head. I then latched my legs around its neck and began stabbing it in the back of its skull with my flaming dual daggers, setting its feathers ablaze and sending it careening downwards. I rode its burning corpse down into the ground like a meteor and leapt off just before it came skidding through the dirt, reducing my fall damage just enough to narrowly avoid death. My character tumbled across the ground until she stopped and stood up. With just sliver of health left, my healer cast a healing spell as i walked over to relieve the still burning remains of its loot. 

None of this was in a cutscene. No quick time events or cinematics of any kind. Not even part of the story or a sidequest. 100% pure action packed gameplay against a monster that decided to show up randomly as i explored.

The combat is passable, it functions but it also doesn't feel like its own, it is like shadow of the colossus trying to be a final fantasy game in that you can cast a big spell and hurt a monster or you can climb the monster and hurt them that way, climbing isn't really all that good, just gets in the way and often times just isnt really necessary or called for.

Traveling also takes too long, you have a couple things you can do to make some of it quick but theres only a little bit of fast travel, ultimately you will be wandering valleys and country sides for most of your gameplay wondering to yourself why you would bother fighting enemies under various conditions or which quest actually progresses the story.

Speaking of story there isn't one, theres cutscenes but there isn't a story, thats vague but it is genuinely the situation, you start the game and get an introduction to a dragon and from there a loose concept of whoever kills said dragon is the head honcho, but from there people just sort of babble at you in really bad Shakespearean and the game just expects you to decipher everything from a quick conversation for really most quests.

Hey lets talk about progression, and the fact that once you have SOME of your armor you will likely hit a wall and be expected to advance the game, as well as start chasing upgrades before you have a set of gear you like using, or can meaningfully enchant anything to begin with, this is all coupled with what honestly just feels like a really really small and limited item table, i don't know how anyone plays ""fashion"" in this game when there aren't really that many ""outfit"" ideas to be had from whats available.

The game itself features an extensive map, making it easy to get sidetracked while on a mission. It's rich and fun to explore – I've often paused a mission to spend two hours exploring a random cave or venturing into areas my level couldn't quite handle yet. That's the real joy of the game.

The combat system is a delight in itself. From the very beginning, you realize how solid the mechanics are, allowing you to grab and climb on enemies, even if it's considered ""old.""

I have no comments on the soundtrack of this game; it's simply wonderful.

Character creation is very comprehensive; you can easily craft characters from other worlds within the Dragon's Dogma universe. There are even many tutorials on YouTube for creating specific characters in the DDDA world. You can even determine the personality of the main pawn according to your taste.

I've played almost 100 hours, and this was one of the games that kept me up at night, like caffeine trying to keep me awake 24/7, and I regret nothing about it.

Now, it'll be a few more hours until I get the platinum trophy. Here's a tip if you're interested in platinum: follow a tutorial because there are side missions that can be missed by changing chapters, and you can't go back to replay them.

Armor is a mess.  Rather than using a percentage system like nearly every other game in existence this uses a straight reduction.  So it's entirely possible to run into one random enemy in a bunch that you just can't hurt, even though you 2-3 shot all of his allies.

AI is garbage.  Yeah there are options for editing it but there's little explanation as to what any given value means, there's almost no manual control since the orders you can shout are largely ignored, and if we're going to have the option to truly edit the values then just let us set what we want and leave them.  Having to go back and keep tweaking things to keep the bots from doing something stupid gets old.  And that's only for the pawns, if you're on an escort quest and your ally decides to engage an enemy they can't hurt then congrats, you failed.  They actually found a way to make escort quests even worse.

The quest system is pretty junk.  I had several ""kill x enemy"" quests that as soon as I took them the creature type in question stopped spawning in the world.  One of which was extremely obvious since it was seabirds that were everywhere until that exact moment.  You'll lose access to quests ridiculously quick with no warning or reason.  An early quest lead me straight into a group with an invulnerable enemy so I assumed I just needed to circle back and handle it after getting some upgrades, but one mainline quest later and it was failed.

The sorcerer begins preparing a devastating fire spell, while the warrior charges forward with his massive sword to meet the beast. As the griffin sustains more and more damage, it takes off to the skies, trying to regain the advantage. The mage (not to be confused with the sorcerer) infuses the ranger's arrows with the element of fire, and they both manage to return the monster back to the ground.

It is just that I found the spawn mechanic boring. It is hardly a new thing in action RPGs, but making them boring emotionless puppets on purpose which you cannot even actively control beyond the most basics made it feel unnecessary and clunky. 

The narrative at points also lacked focus at some points, leaving me wondering around not sure what to do except grinding and blind exploration. Don't get me wrong, I love exploration, but I prefer to be able to progress the story once I am done with it. The lack of any fast travel mechanics (except returning home) did not help.

Way too dark in caves and at night makes combat infuriating.
Missions painfully slow, I had a 15 minute escort mission moving at a snails pace.
Side quests have no map markers and are uninteresting.
Lack of proper auto-save and multiple save file slots that can only be fixed with mods is egregious.
Minimal instructions on how to use other weapons outside of the sword and shield in the tutorial.

Lantern gets put out if you step in water, I have to go into my inventory, un-equip my lantern, exit my inventory menu, wait 3 seconds for my character to slowly un-equip my lantern, then go back into my inventory to re-equip my lantern. All this for it to get put out by water 20 seconds later.

Extremely railroaded story, I wanted to go back into the village to fight the dragon instead of fighting him on the beach and I hit an invisible wall and a cut-scene force started where I was teleported back on the beach getting hurt by the dragon.

Realising there was a maximum carry weight made me not want to pick up the random items I find which was most of the fun.
Graphics and lighting even when adjusted with mods look very lacking.
The starting village was bland, bleak, with no soul. I'm not taking pity on this world if it's not even beautiful enough to be worth protecting.

Barely any room for creativity in combat or story, I felt the game was telling me ""you will enjoy this story because I told you so and there's nothing you can do about it"" but I definitely didn't consent to this madness.

Into Free -Dangan- is a really good song, you should listen to it and otherwise just give this train wreck of user experience a miss.

On the one hand, there's a lot of not very good stuff in it: godawful english voice acting (Japanese one is waaay better), pretty confusing story, strict timetable that can lock you out of some quests just because you've STARTED some main quest, pawns AI can be annoyingly bad (like if you got captured and they don't do sht to free you, so you have to mash A/D), beloved system, save system.

But on the other hand, I love this game. Music is top notch (especially in the Bitterblack Isle and late game Everfall) , you can do surprisingly cute MC, there's huge amount of freedom. Combine equipment however you want - will still look good probably (unless it's silk tights); do any class with any skills at ANY point in the game - got bored playing as a all-powerful sorcerer? just switch to assassin that can solo ANYTHING; you can change your pawn at any pawn too, so they are better suited to your play style at the moment; you can explore almost all of the map after doing just a couple starting quests; you can combine almost every item to create another item; you can kill enemies by just grabbing them and tossing them of the cliff. Really, gameplay is where this game shines.

Story is pretty confusing, it's a bit disappointing that there's [spoiler]no good ending for the MC[/spoiler], it's really annoying how much of a bias there's for beloved characters. Like, it's so obvious that Alienor is meant to be canon beloved - it pisses me off. And also, all of the main girl beloved have epilogue dialogue, yet not a single male has one? The hell.
The big battle and the ending are pretty epic though.

The graphics are fit for purpose, some idle and walking animations are wonky, but the monsters move REALLY well! Dragon's Dogma 2 (which was announced around the time I wrote this) is going to look and feel gorgeous.

The character designer is really good - albeit with some wonkiness - and I've seen some amazing and hilarious ones online.

Combat is quite fun. Strongly recommend a controller rather than KB and mouse. 

I gravitated towards the magic classes and finished the game as a Sorcerer. As others have mentioned, I also feel it makes the normally ""stand in the back and shoot things"" nature of the magic classes more fun and ""crunchy"" to use. I never got bored of Maelstrom, the tornado spell. There are some enemies that are frustrating for a Sorcerer, but making sure you have a Strider and Fighter for companions helps a lot

If you are very particular about waifus (or husbandos), I strongly recommend reading the wiki and other discussions about the ""Beloved"" mechanics. The game WILL railroad you into 2 choices, and thankfully I was able to avoid that (but at the cost of skipping a mission and getting arrested 😆).

Only downside for me is in order to get the best and coolest gear and weapons, there is a lot of grinding involved with a ""dungeon"" called Bitterblack Isle. I don't have the patience and gacha / %age mechanics for finding gear just annoy me. But this might be a positive for those who enjoy perfecting their dungeon runs.   

The main story is actually really short. A lot of time as a n00b is spent exploring the world and finding out where things are, which adds time. Rolling into a New Game+ keeps all the map knowledge and gear you have collected, so each game is more streamlined.

1. The combat system. Climbing up monsters, epic sorcerer attacks and variety of skills for each class
2. The ability to change class mid-game gives you the option to try all special skills for each class without restrictions.



Cons
1. Story, presentation and lore. Bad dialogue and the story makes no sense at times and it gets way over its head in my opinion - trying to be philosophical and clever. Everybody talks like when Joey found the online thesaurus. Underwhelming and anticlimactic bosses, at least in the main story.  I won't be playing the expansion (Bitterblack isle)
2. Lack of commands makes the pawns a bit harder to use - they tend to be  stupid.
3. The silent protagonist acts more like a pawn than the pawns. He/she stares at the void with a stupid look on his face in every cutscene.   
4. Too many items that are way too similar make the looting tedious and the whole exploring thing feels kind of, empty to me. 99% of items you find, you don't really need them, as they are not better than the equipment you already have 
5. Although the skills have variety and are very good overall, some are implemented in a way I did not like and the classes have too many restrictions. For example, the roll should be a core skill - not a dagger skill - if I know the skill to roll, why can I roll with the dagger, but can't I do it with a sword? And if  I know how to roll as an assassin, what's stopping me to roll when I become a sorceress? Also, no crouching or any form of stealth - assassin class excluded. 
6. The whole interface of the inventory and player profile/status seems unpolished to me. Tedious crafting system with little explanation, tedious comparing of items and class skills. No skill-stats to compare which skill is stronger etc.
7. Mediocre music

Summary
1. I have played almost 50 hours and it's all because of the combat system. It's a fun game to play. I did the main quest and stopped there, because I've tasted the gameplay - which was the reason I played this game - and now I'm full. I don't want to play the expansion. Everything other than the combat system was unpolished and/or mediocre at best. 

I recommend this game for it's combat, but personally I wouldn't do more than one playthrough.",1703757563,1703757679,True,1,0,0.507874011993408203,0,True,False,False
367500,154612294,76561198094985434,0,3,3801,0,2093,1704736460,"The combat's a blast, no doubt about it. But let's call a spade a spade – the story is pure dogshit. I mean, how do you mess up a fantasy setup where your main premise is taking down a fucking dragon? It's like the ABCs of fantasy, and yet, they delivered it like a blindfolded kid swinging at a piñata. To break down the story first:

[b]1. Your Character:[/b]
So, you kick off as a humble fisherman, right? Your village gets trashed by the dragon, and you decide to step up. Cool. But here's the kicker – you work your way up, gear up, get stronger, and when it's showdown time with the dragon, you still look like a mumbling moron. Teeth out like some mutt trying to scare off a burglar. And here's the cherry on top – you don't talk. At all. This leads to some seriously awkward cutscenes. I get we're supposed to fill in the blanks, but when your character's interactions with the NPCs are so off (It gets especially awkward because they really tried to use words like ""Aught"" or try to talk like ""I see it's best if we bla bla or summit like it"" like it's supposed to be medieval talk, I guess? But it's delivered so awkwardly that it's simply too noticeable.), it's hard to step into their shoes. Speak up, dammit! And the lack of choices for your character? Come on! When the Duke accuses you of dragon conspiracy, defend yourself! Show him the dragon loot or something. Nope, you just run like you've got a traitor's stamp.
And the forced ""beloved""? I never liked her, but apparently, I gotta save her to fight the dragon? Why? And why doesn't my character care about her initial betrayal? They just follow her orders like a lost puppy.

[b]2. The Main Story:[/b]
Dragons and fantasy – easy, right? Nope, they tried so hard to make it deep. After beating the dragon, it's supposed to be a victory lap, but nah, you get tossed out of the capital you saved, and no one vouches for you. Not the people you've helped, or the ones you've saved, nothing. And the story gets so confusing in the second half. Defeat the dragon, and instead of fireworks, you end up in some oblivion. Inconsistencies and loose ends with the side quests also pile up, and it's a hot doodoo.

[b]3. Relationships (Affinity) System:[/b]
Building relationships with NPCs by giving them gifts? Mentioned once or twice, but who's got the time to figure out what each NPC likes? And what's the deal with the importance of these relationships? Does it affect quests? Who knows? And the story's inconsistencies spill into relationships too. Duke's wife betrayed you, but when you face the Duke, it's business as usual. You helped the knight Ser Maximilius (?) with the Salvation cultists, after he personally asked you for that favor, he will say ""I've known you were a villain from the start!"" when the Duke said you coerced with the dragon. Did everyone get amnesia? Why bother raising affinity when they love you one day and hate you the next?

And then there are those moments where you think, ""Can I do that?"" but chicken out because you're scared the game will glitch. It's a mood killer. The quest system? Walking to quest marks 80% of the time, only to get sent back to the same spot after reporting? Lazy as hell. Give your pawns a bunch of port crystals, teleport everywhere, and save yourself from hearing them repeat the same yap over and over.

in conclusion:
- [b]Combat 8.8/10:[/b] It's a lot of fun, only minus is the fact that once you have progressed a lot in the ""physical"" or ""magical"" vocations, switching mid game would make your character really weak and half-assed as opposed to try and at least min max a little bit. The enemy types are varied enough even though it can be summarized into like 10 different enemy types.
- [b]Story 0/10:[/b] Absolute dogshit. Stick to the cliché story, and at least do that well. This narrative is a train wreck.

Just get the game if you want to get introduced to Dragon's Dogma, the JRPG equivalent of the Souls series, it's a blast, but prepare for the worst narrative of all time.",1703754581,1703754581,True,2,0,0.530956864356994629,0,True,False,False

I didn't like it at first - YEARS AGO - because I thought it was a poorly done Dragon's Age rip off with barely anything to do but now I realize it's not like that at all. It's not even a soulsborne-like RPG either. This game is it's own thing and once you get over the opening - which is a slog and I think a reason why a lot of people abandon this gem - the game picks up and is absolutely amazing.

There are some gripes that I have though - like the fast travel system and some UI and UX issues - but the fun to be had in this game far outweighs them.  I cannot wait for Dragon's Dogma 2 to come out.

If you're a fan of Elden Ring you need to play this game since it understood a lot about creating a living open world - without Ubisoft levels of random markers and shit to do - and it's cool to see that kind of design a decade or so before Elden Ring came out.  

It's just fun running around in this world and fighting things. Once you realize how the story is doled out (a few main mission 'objectives' at a time and a TON of 'goals' you can just ignore and let auto complete through osmosis then you can lock in on the story and the pacing picks right up.

Also, fighting giant monsters and climbing over them Shadow of the Colossus style never gets old and all the abilities are amazing; even if the weapon and armor variety leave a lot to be desired.

I also like  how the game simplified leveling up since it's a lot like Skyrim where you level up stats by playing the game and you invest into new abilities that you can swap out at any time but you need to go to a special NPC to do it.

As of writing this review I haven't done the post game quests (yet). It took me ~16 hours to beat main story on normal difficulty, I didn't really do any side quests and did use fast travel.

Dragon's Dogma is a game that surprised me in multiple ways. There are a couple gripes I have with the game, but nothing [i]game[/i] ruining, I will talk about those first.

The stamina system isn't the greatest; it works well in combat, but when you have to run (you will do a lot of running between locations) it is very annoying. Running between locations is actually quite fun even though it takes a while, the world is just good.

Pawns are one of the main mechanics of this game, definitely the one that sets it apart from other games the most. Overall they are good, but they can be very very stupid some times and were the only cause for frustration for me.

Another minor thing that I don't like is that there is no ultrawide support, the game is a bit older so it can be forgiving but still disappointing.


Those were about my only complaints, now the good parts.

I got this game because it is praised for its combat and god, it is just amazing. There is a lot of freedom in how you take on foes and it does not get boring at all. You can choose between 9 vocations and all of them are very different. I played as a warrior (big two handed sword/hammer) and it was really enjoyable except for flying fuckers. The difficulty was perfect, it never got too easy or too hard, normal is definitely the way to go for your first playthrough.

The pawn system is another thing that is praised by the fanbase and it was more fun than I expected. Opposed to other games, your pawns are actually usefull. They pick up things you do (looting and how you attack) and are very usefull in general. The game was designed with pawns in mind so playing without them would be a bad idea for your first playthrough.

This game also nails atmosphere, and world and enemy design. It has the perfect medieval fantasy feel to it and so do the enemies. Even though the map is quite small, it feels really big and grandiose due to the big structures and height differences. Quite a lot of enemies are based on Greek Mythology and every one of them is fun and cinematic to fight. Enemies have weak spots, are weak to certain elements and can be climbed on. The music also fits perfectly.

I also enjoyed the progression, you feel stronger every time you get a new piece of gear/skill. I never got OP, but still felt quite strong at the end of the game. Some enemies are really tough at the start and midway through the game you can dominate them.

The story and characters are ok, good enough to give purpose to whatever you are doing but nothing special.


If you want a medieval fantasy RPG with amazing gameplay and atmosphere, get this.

ETA:
I also did the post game content and that took me another 3-4 hours, quite a bit harder than the main game.Definitely do it though, there are new enemies and enemy combinations that make for interesting battles. I did skip out on the entire DLC, because that is apparently quite difficult and I would have to grind a lot to take that on [i]I think[/i]. So the main story + post main story with very little side quests and using fast travel took me ~20 hours.",1703707998,1703729011,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Weirdly enough, this game has some dark souls ideas like the interface, medieval scenery (Red dragons/bridges), one save slot, terrible menus, lots of item descriptions (Obviously it's not a souls like). 

For me, the game didn't age well. Walking/running in a ""open world"" relying on stamina and later on a move set (to save stamina, mind you) is tedious, later you can have a kind of fast travel that is awful, but better than nothing. Inventory management is also a tedious task, with so many items, no sort option and good luck finding out what overencumbered you. Also to solve some quests you need to look for a internet guide, because the game expects that you will eventually talk with the right NPC or stumble on the correct area... which is also tedious. The fights are most of the time good, but there are many enemies that felt like bullet sponge and will required a lot of time just repeating the same strategy until they are defeated. I started playing on Hard mode, but there are so many BS and waste of time that i gave up.

There are some good ideas here and there and I'm being a little harsh just because of the hype for the second installment.  Hopefully more quality of life will be there.

In one hand, I never heard of Capcom is good at making Western Fantasy RPGs, Capcom had like none at that time. In the other hand, there are games who had well known in this genre already, e.g Elder Scrolls, Dragon Age franchise. In short, best FRPGs based on western culture are made from western studios, they knew what they were doing, like pretty well, to my knowledge. Though I wasn’t particularly fond of this genre, why would I give this game a special pass? So I ignored it.

Now let’s fast forward time to this present day. Dragon’s Dogma 2 was announced and incoming within a few months. It has a far better presentation and advertisement, undoubtedly, it met my definition of what a modern game suppose to be, so it got my attention. Because it is a continuation of the 1st game, I brought it's ancestor, in hope through the journey of the first one, will eventually help me have a better understanding and experience in the 2nd entry of this franchise.

However I was wrong, I regretted the choice I’ve made.

After playing Dragon’s Dogma Dark Arisen for several hours, I went back to it's store page, to check whether my eyes had some problems or not. Because I can’t believe the game is from Capcom, a company who produced extremely high quality games like Resident Evil Remakes, Street Fighter franchise. I have double checked the time when this game was out, that’s right, the year of 2016. The very same year that Rise of the Tomb Raider landed us a mind blow experience in video games history. On the contrary, this game looks so ancient as if I dig it from somebody’s gravestone and started playing right away.

Here’s an image I shot. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3121839878
Did you notice the strange look of this poor guy? He looked like a terrible dwarf with an unusual big head as if he had some kind of sickness. I guess this is what happens when you hid yourself in a well for too long.
The character model of this game is horrible, I can barely make myself a satisfied character in order to hop into this world. Not to mention, the environment overall looks rough too, specially for a player who has just finished Avatar: The Frontiers of Pandora. I had hard time to adjust myself to pick up this game right from the beginning. Alright, if comparing to a game of 2023 was not fair, I don’t think I need to link a video of mine from Rise of the Tomb Raider here to back up my argument, do I?

Capcom, if you want to make an open world RPG or other genres with a large world to explore, the world itself must look real, it is how this genre works, OK? It’s not an JRPG of anime style, graphics doesn’t really matter.

If graphics are horrifying wasn’t bad enough, does the gameplay any better, so I misjudged it somehow? Unfortunately, not really.

Despite I am not too far in the game while writing this review, the mechanics of the gameplay isn’t too awful, but nothing impressive either.
The game doesn’t teach me too much at this stage, but I would still prefer a place to review all tutorials I’ve learnt so far. Not trust my memories for everything, you’re not the only game I am playing at the same time after all, DDDR. And some design choices are questionable. E.g there aren’t any level recommendations for all kinds of quests, the enemies don’t have any level indicators on their head, which resulted me having no clue of what kind of danger I am running into. It’s a red flag for an open-world RPG to be honest. Because, sometimes enemies are very weak, sometimes, they’re too OP even though they don’t look like it. E.g sometimes, I received a quest like sleeping for a while then suddenly facing a hydra head on the next day which making me look like a fool in front of my display. I don’t feel shame of running away from powerful foes, but I do mind knowing what I am doing, not bumping into some kind of challenge without consideration. Half of the time, the game feels random and unpredictable, and illogic, sometimes too. This is one kind of question.

The system of the game is rather complex than I’d expect. However, some details need more extra care. Like, weapons and gears can be upgraded, so when you purchase a new one, the comparison should base on the base status of what you’re equipped and what you are going to buy, otherwise we will have no idea of which one is better to go. The materials you need for leveling up  gears should be highlighted somewhere in the menu, in case you coming across them while exploring the map but forgetting what they are called. Specially the game followed the Witcher’s tradition, the weight system. So you are unlikely going to pick up everything you found in the game. What are needed and what are not, should be clear. Again, the option of doing so is none.

Last, the game has only 1 save. To my experience, 1 save is a risking thing to begin with. Devs gotta be extremely confident of their games by doing so, which means there won’t be any ‘accident’ at any given stages of the game. Because if it were, we got problems. If a bug triggers in any part of the main quest line for example, 1 save could get me stuck. I have to beg the game is bug/issue free through the entirely long road ahead.

I don’t want my review being super long, so I am going to stop listing more flaws here. Generally speaking, DDDR fell into a mediocre RPG that I do not feel a strong desire to continue, despite I will still try. In other words, it’s too boring to play it for long judging by the content it represents.

In conclusion, I would recommend skipping this game, just wait up to jump into the 2nd game straight away. There’s no need for a backtracking this time.",1703439895,1703440250,False,9,5,0.449099838733673096,0,True,False,False

As need arises, you can change the jobs and equipment of the pawns and issue orders to them. You can also hire the pawns of other players to round out your party and they can hire yours. The pawns can carry messages and gifts to other players along with helping them in combat, which is a very original way of adding an online component to a single player rpg. If Dragon's Dogma had been more popular I could see a lot of games stealing this pawn system, and when Dragon's Dogma 2 comes out and inevitably competes with BG3 and the like, other developers may take notice. 

The story seems to be your standard ""you are the chosen one"" quest where you are trying to stop a world ending event from happening. I don't really care for a lot of video game stories, and this one feels pretty basic. The world is very nicely built though, full of lore, and unfolds and expands as you play in a satisfying way. There are some very 2012 bits of graphical, UI, and combat jank, and some of the monsters get a bit repetitive after you encounter them a few times. The graphics really aren't a problem, if you have played the original Dark Souls they are about on par with that. I believe Capcom used whatever engine they make Monster Hunter or Resident Evil to make this so despite it looking a little old it's perfectly fine with some blocky effects and low res textures here and there. The menu system is not great though, in fact it's right down there with Skyrim among the worst ones I have seen. You end up scrolling through huge lists of items and each of your four party members has their own inventory. It gets very tedious when you become overburdened and have to go back to the inn in town and do a bit of inventory management before you can do anything else. 

The combat is pretty great overall, but it does get repetitive sometimes, but the repetition is made up for by ambition. Along with the pawn system, the combat has a few really nice touches. There is a lot of different types of magic flying around and fast paced action. The classes all feel different to play, some more than others, but the three starting classes are your standard tank, melee dps, and ranged magic/healer. There are 9 total classes including 3 hybrid ones to branch out into. You can switch in and out of them any time and this is necessary in order to meet various threats and continue leveling up once you max out in your original class. It was really funny to switch from a mage to a rogue type about 20 hours in, because suddenly I didn't know how to do combat encounters all over again. The game feels pretty fresh like that as you change classes, but you can make up for inexperience by having solid pawns to round out your party while you learn a new thing.

My favorite part of the combat in Dragon's Dogma is the ability to climb up on large monsters and attack different parts of their body. Because it is played as a party of 4, you often get ambushed by a large gang of enemies and have to use all the strategies available to you such as crowd control, tanking, and healing. I think it also is worth highlighting that the combat is real time, unlike some of the more wellknown AAA games at the time. This is quite the achievement for a game from this period when all they had to do was copy Bioware. In combat the AI pawns are competent, and rarely felt like my npc party was lacking in ability but not overpowered either. Since you can swap classes and pawns in and out, you never feel like anything is a brick wall and this encourages players to try different things and innovate rather than cheesing encounters with OP strats. This balance of constant fair challenges and a good set of tools and systems for any occasion is very commendable on Capcom's part.

 I think the music and sound are probably the weakest part of this game, with an (imo) obnoxious main menu theme, generic fantasy music in game, and a lot of repetitive audio cues. Your npc party will constantly call out when they see a monster and what its weaknesses are, which is really irritating when you hear them screaming about goblins or wolves for the thousandth time. Other callouts are useful though such as advice about where to go next so it's a mixed bag. Overall it's a shame that this game didn't get the recognition it deserved at the time, but I recommend it as a really solid rpg if you like fantasy and a party based tactical experience. And it's usually really cheap so pick it up for $5 and have a good time before the sequel comes out.",1703207218,1703207218,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I want to ask, “why don’t more people know about this game?” 

And the answer is, I don’t know. In fact, I’ve only recently discovered it myself. And that discovery was purely by happenstance, reading an article on Gameranx called, ""31 Best PC RPGs of All Time""

So I said to myself, what the hell – let’s give it a shot. And it turned out to be one of my favorite games of all time. 

It’s such an incredibly good game. And yet, so few people know about it. 

Now having played it for hundreds of hours, I have to 100% agree with Gameranx…. it's definitely one of the best RPGs of all time.

And for those of you on Linux, it runs beautifully on Linux Mint, Linux Mint Debian Edition and MX Linux… and very likely many other distributions. But those are the three I’m using.   

And to boot, I'm currently playing this on my oldest computer… K9A2 Platinum Motherboard…  AMD Phenom X4 970…  8GB DDR2…  and a GTX 750 Ti graphics card. 

So if it works for me on this old rig, it’ll certainly run like a charm for you. 

~/~

Update: For whatever reason this game no longer works on Linux Mint 21.2… so I’ve switched over to MX Linux 23.1 and it works like a charm. 

Maybe something is going on with Ubuntu upstream; I’m not certain. But I feel much better using a Debian Based distribution – and as it turns out, not only does it work flawlessly – but it’s much faster.",1652132696,1703206475,True,8,1,0.573556125164031982,0,True,False,False

- Heterochromia (two different colored eyes): Most modern games with character creation have this feature, so I can say I was delightfully surprised to see the feature in this game, being 11 years old as of this review.
- Body Scaling: I believe this game went above and beyond for body scaling. Weight and height are factors that change statistics in-game, like weight capacity, stamina, and stamina regen. Also short characters can crawl through small spaces. Large characters (If I'm not mistaken) can pin down enemies of a certain size. Also gender matters. Some enemies target certain genders.
- Pawn creation: Not only can you change how you look, but you can also change how your pawn looks. YOUR pawn is basically your right hand man/woman etc.

I've only played the Dark Arisen version of Dragon's Dogma, and apparently, the original version was even WORSE about limiting your fast travel abilities. Yet the expanded version of the game STILL feels like it is CONSTANTLY punishing you by making you revisit locations you've been to three to four times previously. Oh, you didn't leave a port crystal there? Too bad. Now you're making the same trek to the same, unchanging location YET AGAIN, and what do you get for your trouble? The same mobs, the same encounters, and maybe, if you're lucky, one or more of the same mini-bosses you've already seen half-a-dozen times already.

I'm sorry, but the fast travel system feels like a punishment in this game. It forces you to micromanage where you leave your travel points, of which you have very few versus the number of locales in the game's map, and if you happen to forget to leave one behind, or you happened to pick it up because you were JUST THERE and you assume there's NO POSSIBLE WAY you'll have to return to it two quests later, too bad. Run miles upon miles while watching your dumb ass character endlessly run out of breath if you dared to equip them with heavy armor. It's so much worse if you're the sort of player who wants to be prepared with items and curatives to make combat easier -- they just weight you down more, and while you can distribute them amongst your pawns, eventually the absurdity of having to manage your wares becomes so obnoxious and time-consuming that you'll probably say ""fuck it"" and just endure running out of breath every thirteen seconds.

The combat in the game is fun, but it, too, becomes repetitive after a while, and switching between vocations only diminishes this problem to a certain extent. The story is INCREDIBLY bland and generic fantasy, the characters are all but devoid of unique personalities, you're yet another silent protagonist so YOU have no personality outside of whatever stupid, pointless choices you make, and for the most part, unless you go out of the way to handicap yourself, you will invariably be forced to grind until the enemies become comically weak against you unless you avoid every single random encounter, of which there are so, so many. This shouldn't be a problem, but after a while, fighting a pack of wolves that can knock you over but can't really damage you gets SO FUCKING BORING that you'll find yourself sprinting past them, only to run out of stamina YET AGAIN so that they can knock you on your ass.

There is the seed of a fantastic experience buried in this game, but it's bogged down by so much fluff, so much padding and so much POINTLESS FUCKING LONG-DISTANCE WALKING that it becomes insignificant in the grand scheme of your experience. I'm still vaguely interested in the sequel, but only if they streamline travel somehow. Otherwise, I'm done with this series.",1702853906,1702853906,False,14,2,0.497218132019042969,0,True,False,False

For example the unlockable augments you can use to create your build are often unclear or outright misleading in their descriptions, and learning how to best make use of your AI companion pawn requires an understanding of several mechanics that in-game sources don't properly provide. The actual value of augments that boost stats like stagger/knockdown or your own resistance to it are hard to parse given the large enemy variety. Thankfully the game is old enough that plenty of testing information can be found from other players on the wiki which goes a long way towards sorting the wheat from the chaff.

Yes I would highly recommend this game 101%.

[b]Long story:[/b]
The game has a lot going for it and it's really good. There are some aspects of it that I don't quite like but that's all minor and preferential so these may not apply to you.

The story is not something to brag about but it's good enough to keep the game going and entertain you a bit. If do the main story/quest-line only it would take about 7 hours or less. Overall, it's good story even if a bit simple, but simple and straightforward can be great at times. This may stem from me playing the game too much/too long and/or having played games with more depth in their story. However, I quite found the characters to be enjoyable.

The game truly shines when it comes to game-play and combat. It is what keeps me coming back to the game even months after. I really like how they implemented mechanics like stamina management, night cycles, enemy grappling, etc. More so love how the game doesn't wait for you and how you can miss out on quests after some time has passed, and how the enemies are at a static level so if you're at lvl 1 and enemy is lvl 10 mopping the floor with you, after you grind and level up to reach their level or beyond it becomes a ""fair"" fight as they don't level up alongside you. This provides a sense of improvement on your part, a sense of accomplishment. The enemy variety is great too, each with different strengths and weaknesses, more so in the DLC isle.


As a side rant, my gripe with the game boils down to two matters, though these are [b]HIGHLY personal preference and not subject to sway your interest in the game.[/b] Hopefully Mr Hideaki Itsuno addresses these in the sequel though, not likely but hopeful :D.

- First one is that despite the meh story there are some side quests that cause inconsistencies with the main story for me as someone who like's to be ""immersed"" in a game. Top of my head example being [spoiler]the side quest for the dukes wife. Imagine ""shagging"" the kings wife, get caught and she pins the blame on you and sent to jail, escape the jail cell, and come back tomorrow to chat with the king and continue like none of that ever happened. Worst of all is you'd be romancing some other character but mandem be getting into relations with a bunch others willy nilly like he has amnesia when meeting someone new lol.[/spoiler]
- Lastly, how the heck does immolation (setting oneself on fire) skill from the magic archer vocation not remove getting wet/drenched Mr Itsuno?!


P.S.: I'm aware this game was released way back and was ahead of its time at the time, and given what I've seen of the sequel getting released next year (2024), it has improved exponentially better, so this ""review"" or recommendation is just kinda pointless :D.",1702580279,1702580279,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

With all the hype around the sequel, I finally decided to give the original a shot, and wow, did it just pull me in. Been rocking it on my Steam Deck about 90% of the time, and let me tell you, it's pure brilliance. Never thought playing a magic-focused character could be this damn enjoyable, especially with the sorceress.

The combat is like a sweet blend of action and targeting systems that just hit the spot. It's getting dangerously close to that 'perfect 3D Action RPG', and it's giving off some serious Monster Hunter RPG feels. The story? Solid and engaging, with this cool mix of western and eastern influences that I'm totally digging. And can we talk about the party system with those 'pawns'? It's such a unique way to assemble a crew with your buddies or random players that THEY created, tailoring it to fit your needs. Plus, there are perks for creating a pawn that catches the eye of other players – super slick implementation for sure.

Now, let's be real – the game's starting to show its age in some areas. The movement feels a bit clunky, the user interface could use a bit of a usability facelift, and the character models aren't exactly amazing (though the big bosses look downright stellar).

But hey, I'm officially lost in this world and super hyped for the sequel. Capcom's got me hooked on another one of their IPs, and I'm loving every minute of it!

con:
- Minimalistic story. It starts strong with the opening cutscene and prologue, but then there is nothing for 30 hours until you reach the final battle and post-game content. Npc sidequests are short too.
- Forced romance. The game will pick a love interest for your character from among the sidequest npcs and you can't say no to any of it, not even if you don't like the npc that the game selected for you.
- Worldbuilding. You hardly get to know anything about most characters or their culture. It lacks atmosphere and immersion. In some instances, the world just doesn't make sense, like how there is a fishing village when the ocean is canonically contaminated by ""the Brine"", or the respawning bandit ambush right outside the capital where soldiers patrol. Suicidal civilians traveling unarmed, constantly getting assaulted by wolves and whatnot.
- Missing quest markers. Some quests have them, many others don't, often those where you would have wanted them the most.
- It is a 2012 console game through and through. The default graphics looks dated. Has a high chance of freezing and crashing if you alt-tab out. No borderless window mode.
- The audio volume is all over the place.
- Too many tanky bosses. Most bosses & minibosses are easy, they just take ages to beat (on a first playthrough at normal difficulty).
- The game does a poor job at explaining things. There are many popup messages and such, but I still felt like I had to figure out most things by myself.
- Item weight. You can't carry much, even just being ""Heavy"" negatively affects your stamina regeneration.
- Minimalistic equipment progression, which gets in the way of customization. You rarely find equipment that's better than the stuff available in the shops. The free armor sets that you get early on are better than any of the other armor that you can get until the end of the game.
- There are lots of flying enemies and sometimes objects to shoot down or enemies on ledges that you can't reach, but not every class has a ranged attack.
- There is no aim-assist for the bow and no lock on, playing on a controller is a bit of a pain.

pro:
- The ""pawns"". I've never seen AI companioins done like this, it is very unique. You can have two, one of which is a customizable character, while the other is recruitable/dismissable and can be a copy of another player's pawn.
- Dynamic difficulty. There is a difficulty setting, but ignoring that, you can go from regular self-imposed-restrictions to letting the max-level pawn of a Steam friend solo half the game for you and when that gets boring, you can simply dismiss that pawn and try something else.
- You can climb monsters, break monster parts, etc. Combat is interactive, a little bit like in Monster Hunter.
- The fast travel system. The ""Eternal Ferrystone"" lets you teleport to any town [b]or[/b] directly to one of up to 10 ""Portcrystals"" that you can collect and place anywhere on the map and they won't disappear until you pick them back up, they even stay in place for NG+.
- Exploration is alright. Finding optional bosses and quest npcs in the wild is fun and the fast travel system makes it not a slog. Dungeons also rarely have pointless branches, its overall relatively time efficient. Almost all enemies respawn if you let several (ingame) days pass.
- There are 9 different classes (""Vocations"") and you are encouraged to master multiple of them, since passive bonuses carry over between classes. It keeps the gameplay fresh, while simultaneously advancing your character build. Each class is unique, Capcop took the combat of several different games, tossed it into a blender and somehow ended up with something good.
- Has multiple endings, post-game content and a NG+ system that retains your progress.
- Has a dedicated speedrun mode.
- The day-night cycle. At night there are harder enemies and you can't see anything without a lantern, just like in caves. (One of the few things that the game does right in the atmosphere department.)
- Occasionally, it matters how you complete a quest. It doesn't come up often, but there are some quests where you get a different quest ending or reward based on a decision.
- The game is cheap, often on sale at -84% and the ""Dark Arisen"" DLC comes with the game for free. 

It's a great game, but has many flaws.

I really enjoyed the combat despite the jank. I also liked the invocation system and the pawn system. The 5 out of 9 invocations (aka classes) were all enjoyable. I ended up going strider for the second half of the game and loved it. Exploring felt extremely fun and dangerous early on. 

The problem with the game is it was clearly rushed out. Areas are reused for main quests and there is no fast travel to those areas. So you walk the same path and fight the same enemies. It looks like half the map wasn't used when you look at the big map. The main quest line is rushed and hobbled together. You can tell some of these areas and systems just didn't have the time they needed during development. The main cinematics are decent but sparce. The main plot is simple but works well. Sadly it's all rushed and limited.

I can see why this game has a following but I don't think its something I recommend to most people. I will say that I am very psyched to check out Dragon's Dogma 2 now.

Piece of advice, don't play on Hard Mode for your first run. Yeah you might be a Soulsborne veteran and all, but hear me out. There's no difference on enemy behavior or types encountered, the only change is that they do double damage (to you alone, your Pawns remain unchanged) and you use more stamina for all attacks/spells.

Most enemies at early levels will 1-shot you. You may say 'git gud' or 'skill issue', however it's not challenging hard, it's frustrating hard. There are no iframes to carry your ass on the early game, a bushwhacking wolf or a stray bandit arrow may kill you outright. Of course there are ways to deal with this, playing super safe, or with a shield, but my main gripe comes with the Gold and XP rewards. 

On Hard Mode you and your Pawns get double XP and any enemies may drop random bags of 10k gold (whereas normally you'd get few hundreds at most). Due to this, it's not long before you outpace the enemies and suddenly you are sitting on a pile of gold and overleveled. IMO this breaks the intended pacing of the game. 

Stick to Normal the first time around, there are difficulty spikes in new areas and you must adapt your game (attack damage type and strategy) to fight different types of enemies. Still, if you want an extra challenge, you may simple take less Pawns with you OR even not using mid-combat healing items.",1701723169,1702146939,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game deserves it. The combat system alone is worth the price of admission. The game feel of beating the shit out of goblins is spot on, and this game's legendary ability to let you climb on larger enemies to hit them in the face never gets old. All the different classes are at least viable, and messing around with them all meant I never ran out of toys to play with even after restarting the game half a dozen times. 

This games quests also deserve some recognition. Some of them are admitably not great (looking at you cow escort quest) and there are a fair share of generic ""Slay X amount of monster"" ones, but more often than not I was given a surprising amount of options for completing what initially seemed like basic tasks. My favorite example of this involves forging a spellbook that you're supposed to return. Doing so costs more than the quest reward gives you, makes a later boss fight harder, and only really serves to bully one specific NPC, but the game lets you do it and is all the richer for it.

This game has its rough edges and more than its fair share of jank, but it rarely gets frustrating. More often then not it just makes the game more charming. I don't know why everyone talks like they're at a Renaissance fair, or why the NPC companions decide to run headlong into enemy attacks at every opportunity, or why the romance system is so busted that it almost made the 'Masterworks All"" guy my soulmate. I do know that I will remember all this weirdness for years to come, which is more than I can say for some more polished titles,

Also, the soundtrack is full of bangers. My personal favorite is the Cassardis theme, which I listen to when I want to feel sad on purpose.

I can't wait for the sequel, please don't disappoint me Itsuno.

Pros:
-Terrific PC port (runs extremely well in 4K on my 970) 
-Combat is very fun and addictive 
-Boss battles are always awesome
-Pawn system is still a feat which no other game's done like DD did

-double EDIT: Apparently, we get an item called Eternal Ferrystone that ables you to fast-travel unlimited times (read below for how to obtain it)
-''Several Port Crystals (these are your jump portals) can be found throughout the adventure and placed anywhere on the world map as you see fit. In addition, the price of the Ferrystone has been reduced significantly from 20,000 to 2,000 gold pieces. The unlimited-use Eternal Ferrystone, which can be unlocked after completing the quest “Off with its Head'', can be found in the Storage which can be accessed from the Gran Soren Union Inn.''

Cons:
-Voice acting is still desynchronized sometimes
-minor bugs

Many aspects of the game are pretty outdated. Story is pretty mid it's wasn't engaging enough to keep me excited on what comes next. 

Gear drop is pretty bad. For the most part its what ever has the highest number you use. 99% of the gear you run into for the campaign has no interesting sub stats your pretty much looking at the main stat.

General UI and inventory management is terrible, too many clicks to do things. Minimap is to zoomed in causing you to have to open the map often which there is no dedicated button for, so you have to make 2 actions to view the map and like wise to see your current quest.

Side quest are pretty boring. Most of the quest are kill x, escort or deliver/find some item.

Actually character progression is very limited. Levelling up doesn't feel as rewarding. When you level up you get stats which the game doesn't tell how much unless you manually do the math and the type of stat you get are based on your current class. You cannot allocate any stats yourself making build variety very limiting and levelling doesn't feel rewarding.

Party system feels really restricted. You can have a party of 4 including your self. 1 party member you create and will level up with you. The other 2 members you have to use other people's party member and those 2 party members you borrow don't level up with you. This results in you having to keep getting new party members every few levels to keep up with you. You can see the stats of other peoples' characters but this results in you having to waste time to check each character to see if they are built right and have the right skill for your ideal party composition.

Overall I recommend the game if you want to experience a game that I would say is pretty innovated for its time. But if your going into this game expecting a masterpiece because everyone else says it is your going to be disappointed especially if your someone who has played a lot of modern games like Baldurs Gate 3, FInal fantasy or other highly acclaimed modern rpg.",1700707449,1701957578,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The leveling and classes system is unique and fun. Making your pawn exactly the way you want him/her to be, is also a huge task in this game. Perfection takes a long time as your pawns take a lot of time to learn all the enemy's behaviours. It's truly a gem and I'm looking forward to Dragon's Dogma 2.
Multiple runs are actually fun. In the beginning you feel really weak and if you play the way it's intended to, it takes a lot of time to actually get pretty strong.

 Not bad considering the original year of release, but not the best of that particular year either.  The cut-scenes are okay.

Sound:

The soundtrack is a symphony that complements the epic battles and moments of solitude alike. The ambient sounds of nature and the menacing roars of mythical creatures further enrich the gaming experience. While the voice acting is generally solid, there are instances of repetitive NPC dialogue that can be immersion-breaking.

Gameplay:

The combat system is where this title truly shines. The visceral, weighty feel of every swing and spell is unparalleled, providing a satisfying and challenging experience. The pawn system, allows recruiting companions and customize their behavior, adds depth to the gameplay. The variety of classes and the ability to climb massive foes add strategic layers to battles, making each encounter unique.  However their is a problem. The affinity system, which governs relationships with NPCs and pawns, often feels arbitrary and poorly explained. Building connections with characters can be confusing, and the consequences of certain actions aren't always clear. This lack of transparency in the affinity system diminishes the impact of choices on the game world.

Story:

Unfortunately, the narrative falls short due to persistent inconsistencies. NPCs that turn hostile one moment can later be found offering quests as if nothing happened. This breaks the immersion and makes it challenging to invest emotionally in the story.  Another gripe is one of the endings, where a pawn of the potentially opposite gender inherits the protagonist's body.

Open World:

While the vast open world initially impresses, it quickly reveals its shortcomings. The lack of meaningful activities and a sense of life in the world makes exploration feel somewhat hollow. A more dynamic and interactive open world could have added depth to the experience.

Conclusion:
Capcom excels with the combat and gameplay mechanics, offering a thrilling and engaging experience. However, the story's inconsistencies, awkward narrative moments, and lackluster affinity system detract from what could have been a truly epic adventure. The open world, while expansive, feels devoid of life and activities.",1701894540,1701894540,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I f*cking LOVE this game, every time I come back to it, I fall in love all over again. I love Dark Souls, DS1 is one of my favourite games of all time, but Dragon's Dogma, oh boy. While it's unfair to compare the two, since they're way different to eachother, I need to say I think DD is 10x better than the entire Soulsbourne series. Everything about DD just feels... right. The combat, the exploration, the pawns... It all feels so perfectly thought out. Regrettably, I never played it back when it came out, it was only in about 2018-19 that I first played it and gods, this game dominated my brain for so long it's not funny. The sadness I felt, despite being a newer fan, for a lack of even acknowledgement of the series from Capcom hurt me.

But that hurt? It's gone now, because DD2 is coming out in just over 3 months as I type this, and I'm ngl, I shed a tear back when it was announced.

Want to be a magic archer that fires mystical tracking bolts at enemies from a distance? What about a mystic knight that wields a machine gun orb and anti-intruder warning system? Think it would be cool to fire an arrow into the eye of a cyclops from 200 yards? Want to chop the snake tail off a chimera? Strike a griffon's wings with lightning and burn its body with meteor fire? Want to forge new weapons in the soul of a wyvern?

Dragon's Dogma will let you do this, but it will force you to play one of the poorest narratives and most frustrating quest systems I can think of as compensation. Seriously, there is a lot to love about this game, especially the combat and music, but it's been a long time since I've played something that felt so good and so awful at the same time. The world is big and empty, the quests have you retreading tons of familiar ground for no reason at all, and the story is so full of holes, you could fly a troll the size of the Chicxulub crater through it and still have room to spare. There's literally a monumental event that happens mid-game, which should change how the game is played and who you find yourself fighting for, but it literally ceases to matter the moment it's over... so it seems to exist merely to be shocking, or to hint at a direction the game might have gone had it received full development.

Short version? If you like killer combat, some tough bosses, and lots of cool weapons and magic, this game is a blast. If you care about story or narrative consistency, or if you hate repetitive quest structures and fetch BS so bad that the DLC gives you a way to partially skip it, then you might want to try the game out on sale, and just test the waters.

[b]Note[/b] fanboy spotted, and unfortunately, I had to cut down the review after reaching the character limit.

[h1] Story [/h1]
The Arisen must face the Dragon, that is a truth of the world, it brings destruction both on its own and by the hordes of monsters that appear alongside it, as long as it remains the world is not safe. Ages ago, Savan fought against the Wyrm, a generation ago so did Edmund the Wyrmking, but it has returned, it laid waste to your home and when you tried to stand against it you were powerless. It took your heart, marking you, you recover from your injuries a heartless Arisen, destined to fight the Dragon or perish along the way.

I really like the stories in [i]Dragon’s Dogma[/i], however, a lot of the main quests boil down to preparing for and researching the Dragon. Overall, I think I would describe my impression of the main plot as a sort of corrupted folktale, you have all sorts of classical tropes, a ruler, a princess, a fool, a dragon, and a hero, but it is also somewhat subversive. Not to say that there are not a lot of issues, there is an especially jarring event where it is obvious that something [i]more[/i] would have followed but no you are actually that close to the end of the game.
The most frustrating thing is how little they integrate supplemental material in the game, for example there are digital comics that feature Savan these explains that pawns are influenced by the Arisen’s thoughts at that moment, in his case his pawn looks very much like his dead father. Another example is the rich backstories that were written for a number of characters, these can be found online preserved on the wiki. One of the most interesting characters that exemplifies my issues is Feste, a jester, he is a liar and a trickster, his backstory is very interesting, but this did not translate into the game perfectly. If you pay attention, hear his optional dialogue and see what he does in an empty throne room you would notice that there is more to him than your first impression, but a lot of people would never bother. It is a shame but ultimately this is a result of scaling down, cuts or troubled development and not the fault of the audience.

[h1] Presentation [/h1]
One of my favourite things about [i]Dragon’s Dogma[/i] is the sense of scale. You travel vast distances and you can look back and [i]see[/i] how far you have come, it gives a sweet feeling of accomplishment for something as mundane as traveling, it is one of my favourite games for feeling like I am on a journey.
This sense of scale also extends to other things , Gran Soren is a great city and it feels a lot bigger than it is, and the enemies! They are big and they feel big, climbing around on a cyclops to reach the eye is awesome, so is mounting a griffin clinging desperately as it tries to fly away or being flung left to right on a serpent. I genuinely love it.

Another highlight is the character creator it is quite robust and gives you a number of options to create nice looking characters or simply just decent ones (I am bad at character creation), there are images detailing how to recreate various people and characters such as Geralt and Ciri from the Witcher. As in most games the endgame is fashion and you do get a lot of cool looking equipment, and capes! Never forget the capes! There are also nice smaller details such as helmets being opened when you are in safe areas, characters' lantern affixing animation, or the several knights each with their own coat of arms.
What I especially like with the creator is the ability to change the height and weight of characters because that is so very rare, it also has some slight effect on gameplay which is cool but also annoying as you might expect.
Same could be said for the voice options, some of them are pretty good but you will hear them a lot since your pawn will give a lot of advice, so you should make sure not to select one that sounds obviously pitch shifted, but that is hard to do when all you can hear in the character creator is grunts.

The music is another great aspect of [i]Dragon’s Dogma[/i] and its expansion [i]Dark Arisen[/i]. I really like the recurring motif but also that each major enemy has their own theme, it sounds great and there is a lot of versatility to it, with drums, guitars, and various vocals. A fairly frequent track like [i]End of the Struggle[/i] never fails to send dopamine into my brain. Perhaps I would not this name if my favourite OST of all time, but it is certainly up there, especially the vocalised tracks like [i]Eternal Return[/i] or [i]Coils of Light[/i].

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]
I believe it's fair to say that most people like [i]Dragon’s Dogma[/i] for the gameplay, I do love the combat, and frankly I find all vocations fun to play, but as I hope I've made clear I find other aspects enjoyable too.
Nevertheless, combat is most of what you will be doing when you are not exploring, and it is awesome. Enemies require and use different tactics making them all different experiences even when they have other similarities, and your pawns slowly accrue knowledge and become better at fighting them, sometimes, this is mostly voice lines, but mages in particular are often best at utilising elemental weaknesses. However, you will be using other players’ pawns or pre-made ones to fill out your party, and you should be switching them out frequently on low levels, which means their actual bestiary knowledge will vary.

Clearly, it is great to climb big monsters to go after their weak spots, or to get them to claw off their own armour but that is not where all the fun lies. Using ‘Arc of Deliverance’ as a Warrior is tons of fun with some slight planning you can get off massive hits, and one-shot most of the story bosses, but that is like the only fun skill they get lol. 
Magic is more fun since there is a lot of diverse spells, grabbing enemies is cool, lightning whip is cooler and so is GIANT ICE TENDRILS. 
My very first character was an assassin and, yes climbing, but archery is also great, especially with exploding arrows, and so is the kicking. But there is certainly a vocation for everyone so you should try them out and find what you like best, equipment will be most of your damage so try not to bother about stats if it is your first playthrough.

As for quests, they are often an excuse to do combat. Such as notice boards with bounties, these are completely optional but give some nice rewards, maybe you do want to hunt a Griffin anyways, so might as well get a guaranteed reward for it, or perhaps you are going north so why not bring the NPC where they want to go? Fear not though, NPCs respawn after a few days, but they remember what you did... For a while. You can also give them the petrified heart of your predecessors and they will probably recover from death. 
Unfortunately, the actual side quests are rarely much better than the bounties, there are a few that could be considered interesting but generally they are simple affairs, fetching items or committing treason, that sort of thing. The best ones are questline associated with specific characters but since certain quests fail when you progress through the main story it can be easy to miss stuff on your first playthrough, as I myself did.  
It is worth remembering that you should not fight a losing battle, which was emphasised more pre-[i]Dark Arisen[/i]. Now you can teleport back to Gran Soren whenever you want instead of needing to plan around your return voyage and only being able to teleport on rare occasions. This and most players instinct of fighting everything the first time they see it can cause problem especially early on as they head towards Witchwood, or they can do what I did and fight until they win. Either way works, if you are having fun.

The game is an open-world action RPG that lets you create your own character and choose from nine different classes, each with their own skills and abilities. You can also recruit up to three companions, called pawns, who will assist you in your quests and battles.

The combat system is one of the best aspects of the game, as it is fast-paced, dynamic and satisfying. You can use various weapons, spells and items to fight against a variety of enemies, from goblins and bandits to giant monsters and dragons. You can also climb on larger foes and target their weak points, which adds a lot of strategy and excitement to the fights. The game also features a day and night cycle, which affects the difficulty and appearance of the enemies, as well as the availability of certain quests and events.

The vocations are another highlight of the game, as they allow you to customize your character and play style. You can choose from three basic vocations: Fighter, Strider and Mage, and later unlock six advanced vocations: Warrior, Ranger, Sorcerer, Mystic Knight, Assassin and Magick Archer. Each vocation has its own strengths and weaknesses, as well as unique skills and equipment. You can also switch vocations at any time, and level up each one separately, which gives you a lot of freedom and flexibility.

The story of the game is intriguing and engaging, as it revolves around the Arisen, a chosen one who has to face the Dragon, a mysterious and powerful creature that threatens the world. The game has a lot of lore and history, as well as interesting characters and factions, that make the world feel alive and immersive. The game also has multiple endings, depending on your choices and actions throughout the game, which adds a lot of replay value and consequences.

The game is also impressive for its graphics and sound, as it still looks and sounds great, even though it was released in 2012. The game has a realistic and detailed art style, with beautiful landscapes, environments and lighting effects. The game also has a superb soundtrack, composed by Tadayoshi Makino, Rei Kondoh and Inon Zur, that matches the mood and atmosphere of the game. The game also has a good voice acting, with a diverse cast of actors and accents, that adds a lot of personality and charm to the game.

Overall, Dragon's Dogma is a game that I highly recommend to anyone who loves action RPGs, as it offers a lot of fun, challenge and depth. The game has a lot of content and features, such as crafting, upgrading, exploring, questing and more, that will keep you entertained for hours. The game also has a loyal and active fan base, as well as a sequel and an anime adaptation, which shows how popular and beloved the game is. Dragon's Dogma is a game that deserves a lot of praise and recognition, as it is one of the best games of its genre and generation.",1701747515,1701747515,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

To get the bad out of the way, there is no lock on system, and if you aren't a Strider there is no rolling either. Fast traveling is fairly limited, even with this edition having an reusable fast travel item there are relatively few fast travel points... not that all of that is bad.

That is a great point to transition into what's unique here, you get to set some of your own fast travel points. Choose wisely. The pawn system is unique, you can summon other player's pawns to help you out and the players get rift crystals for you using them, win/win. It's a neat way to make the game feel like a cooperative experience, especially summoning friend's pawns. There is 0 cost for summoning a pawn of your level or lower, or your friend's pawn regardless of level which can lead to fun moments summoning in help much stronger than you, thanks college friends that apparently played Dragon's Dogma at one point. 

Overall it's an enjoyable game, not the best balanced (looking at you Magick Archer) but you probably won't hit major walls once you get rolling if you adapt to the enemies you are dealing with.. until Bitterblack Isle (content added in Dark Arisen as post-post game content).",1701661162,1701661162,True,1,0,0.529411792755126953,0,True,False,False

Often [i]role-playing games[/i] let you express yourself through choices in the story that influence how your character is perceived in the game world through dialogue options or how you complete a quest; but I have never played another game that puts so much emphasis on the ""action"" aspect of an ""action-rpg"", where you can also express yourself through the combat, in a very awesome and flashy way of doing so. There are so many mechanics that allow this, from the way enemies behave to the way pawns also aid you through the journey.
Also, pawns! They're the best AI companion I've ever encountered in a game, you can customize them with looks, gear, actions and even their manner of interacting, being shy, agressive, confident, along with a few other options. They're far from perfect, though, as the developers intended them to resemble actual humans, and humans are dumb. As you progress through the story, they'll pick up on some of your habits and even mimic some of your actions, you can of course also set your main pawn with different inclinations that'll make them more active or more passive, depending on their vocation or role you want them to play in your party.
There aren't many vocations to chose from, but each feel very unique in their own way to play, even if they do share some commonalities among them. There isn't much balance to find here, as you will ultimately find, all vocations are, in fact, OP.
Want to i-frame your way through everything? Fighter is your vocation. Want to support your party with buffs and healing? Mage is your vocation. Want to quickly and swiftly dispose of enemies with style? Strider is your vocation. My personal favorite is Ranger, I'm always social distancing and dealing with trouble from afar, if anything ever touches me, I can just instant reset and walk it off. Never has any game with ranged combat felt so good. About the story? Well, it mainly bogs down to choice, it's your choice to become an Arisen, it's your choice what to do with that and if you'll take the responsabilty or just the power that it brings.",1701645639,1701646188,True,61,2,0.81905674934387207,4,True,False,False

And if your mage is completely fire magic based, there is no way to change spells since dragon is immune to fire.

And about crafting - every time you want to craft some healing or stamina potion you have to really remember which potions are for healing/stamina since game never tells you what effects of potions are being crafted.

+Good enough story.
+BEST ADVANCED character customization one could ask for. (a perv like me might have wanted bigger tits for females :), maybe not you?)
+Fun combat with lots of skills and abilities.
+Vocations/classes to swap from freely. 
+Good boss fights that you can tackle hard or easy (with meta).
+Farming that is fun,
+Pawn system that is fun yet not. I still like it, yet today it's a fresh idea.
+Climbing system, climb on an enemy and go stabby.
+Pawns learning more and more, and by other pawns.
+Many different enemies.
+Portal crystals that you drop and can teleport where bloody ever you want, how hard can it be? Still amazing because so few games give you that freedom.
+There are chests just about everywhere that can be of use to you, exploration value = high
+quests and actions matters,some quests have to be done in order to get different items, and you can restart whole game to get the other items, how many times as you like
+hard mode = master mode
+character customization will become freely changeable after completion, you can change it how many times you want, for you and your main pawn.
+dlc offers a lot of content that can even prove a bit challenging at max level
+mods, I use a mod that helps me with a lot of things in a normal good way, no stamina drain while running, more inventory and no scar on body, popular mod, choose your version. 

-no real in built ultra widescreen support, I don't really cry that much about it, the blacks on the sides is something i get used to fast.
-chests have always same drops, some chests you have to loot forever and ever, I would have liked more tier chests more, or such. farming one chest over and over is a bit boring. Kingdoms of amalur did this good I think.
-I really loved the fashion in this game and it will never be enough, more fashion, even if it has a lot I want more!

This is my game of all times. Might be mad but even if this game has little to or next to nothing to do with might and magic 7 (not hereos), they are competing for the title. Somehow that old game just have a feeling no other game have.

Also another minus is: -add save slots so we don't have to create multiple fake steam accounts for reruns. THANKS!

A few tips btw:
Inclinations:
*Attack pawns you would generally want Scather and Utilarian or mitigator.
*Healer pawns you want medicator, if they are guardian medicator they will rarely do damage and just heal and support, which can be quite nice in beginning but medicator for healers! 
*You can buy these potions to change your pawns inclinations at the camp, where you first got your main pawn.
*No need to min max, especially not first playthrough, just enjoy, you can't fail! Still it's not advicable to level up as mage or magick archer at all.
Rusted weapons (the starter gear) can become GOD tier once upgraded because it they make/cause enemies to move and attack slower and few enemeis are resistant to it.
*Kill even low experience monster you see, lower experience monster gives more vocation experience. So you max out it faster etc. Once you got all vocations and augments you can skip them.
*The game is harder in beginning, so kill lots of stuff!
*Enemies have hitboxes, if you hit a dragon in the face he may drop a horn, if you hit its claw it may drop.. a claw.

More tips:
Fournival is the best romance options, if you play for practical causes, he is a bit of a pain to find post game so having him as your spouse will make him stay at your home and you can find him easily!
UR(offline) dragon sucks at lower levels. Just a large boss fight who takes up time and the one thing you may want is the weapons from it. So better kill it almost dead - leave area and make a checkpoint save by resting and then kill it over and over until you get your weapons.
UR(online) has some gear I wanted to try for fashion but there is no way in hell that I have the patience for that. I read if you deal too much damage it registers none and yada yada, and it just seems like a clusterfuck of an idea. Fire the guy who did that and make UR online to work as offline! Anyway no real reason to do that dragon either, it just has some cool fashion I think, kinda sucks though but I don't have patience for such crap.

Improvements I wish to see in DDA and Dragon's Dogma 2 are:
-Faster incantations for mage classes and-/or have a quick fighting side weapon as a wand or such to fight a little more quickly like a fighter. Running around focusing bolting gets a bit annoying. 
-A clock to tell time, map button, quick keys more consumables, up to 10? Make food heal over time as insta heal is ""a bit"" OP, or have a you're full meter, forcing people to play more safely and wise.
-To search for pawns after inclinations, have a set of types, not 3 types of inclination. Defensive healer, Offensive Healer. protective tank, offensive tank, bit worse but more aggressive and deals damage. Just an idea. When going for pawns it's inclinations and certain buffs/spells that can be desirable.
-Two-handed weapon attacks should be increased, maybe reduce the damage to balance it but not so rarely do enemies just easily run away from your swing as you're slow as hell. If one wanted the assassins skill gale harness anywhere it would be for the warrior class.
-I would have wanted to level as a mage healer for a while but the stats growth is so bad and I am a bit of a min/max player which makes it nearly impossible for me to do it. At higher levels I doubt that idea is even fun. I should probably try it anyway sometime.
-I want the duplicate system gone, as much as it pains me to say this, but I think it would be funnier to force us to go out farming than running back and forth in Gran Soren. I like the idea that we can duplicate certain quest items like the wyrm king's ring. If you want it, pay up!
-MOST OF ALL a transmog system and to remove helmet visually through it as well.

I remember playing it ages ago on PS3 and immediately getting hooked (even more so than Skyrim). This game had features that no other game had ever implemented and TO THIS DAY, I have yet to find a game that even attempts (or at least is able to properly execute) some of the ingenuity this game applied so well (and this game is over a decade old)

So, of course, the opportunity to play it again on PC? SIGN ME UP. 

I’m gonna try and make this quick. Firstly, [b]the graphics[/b] look great, the game is gorgeous and definitely holds up to this day, and it runs like a dream on PC so no complaints there. Second, [b]the story[/b] was honestly never WOW but it's also not too bad, mostly interesting characters with a decent plot. But given most of the plot is given through in-game dialogue and since the animations for said dialogue honestly kinda sucks (almost getting oblivion vibes), it's kinda hard to get really invested. There are cut-scenes and they are awesome, but again, it was still a little hard to get really invested in the story. Don't get me wrong here though, this game's main villain (and subsequent villains) are amazing, you really do feel their impact and they were very well executed.

Buuut, story-shortcomings aside, the main star here is [b]The Gameplay[/b]
Spot on gameplay, super fun. You’ve got 9 classes (the game calls them “Vocations”), 3 basic ones you start with and 6 hybrids from the 3 basic ones. They all play incredibly different and are suuuper fun, give them all a try. And just a give a little sneak peak, you can go from epicly climbing massive beasts, striking weak points and severing limbs, to strategically taking them on from a distance with arrow-fire, to barrelling through with heavy weapons, to just absolutely OBLITERATING with insane spells (and I mean INSANE spells).

Wanna know what's great about progression in this game? [b]No skill trees, no tedious menus[/b]. The only thing you have to worry about Character-wise as you level up is what special ability or vocation you wanna try next. THAT'S IT. The game will adjust everything else for you based on how you play. Just play the game, the game will handle the rest. If you really wanted to though, you could totally nerd out on stats because certain armor pieces and weapons blend really well with certain vocations and abilities, but that's totally optional.

Guess what, the same applies for your companions (or ""pawns"" as the game calls them). You have one main pawn that always stays with you (which you get to fully customize along with yourself, and by the way, your size, height, and muscularity matters in this game) and then you can choose two other pawns that other people made. And guess what, you don't have to go through tedious options and menus to set your AI companion’s playstyle and skills because the way companions are handled in this game is genius. Other than choosing their vocation and special abilities, you don’t have to do anything, [b]they will learn everything they need to know by watching you fight.[/b] ""Monkey see, monkey do"" style babyyy.

I know, [b]genius[/b] and it baffles me that no other game (in my experience) has been able to pull off a better companion system and this game is [b]OVER A DECADE OLD[/b]

Alright, I'm gonna stop here because you really should experience this game for yourself. It's always kinda saddened me just how underrated this game has been over the years and how not nearly enough people have known about it and that's why I'm so pumped for Dragon's Dogma 2! Not only am I itching for a sequel (DD2 looks soooo goood) but maybe now, at least in the meantime, the original will finally get the love it deserves.

Also, the weight limit thing sucks.  Travel can be tedious, especially early on when you're really weak and unable to afford much healing.  Also, without mods the lighting system is truly atrocious.

From what I can see the game-play looks fun, but figure I'll wait for DD2 instead in a couple months to have a better experience on a modern engine.

I reckon for more ""mainstream"" PC's this would work perfectly and be a great experience.
Especially recommended at the current price of 85% discount!

But the older game doesn't scale well to my modern, Ultrawide PC, even though it's the remastered 4K edition.
The 3840x1600 seems to stretch and drop the bottom 1/3 of the screen and get some weird ghosting going. 
Frame drops on the Radeon RX 7900 XTX from time to time.
Clearly a console port which I'm fine with, but I can't justify my first experience to be sub-par due to technical issue while the successor is so close to launch.

I liked what little I saw, but will wait for a more modern experience as my first entry into the Dragon's Dogma series.

This game is awesome super excited for the sequel! Highly suggest playing this one until that one comes out. 

The endgame content in this game is insane you've got tons and tons of content ! The main story is cool a bit of a grind at times. Honestly go buy this game its on sale right now! see for yourself! 

The class system is 3 different classes (warrior, mage, archer) but then you can also mix them. Want to be a warrior with a bow, a mage with a knife, an archer with a staff? sure! In total 9 classes. 

The customization is pretty straight forward and I was impressed with the amount of stuff you are going to have! Each armour set is beautiful and their is a fine line between looking cool and having good armour stats. Luckily, any innkeeper will let you deposit your extra goods with them so you can horde to your hearts content!

The 1 downside in this game which I hope is improved upon in the next game is the combination of items mechanic, its kind silly having to just try each combination of items without knowing if it will succeed like a tree branch with a oil flask to make a torch.  I would love to find recipes for crafting stuff out of random items instead, and you could even add in weapons or armour schematics that you can find and then craft from these random items and monster parts like a cyclops bone for a melee club.

[b] Pros : [/b]
- The pawns were a cool idea with a deep AI system behind it. The fact the pawn's behaviors change based on your actions is cool enough!

- The combat & classes were some of the best I had ever seen in a game. Playing as a magic archer was a lot of fun and felt awesome. The combat is 10 out of 10. if you want a game where the combat feels and looks great this is the one. And you have so many classes to choose from, all with unique play styles that really keeps things fresh.

- Dragons! The main villain (who is a dragon) is so menacing.

[b] Cons:[/b]
- The story was trash. Didn't make sense half the time, or just wasn't explained well enough half the time. When I beat the game I didn't really care because I didn't care about the story. Thankfully the game play is good enough to make you want to keep playing.

- Too many pointless fetch quests. about mid-game, the story just falls off and get super weak and you're just running around doing a quest that feels like they have no connection to anything.

- No fast travel till later on and even then, its an item you have to buy. There are also no mounts. That got annoying fast especially when you were constantly trekking across wide open fields.",1701309831,1701309964,True,1,0,0.526694774627685547,0,True,False,False

A game where the writers failed to address the questions that arise when a player decides to look past the shallow veneer of the game. The authorial opportunities that pawns present into the game are completely overlooked. They simply are. Not once can you discuss the world or ask what your pawn thinks about their self or the wide world. There are only canned lines to give them the semblance of personality.

The world has no eco-system, there was no time spent thinking about the world-building. It's entirely gameified for the player to constantly engage in repetitive combat. Goblins and wolves roam populated roads and represent an existential threat to civilization. Pawns roam the world like lost neglected robots. Other characters in the world are one-dimensional plot-devices for the player to go on quests with them so that you may have one whom you have helped the most and are utilized in the final quest as your 'beloved.'

The game is a master class in how to create a thoughtless story and plot. Its game-play was novel at release. The directors have no vision for creating a thought-provoking or profound story.

No. There are a number of glaring flaws such as its obviously rushed and unfinished nature which permeates the world building and storytelling but despite this the gameplay shines through in a way that I have rarely seen. The Pawn system is the best AI companion system of any game ever made. This is one of the few games that actually makes you feel like part of a party that is equally capable to you. There are layers to the pawn system and those must be understood to get the most out of it but once you understand those nuances your pawns can be just as effective at handling threats as you can . The moment t moment gameplay is amazing and the large monster fights can only be compared to one of this game's spiritual predecessors, Monster Hunter. Without rambling too long I have nothing but endless praise for this game as it has a myriad ways of playing and even after seeing everything a dozen times it is still a blast to play.

Yes, the graphics are starting to show the game's age, but all you really need to fix that is just some reshade/retexture mods and it'll look pretty close to what (at least I think) a PS5 remaster would look like for the game. Only problem is that some of the NPCs might look a little... weird in certain lighting. But besides that, the gameplay is extremely fun, especially since there is 9 different classes you can choose from, and all of them are fun in their own way. Example: Assasin gives you the highest physical attack per level, so if you want to destroy everything in your path, go with that. Or, if you wanna spice things up, you could be a Magick Archer and make all of your arrows lock onto your targets, set yourself on fire, etc. I know I've probably missed a ton of points as to how this is a great game, but this is all I can think of atm. 10/10.

Many quests have different outcome or just different interaction that may or may not affect the progression of the game.

""Progression"", what I meant by that is how one would experience the game. For main story, it is not affected much. But for availability of certain quests (these become available if some particular previous quest is completed in certain way) and possibility to get certain item (that is ""fixed"" available during that time but unable to be get because quest is not done in certain way). It may not seems much but there are just so many diverging paths in this game. Need multiple playthrough to get all things covered.

There is also random drop in this game. Which is something I didnot know about until, like, 20 hours(?) in. It is no big deal. But the cooler equipments are behind this randomness.

I apologize for maybe confusing-short writing here. I just complete the game with lenghty gaming session each day, everyday, for under 4 weeks. I need some break.

I was not expecting this game to feel good to be played. I play this game just because the second game was announced. It took me, maybe, 10 hours just stuck at first area since I do not know what to do and this game only have 1 save file (can be manually backed up). Gameplay is simple, just attack ( '-')9. But the ""attacks"" that are available in this game is soooo cool. Sadly cannot just ready all the skills, can only bring a few (3/6 active skill, 2 core skill). Despite that, the vocations(jobs/classes) here, each feels different. IT IS SOOO GOOD AT THAT!

I think that is all the big highlights that I remember. Definitely need some kind of vehicle to move around since the world is big and can only teleport once you set the place to be ported using certain limited item.

I've already completed it an handful of times in different platforms, achieved everything again here on Steam as well and it even got better thanks to the addiction of some game/class changing mods that showed me something new too. A lot of new mechanics introduced at its release date were already innovative and interesting: to think that they've passed the test of time, is truly remarkable to me.

So...with that said, I'll immediately start with the obvious downsides that plague the success of this game from the very start.

[h3] Fast Travel [/h3] aka [i]""start walking you fool""[/i]
I've never found it as a weakness, because I really love to explore around in every videogame, but, in the beginning, there was no way to teleport around at all, until you reached a certain point in the story; it was also very limited in numbers and was bounded to where you had placed the teleporting crystals. You had the power to place your own favorite place to teleport to, with every pros and cons that come with it, but later in it got, umh...eased with a bit more choices. It was frustrating at first, but I've found it as a good excuse to acknowledge more and more the landscapes and where enemies roamed around, learning their patterns and where to find the things I needed the fastest way. This was a big turning point for some people, that kept them away from DD.

[h3] Don't Blink [/h3]
Another odd thing is that it's really easy to miss, like...[b] SO MANY THINGS [/b] and side missions if you do not pay attention or you do not explore your surroundings in some specific frames of time; and there is no way to go back, or in some cases it's the opposite. Hope in heavens that your last checkpoint was a couple minutes from where you are now, because you're gonna reload a whole fuckin section that started 45 minutes before you decided to make a guess.

[h3] Dark Arisen [/h3]
Bitterblack Isle (the island where the DD expansion takes place at) is extremely unwelcoming, punishing and gloomy...almost depressing. Some encounters seem unjustifiably impossible even compared to the endgame challenges you get faced with in the base game at first glance (even at a second glance lol), but, if you're leveled up, you're geared for good and you know what you're doing (which is like, the hard part of the game duh), it doesn't feel impossible, just...very, VERY hard to accomplish!

Oh yes, you get to fight [b] SATAN [/b]...and SATAN II as well! Oh and you can also well, you know, [b] CASUALLY WALK INTO THE GRIM REAPER AND LITERALLY KILL DEATH [/b].

[h3] Old Gen, Dated Polygons [/h3]
As the title suggests, yeah...the graphics were another one of those set backs that probably didn't helped at all to lift up the already infamous reputation that the game had among most of the majority of players. Some mods can circle around these old.

Still related to something of an old gen limitation (or probably as an artistic decision, being related to the lore as it is) there is no kind of co-op possibility whatsover, other than the pawns mechanic, leaving people wondering why in such a co-op dictated combat system, a thing like this got overlooked in favor of something else. Performance issues where a lot more consistent back in 2010-2011, so, it was for the best experience I believe.

So:
[b] 1] [/b] No real freedom of fast travelling in a vast world filled with dangerous encounters.
[b] 2] [/b] Very missable side quests, which means less money, equipment and deadly weapons.
[b] 3] [/b] Easily one of the hardest (yet most satisfying) DLC/expansion ever released.
[b] 4] [/b] Graphically outdated even for its time.

With that aside...

Dragon's Dogma, for me, can easily boast [b] the best [/b] action-paced combat system ever created for a videogame, way too engaging to be skipped because of the aformentioned issues, and the main reason why you should also play it! The freedom, the possibilities and the verticality that you can create while fighting any kind of monster is unprecedented, even to this day. You really feel like an important piece of a medieval-fantasy party going for the most epic bounty quest ever when the soundtrack kicks in and you're grappled into a giant hawk flying you towards your impending doom, and it delivers every time something really big and dangerous approaches your path. It's surely pointed towards a much more mature audience than other games in the same genre, with its dark themes and story, its grim creatures and the feeling of being completely lost and having to go on foot for the next fifty minutes back to where you were supposed to be, BUT, it's a damn journey that you have to try and endure at, in order to truly appreciate what Dragon's Dogma has to offer.

In all seriousness though, this game is just so much fun to play and experiment on! The combat is engaging, fast paced, and the boss battles are pure hype! There are multiple classes to choose from and each have their own Augment skills which are like passive abilities that can be used on all other classes once they have been learned. Furthermore the pawn system is amazing, your Pawn is basically the adventuring partner you create that will accompany you through your journey to slay the Red Dragon, and the Pawn can also be rented by other players online with rift crystals you can get in-game or they can be rented for free if the players who own the game are in your friendlist. The Pawn you created as well as ones you rented can gain knowledge as they adventure with you, they get knowledge on the areas you explore, the enemies you fight, and the quests you do. Also the soundtrack for this game is truly epic!

Additional info on pawns = 

Your pawns also learn inclinations through your adventure [or during their travels in other players worlds] which basically changes how their AI reacts to certain situations and in battles. Their inclinations can be changed by going into inns and sitting down with them for a talk / interview or using potions that can be bought with rift crystals in the Encampment. 

Here are a couple videos explaining how you can change inclinations and how they work =

There are a few setbacks of confusingly marked quests, age old full inventory problems of many rpgs, and constant retracing on foot, but it is incredibly worth sticking with this game to see where the Main quest leads.  The normal game is not difficult, but I was surprised how large the end game and the Bitterback DLC area extended beyond the main quest, and it re-calibrated my understanding that this game does have quests for Higher Leveling and Gear Enhancements, and more in depth Strategies.

GREAT ACTION
Dragon's Dogma has stellar, action fighting dynamics, where you hack, shoot, cast spells, and can even climb up large beasts like Spider Man to hit their weak spots. The creatures you encounter in the regular travels are well known mythical creatures, like goblins, harpies, wolves, while there are fantastic the large creatures that can be in the regular paths are amazing to see in this game such as griffins, cyclops, and dragons.  The battles with the large creatures are epic and chaotic, and can be fairly forgiving without very many deaths if you are decently leveled.  It relies on a fun team of three computer assisted ""pawns"" that aid your fight using their own AI battling.  You need to build an interchangeable team of various skills and spells to take on the adventures ahead.

PAWNS
Your team of Pawns is a very welcomed accompaniment on your journeys, since they are your Computer Assistants who help you fight, cast spells, and pick up items independently of you.  It can get a little chaotic to reign them in as they run off to a fight, or open lots of item containers like a kid opening presents, but they mostly work very well and feel like a great team.  
Pawns are a large focus of the game since to aid your main character, you always keep 1 pawn that you created, but the other 2 pawns you will constantly replace with stronger pawns as you level up because they will not level up.
The inventive feature of the Pawn system is that many pawns are copies of other another players' pawn and you borrow a copy of that pawn, and at the same time your 1 pawn that you created is also available for other players to use a copy. It is really a neat long distance connection to other players, and you can gift an item back to the pawn's owner when you release a copy of their pawn.

WORLD MOOD
The game has a charm and levity as your company of pawns speak all the time in encouraging and optimistic ways, but that levity is smashed by the darker world, such as the opening scene of the Dragon taking your heart, or the Duke's crazed mind and his messed up wife, or live sacrifices of the cult, Salvation. It is a strange dichotomy of tone, and seems like the game wants to show the contrast of a safe, friendly town, to a darker world outside.

BOGGED DOWN
Constantly during questing far away on foot, the game is bogged down by issues of full Inventory and you need to keep passing items among your party or dumping items, because you do not know which items to keep. The crafting system is disappointing because although it is well designed, I spent way too much time trying to experiment, and rarely are the economics worth combining ingredients when you can sell those same components to buy the potion that you are trying to create.  I enjoy crafting systems that better profit the player with Gold for taking the time to combine items.  For the early game, Gold is plentiful when you need a few thousand Gold, but items and enhancement upgrades nearer the end game skyrocket to half a million Gold or more, so I was pressing for methods to make Gold.
Exploring in this game did get tedious when you run into the same enemies and return to the same areas over again.  This ""Dark Arisen"" version of the game gives you an Infinite Warping stone, yet there are still too few warping points, and you will spend the majority of your game time retreading land on foot, and returning to inventory storage locations. You can explore much of the land early in the game, although you can find yourself wondering for hours stopped by mountains and closed obstacles without knowing what you need to progress.

CHALLENGE
Most of the game only lightly challenged my team and barely required the use of counter potions, which was fine because I felt dominant and kept the game fun.  But do not get too comfortable since at one point it surprised me when a dragon in the world cast the spell Possession on my pawn, set Fire to me, and instantly killed my remaining pawns. That was the first time I needed to plan counter potions to battle the ill effects of a beast.  The game is not hard if you level up and carry healing potions, but if you can push ahead there are bigger end-game challenges that need a strategy of potions and spells.


GREAT END - EPIC
I encourage you to push ahead the main Quest and to get to the Dragon who took your heart, since it is a stellar part of the story and I was completely blown away by how it all goes down. I set aside the game a few times because I took my time on the wandering quests, but I am so glad I pressed to the main story to the Dragon. I was level 55, brought a bunch of Spring healing potions, and had no idea what to expect of the fight or how strong I needed to be. It really is a masterful event that pushes beyond the vanilla rpg story of the rest of the game.  

ONWARD
Surprisingly I learned that there is more depth and replay to this game than meets the eye, and that depth welcomes dedicated players to study the game and further test their team. There are tons of weapons, and character builds, and tricks to get better gear.  I ventured a bit into the DLC Bitterback island expecting a small temple but to my surprise it seems to be a vast area, and challenging strategies need to be deployed. I noticed some players online even are past Level 150 while venturing in the area!  The NORMAL game to me started to stagnate by level 50, although my play continued to around level 90 as I started to have fun re-battling the big beasts, and then venturing further into Bitterback DLC. I was hoping for a definite end to beat the game, but you seem to have some flexibility if you want to do Bitterback DLC at any time Lvl 1 and/or even if you continue to NewGame+.  This was a great game and at times invigorating in the journey, if you can get past the searching and wandering, and find a way to complete the Normal game, it is an incredible journey.  Bitterback DLC looks like a great bonus to test more advanced players.

I am excited to eventually try Dragons Dogma 2 (maybe wait a year or so) and see if a new journey will provide renewed engagement in this flavor of an action RPG.",1700854668,1700854943,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

TBH, the main game to me is a mixed bag (6.5/10) because it has so much charm but you can't help feeling like it missed a few tricks in places. There's a lot more going on than it appears and little handholding. It does a good (but not perfect) job of making every class viable throughout the game, with assistance from NPC comrades (pawns) that you can USUALLY rely on.
The additional area to Gransys, Bitterblack Isle, is where the game really starts to get compelling (8.5/10) (and feels more like dark souls lol), I really enjoyed that. 

General Pros:
* The character customisation is great (9 available classes to mix and match with, including MAGE = average magic + healing and SORCERER = no healing + insanely OP elemental spells (had lots of fun with MAGIC ARCHER's ricochet shots too after my magic stat got high). This game has incredible magic attacks, but I do wish you could mix and match a bit more (I would sacrifice 1 or 2 (but not the best ones!) elemental attacks to keep healing ability!)
* The soundtrack is very memorable and the atmosphere with it = spot on to an open world, fantasy locale.
* It feels like armours (many are per similar class) have generally not that much stat difference between them (weapons absolutely do though), so you can do 'fashion souls' if you like and not be penalised too badly for it!
* Your steam friends' pawns can be max level (200) and cost 0 rift points to help you out, so if you're really stuck on a boss, you might have a lifeline in them!
* With little handholding, the map has a real feeling of being left to explore. Infact, it's not actually that big of a map (nothing like Elden ring for example) and dungeons/zones are often copy-pasted with only slight variations to be honest (it doesn't stand out too badly), but it does FEEL bigger than it is and the enemy varieties within them are always good.
* The over the top, massive boss battles are done so well in this game. Hydras, Griffins, Manticores, Beholders, Dragons and all their variations for DAYS.

Cons/thoughts:
* Your helper NPCs (pawns) are fun to listen to, but they're not always helpful in combat (even with pawn elixirs meant to outright set their 'mode' (scather/challenger/mitigator etc and nor even after training them with 'come' and 'go' commands all the live long day. Perhaps you can rely on them less as a strength build yourself, but as a spellcaster, ideally you want them to distract enemies so you can be the glass cannon, and sometimes they take your evasive/clever positioning as a cue to stare into space lol
Hopefully a sequel allows for more precise pawn commanding (like 'open that chest with a maneater in it for me, please' lol)

*The Main story quests (sidequests are a little more involved) repeatedly caught me off guard for how quick/easy they were. (More a bad thing than good). They're over SO quickly! Am I saying they're too easy? Not necessarily, some quests can be a good challenge on the journey and they do all mesh well with a narrative, but equally they seem very short. It's also very easy to miss main quests because you did another, and without any warning, making the 'Hero' achievement rarer, though you can finish them up in NG+.

*I also don't think we really spend anywhere near enough time on character development and even the Duke/members of court would have benefitted from more interaction/storytime, so characters can feel a bit hollow. Lots of facial expressions, little meaningful dialogue lol 
In dark souls fashion, since cutscenes are rare and characters quite 1 dimensional, I think the game could do with lore snippets here and there to fill it out at least (like item description stuff).

*The system of being able to pay a specific price to duplicate almost EVERY ITEM in the game (usually without any consequence lol) is strange but a def positive (encourages getting coin to keep doing it, to then upgrade weapons and armour fully etc).
Noteworthy, but the game can also get a bit grindy (for specific loot etc) in the same area which might put some people off. You also only find a few of the teleport crystals your first time around so you might have to teleport to main cities instead and do a bit of a trek. 

* I admit in the beginning, I found the mechanic of some items (food and some plants) perishing after not that long to be quite intimidating. (You have to buy and combine them with airtight flasks). Not very important mid to late game, but in the beginning when it's all you have or items need to stay fresh for a sidequest, and you do might need to keep an eye on this.

It also has a bizarre saving system of 'checkpoints' whenever you rest/sleep which is your ACTUAL checkpoint and any saves (or autosaves) can be loaded but equally you can undo everything you've done back to your last sleep e.g. if you bumped into an NPC and made them not like you lol (Yes, there's a questionable NPC-likeability mechanic and you can give people presents!).
It also doesn't say, but I think there's like a 7 day ingame timer where killed/angry NPCs and certain items/enemies will respawn as if nothing happened. Go figure!

* There are a few 'Metal Golems' in the game. They can be killed by hitting their medallions scattered around the level to whittle down its health. Absolutely no problem for a warrior/fighter who can reach them, or a bow user strider/archer who can shoot them and do physical damage...but mage? sorcerer? magic archer? it becomes a real slog trying to hit them and doing next to no damage with predominantly magic dmg attacks that only have minor physical dmg on top of them. ""Throwable bombs"" or ""respec temporarily"" here, it might have to be!

*Fall damage is a bit silly lol Levitating at the end of dropping from a not-that-high fall should prevent you falling flat on your face but it doesn't :(

===BBI===
Bitterblack Isle REALLY elevates the game beyond the falling and grinding in the Everfall.
Definitely a huge plus for fans of dark souls and it requires the same kind of persistence to get through.
You don't dare go there until you're either very sneaky or at least around lvl 60, and even then it will be a challenge (though you can go whenever you like!) where everything is lethal and trying to kill you - even death!
I know it's just essentially another dungeon-crawler separate to the main journey, but the oppressive and haunting atmospheres (sometimes to be greeted by hulking dark abominations spawning in at random) are just a joy to descend deeper into and the rewards (equipment etc) are many (some wpns can be worth millions to sell on if you're in need of cash.).

Oh, and also, not start as a mage. At some point, everything seemed to click - the combat felt really quite fluid, I knew exactly how to get the best combination of Pawns depending on how I was playing, and I was absolutely smashing every enemy type I came across, even the dragons. 

Then, I found a pretty addictive game loop that I kept coming back to, and before I knew it, I was a good 80 hours in and level 70 - 80, at the endgame, but with still content to do.

I've been singing the praises of this game for the longest pf time, and I dearly hope that it gets the sequel it deserves!

[h1]The Good[/h1]
+9 Vocations, each with six (Except warrior, but I'll talk about that later) assignable skills to your primary and secondary weapons. These skills vary from counter spells activated on block, explosive pocket sand, shield spring boards and a life stealing magic bolt called ""great sacrifice"". Not to mention you get to select from a huge list of augments, both shared and not, and mix and match them to your hearts content. 

+Combat is the bread and butter of this game! It's just fun! Once you reach bitterblack isle, you might find yourself spending time entering and leaving an arena room that respawns unique groups of enemies - I know I did.

+Evil eyes, hydras, cockatrices, wyverns, demons, living armour, death himself and more. This game has an absolutely massive boss variety, all with interesting enough challenges to keep you interested in battling it out. If only the same could be said for the small enemies, which are oft just recolours.
   
+Spells, my god, the spells. If you've ever wanted to send a cataclysmic meteor, or summon a tornado on unsuspecting foes, the magic in this game is for you. It's just beautiful.

[h1]The Variable[/h1]
+/- Massive item variety, almost too great. The game contains pages upon pages of healing items, crafting materials, special items and the like - and has an absolutely huge crafting list... Most of which I was unable to ever make because I hadn't managed to either find the item required, or the drop/find rate was so low, that you never had any in stock. It's variable, because you can literally ignore it. All periapt buffs, all special arrow types and any curatives that will serve can all be bought at some point in the game.

+/- Good items require a massive grind. I like a bit of grinding, and for the most part the game fed me good enough items as the game went along so I wasn't bothered by it, but the moment you're looking to find some special weapon or armour, be prepared for tens of runs giving you nothing but dupes in bitterblack.

+/- The pawns - I love them, but I also hate them, [b] goblins hate ice and fire both [/b]. Don't forget to sit your pawn down in a knowledge chair, ask them to pick up EVERYTHING and shut the hell up while they're at it.

+/- Enemy damage and armour scaling. The damage system works like this: 
Damage = [enemy armour] - [weapon damage + damage type stat]  where Damage<0 = 1
This means that the only thing that truly matters is your gear. Personally, I enjoy seeing my gear vastly improve my performance, but if you overstep your bounds, a boss that should take 5 minutes now can take upwards of 40. 

+/- Equipment load management - When you start the game, you get to choose your height and your weight. Don't be fooled though, your height affects your movement speed (walking, climbing, NOT sprinting) and your weight, which affects your equipment load and stamina regeneration rate. Before deciding these, you should look at the wiki to find what would work best for you. The problem comes from the amount of time you might have to spend in menu's, sending all your monster parts to your pawns after you become overencumbered. Oh, and remember, when depositing items into your item box, remember that you can press ""Category"" to deposit all of one category, it's really handy. 

+/- The story. Personally, I think the story is acceptable. Some of it makes sense, most of it doesn't. Most of the fun in the game does not come from the story, however.

[h1]The bad[/h1]
-There is a single obligatory escort mission where you have to slowly walk alongside a convoy ferrying a hydra's head. This takes literally 15 minutes. In order to avoid this problem, make sure to summon a healing pawn with anodyne, and [b] Kick. That. Ox[/b]. It makes it go faster, no it's still terrible.  

-The entire Warrior vocation. This vocation gets to use a big eff-off sword, with some really hard hitting attacks. You can charge up an Arc of Deliverance, which is a channel ability with absolutely humongous damage potential, and whose impact representation in-game is fantastic. Wait, right, this is a bad point. Warrior only gets to have three active skills, and most of the skills are borderline unusable against endgame enemies (they don't reach weak points). If warrior had gotten the last three skill slots that it should have, then it would have been fantastic, but as it stands, it cannot compare to any of the other classes. Which brings me to..

-This game felt like it was designed around co-op. You have abilities like springboard, or Ladder blade, whose purpose is to launch an ally onto an enemy for damage, the problem is that your allies can't ever make use of it. Many skills are made redundant because of this lack of foresight.

-Lack of balance in skill selection. Some skills are undeniably better than the rest, and to a ridiculous extent. Attacks like brain splitter, fracture dart, and when combined, instant reset become almost essential for late-game efficiency. The last boss of the game can be permanently stun-locked by just you, and one other pawn, spamming fracture dart. The problem therefore is that many skills that are fun, like foot binder, toss and trigger, dazzle blast, easy kill etc, are not really useful late game.

-Your stats levels are determined by which vocation you were using when you gained a level, this actively discourages you from mixing and matching str/mag vocations, since your endgame character will have a much harder time dealing damage in each of the damage types. 

-Communicating with the pawns - you have only three options, ""go"", ""help"" and ""come"". If only you could equip your melee pawn with springboard, and ask for it. It's ok, I guess...

[h1] Final Verdict [/h1]

This game is great, buy a copy and play it! You'll get, at the very least, a good 20-30 hours from the base game, and if you enjoy farming for better gear, upward 80-120 hours from the bitterblack endgame.
The combat is satisfying, the soundtrack is great, the story is there (???) and there's loads of fun weapon and armour combinations to fashion yourself out with. I highly recommend it.

The game has great character and creature designs, interesting takes on existing fantasies, and while the combat can be finicky sometimes, I quite like the skills and vocations!

Dark Arisen, while much harder than the base game, is a great expansion too. In my opinion the main game lacked a little bit in content and Dark Arisen made up quite well for that along with the extra story that comes with it.

The combat system in this game is one of the best you could ever find, climbing/grabbing monsters, all vocations(classes) are unique & fun to play, and the day-night cycle is just perfect. Pawn(follower) AI is mind-blowing as they can literally learn from your habit, for example if you likes to loot things even when the fight is still going on then the pawn will later learn and do the same thing, to think this game released 10y ago is just insane. I read that this game is actually only 40% due to budget crisis in the middle of development, and I can really tell with how rushed it is on the later part of the story. And I'd say for an open world rpg this game map isn't really as huge as others, but the perfect day-night cycle implemented really well that it really encourages us to explore. The game has it flaws but the part that they finished are perfect. What I need to say is don't stick with the main quest, do your side quests, take your time with it, because the game feels really short if you stick to main quest too much. Also, LOVES the old English-British accent in this game! This is the best 7/10 game you'll ever find!

If you enjoy Skyrim / Dark souls / elden ring and games alike.

You'll enjoy this!

Pawns are brilliant as you can specialise your character and your pawn and effectively 'hire' other players pawns to assist you with your quests (Can hire up to 2 more pawns to run alongside you and your pawn) 

The Pawn have their own skill set and will develop as the game continues. If you fight plenty of one enemy type your pawn will start to develop their fighting skills to take the enemy out quicker and deadlier.

Equipment is where you have to read what benefits you get out of each piece and that alone is common in many games which falls under the RPG aspect

Character level - You can change what class you want to be and can purchase / level up your move set which would vary between each class. obviously more you level up the more health and damage can be done.

Pawn - Now this aspect they are brilliant and they do aid you in a big way. Your main pawn you want to level up and equip as much as your main guy does due to other 'Arisen' players can hire your pawn (You still get to keep em with you) and every time you go to an inn the other players can send you gifts to you for hire and you would get a load of points to level your guy/pawn up so you can get better skills/move sets

Open world - It isn't as big as Dark souls / elden ring but big enough to have fun in and to explore!

The game has been made a long time ago now but the graphics are good and the gameplay is brilliant. 

I will admit some of the quests is a bit of a snore but some do keep you hooked! I have played solid 4 hours without realising and I've enjoyed it enough to leave a review.

Will update as I go along and if you see my Pawn Violet (Class Strider) do send me some goodies eh? ;)

Some quests are great, giving you a rough direction and an estimate of what you need to do and then providing you with the tools to figure it out yourself - explore a dungeon and check out what's happening in there.
And other quests just say something like ""Gather evidence (you have 4 days)"" which means you either run around talking to random NPCs on the streets for an hour or two, most of which have nothing to say outside of general ""What nice weather we have today"", or pull up a walkthrough and follow it step by step.
And these are main quests. You can't just skip them because you don't care. 
And even if in theory you can fail them and move on, you will miss out on lore and cutscenes.

The devs knew this and tried to remedy it with the pawn learning system - in theory your companions learn how to complete quests when witnessing other players doing them and can later help you with the more enigmatic quests.
In practice, this mostly doesn't work and the quests that are braindead simple - go to this dungeon and kill this boss - are the only ones that my pawns ""helped"" with.

At the same time, you can't just say ""I'll figure it out later."" and do some different quests, beacuse many of them can be failed if they aren't done in time and others are automatically failed after some point-of-no-return.

This is my main problem with the game and the reason I can't bring myself to play it more.

Other than that, many of the systems featured here are great.
I love the vocation system - it allows you do drastically change your playstyle whenever you want and improves replayability.
The pawns are an interesting idea, although 90% of them are females with huge breasts, wearing only underwear.
And I like the overall theme and colourscheme, being more bland and ""realistic"" than most others in the genre.

But the quests are just too frustrating and boring.

When Dragon's Dogma 2 comes out, I'll probably try it out.

There is an alternate universe where every developer is trying to recreate pawn mechanics of Dragons Dogma. Making boss fights where instead of hitting the giant enemy between their toes until it's health bar reaches zero, you climb on them, find their weak spots, try to stay on them while it tries to throw you off, chop off their limbs to weaken them. 

It's crazy none off these feels scripted in Dragons Dogma. The sandbox nature of combat flows so naturally that it makes you feel like you are watching a scene from a fantasy action movie but every moment is under your control.

Was it really going to be anything special, anything I hadn't seen before? But I took a chance and picked it up recently in the post-Christmas sale. 

Good decision! 

This feels different from any other open world RPG I've played. It's a game that doesn't try to do everything well, but instead really delivers on two or three key elements. The story (so far) is nothing special, the characters are 2D, the script is mediocre, the voice acting is meh, the lip-sync is shoddy, the interface is annoying and the quests are pretty basic. But none of this matters too much, because (a) the world is great to explore and (b) the combat is so much fun.

Other reviewers have gone into the combat in depth. I'll just reiterate what they've said: it's the best I've come across in an open world RPG. And there's a lot of fighting in this game! Cutting down armed bandits, scorching lizard men to death, shooting down harpies, immobilizing giant cyclopes with lightning blasts... It's all good fun, with enough diversity in terms of play-styles and enemy types to keep me engaged.

The game's other great strength is the design of the world and how satisfying it is to explore. It looks great, it's neither too big nor too small, it feels dangerous to get lost in (especially when it gets dark). The game rewards you for exploration but punishes the overly-intrepid.

It's just rough around the edges, probably due to low budget and time constraints. That's why I'm looking forward to the sequel. I just want to talk about 3 main points that the game got so well and it is what makes the game so fresh and original.

[b] Combat / Vocation system: [/b]

This game has many classes that you can play as. And they all change the combat dramatically. The combat is really good. It plays like a good action game.

What's great about it is that you can swap vocations with little cost. If you get bored with one, you can switch to another one. No need to commit to one build throughout the whole game. To be able to switch around builds and experiment is something I'd like in more RPG's.

The day-night cycle actually matters. Things change at night. The enemies change, and it's actually pitch dark. You feel it. It's awesome.

The meat of the combat is fighting many types of big creatures that you can climb on. It's a lot like Monster Hunter. You have to know about each monster's weaknesses to have an edge. You also have to cooperate with your pawns.

[b] Pawn system: [/b]

Pawns are your CPU-controlled party members. You have your main pawn that you build yourself, and 2 others. The other 2 are pawns from other players. You could say this is a [i]strand type[/i] mechanic. Through pawns, the game connects you to other real life players.

Pawns also learn different things as they experience the world; and they help you in many ways, even in quests by giving you quest information. Their knowledge isn't hard coded, though. If they know something, it's because they actually experienced it either in your world or in some other player's.

You could talk about this pawn system for hours so i'll stop here. But it's one of the coolest and most original game mechanics I've seen in an RPG.

[b] Quest design: [/b]

Choices you make actually matter, even in-between quests. NPC's remember what you do. You build a reputation with them throughout the game. All of this contributes to a feeling of immersion and real consequences.

[b] Downsides and final thoughts: [/b]

The game is rough around the edges and there is a lot of jank. The story isn't told very well and it feels rushed at many points. The world sometimes feels not enough populated and rich. Also, you'll be spending too much time running to get to point A to B, due to no mounts and a very limited fast-travel system.

This game just needed more budget and it'd be one of the greatest games ever made. Let's hope they perfect it in the sequel.",1699821802,1699821802,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The good...

Combat is the game. It's a lot of fun. It's very 80's/90's arcade like. Climbing up big monsters is a lot of fun. There's a lot of classes with cool abilities to work between.

The pawn system is fun. You build the right party, and you'll have a lot fun. Customizing your main pawn is a cool addition. 

The class system is really cool with what you can mix from different classes.

Actions have consequences in this game. Doing the right or wrong thing can change the world in unintended ways. Things really matter, and that's rare these days.

This has probably the best day/night cycle in a game I've played since Castlevania 2. Night has different enemies. The lantern only lights up so much, and it can be hard to see enemies. Finding things in the dark can be challenging.

The soundtrack was really fitting.



The ok...

The pawns don't have much use. You can't command them to do what you want.

Excessive amount of pawns exclaiming loudly in slow motion can break up the flow of combat.

The map isn't too big, but you'll be backtracking a lot.

The story is ok. There's a good story there, just poorly told.

The inventory weight limit will have you spending a lot of time micro-managing storage between pawns.



The bad.

The game actually gives you a manual that explains some things. In today's day it's a miracle to even get anything. However, the game fails to explain almost anything outside of the basics to you. You can easily miss most of this game. This is sadly common with the low standards of today's gaming. I miss detailed manuals.

The game design can be poor. I see why so few people bought it, or played past a few hours (very low achievement rates.) The combat is strictly numbers, with no skill. This wouldn't be bad except that early on you may encounter random bandits that are impossible to kill. I imagine this frustrated a lot of players out of the game. The stamina system is terrible for exploring. You will always run out fast.

Overall, I recommend it on a good sale. I spent about $10-15 on it. Worth it.

There's an input delay when using controller on the Start screen that I've come loathe. My reason: this game has randomized loot tables. The same chest can give a useless item or highly valued items, depending on RNG. Even in the first village, Cassardis, there are spots to gain gold with possible loot at 100g, 1000g, 3500g, up to 10000g. 

It is absolutely in your favor to meta game by looking up loot tables and save scumming chests. There's even a late game meta known as ""godsbaning"", where you suicide to cut reload time. You're going to be seeing that start screen A LOT. This takes the joy out of finding a chest, knowing you might spend the next 30 mins reloading or leave with FOMO. Treasures respawn, but so do enemies. Your pawns can also open chests unprompted...

The pawn system is a great and novel, but deeply flawed. The AI is simply lacking. They'll fall off cliffs, throw bombs at you, smash barrels you need to climb up, your mages will cast spells standing out in the open, etc. They'll also learn and change disposition by player action, so every so often you'll need to literally sit them down and have a talk... over and over because Knowledge Chair convos are also randomized. Or if its really necessary, spend rift crystals which may mean spending several hours farming Bitterblack Isle.

Your only other means of controlling your pawns are commands: ""Go!"", ""Help!"" and ""Come!"" I would've liked a basic ""Stay"" for when I'm trying to stealth. But nope, they've already drawn aggro. This can also make it seem like the game is one long escort quest (which this game also has). It's little wonder many players prefer to play solo. (lol in Mystic Knight)

But you'll want to build your pawn for late game, and occasionally need to borrow pawns from other players. However many pawns out there are from players who played and quit, or players who didnt give thought to pawn build. Obvious joke pawns are also common. And there's no good way to search the pawn directory (and the official Capcom pawn exchange has gone down). So it can take hours to find the right pawn.

Oh, and all the loli and child pawns, although partly due to game design. There's a meta of carry weight vs stamina/mana regen based on the height and weight. Short/light pawns have low carry weight but high regen. You see a lot of mage pawns that are as short as possible, disturbing for obv reasons.

Oh, and as many have mentioned, a single save file! Honestly, I feel like it was done just for ""replayability"" which otherwise wouldn't be there. On PC its easy to work around by making copies of the save file, but the game's auto save can still make you have to backtrack or just wait for NewGame+. But NG+ would mean replaying through the story, which isn't really DD's strong point? xD

Combat is the reason I've tried to stick with this game. The grapple mechanic is great (except directional control when climbing a monster) - again good but flawed. The vocations are fleshed out have a certain play style but still intuitive enough to regularly swap out. Environments can also be used in combat, either strategically or to player's detriment.

Except for The Brine. The Brine is dumb. Its just a border around the playable area. Invisible walls would've been better. Oh wait, the game has those too. Seriously, you start in fishing village but they cant swim.

All in all, this game has a lot going for it. It's really a matter of how much of the flaws a player is willing to overlook. Dragon's Dogma 2 has been announced and hopefully with improved systems.",1675887919,1699586006,False,2,0,0.487179487943649292,0,True,False,False

In a genre that often feels stale with the same overused systems, Dragon's Dogma tries something a bit different for a change, and it works quite well.

Combine that with the tight combat system and the very Monster Hunter-ish boss battles and you get a mix of solid features that make for a pretty good action RPG.

The open world, although at times feels a bit empty, is still interesting to explore a little bit. 

I think this game has been shilled to the point of exhaustion by some people and while you shouldn't expect a masterpiece level of a game, its still quite good.",1606242194,1699406475,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

If you essentially have to have a guide open to ensure you're not going to an area you'll get dumped on/softlocking out of a quest/what descriptions mean/when inaction is suddenly considered an action/figure out what even is the main quest, there's a problem.  

Also the save system is an absolute non starter.  It would honestly be better if it just didn't exist so you don't have the expectation (ex - Fromsoft - same thing with quest notekeeping as well).  I don't usually have more than one save/save state but the fact that you can't load your manual save whatsoever is insane to me.  Autosave will likely piss you off and the ""checkpoint"" save is inconsistent, frustrating, and probably from 2 hours before where you want it. Seems to be whenever you sleep at an inn or whenever a quest is COMPLETED (not objective updated, etc even if you hit a switch/go through an entire dungeon/boss fight/save/view cutscenes/start new quests/ hit the pawn stone thingy from my experience)

It was better than i though, the world building is great, the fantasy elements are good, the OST is good, the combat system is enjoyable, granted, the game is kinda dated, which is largely noticeable on the Menu and Inventory management.

So lets get to specifics:

Gameplay: 
Overall, the gameplay is good, theres several classes to choose from, each with their own flair, which allow you to customize them with different skills to suit your needs, fighting enemies is enjoyable, since each enemy has its own weaknesses and strategies to deal with them, like climbing behind a Cyclops to make him remove his helmet trying to grab you, exposing his eye, travelling can be a bit tedious at the beginning since theres A LOT of walking, but has you progress through the game you can gain Warp Crystals that essentially serve has fast travels you can place pretty much anywhere. 

Pawn System:
Probably one of the best if not the best aspects of this game, you can create your own companion in the game, which is called Pawn, this is essentially a second character you can customize to your liking, and you can even hire up to 2 pawns created by other players to help you in your journey, making it a total party of 4, with you the Arisen, the Main (your) Pawn, and two extra Pawns, so you can create your adventure party, with each member filling a role, like a ranged dps, a support, a tank, etc.

This king of thing heavily reminded me of the likes of World of Warcraft, of making a party to tackle dungeons, bosses and such, which was pretty good. 

Performance: 
Didnt really ran into many issues, there were a few crashes here and there, but nothing else besides that. 

The HUD: 
Yeah here is where the game really shows its age (besides the graphics), the K&M keybinds for the menu are messy to say the least, and changing equipment feels clunky, and the game could REALLY have used a search bar, since you can acquire a large amount of items, so sometimes it can take a while to find whatever item youre looking for, but like i said, this largely a product of its time, which is likely fixed for the sequel.

The DLC:
Oh god the Bitterblack Isle... yeah i have to voice some issues with this area, its meant to be the endgame zone, so it is meant to be the hardest area in the game, but some of that difficulty just felt frustrating, to begin with if you dont deal enough dmg to bypass the REALLY high defenses of the enemies there, then you literally do no dmg, i learned the hard way, also several enemies can be outright obnoxious, one being the Living Armors which do considerable dmg and need both Physical and Magic dmg to kill, so depending on your class, youre gonna have to depend on the AI of the pawns to deal with the first or second form of these things (first is weak to physical while the second is to magick), its doable, but again, be prepared for it, or youre gonna hate it.

Writing:
I found the overall Lore to be good and interesting, but the plot itself felt weak and had pacing issues, and i felt several characters were underused, Selene being an example. 

Conclusion:
The game is good, its aged mostly well, if you want a good Fantasy game, this is it. 

Cant wait for the sequel which looks really good.

เป็นเกมที่เสียเวลาเล่นนาน  แต่ไม่ใช่เกมที่น่าเล่น

ถึงจะเป็นเกมเก่า แต่คุณจะได้พบกับสิ่งกวนส้นเท้าคนเล่นที่ไม่น่ามีใครทำมากนัก 

อาทิ บอกว่าตัวเองเป็นโอเพนเวิลด์แมพใหญ่ แต่เส้นทางจริงๆคือลากเส้นตรงตัดทแยงจากมุมแมพมาอีกมุมเป็นกากบาทแล้วสร้างแผนที่ทางเดินแคบๆล้อมด้วยภูเขาหรือทะเลที่ไปไม่ได้
แถมยังใช้ซ้ำอย่างไม่น่าให้อภัยด้วยเควสที่ยิงไปตรงสุดมุมแมพตรงนู้นตรงนี้ที ซ้ำไปซ้ำมา โดยที่ไม่มีการรวมจุดให้สำรวจจบเป็นที่ๆ คุณจะเสียเวลาส่วนใหญ่ในการเดินผ่านทางเดิมๆ ลงดันเจี้ยนเดิมๆซ้ำแล้วซ้ำอีก และกว่าคุณจะรู้ว่าตรงไหนควรตั้งจุดวาป มีจุดวาปพอใช้ก็แทบจะท้ายเกมแล้ว  

นอกจากจะต้องวนอยู่ในแมพเดิมๆ ทางเดิมๆจนเหมือนเป็นสวนหลังบ้านแล้วหลายจุดก็ต้องรอเนื้อเรื่องหรือเควสพาไปถึงเข้าได้ และมักไม่มีอะไรดึงดูดใจให้ไปอีกนอกจากทำเควสเก็บเหรียญหรือเควสแม่งให้ไปใหม่

ขนาดนั้นแล้ว ยังมีหน้ามาทำฉากแบบใช้แล้วทิ้ง แถมมีเควสเก็บเหรียญในนั้นที่จะเก็บได้แค่ตอนนั้นและมันอยู่ในห้องบอสแบบสู้บอสเสร็จคัทซีนพัง รอบแรกไม่รู้มาก่อนคือเฟลแน่นอน เจอบอสใครจะมานั่งไล่เก็บของสำรวจแมพ  เป็นอะไรที่บัดซบมากเหมือนบังคับเล่นรอบใหม่หรือรู้ตัวทันรีบกดออกเกมแล้วมาเล่นใหม่ เพราะเกมมีแต่เซฟออโต้หรือเซฟเองล่าสุดทับไปเรื่อยๆเซฟเดียวเท่านั้นไม่สามารถเล่นหลายเซฟหรือเซฟไว้ตรงจุดนั้นจุดนี้ได้และมันเซฟทันทีเมื่อเจอเหตุการณ์อะไรซักอย่าง

ไหนจะเนื้อเรื่องที่ตีมใหญ่ครอบนั้นคิดมาพอจะว้าวอยู่ แต่ข้างในนั้นกลับกลวงและเล่าได้ห่วยแตก ตัวละครตามเนื้อเรื่องก็จืดจาง ไร้เควสปฏิสัมพันธ์แล้วยังตัดบททิ้งทุเรศทุกตัวอีก แบบมีเควสเปิดทำความรู้จักเจออีกทีเควสปิดที่ทำเสร็จจะไม่เจอแม่งอีกเลย เป็นงี้หลายตัวมาก บางตัวบทปูมาเหมือนเป็นบอสแต่กลับหายไปเฉยๆเลยก็มี

ยังมีอะไรแย่ๆอีกเยอะที่ไล่หมดคงยาวเวอร์  แต่แค่นี้ก็เพียงพอที่จะให้เป็นเกมห่วยแล้ว 

อ่อ ข้อดีอย่างเดียวที่เกมนี้ทำได้คือ การควบคุมต่อสู้ที่ฉับไว เรียบง่าย รวดเร็ว  

...แต่ไม่สานต่อให้สุดทางซ้ำยังเหมือนกลัวง่ายไปก็ไม่ทราบได้ เพิ่มระบบหรือการหน่วงแอคชั่นใส่เข้ามาในจุดที่ขัดกับการควบคุมปกติ เช่นการหยิบของขว้างที่ตั้งช็อทคัทและเล็งเป้าดีๆไม่ได้ต้องเข้าไปกดถือในเมนูแล้วออกมาขว้างแบบกะเอาเอง หรือการโดดออกจากมอนที่หน่วงช้าเวอร์จนน่าเกลียด ผิดกับตอนเราเข้าปีนหรือตอนโดนสะบัดหลุด

Friday, 3 a.m., I wander around in my room for 10 minutes feeling like I just lost a friend.  

Now, the review: 
- The game is far from perfect. It has a lot of ""point of no return"" moments due to the autosave and single savefile feature.   
- The difficulty is quite terrible. I know running is an option but the game is bad at teaching it.  
- I started playing this game after watching the combat (especially the mage playstyle) and the pawn system. After seeing how you can make another character as an NPC, I was like ""say no more"" and bought the game.
- The pawn system is very interesting. It has more depth than the main character itself. I will not be satisfied until I make a perfect pawn.  
- I also love the mage playstyle. It makes me feel like I am, well, a mage. However, I became an archer later because some enemies easily counter pure magic build. [i]Damn those golems and wolves[/i].
- The main disappointment in this game is that there is no way to continue your adventure after watching the credit scene without starting a New Game+ due to how the story goes.",1698359931,1698381374,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm not that far in, and playing on hardmode, and am very satisfied on the difficulty/challenge. (hardmode is you take more dmg, that's it, but that isn't such an issue because the fighting mechanics lend itself to playing smart and striking hard, so hardmode makes all encounters more threatening, but beatable). 

I'm playing as Fighter, so it's possible the other classes will have a more difficult time, but as a fighter, you can block all strikes (so far), then dash in for high damage before relocating defensively for the next opponent while your team do their thing creating distractions and openings. 

The creatures all have unique weaknesses, figuring them out is fun, and impactful, you can climb onto monsters (that's new to me, even though i am aware other games since have this mechanic) and get to their weakpoints. You can knock opponents down and/or up, grab them as a shield, and other theatrical skill moves. Combat is fun and tactical (on hardmode)

the story-loop, is a bit flat and their reality feels crazy (i mean the pawns? really? wierdest lore ever). The quest delivery method feel a bit too much like mmorpg fetch questing (but it is a product of its time, 2012-2016), and it's not too bad, there are plenty worse in present day.

The main storyline missions are engaging enough, and the world/threats are satisfyingly dangerous (on hardmode) and uniquely challenging (ie. the unique monster weaknesses and attack patterns). Get it. It's fun if you are into some sword and board action and rpg mechanics.

edit: i got to say their loot design/progression is poor. my experience is hardmode so i can speak only from that perspective. your initial starting items are the strongest in the game. i'm at the midway point, and i've never really had to change my gear. Everything they present to you, in chests or shops is weaker. And money drops like crazy. 10k gold drops happen frequently. money is not a factor. anyway, the loot progression is a mess.  acquiring upgrade components off creatures is the only thing that is paced correctly.",1682865598,1698266273,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Game is clearly unfinished with content abruptly dropping off on the end.
- Gameplay is very rough and buggy despite being released multiple times.
- Absurd systems like having levels tied to the class your playing as you level up with no in-game explanation of how it works, and no way to respec if you mess up or how a random NPC can be made into a forced romance based on simply being the last person you talk to before doing the final mission (hint: all the main romances leave your world before this quest, so if you talk to ANY NPC afterwards, they can potentially replace them as your romance. EVEN if you give them the wedding ring accessory. :')
- Fixed how certain classes are straight up broken and can even one shot bosses while other classes are objectively nerfed by comparison / have less abilities / Abilities come with absurd penalties or costs in exchange for ""equal"" damage / significantly put you at a disadvantage when you to play them.

Things they should have fixed but didn't include:
- Fixed the atrocious save system which literally lost me 2 days worth of gameplay due to how checkpoints and autosave work.
- Added additional save slots instead of limiting you to 1 slot and forcing you to overwrite it if you want to try something new.
- Fixed the Pawn system to be more competent.
- Added actual coop instead of having you recruit online players character's to join you as offline summons, like ""42069[redacted]GothBf"" which totally kill your immersion and cannot be customised in a meaningful way.
- Fixed any of the thousands of bugs and glitches in the game.
- Fixed any of the absurd systems that don't make sense or don't work properly.
- Added explanations in the game for these absurd systems so you don't have to play with a wiki open.

Loot is good-ish, but so far, no diablo/destiny-like loot system where you switch weapons every boss, which I happen to think has some charm, but I'd like to change more. 
But a few things you ought to remember:
ALWAYS SAVE THE GAME (feels like I'm back in 2000's but yeah don't forget to save manually, or you'll lose hours of grind on a daily basis, if you suck at playing this like me)
There's a lot of walking in this game (couldn't they put some horses or anything geez)
This game is prone to bugs when you alt+tab, so remember again, to save before every time you go back to your desktop/internet browser where you are reading guides for quests/character builds.

This game, despite the lacking in graphic department(given that it's a rather old game) hold up well in other department. Combat is unique with each class/vocation giving a fresh paint to the series as different classes have their own ways of dishing out damage. Kind of like using different weapon in monster hunter giving it a whole new type of play style.

The pawn system is way WAY ahead of it's time, a sort of AI companion that gain quest and enemy knowledge as they travel with you. An online system where other players can ""rent"" your pawn to go on their adventure and you can rent others too. Not only that when the pawn have finish their online adventure, any additional knowledge on quest/enemy info get added to your pawn. And if you rent a pawn that have already finish a quest that you are currently doing, talking to them might drop hints or they will guide you to the necessary npc to progress the quest.

Now for some cons. This game while not as hard as dark soul, is no walk in the park either, the open world can be quite unforgiving especially to those unprepared, it is especially dangerous to travel at night.

Quest are easily miss or can't progress after a certain story point and if you have no backup save you got to wait till the next run to do them so if you are looking to finish every quest it is better to refer to a guide.

The very first run of the game is a bit unforgiving as the whole map is open to explore which make escort quest annoying to finish but after you have places your port crystal (a sort of teleport land marker) new game+ will be a breeze.

So if you are into rpg and open world and see this game on sales its definitely worth giving it a shot.",1697893338,1697893338,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story is a bit of a mess, but ultimately the world and setting it presents, while a bit messy, is a pretty nice and interesting deal. The combat, and classes... It's fantastic. If I were asked what the best combat I've experienced in a game was, I'd point to this game. It's like a combination of Souls, and Monster Hunter... Even the magic in this game really feels great. Probably the coolest and most impactful magic I've seen in a game. Sorcerers can summon spells that just wreck everything, it really makes you feel like a crazy powerful mage... Downside is you have to sit there for like 30 seconds charging a spell, and if you get knocked around at all, it's obviously cancelled. 

The idea of ""Pawns"" is really neat. You can bring a NPC companion of a friend or a random person online with you to help out. It's not quite multiplayer, but it's nice. They're mostly kinda stupid, their AI isn't the best, but yeah lol, still a neat concept. Waifu trading.

The only complaints I'd have, is that when you play anything that requires you to climb the big monsters to get to their weak spots... basically any melee class, the camera isn't great. Climbing can be awkward, because the direction you climb isn't quite how you'd think it'd be, but you get use to it. Sometimes you're on the dude's chest, but somehow get clipped through his arm, and now you're on his arm. The way the leveling and stat distribution work is kinda awful too. If you want to min/max, you basically HAVE to play Assassin or Sorcerer until max level, because leveling in those classes gives the most strength/magic attributes, THEN you can play whatever you want. 

I've played the hell out of this game on PS3/PS4... And a bit on PC... It's definitely a fun game that I still come back to. Definitely worth it imo. And now we're geting Dogma 2? Daaaang.

Full playthrough in Hard-Mode, then another one, in normal mode - the Bitterblack storyline flabbergasted me, the main storyline engrossed me now as much as then.
The game is just too good, just the running around, the adventuring for adventuring sake, all of it.

Who knows how much time I've personally sunk into this stupid thing because I KEEP FUCKING COMING BACK TO HER.
 
The game can be ridiculously short, if you want it to be and long if you want it to be. It respects your time, and there's a lot of stuff you can actually miss your first couple of playthroughs. 

Combat is responsive, reactionary, and committal, so if you like action games you'll LOVE this.
The story is serviceable, I agree with most of the community that it's mostly ""meh"". I like it but at the end of the day it's just padding to get you to fight the final boss.

And that's kind of literally the point of the story.
This is a game where it's a lot more about the journey, not the destination.

Take it like this. I've bought the game four times. No one buys a game 4 times if they don't think it's good.
I also like hardly ever care about achievements.
This is also probably my longest ""review"".
So take all of that as you will.
I don't want to say this is my favorite game but I keep coming back to *this* over other games.

Lots of different play styles to chose from and you're not bound to your first choice at the start of the game. 
Bored with being a mage? Switch to twohanded warrior when youre in the tavern.
Then there's the teamplay a la dungeons and dragons. You complete your team by chosing 3 more characters. They are called Pawns. One of them you will need to create yourself and the other two are characters made by other gamers. These can be anyone you like and if you're fed up with one you can switch them in for a different character. You want to be a party of 4 mages? Go ahead.

Downsides of this game? Lot's of backtracking so you'll be running your arse off.
Also the Pawns that complement your team are really annoying. It took me 15 minutes to get pissed off at them. They just never shut up and repeat the same lines over and over depending on where you are. Can't turn it off as an option (only the audio). Weird choice by the devs to implement this.

This game will waste your time and no amount of ""saving"" the game will keep it from returning you an hour and half back before you were if you choose to load to a recent checkpoint, which the game thinks is only when you sleep at an inn or use a rift stone.

First, the pawns.
Your party is made up of yourself and 3 AI controlled characters called ""pawns"".
The game prides itself on it's ""pawn"" system, where your AI companions assist you not only in combat but with quests and general tips for fighting different monsters.
Unfortunately, every single aspect of the pawn system leads to frustration.
You can only customize your main pawn, who levels up alongside you. The other 2 pawns have to be borrowed from other players. This means you have to dig through the countless pawns other people have made trying to find pawns that are set up the way you want them to be.  Then, when the pawns fall behind in level(which doesn't take long, levels come quick in this game), you have to go looking for new ones that match your criteria to replace them. This is tedious as hell and there's absolutely no reason not to allow the player to customize their own damn party members.
Then, despite all that effort, your pawns serve as lobotomized meat shields in combat that either spam their abilities or sprint to their deaths at random. 
This brings us to the combat.
The combat system gives you all kinds of interesting tools to deal with various enemies and situations, and the tools different classes have access to encourage a well-balanced party and creativity in combat.
But three of your characters are braindead and don't make proper use of those tools.
This spoils the otherwise interesting and complex combat and leaves your party feeling lopsided because only your characters capabilities are utilized effectively.
Not only that, but most enemies seem even more clueless than your pawns. They aren't much of a threat most of the time until you suddenly get two shot by an ogre who finally remembered he was supposed to be fighting you.
If any enemy does prove to be a challenge, you can always pause and use one of the million free instant healing items the game showers you with anyway.
The Quest system is also more broken and obtuse than any I have ever seen. You can miss quests easily, and some quests lock you out of others with no warning.
In order for this game to be enjoyable, the AI would have to be massively improved or co-op implemented.",1696811051,1696811051,False,3,0,0.458284229040145874,0,True,False,False

Today I woke and looked outside again
But the sky looked the same to me
Something told me that this world had changed
Couldn't figure out what did it mean

Some say to get out fast, looks like it's gonna last
Get all your things and fly (DON'T LEAVE NOTHING BEHIND)
Some said it'll be OK, just go ahead and stay
Be sure to drink your iodine

The wind is pushing me, into the clouds again
I feel the blood in my veins
Time is running free, I feel like letting go
Just like the Dangan

Staring out to the hourglass inside
My mind is racing and wild
Blinded by eyes that cover up the facts
Uncertainty with all the cracks in a smile

I'm breathing life or death, are we making progress?
Not really sure this time (THE CHOICE IS YOURS AND MINE)
Not sure what to do next, no real test reflex
Can't touch or see with my own eyes

The wave is pushing me, into the current again
I feel the blood in my veins
Time is running free, I feel like letting go
Nothing to slow me down
Dragon inside of me, I feel it letting go
I can't hear not a sound
Flying into free, I hit the mother lode
I am the Dangan

The wave is pushing me, into the current again
I feel the blood in my veins
Diving into free, can feel it letting go
Not gonna hit the ground
The sky is painted free, why can't we understand
We kill ourselves in the end
It's simple as one, two, three, it's written in the sand
We are the Dangan

Flying

Dragon's Dogma felt slightly weird to me for most of its runtime. I'm no stranger to threadbare stories, having some experience with the Souls series, but I just always felt that I was missing something. Why do I care about getting my heart back? The dragon taking it turned me into a demi-god who could bring down monsters ten times my size. What's with the duke's second castle? Why can't I go in? I ran to the end of the world for nothing? And what happened to my childhood friend, she just disappeared from the village.

Yes, and this includes that random fetch quest where you need to get flowers or deliver ten fish to someone.

And dammit, the game is that fun. I never cared that I had no idea what or why I was doing something. I just enjoyed the fact that I was riding atop a gryphon, stabbing it while my pawns where raining down arrows and spells.

*I killed the dragon, explored the Everfall, and tried Bitterblack Isle before throwing my hands and calling it finished. 

I dunno man. Was it because this originally released around Skyrim, but had better combat and hating Bethesda games started becoming hip? Did people not play Monster Hunter at that time, so the combat felt more unique? Does picking up and throwing people go that far? I can't really pinpoint why this game is as fervently loved as it is, but I didn't hate it. I enjoyed it enough to finish, at least. 

I found the generic fantasy setting to actually be more refreshing and charming in 2023 than when I originally tried this game many years ago. Battling chimeras while your pawns speak in Olde English makes for a cozy setting, something that reminded me of '80s fantasy movies but without the synth tracks. Being a massive Middle-earth guy, I feel like we don't get enough ""down to earth"" fantasy settings nowadays, even if the post-game armors can get very Monster Hunter, which I still loved. 

While the story wasn't amazing, the actual writing was leagues better than I thought it would be, and the lore was fairly interesting. Smashing goblins with my giant fuck-off sword and stunlocking dragons was the highlight of the game, and the setting and competent writing only made it better.

But after a solid 30ish hours on this final playthrough... god. How many enemy types are there? Seven, maybe, not including shared models? Goblins, wolves, chimeras, cockatrices (which share a skeleton with chimeras), amber dragons (which are ripped from Monster Hunter, maybe a Gore Magala skeleton), skeleton warriors/mages, cyclops, golems (which share a skeleton with cyclops), and ogres (which share a skeleton with cyclops)? I was shocked at little substance there was as I progressed, with each quest being escort a person, kill these things, talk to these people (which have ""schedules"" btw, good luck figuring out where they are). That's pretty much it. 

So we have an okay story with good writing, great combat, and a small world to explore with inconsequential quests. Is this really what got people's goats in 2012/3? 

Again, I don't hate this game. I think it's worth a playthrough if you're in the market for a fantasy game with great combat and a charming setting. But the way people talk about this game, you'd think it's the world's most underrated gem Of All Time, and that's a feeling I couldn't shake during my whole playthrough. Unfortunately, that's a splinter I couldn't get out of my head and one that eventually soured the whole experience, as overall I just found the game to be okay at best. Some highs, but a lot of middling- to low-lows. 

If we're comparing this to games that came out at the same time: Skyrim had superior exploration; Dark Souls had the more interesting lore with a more fun challenge; and Monster Hunter had the more exhilarating boss fights and deeper combat. This games tries to combine these experiences into one setting and it doesn't quite pay off the way I was expecting.

I just hope Dragon's Dogma 2 comes out way more content rich, cuz if it's just more of the same, we have a problem.",1696378546,1696378546,True,0,1,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Create your own character; choose a class. Meet ""Pawns"" which are your followers/party members. Customise your main Pawn; choose their class. You may recruit 2 other Pawns, and you get to choose who you want to join you based off their class and looks. Pawns talk and react to things you do and are smart enough to know what's going on during the quests you're doing.

This makes the game more immersive than any other fantasy game I've played. Being able to put together a party like Dungeons & Dragons or a Lord of the Rings fellowship. With how unique this game has been so far, I feel like I don't know what to expect and that gives me that feeling that gaming once did. Fantasy MMOs have become predictable and boring. All having similar combat and systems and restrictions. Dragon's Dogma gives me that feeling I had when I first played WoW and I was excited to explore the world, being completely oblivious to what it had to offer.

It's one of those games I've been asking for for years, and to my surprise it's a decade old. I guess I never really did give a lot of single-player games a chance. Dragon's Dogma 2 is being developed currently and that's how I discovered this game existed at all.

It's the kind of slow start that might have you questioning your life choices, wondering if you should refund it instead and go outside to fight some bears like Rogan. But hang on, don't quit just yet.

Now, here's where it gets good. The real gem of Dragon's Dogma lies in its innovative pawn system. It's like a light at the end of a tunnel, and boy, is it worth the wait. Once you go through the initial crawl and reach Gran Soren, you'll discover a game that's nothing short of magical, thanks to the pawn system.

Picture this: Even if the game is a single-player game, you're not alone on your journey. You have a team of AI companions, your bro pawns, ready to assist and follow your every command. It's like having your personal entourage of badass adventurers. Need a healer? You got it. Prefer a ranged attacker? No problem. You want a tank? Sure, why not. The pawn system is a game-changer, and it's where Dragon's Dogma truly shines.

As you delve deeper into the game, you'll appreciate the strategic depth that the pawn system offers. You can customize your pawns' abilities, behaviors, classes, and even their appearance. It's like assembling your dream team of fantasy heroes, and the synergy you can achieve is nothing short of pure awesomeness.

But Dragon's Dogma isn't just about your pawns; it's also about you, the Arisen. The battles in this game are pretty epic. Whether I was taking on a towering ogre or a ferocious griffin, the fun never really gone, at least until you got so over-leveled that everything became too easy, like any other game.

Now, let's talk magic. Playing a magical class in Dragon's Dogma makes you feel like a wizard on steroids. It's magic in its purest, most explosive form.

So yeah, I'd say this is quite the masterpiece. Even when all of those things I already mentioned are amazing, there are many other aspects in which this game excelled. Like the lores, the story, the replayability, the fact that every class in the games is just well designed, and many other stuff.

[h3]Would I recommend it to anyone? Hell no! Here's why: [/h3]

[b]Overview:[/b]
- This is a very old game. Don't expect it to live up to today's standard of gaming, in terms of graphic and mechanics
- Title is very misleading. There are no dogs in this game.

[b]Pros:[/b]
- Graphic and animations are not bad, even for today's standard. 
- BGM/SFX/Voice acting are above average. Not too repetitive or annoying.
- Character customization are fantastic. You can dress to impress without worrying much about stats. 
- Playstyle for different classes are unique and offers a refreshing experience
- Sorcery system in this game is done perfectly. Not to overpowered, not too tedious. Positioning and timing matters. And most of all, the animation is fantastic!
- Your AI companions are not completely useless or underpowered. 
- True open world. You can run to literally anywhere on the map at the very start of the game (except a few story scripted areas). 

[b]Cons:[/b]
- The game is incredibly punishing at early game. Almost anything including random bandits can one-shot you.
- Traversing the map is a joke (esp in first playthrough). Imagine Elden ring, with no grace, no horse, and a stamina that depletes when you run even when out of combat. Yes, it does feel like an adventure at first, but when you realize majority of the quests requires you to travel from point A to point B, C, D then back to point A, that's where the frustration begins.
- Unnecessarily complicated dungeon layout with mazes, puzzles to fu-k with the player. Design like this adds 0 value to the gameplay as all it does is artificially lengthen the time to reach the destination.
- Most side quests and even main quests are boring and not rewarding. They feel like fillers instead of necessary plot progression.
- Enemy variations are limited. Eg. Wolves, goblins, harpies are everywhere, with different colors to make them unique. 
- Boss fights are refreshing on the first attempt but it becomes a button mashing fest once you learn the exploits. 
- Weapon variations and choices are very limited. Moveset of each weapon are the same too. Hence, the player will always go for the best weapon for that class. 
- Grinding is optional but if you chose to do so you'll be having a very hard time. Not only drop rates are abysmal, trying to get one specific boss to spawn is near impossible.
- Jail system is bullsheet. It does nothing but to punish players for input errors. 
- NPCs are... weird.. You can romance literally anyone, including married one. 
- There's even a scripted NTR scene in which you pork the wife and the husband is cool with it.
- Main story is too short. Feels rushed and unfinished. Ending is also... really weird.. 
- DLC is underwhelming. To summarize : Move the goalpost - by making enemies real hard, while giving you option to further enhance your weapon.
- Crashes/ Game Freezes. Throughout my 60hours+ gameplayed, it happens for at least 5 times. No major progress losses for me, just annoyance.
- Only 1 saveslot. Autosaves are not timely or reliable. Hence you gotta spam saves every 2 mins just to be safe.

[b]Conclusion:[/b]
- 70% of the time I spent running around travelling from point A to B
- 25% of the time i spent doing makeover and fashion show
- 5% of the time I spent doing actual fighting and progressing the plot
- I had a good time tbh but I can't look pass the flaws to give this game a thumbs up",1695977917,1695977917,False,3,0,0.438486069440841675,0,True,False,False

[STRONG SPOILER ALERT]
You are random guy. Dragon attacked your village. You wanted to kill dragon and he made you Arisen (strong warrior), because he want´s to be killed by you (why, we dont know). You want to help your girlfriend to find a witch, because she want to save you (why?, you are in great condition). You will find only young kid -Selene (she say that she is grand-daughter of witch). Mission end without result. You visited local Duke. In all cutscenes, you are silent, like some autistic. Duke gave you quest ""kill random beast"". ¨

Duke´s wife want to see you in her room at the night. Duke´s wife is in love with you (she doesn´t know you). Duke come to her wife´s bedroom. You hide in corner. Duke want just to randomly kill his wife (why, we dont know). You intervene (after few minutes of silent watching like creep). You are locked in jail (why, we don´t know). You open jail door (no lock). You walk away. Duke give you another ""kill beast quest"" (like everything is normal and nothing happened). You pass quest. You go to visit Selene. She run away. After you follow her, she say that she is pawn (similar like your companion, we don´t know nothing about pawns, only that they are servant of Arisen.. She will move to your house (why wtf, what does she want, i dont like her).

You go to kill dragon (because we don´t want to be Arisen). Dragon give you choice: Kill him and save Selene (random girl that is living in your house, nobody knows why), or sacrifice Selen (eh?). Hard decision, kill random dragon who give you power, or sacrifice random girl, true epic.... I kill dragon and i acquire blade, that i can use to kill myself (why, we dont know). After that, Duke became very old (why, we dont know). He and his guards attack you, but suddenly big hole in earth appeared. You fall insinde hole. Somebody in hole give you quest ""find a lot of stones"". After that, you are teleported in some ""heaven like"" sfere. You have option: kill some local ""god"", or kill yourself. I kill some local guy. Previous arisen is here (why, we don´t know). You can kill him in submission (only.....and if you loose, you became dragon and game ends). After killing him, he give you another ""suicide blade"". You can kill gim again and he is happy with that. 

You become a ghost. You are stuck in heaven like dimension. Nothing to do here. You don´t know meaning of everything after prologue. Only think you can do is random walking in ghost form or kill yourself. Ok, i kill myself. You are dead and your body is occupied by your pawn (i was male knight and my pawn was female mage, her voice remains same, omg, this is so stupid....

From wiki: Duke was immortal due to he killed previous dragon, and after you killed new dragon he lost his young, Selene in my final story was because i have romance with her (no, i definitely didn´t, this kid is annoying).

Favorite parts so far are the exploration, freedom to pick and change your class (vocation), interesting ""pawn"" system where you can have up to 3 companions at a time to round out your party, and other smaller pleasant surprises like a crafting system that I enjoyed, inventory management, simple dungeon puzzles, and a unique fast travel system that has you collecting magical crystals that you can pick up and set down to serve as fast travel points. 

The cons: 
Combat isn't quite as good as the Souls franchise, though fun in its own way. There is no way to ""dodge roll"" unless you are a dexterous class such as your typical hunter/rogue archetype. I'm playing mostly as a sorcerer and feel like most of the time I just have to stay back and spam fireballs. Most of the challenge is not getting hit and eating health items if I do. 

The story so far to me is pretty meh. You're a Dragonborn -- I mean an Arisen - and you have to kill monsters and slay the dragon and save the land from evil. Maybe it gets more interesting, but I haven't been really pulled in. Regardless, the setting is still very nice, and the graphics are pretty good considering the age of this game.

Instead, it fizzles out. 

The game can be described as FABLE meets SKYRIM meets A PILE OF GARBAGE.

It feels like it's trying to inject the best things from those games, but gets them all wrong.

First off, the controls are crappy. 

You spend more time fighting with the controls than fighting the monsters.

There's just too many ""special moves"" but not enough ""buttons"" for them. Instead of just binding those moves to a key (like in an MMO), you have hold down a button or key, then press another one. 2 generic attacks, 3 special offensive moves, 3 special defense moves. However, the enemies and their tactics vary so it's a fumbling mashing mess to switch gears to mash different things to be the most efficient.

Instead, they could have just made those moves as something bindable to the keyboard.
Maybe they wanted to make PC gamers know the terrible horrors console gamers go through having to play 3rd Person or FPS games with a silly console controller (hahahah).
If it was bindable to the 1-9 keys, we could just PRESS A SINGLE BUTTON, just like in many RPGs or MMOs. 

My character in World of Warcraft can execute all types of moves by pressing 1,2,3.
In Dragons Dogma, you have to hold down X, press right mouse button, then hold down E and spam-press left mouse button, then you have to hold down X and then press F, then press E to jump then press R, then left cilck because if you accidently right cilck, you fall the fracken hell down and die.

Terrible. The UI interface controls are equally atrocious.

Graphics for a game this age vary from standard to above standard. The character design is great, there's a HUGE TON of choices and it's easy to understand what you're able to change. The controls for that suck too but the artists did a great job. The main downside is the textures are detailed in some areas and low-res in others for some reason. The character animations are fantastic. They use the in-game graphics for the epic cutscenes. It looks like they motion-captured the animations, so everyone walks, runs, leaps, fights crazily fantasy-ARPG-style...realistically. The action is very fluid and smooth as well.

The music is very good, it's very ""soundtrack-y"" and used to great effect when showing the cutscenes. The downside is when you run from a battle, the generic ""action"" sounding music keeps playing. That's annoying.

Save system is junk, it auto-saves. You have only ONE SAVE. So if the game saves at a very bad spot...YOU'RE SCREWED. You also cannot reload because you save/quit or save/continue. Get stuck in jail without money or special key?...you are literally stuck there. You cannot get out. In a dungeon getting thrashed by ridiculous swarms of OP'd monsters can't escape from? SCREWED. There's no ""past save"". DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU!

Like a Groundhog Day...from Hell. 
Reload...OH LOOK STILL TRAPPED! 
It's a uber-cruel defacto-permadeath/stuck/screwed system.
RESTART OR REFUND. 

Gameplay is brutally linear in the beginning, oozing with waaay too many cutscenes.
You walk like 10 steps, and CUTSCENE and a forced sequence. HOLY MOLY when does this game actually start?!....or is THIS the game??

About 1-2 hours later, you'll find you can run around without too many forced cutscenes or sequences, but the world is sealed off because...YOU HAVE TO DO A TASK to continue.
UTTER LINEAR GAME HELL. For the first few hours. It's a slog, it's boring, and you'll start looking online for help asking yourself: ""Am I Doing Something Wrong""? 

A total on-rails game at first, and for too long.
Now, after you grinding-ly slug it out to the capital city, everything goes OFF THE RAILS. 
Badly.

Prepare to DIE. LOTS.

That is all there is to do in this game. 
For all the skills you can get, your character is massively underpowered...even on the EASIEST difficulty setting.

It takes like 20 strong hits just to kill a fricken armor-less Gollum-esque goblin.
Every trash mob fight is a 15-20min affair the game treats like an ""epic battle"". Win. Run in any direction for 5-10sec. and get attacked again. Wash, rinse, repeat. Sound like fun?


It's like playing the Gothic game series using only a wooden branch as your weapon the entire game. Your armor feels more cosmetic than actually protecting you. Play as a warrior and put up that shield? Many enemy attacks go through it and uber-strike you. The game lets you jump on giant monsters and crawl all over them...but it does no good. Your direct attacks on their head don't appear to do any extra damage whatsoever. Instead, they can throw you off and you end up taking a ton of damage, discouraging future attempts. Even the best gear you can buy is laughably useless.

The game is broken in that any dungeon/cave/ruin is loaded with OP creatures right away who will utterly destroy you. Get used to the ""Retry"" screen.

Anyone who says ""NAH, I DO FINE"" probably stopped playing early or is using CHEAT MODs. (look it up)

Leveling up is useless. You get a few more HP each level. It doesn't make a difference when a snake monster blasts you for 200 dmg and DOTs you with fire. Those measily HP gains melt away VERY fast.

There's no dodge skills in this game, but just pressing jump and aiming in a different direction.
The enemy seems to have heat-seeking ranged attacks so your only hope is to hide behind something and snack on plants.

You can't run very far because you burn through stamina like crap through a goose.
Your character will actually stop where they are and start panting while it regens.
Even at 1/5th of your stamina back - due to an ""invisible minimum"", so you're still waiting and waiting, and then some enemy totally roasts you or picks you up and smashes you to bits. 

Stupid design.

""Pawns"" are a joke. So basically, there's this gimmick of everyone getting an NPC follower and being able to share online. They're useless in that these NPC ""helpers"" fricken NINJA LOOT stuff and you can't take it from them because...it goes to the owner of the pawn. Buying good gear for them is a waste of money because it's ""gifted"" and cannot be ""returned"" (who thought of this crap?). Even in full-offline, this is in effect. You can get 2 ""other"" Pawns and 1 of your very own. Only for your very-own, can you move their gear. So that's good. But for the other 2, what gives? Gimmicky.

The AI is okay for the Pawns but they don't heal themselves when they should.
Similar to Clive Barker's Jericho, your ""followers"" get their butts kicked ALOT, and lay there dying. You have to run around to each one to rez them. You spend most battles fighting with the crap controls and rezzing downed followers. Is this a game? Or Fantasy Medic simulator?

If you don't heal them in time? They're dead and leave the game, and all the nice gear you got for them is gone...forfeit. There goes all your investment. Best to die too and reload.

The game should be called ""Futile Dungeon Medic Simulator"".
Even the starting caves and dungeons is like a Level 1 going after End Game Content.
You have to hit everything 200 times to dent it. It's just annoying...but more importantly is incredibly BORING. There's no special skill or strategy whatsoever to fighting large monsters or the various creatures (look it up), except: ""HIT IT 'TIL IT DIES!""

Your only recourse is to run around the open world killing rabbits and boars to grind levels, at least enough so those giant enemy attacks that burn away your HP allow you to last at least another 2-3 seconds before you succumb. 

Finally, the weapons/armor choices are very limited. There should be way more choices. It seems 99% of it can only be bought from vendors, almost never drops at all, and if it does, it's a trash item. Hugely disappointing. 

Anyways, that's ""Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen"".

367500,147043855,76561198997259386,0,2,3750,9,3188,1707941982,"Dragons Dogma is a deeply flawed gem that is incredibly fun but has a multitude of issues which hamper a very unique and fun gameplay experience.

This is in my top 10 favorite games I've ever played, I have played on Xbox, switch and finally PC. It took me three different tries to really get into this game, and on the third try it clicked very hard, where I reached a major focal point in the story and I have been in love ever since. It is a great story told poorly, with so much so easily missed, and a great deal that is confusing unless you pursue side missions. But once you understand, you get to enjoy a nicely thought provoking and immersive story with (in my opinion) the greatest dragon boss fight in all of gaming. This game massively shines in the monster combat. Monster attacks generally feel weighty and impactful, the many ways of dealing with them from magic to climbing and attacking them to teamwork with you and your pawns and many status effects as well. But combat with bandits, with other humanoid or small enemies is generally fairly weak, combat generally feels far less impactful and enemies are far less responsive to attacks than monsters. As well they can be far more dangerous than actual monsters which partially ruins the sense of power you get from said monsters. 

Regarding the expansion where I spend most of my time in the game, it is a very alluring setting, the tone is very consistent and utterly dreadful at times. Almost feeling as if you are walking between hell and ruined splendor, the ambient sound design fits very well and the soundtrack accentuates the tragic backdrop of it all. I love almost all of the monsters added, whether they be far more dangerous variants of previous monsters, or entirely new hellish monsters to fight. Also the final boss is such a blast to fight, the raw power, grace and arrogance shown through how they fight and talk is awesome and was a fitting ""end"" after fighting through grueling combat encounter after another. But as many times as the expansion is a treat, it is also incredibly frustrating with seeming little play testing for enemy placement, ai companion behavior in some encounters and insane difficulty spikes and drops at times. you will be forced on more than one occasion to fight very power monsters in unacceptably tiny rooms, where they take up a good chunk if not a quarter of said room, and have attacks that can hit more than or near entirety of said room. Fighting highly disruptive enemies that tend to fling you very far and wide on a narrowish bridge is a challenge but so unfun when you and your companions die instantly from the fall. One of the sub-bosses in the expansion that you must beat to progress, can either be a walk in the park or incredibly difficult based on your class and your companions, as well as if they decide to function properly. My last major gripe is the lack of clarity and telegraphing for a fair few monster attacks. Some will have virtually no telegraphing, whilst some spells that look nearly identical to other attacks are vastly more powerful. From being simply blinded, to potentially being insta-killed from petrification if you don't have the right curative. Overall adore the expansion but there are many things that cause great frustration.

lastly the AI companions or pawns. They will go from being absolutely insane berserkers completely decking everything that so much as looks at you funny, or being the greatest guardian angel constantly saving you from death. As well as buffing you with the right magic at just the right time, working with you and the other pawns so perfectly sometimes it's briefly feels like a human player. Or never casting their most powerful spells not healing you and the others, not buffing you, giving you the wrong buff which can completely compromise your DPS. As well as not using powerful combat skills, not helping you when your in a pinch, staring at the monster, wandering off somewhere a fair distance away (rare) and casting a dark spell on a creature that takes next to no dark damage CONSTANTLY. Or they will have no sense of self preservation and die over, and over, and over again. A partial saving grace is the ability to instantly revive at any and all times. All in all their AI. They will grab a dragon by the balls and squeeze so hard god feels it, or they will actively sabotage you through their immense ineptitude.

I love this game beyond words, it has some of the best magic in an rpg, the best monster combat in an rpg period a deeply resonant story for me personally and a world I can get very immersed into.

My hours played aren't truly reflected accurately because I owned this game ever since it first came out on the PS3 forever ago. So couple a few playthroughs on the PS3 with the Steam version and it'd be A LOT more than what you see. What else is there that needs to be said? this game is an underrated cult classic gem if there ever was one. So many people own the game but barely play it to the point where achievements have such low completion percentages (despite mods not disabling achievements). 

In the end this game is basically what a Berserk RPG would be like, with Shadow of the Colossus grapple mechanics and a unique story with a nice world to explore and immerse yourself in. I've always loved Dragon's Dogma and I was in awe and amazement with my fellow fans when the sequel was FINALLY announced after a decade of constant begging. Here's hoping the Dragon's Dogma Online game comes out, but if now I hope you guys will pick up this game and get yourself hyped for Dragon's Dogma 2 so we can show Capcom that Dragon's Dogma deserves the same love and respect that Dark Souls had.

You can climb monsters, grab NPCs and throw them, you can grab your party members and throw them away too, the magic is over the top and so fun to use (specially the tornado, that is fantastic), the classes are very good too, they work well and you feel that you and your party are doing something, the party feels like a fellowship of the ring, choices matter and the game look kinda good for it's age.
Besides all that, the main map is kinda small, the stats system is bad since you upgrade your stats based on which class you level, so if you level up as a fighter until level 100, for example, and decide to switch to sorcerer until level 150 and then switch to rogue until level 200, your stats will be kinda messed up, it does not really matter if you're more casual, but if you care about doing a ""perfect"" build, it will ruin it for you, also, you can only make one character per account, so if you decide to level another character, you would need to delete the first character you made and create a new one(there are mods for multiple saves tho), the inventory system is personally bad (I don't like weight inventory systems), the main campaign is kinda short and the beginning of the game may be hard, but it become a joke later when you get stronger (the real difficulty is in the DLC).

Overall I would say the game is a 7/10, it's good, fun, probably one of the best ""Berserk games"" we have today, but have it's flaws not only for some bad decisions the devs made, but because they got paid like 3 chicken nuggets to make it. 

By the way, play the game by yourself first then play it again with a guide to see how many quests you missed, I bet you gonna lose your mind.

it's clearly unfinished/unpolished due to development cuts, but it is still so, so incredible. my steam hours don't take into account the over 500 hours i had on the original playstation version (before dark arisen dropped!). i've exhausted this game several times over and i still cannot get enough of it. if you're looking at dark arisen because you're interested in the sequel, i HIGHLY recommend giving the original a shot! 

combat wise, the game can be a bit tricky to get into/pick up, but once you do you'll find it flows so naturally. there isn't a way to lock onto enemies, but you'll find that the combat is comfortable without it as you get deeper into it. 

story wise, you can tell when exactly budget cuts were being made. still, if you're willing to offer a little patience and imagination it will meet your expectations. because of the budget cuts, i find that dragon's dogma offers a more personal story than they originally planned (yes, even if you know how it ends)--which isn't a fault! personally, i love stories that are more grounded. 

the graphics are the perfect mix of semi-realistic and stylistic, meaning this game will never truly age out or feel ""too old"" to play. i've been playing this game since 2012, and i can honestly say that even in 2023 it exceeds my expectations. ESPECIALLY if you pick it up on sale, you're more than getting your money's worth even if you end up only doing half of a playthrough.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching Ukrainian men French kissing canines on YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died.

Pros:
+ You can climb EVERYTHING including monsters
+ Satisfying and challenging combat
+ Intense fights against epic creatures
+ Responsive controls
+ The online Pawn (companion) system works really well
+ Infinite replayability thanks to NG+
+ Rewards exploration
+ Every class offers a completely different play style and you can switch classes at anytime
+ Interesting story with a few surprises towards the end
+ Bitterblack Isle is like an entire new game
Cons:
- Some important side quests will fail if you rush through the main quests (you can always re-do them in NG+ but still)
- Some cutscenes and story moments are weird and cringy
- The game doesn't really tell you everything you need to know, you will need to use the wiki a lot

What is Good:
- This is basically an Open World RPG like Skyrim (but 3rd person camera only).
- You can create and customized your own Companion (Main Pawn)
- There will be 3 Basic Vocation, 3 Advanced Vocation and 3 Hybrid Vocations. Vocation is Class or Job (based on Ragnarok).
- The Quest is really similar with the known MMORPG games like Escort or Killing a big monsters.
- At the first time, you need to learn some items, especially the items that could heals or be combined.
- The games is pretty balanced and you can grinding your Character and Your main pawn (Companion) really well.
- Climb a big Monsters is a plus, this was reminds me of Shadow of the Colosus game.
- You can pick up any NPC's and bring them to wherever you want. (A details that will never exist in another game)

Things that you need to Consider:
- This is an Old game, was made in 2012. the graphics will not too far if compare with Skyrim V.
- The beginning phase is tough and the enemies will not have the level indicators. So we may face the hardest skin enemies without knowing it.
- This game is using a Stamina system, same as MP.
- The Pawn (Companion) play style was not good enough to support me like MMORPG does(Of course, because MMORPG have real players, not using Bot).
- The Map is not huge but the quest will give you to the farthest route.
- Allowed Pawn (Companion) is only 3, 1 from your creation and 2 of them is owned by other player.
- There is an Online Feature, but only to recruit your friends or other Users Pawn.
- Confusing route or Map.",1695382252,1695382252,True,1,0,0.512239992618560791,0,True,False,False

Keyboard/mouse seems to have been added as an afterthought, by an employee who resented the idea, and was about to get fired, so they wanted you to have a bad time with it.

Cutscenes too, extremely jarring, fast cuts, shake shake shake.

Ok, I'm through the intro, made a character, I accidentally stab a fisherman while smashing up his home and stealing his stuff. Then I get my first fetch quest.

Maybe if I played it at that time it would have seemed better. Kinda like how old Tomb Raider seemed like state of the art graphics for its time. I'd say this is pretty good graphics in a 2012 mindset. The fast travel system can be pretty annoying but it gives the fantasy world charm to it that its bearable.

NOT A MP. only a multi rental (Borrow other players bots), co op shouldve and wouldve been great.
can be slow to search for missions, alot of wich are kill tally i.e: kill 20/20 windex huffers, location Gransys desert spar and mall.
creatures/monsters are top notch, battle is fun and changeable at venders.
Buy at at least 65% off.

mini review.
like someone stretched k.o.a awakening over 2 strategic d&d tennis rackets to make snow shoes, to scale a long steep mountain.
end.

PROS AKA Your party experience sheer elation and decide to stop off at a inn to change their hemps. 
Its D&D
all original creatures taken directly from the role play game of the ages!
combat is good and fun (not quite lvl of K.O.A reckoning but what is. similar though.)
The scenery looks and feels immersive and detailed.
levelling system is good.
the combinations of alchemy and weapon upgrading is done well.
the spell system though not perfect is v cool, tornadoes, fire also i noticed after casting large ice i could stand on it! (noice ice)
you can change your skill sets up, as you go for a small 1-off cost of variant xp, but you cant change from spells to steel on the fly, only at a registered place on map.
bull climbing.ah, wind in your hair. one of the best of ye olde pursuits bovine free soloing.
good voice over art and game sound.
addictive detailed mechanic overall.

CONS AKA please feel free to throw your d20 at the screen in a reroll of unbridled frustration.
MP isnt there its a multi rental of other players rift humanoid (bots).
Stamina bar drags the entire game scrapping on the ground like luggage ear ring extensions. (pack extensive shroom collection for stamina.)
There is next to no story at times. so much beastie searching
missions are frequently kill tally BS. sparse missions! (glad i got my rackets) 
notice boards should really let u know of live missions on the map so you dont have to keep checking them.
hardware issue.. If wireless headphone disconnect.. game crash ..BAD! (no food break 4u!)
A banshee haunts the start titles, her shrill siren contort my expression like a face rack!
SERIOUSLY reduce the amount of times a talking NPC blurts out the same line. A single interaction repeats on u alot, it can actually give u real indigestion, I projectile vomited 5 capcom barrels of toxic alphabetti spaghetti. Oh howcanihelp..ohhowcanihelp, ohhowcanihelp ohhowcani....
SHUT 
THE 
HELL 
UP!
less mission hunting in general would be* minty salvation to the ogre dentist appointment of head smooshing tedium. not that i am questioning ogres ability to be dentists they are fully capable of that, but also with the ability to put thier arm straight through a thick cave wall ...your choice?! ..like these 3 lines that could easily have been the word '*good'.

 I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

You feel a part of the land, and you get to know it, walking around and exploring until you know every spot and what to expect. You learn, and your companions learn, helping you in all encounters and showing progression as a player. It’s a unique journey that you will never forget, even if you don’t replay the game. 

Some things to consider are the classes can be a bit unbalanced in terms of the value they provide in certain fights. The wiki and community posts have great tips for picking a class you like, but you can change it anytime. The only issue I had was that I wish all classes had a dodge, but it is nothing major, as each class has strengths and weaknesses that you can balance with party composition.

In a world where the most popular games are full of microtransactions, freemium predatory models of monetization and lack of love for the product itself, Dragons Dogma: Dark Arisen is a hidden gem 2013 gem that deserves begs to be played, replayed, and replayed again.

It doesn't have nice CG's, since it's an old game, the plot is good, but not well developed mid-game, some mechanics are questionable, but hell, this game is fun. The combat system is amazing, the online mechanics with Pawns is something that needs to be implemented in other games, and the replayability is vast due to the NG+ and Bitter Black Island (BBI) addition in the Dark Arisen.

Unfortunately, the game has some problems that can't be ignored, some classes are not well-balanced, the most notable example is the Warrior, which for some reason is not able to equip the same amount of skills as other classes, on the other hand, the hybrid vocations like Mystic Knight and Magic Archer are a steamroll when it reaches certain point on the game, and some other minor problems that you can encounter while playing. 

But overall, the game is amazing, it's not uncommon to see people who replayed a NewGame+ dozens of time, because the game have so much sidequests that you're gonna fail or not even know about their existence in your first plays, that you're gonna want to replay just to help certain NPC, and with the announce of the second game, playing the first game is a worthy experience to contextualize for the second game, and even transfer progress, since the game's plot makes you think that Dragon's Dogma 2 is the perfect game for a progress transference.

367500,145872291,76561198191645374,436,70,12762,0,12762,1694090051,"An action RPG that sees you unleashed into the medieval fantasy world of Gransys to face all the threats lurking within its wide open world, with the ultimate goal of slaying the mighty dragon. The premise is as typical as it sounds, until the game becomes completely insane in the final stretch in any case. Characters are not anything special, you might find a few you like, but a lot don't stand out. Main and sidequests can be intriguing and are decent justifications for your combat expeditions.

The main star is definitely the game's combat. It's heavily class based, with the weapons and skills usable depending on classes. There's 3 main classes of the usual archetypes (melee and shield, melee and bow or magic), and 6 others that are either more specialised and powerful versions of those or hybrids of two of them, and all 9 feel different to play. Basic melee combat has good feedback, and the multitude of skills available are fun to play with and picking and using them at appropriate times is vital to make it through encounters in one piece. Bows are also pretty fun to use and let you target weak points like you expect, and magic users can enjoy increasingly powerful tiers of spells, with the most powerful being incredibly devastating and fun to use.

In terms of enemies, you have the game's own takes of the usual fantasy creatures with impressive designs and a level of deadliness seen in few other places. Minor foes can overwhelm you with ease if underprepared and major foes will need all but the most powerful characters to take advantage of the game's mechanics and find weaknesses to exploit. The game's mechanic of climbing onto enemies comes in when facing larger foes, allowing you to reach and hit weak spots with melee attacks much easier.

You'll usually face the game's challenges with 1-3 AI-controlled companions in tow, recruited from other players usually. They are important for supplementing your chosen class in ways it may be deficient or just for the additional damage, and they do mostly work well, but the AI is far from perfect and it can be more than a little frustrating to see them idle or distracted when you seriously need their help.

A note on the Dark Arisen expansion content (included in this edition): What's said above applies to it, the main difference being even less direct plot and character interactions (though what is there is darker), the area being a really large dungeon with multiple segments (that aren't all completely unique unfortunately) rather than an open world, and a wealth of extremely deadly variants of the base game's enemies. The area can often make the worst the base game throws at you look like a tutorial. Harrowing but rewarding to get through.

Overall, it's a must play if you're looking for an action RPG with combat both challenging and satisfying.

Everything feels like it's just almost there, but not quite:
- The grappling system for climbing on larger monsters is an awesome idea, but it can feel like you're fighting the controls/camera at times. It works okay on some enemies at least.
- The combat system might've been good back when the game came out, but I feel it really shows it's age.
- Boss/encounter seems to mix between annoying scripted events removing all player agency and/or just using a few interesting gameplay mechanics against a HP sponge.
- The class/vocation system is disappointingly narrow with the balance between abilities showing clear winners and you get funnelled into the same cookie cutter builds with uninspiring passive augments with minimal variance.
- NPC/Pawn AI is not really that great and the inability to direct your party members in any meaningful way is a frustrating experience.
- I personally found the story pretty lacklustre, which surprised me given how much some of the community seemed to praise it. None of it seems to really matter or go anywhere. Maybe this is an area that suffered due to the development problems?

The reality is that whilst this game might've been impressive back when it was released, these days you can find a better experience elsewhere.

I played a ton of this on the Xbox 360 and nearly 100% it on there but on PC it still has a lot of the same problems. :/",1630797434,1694041055,False,0,0,0.496183186769485474,0,True,False,False

Pawns barely function and are egregiously annoying to work around. God forbid you decide to play a non-magical class and have to depend on these spaghetti-coded bots to assist in a fight. 

The story is basic, the world offers 3-5 interesting npcs and the quests very quickly become boring chores to distract from an already boring main story. And on that note, quests cancel or fail themselves without prompt and because DD only has one save file, there's no going back. And the game saves over itself quite a lot. 

I can't even imagine playing this game without the DLC eternal ferrystone. Quick travel was the only thing making this game tolerable because every 2 minutes you are flanked by goblins, bandits or harpies. Remember, their kind ill likes fire.

When I was about 5 hours in, I remember thinking that this was going to be my next go to ""open world time killer"". However, the game began to show it's many flaws around this point.

For one, the world isn't quite that open. It's not very big and it's very repetitive and predictable. Not that this is always a bad thing. I had a fun time with games like KOTOR, Nier: Automata, and Final Fantasy XII, but this game just kinda misses the mark. It's just that the environments, while pretty at first glance, are pretty samey. The quests are incredibly boring: these are the fetchiest of fetch quests to ever exist. You will spend a ton of time backtracking through vast areas of nothingness, just to do some mundane thing for some unimportant person. Plus it's pretty buggy and unpolished.

Gameplay it's fantastic and refreshing for an action rpg. Storytelling is odd, mysterious, but in a good way. A good soundtrack. Don't expect Oblivion, it's more akin to a more arcade-y (and personally) more fun dark souls set a world not quite fallen so low. While there is npc interaction and dialogue it's certainly not the focus. The general vibe of adventuring and slaying monsters is what the game is about. You can grab and throw smaller enemies, grab and climb on larger ones, and most enemies have some sort of location based hitboxes that shake up strategies. There are 9 classes and not a one feels like it underperforms. The magic is absolutely brutal, summoning tornadoes and meteor showers at the highest levels with the lower level spells always maintaining use.

If I were to even try to compare this game to another, i'd maybe say you were looking at something similar to Outward, except not even half as obnoxiously difficult. I say that because you're set into the deep end of a map with enemies that are potentially far stronger than you, and it's not like you can actually tell they are until you fight them because they don't have a level displayed above them. Aside from that, you still have a map you can use (and see your own location on), and the stamina usage isn't even nearly as painful as Outward was. Aside from those few similarities, this game i almost entirely in its own unique league. I can confidently say nothing i've ever played in 23 years comes close to the vibe of this game. 

I wanna say a few things I love and a few gripes I had, and hopefully this long-ass review lost in a sea of better reviews on an overlooked game will help you buy and enjoy it too. 

First off, this game has such a vibe that I haven't felt since I first discovered RPG gaming, was young and naive, and had some shred of joy left in my soul. Now as I play this I can at least say my husk of a human being got to feel the tiny spark of that same feeling I experienced as a young lad. I couldn't describe it further if I tired, but if you too share this declining lifestyle. I'm sure you'll understand.

I also love just how diverse you can be in this game, which is honestly extremely impressive for a game made in 2016. The combat is insane and personally I feel it rivals most newer games. You can climb onto monsters, crawl around to their weak spots (most enemies have at least one) and attack it. Even if that mf happened to be a griffon and takes off into the skies. You BET you can be clinging onto that creature for dear life trying to bring it down. You can also set up some insane combos, some of which aren't particularly designed to go together, but do so beautifully anyway. Just the amount of things you can do in combat is insane. You also have a very extensive list of classes you can become all of which can absolutely be changed at your own leisure. A feature that not enough games has (Seriously. I'm tired of restarting games just because I suddenly vibed with a mage build instead of my current sword and shield). 

The entire aesthetic of it holds up impressively well too. The graphics are a little behind (even for the time) and still it wouldn't bother you one bit. I actually enjoyed it more than some newer games. Sometimes less is more I guess. 

Now for my one complaint. Sometimes the party mechanics are just a little frustrating. Your companions are AI controlled and there isn't a single way to command them to do anything, you can set the behaviours for 1 main companion but I never really noticed the difference after doing that. They all kinda just do their own thing. They are effective at it, but more times than not they just fall short of doing the things I need them to do. I wish I could command them to focus on healing or maybe fall back and recover. Maybe even just not run off and fight things that aren't our concern. Even Dragon Age Origins, a much older game, had the ability to tell your companions to do / don't do certain things. That's just me though, maybe people enjoy not having to manage 3 other companions. 

Overall... Just play the game, it needs so much more recognition than it has. So slept on fr fr. I may even do a second run, screw it.

1. Fun Vocation (Class) system which makes you wanna use all of them.
2.  Simple yet rich combat.
3. Neither easy nor difficult gameplay experience
4. High replayability
5. An Innovative Pawn System which makes you forget that the game is actually single-player because they talk to you throughout the journey. They're also really silly and funny for the wrong reasons (Listen to what they say after falling from a height). They're almost AI like and the game's been out for more than a decade.
6. Affinity System

While several cons don't affect the overall experience. the following should be considered: 
1. Escort missions lmao; helpless npcs tend to run straight into trouble when they're supposed to be escorted
2. The best content is actually towards the game's ending and the DLC area that's too difficult in the early levels despite accessibility.
3. Some DLC weapons are horrible and gated behind escort missions, making them a waste of time to do other than to experience the mission for the first time.
4. Affinity System lmao

Nonetheless, the cons are workable and even avoidable, and with all things considered, DD:DA mostly aged like fine wine compared to so many games these days. No wonder it remains a cult classic more than a decade after it was released in the PS3.

10/10 game, really looking forward to DD2 in 2025.

The good: 
-Traditional medieval fantasy world and design.
-Interesting lore featuring old english dialog.
-Best pro-active combat and monster interaction in an Action-RPG.
-Great character creator for an A-RPG as even weight, height and sex affect the combat.
-Dynamic vocation switching allows for deep class exploration in a single run.
-The game has its own way of dealing with evasive moves instead of giving every vocation a dodge button: i-frames counter attacks, perfect blocks and parries, hyper armor, levitation and positioning, animation canceling, double jumps, etc.
-The Augments are vocation specific pasive skills that carry across all of them, promoting replayability.
-You can manually place up to ten fast-travel crystals anywhere in the world.
-The Pawn system where players can rent each other's AI companions online and form a party of up to 4 characters.
-In Dark Arisen, the Bitterblack Island expands on the game and focuses on hardcore combat, commonly refered as ""the Dark Souls mode"" for its structure and tone. It's also accessible from the very start of the game.
-Features a Speedrun mode.
-One of the first games to ever feature a photo mode since the 360/PS3 era.

The bad:
-Only one save file per account.
-Quest tracking and progression often unclear.
-Lacking default fast-travel locations besides Gran Soren and Cassardis in early game.
-RNG loot makes the end game a bit grindy.
-Scarce dialog choices.
-Slow main story pace.
-Pawn AI is very hit or miss and often learn the wrong lessons.

      [b] Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen [/b] is an underrated game with a marvelous hit feeling and skill diversity in 9 different playable classes. The game involves kind of details from the Elder Scrolls, Souls-like, and Monster Hunter game series. That's why, I entitled the game as genre-mixed. Hereby, let me describe the game in more detail.

     Dragon's Dogma is being fed by the NPC/AI companionship which is called as Pawns along the game. Pawns are customized NPCs that follow you throughout the game. Also, you can customize their behaviors and reaction attitudes against to issues and situations that you face. Additionally, you can enlarge your team in the interdimensional Rift Zone in the game. Rift Zone allows you to hire other players' pawns in online with Rift Coin (RC). Next, I would want to mention class diversity in the game with skills. The game consists of 9 different classes which can be unlocked with the respect points (RP). Indeed, all 9 classes have unique items and build systems. For instance, the mage knight has unique shield enchanting skills while the sorcerer has genuine sigil skills. All these details provide the RPG-based experience to the game. Moreover, fair enough foe species with different attacking shapes are looking to be inspired by Souls-Like and Monster Hunter games. Finally, the game story of Arisen apparently refers to the Chosen Dragonborn theme of Skyrim.

      Consequently, you won't waste your time in Dragon's Dogma in vain due to all these genre-mixed details were processed with the refined exertion of Capcom. I hope this review helps you to decide on the buying game.

It has a MASSIVE, truly open world the likes of which I don't think would be surpassed until the recent Elden Ring. It was full of interesting places to explore, full of fantastic monsters and valuable rewards. Most of this map is there simply for the player's benefit, not fulfilling any quest objective of any sort. In my time with the game, I saw but a small fraction of the map by mostly just following the main quest path and would have seen far less had I not done the few side quests I did.

The game is also filled with tons of amazingly fresh ideas. From it's unique take on health and healing (magic healing can't completely heal you to full) to the game's spellcasting system (where multiple friendly spellcasters can join their efforts together) to it's monster climbing system (where you can literally scale massive beasts to get to their weak points). It also featured a robust character editor, both in terms of cosmetics as well as in terms of class/abilities.

But, sadly, it didn't completely come together. There were many areas that felt rough and unpolished. Great ideas hampered by very poor execution. And playing this game in the wake of more modern titles made this rough edges jagged and painful. Imperfections impossible to look past. Far too many to pretend they didn't exist. Almost every facet of the game is marred by one of these small, quality of life issues. And it's a real shame.

That being said, Dragon's Dogma 2 is on the horizon, and this game made me very excited to see what the team at Capcom can do with more time, money, and a fresh, modern eye to this game's exciting uniqueness. Here's hoping the sequel retains this game's fresh takes and interesting mechanics while sanding off those rough edges.

   It's a slow game that makes you take your time and does not hold your hand. Your actions are the answer often in quests. Simply attacking or being seen or even just being a man (or having one with you) decides the course of a quest. The obvious moral high ground is not always the best choice in the long run. It's a subtle game and not for everyone. 
   This is it for me though. This is the fantasy game that scratches my itches... The magic is slow and painful but, my god, when it goes off you just stand back and go ""Yeah, I did that"". The monsters are glorious their proportions and size mixed with a perfect camera  just make you go ""you want me to fight that?!""

And I don't recall why I enjoyed this game after replaying it. The dark arisen just adds the most annoying and tedious endgame. I have seen in a rpg. 
Start with a some list of things that were okay.

Vocation/classes: 3 standard classes, 3 advanced version (kinda) and three hybird classes. A fair amount of skills and magic. Late game though you should probably just become a magick archer, best vocation.

Music: in a few fights they play some absolute bangers, besides that forgettable soundtrack

So now on to the cons
Story: Dogwater

Combat:  You get hit once. You will either have to watch something smacking you in a animation for five seconds and they you will fall to the ground and slowly get up. Or you'll have to wiggle your stick for 4 seconds to 15 seconds depending of what kind of grapple you get hit by (pawns can help here but they are more likely just to watch, they kinky like that). Well laying on the ground you are invincible, but during you standing up animation which takes 3 seconds you are fully susceptible to be damage and combo'd further. So I've had situations were I was stun locked for minutes at a time. But it's cool because you can just pause and use as many health items whenever. (I see this as a band-aid for shitty combat design) 

Travelling: Your stamina runs out after 10 seconds of running, which you'll get 20 feet. Then takes 40 secs to refill your stamina while your character does the most half hearted jogging (the speed is closer to walking then a jog). And if you run into enemies while low on stamina you get to use one or two skills during the fight.
You only get two standard fast travel spots, but you can get 5 portcrystal's which you can place anywhere on the open map. Problem though is you will be going between 10 plus places constantly, so no matter what you're going to just be running to the same place again and again.

The pawn A;I: Your friendly a.i is there to troll you and just be a distraction for the horde of enemies. They will constantly just stand around in fights not doing anything while you get mobbed, then do one thing and say they good for the next few minutes.
Walking close to edges or narrow walkways is a gamble whether your pawn will randomly commit sudoku. You'll know buy seeing/hearing them say ""What a gaffe..."" Get use to seeing that every 20 mins. So you'll be down a pawn or three for the rest of the mission. hopefully you don't run into a enemy that can only be hurt with magic after your mages sudoku.

Mages A.I: Yes they get there own section. They love running under large enemies to cast spells that take 10 seconds to charge and act like they won't get interrupted every time. Unless you have killed like a 100 of that enemy and they have max knowledge of a enemy they will not use the most effective spells against a type of enemy. Even if it's the only spell they have. (like we fighting a bunch of cursed enemies want to enchant our weapons with holy, no?) Your mage has a healing spell. only one they will use in combat. cause someone will always have some white health. 
They will be most done casting a spell then just stop and run 5 feet and start casting again.

Dark arisen/ the expansion: The only positive thing to say about the expansion is the final boss music is fuking good. Besides that is the most most tedious and grindy endgame. Having the second strongest weapons and being max level. I do fractions of damage to most enemies in the expansion. The fights are tedious because you are doing less then 10% of they're health bar every few minutes. P.s most larger enemies have a minimum of 8 health bars. How do you get the strongest weapons, of easy you grind chest's (4 in total, but two can only be accessed briefly after beating the final boss, but that will restart the expansion in a sense) that have a 2% chance of giving you the bitterblack weapon lvl 3, then you have to get it purified and role a chance to get a weapon your class can use. I gave up after getting 5 that were ones that nether me or my main pawn could use.

Great feature of doing too well in the dlc will spawn a super powerful enemy by you, doesn't matter if you are fighting a bosses or large group of enemies. And death may randomly pop up during that as well.
I swear everything in this dlc is just made to instant kill your pawns. Not like oh you pawn ran outta health go revive them, just of your pawn got hit by this one thing. So go recruit a new one, cause he dead as a doorknob.

[spoiler]The dlc story is worst then the main game. Oh this Arisen instead of choosing one of the two chooses of the dragon, told him to go fuk himself and now he cursed.[/spoiler]

I came from hundreds of hours of Skyrim, Witcher 3, Elden Ring, and Breath of the Wild. Dragon's Dogma seemed right up my alley. I am happy to report that I wasn't disappointed at all. 
Dragon's Dogma released in 2012 for the PS3 and Xbox 360, and it likely got overshadowed by Skyrim and Dark Souls. But the game is absolutely worth your time, and in many ways it does feel like an Elder Scrolls game if it had actual, good combat. 
The combat and pawn system are the biggest selling points of the game. The pawn AI is generally very good, and though their dialogue can get repetitive sometimes (""WOLVES HUNT IN PACKS"") there is a charm to it, in no small part thanks to how good the voice acting is. 
You know that feeling familiar to the LOTR films or kids playing DnD? That feeling of being an actual party of adventurers facing peril together in a fantasy world? With the nerdy camaraderie and sense of adventure, like you're a bunch of kids dressing up like knights and wizards? This game (and potentially Elden Ring) is the only game I've played that has actually captured that feeling in the most authentic way. The interactions with your pawns during combat, and the thrill of climbing a huge monster while your mages pelt it with spells is incredible. 
The combat on its own should sell most people on the game. It has the same satisfying nature to it familiar to anyone who uses greatswords in FromSoft or Monster Hunter games. There is good hitlag and emphasis on timing and positioning. Paired with the climbing system and the incredible music, it lends itself to some truly Lord Of The Rings-feeling moments throughout the game (specifically, it may remind you of when the Fellowship took down the cave troll in the Mines of Moria). The lack of convenient fast travel, besides the few portcrystals they give you is one of my biggest gripes with the game - as well as the lack of variety in scenery in many places. But these aren't things that should dissuade you from the game.
I am only 32 hours into the game and yet to finish it, but I cannot stress enough how much this game needs more of your attention. It quickly became one of my favorite games.

But the whole gameplay got better just by the addition of grabbing. My pawn saved me by jumping on another pawns shield and grabbing me midair when a harpy dropped me. That whole scene was epic, too bad I don't generally play with recorder on.  
Also grabbing makes escort quests super easy. You can just carry the idiots when they get stuck. Never have I enjoyed escort quest as much as this, even though the clients are silent and there's no banter, which is a major plus point for me in any quest.
The dialogue and characters of the world seems bland, the story is nothing to boast about, graphics are ok, but the gameplay alone is worth it. 
From traversal to fighting, it's a joy. And with so many miniboss fights it's never boring even though they tend to be easy enough at high levels. 
My sole gripe would be that it's too easy to level up. Money is not a concern. With the fighting focused on skills rather than typical item damage, purchasing items isn't worth it. But on the plus side it means you can go for fashion instead of stats and perks. I guess people play with just their main pawn, where as I play with all three. Maybe that's why it's so easy for me. 
But the early games were truly a nightmare in nighttime when 3 ogres or chimeras attack at once.
And this game had the best Dragon fights out of all the games I've played. Be it Skyrim, Dark souls, DAO, Witcher or whatever you can name (Midir being the sole exception, but even then, if you can solo a Dragon, is it truly a dragon?). It requires strategy and a solid team work, as well as knowing where to strike.. Unless you are high level and have loads of stamina potions (which is a minus point for me in every RPG)
Fighting bosses and even normal enemies become fun when you're not just fighting to win, but trying to attack a specific body part so that it would drop that loot you need. Like attack the tusk of a cyclop to get a broken tusk or target the horns on a Dragon to get the dragon horn. All this means, even when the enemy becomes repetitive in high level, it still makes it fun to fight them. 
I don't know if there's a Mod like SKyrim Legend, that lets the enemy level up with you. If so, this game would never be boring.",1692006354,1692007512,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Story is super barebone, cutscenes have classic Capcom quality in both directing and acting - like original RE classic. Ending is mediocre. Most quests are simplistic fetch/kill quests, even mainline ones. 

Game really wants to waste your time, too - there's extremely limited fast travel (you get 5 beacons to place on MASSIVE map full of enemies in a first playthrough, 5 more later and that's it), you can't run for shit without running out of stamina all the time or slowing down to a crawl because you're overencumbered again, and it requires grinding for levels, support items, random drops for enhancement and so on. 

Another my complaint is that in its infinite wisdom Capcom decided to lock out most classes out of dodge roll and double jump - those are only available to a dagger-wielding classes. Amazing. Without those mobility options game becomes three times as annoying.

What I actually liked is pawn dress up and exploration - other than crossing wast swaths of land on foot it was pretty fun to climb and jump around the Gran Soren or Bluemoon Tower. And Bitter Black Island, that one had a bit of Dark Souls feel to it, even if they absolutely cut corners by copy-pasting half of the rooms in that one.

- Not your usual hand holding western RPGs
- Some mechanics aren't explained but aren't a worry to casual players
- Pawn system is cool (Basically a companion system you make your own and take up to 2 other player's pawns if you want to). It's more in-depth but cba explaining
- Quests are come and go, some quests are not shown meaning you have to explore the map with certain npcs to see if they have a quest available
- There is a 'romance' system but its very information lacking to the player without external information
- Ur-Dragon can be done Solo (Offline) or Online but damage done is accumulated with other people doing it in their domain (You cannot 'actively' play with other people in the online version, basically the online Ur-Dragon shares the same health pool with everyone connected online)
- Very niche style of game play somewhat old school
- The masterworks all you can't go wrong
- Day and night cycle changes the spawns of the map
- Acts/Chapters within the game are not told to you
- When you complete the game you will be allowed to change your character appearance
- Only 1 save slot but completing the game again (2nd time) puts you against your previous character if you make a new one
- I found the Anime terrible

Only downsides in this game are that the RPG elements are severely poor with what you expect of the genre. Roleplay options and a good story, the narrative is non existent, starts good then disappears for the whole game then peaks again at the very end, narrative is very weak in this game (the front cover dragon is only good part), same with the player choice aspect, it just doesn't exist its very linear and kinda predictable you make no meaning full decisions that can impact the story in anyway or alter questlines (this game is notorious for being unfinished and it shows in the aspect) 

AND also the terrible,terrible, TERRIBLE choice to exclude any form of a normal fast travel system or mounts in a game with map that isn't exactly small. You're going to be mostly walking and running around for awhile if you dont find/figure out the unorthodox travelling system, so keep that one in mind, turns alot of people off early on sadly (hopefully Dogma 2 has mounts.)

Seriously, I've heard so many great things about the game - that the combat is great (it's neat), that the vocation system is great (it's terrible), that the pawn system is unique (uniquely terrible for the most part). I wasted over 40 hours on this mess only because the combat was somewhat enjoyable, said enjoyability waning as the same couple of enemies were being slain over and over again. 

The map is bland, static and needlessly big for the stamina system to work properly (yeah, the stamina sucks too). Quests are a joke. The weight system is an even funnier joke (why the fuck is this a thing). The vocation system is neat at first, but it quickly becomes a chore as you need to grind levels with specific vocations in order to get a decently built character. Most skills are obsolete as there are a few that just break the game (brain splitter, for example) making the combat very repetitive. The climbing looks cool, but it very janky and most vocations suck at it (which is a terrific decision considering that it is one of the main selling points). The difficulty is hot mess consisting of fighting a chimera for 20 minutes straight (my first one) and then killing it in a matter of seconds dozens of hours later (my 50th one, I guess). Oh, and who can forget the worst equipment I think I've seen in a videogame - extremely clunky, slow, and powerful. You can easily pause the game at any moment and heal to full HP after clicking on the same item for like 20 seconds. If you want to use a throwing bomb you have to select it, wait for the animation (you don't have to do that if you heal, by the way), use the item, and then select it again (XDDDDDDDDDD).

The worst part is that I was actually enjoying the game for a brief moment when I was still leveling up my vocations. Despite all of these issues there is a good game there somewhere. I just wish the fans of the game didn't have to lie in order for it to look better (""It's like Dark Souls"", where? I'm genuinely asking, it's nothing like the game.)

Even though the game is a bit dated graphics wise, you can look past that due to the interesting story line. One of the main parts I consider essential to an RPG is having different endings, and this game delivers. I wasn't expecting it and I am glad I got different options to end the game. 
I thought I would just mention that the option to fill empty flasks with oil to re light your lantern and the realism of your lantern extinguishing if you go into water was a really nice touch. 
Furthermore, I am glad I got the dark arisen version, I wouldn't be able to stand all of that travelling without the fast travel options of the port crystals (an item that you cast into the ground and you can teleport to). Even then, I would like a few more because it can feel a bit like a walking simulator at times - considering how long it takes to get places and find port crystals. Still, I guess it's also a positive because it gives you the chance to encounter enemies and level up your character - UNLESS the enemies are far stronger than you, that sucks.
I don't know if its like this for all of the characters, but a main gripe of mine was the stamina level for a mage. I decided to play as a mage arisen, and the amount of times I ran and then kept running out of stamina (despite not carrying a heavy load) was really frustrating, especially when you want to get somewhere quick or dodge an enemy in a big fight.
ALSO give us multiple save file options and better romance mechanics! I'm sad I can't really re visit my old character and also I maxed Julien's affinity but made the mistake of doing Aelinore's personal quest, which - [spoiler] suddenly made my character and her in a relationship and kiss, which to me made no sense. So I ended up with her in the end when the dragon takes someone you care about, DESPITE ME GIVING THE RING TO JULIEN. This is apparently if you max affinity a lot of people, it then decides who the dragon takes in alphabetical order?? The game should make who you give the ring to actually important, by then having it guaranteed they will get taken by the dragon - otherwise that whole item is kinda pointless imo.[/spoiler]
Other than that, I already want to replay it and made another character lol. Excited for Dragon's Dogma 2!

I've owned 4 copies of this game since the original release on PS3 and every time I come back to this game, I enjoy it more than the last time.

Story:
While the story is has a very unique and interesting concept, it somewhat fails in the execution. There's nothing wrong with not having a voiced player character, but without many, if any, dialogue options, many of the story beats fall flat. An NPC will say something and my character will just stare at them with a blank expression. I like how New Game+ can be considered as a canon continuation of your initial playthrough as you attempt to break the ""Eternal Cycle"". While the game world is cheerful and sometimes goofy, the story is actually quite deep and depressing but in a good way.

Combat:
This is where the game truly shines. As an 11 year old game, the combat still holds up and even outperforms many more recent action RPGs. It's the main reason I keep coming back to this game. It's a shame more RPGs haven't emulated or been inspired by the combat in Dragon's Dogma. For the time, it was innovative, and more RPGs could have benefited from having similar mechanics implemented.

The Boss fights are always fun with Dragon's Dogma climbing mechanic where you can scale bosses and attack specific weak spots. Nothing more satisfying than thrusting your dagger into a cyclops' eye!

The animations, specifically for spells, are incredible and make you feel way more powerful than mage/sorcerers in other RPGs. All the classes, even the basic ones you choose at the beginning of the game, are fun to play as and sometimes preferred over more specialised classes. The only class that isn't as great is the Warrior vocation as you can only use 3 abilites whereas every other class can use 6. It's still pretty fun to use despite this.

My favourite classes, the Mystic Knight and Magick Archer combine, fighters with mages and striders with mages respectively, feel pretty unique and I encourage any new player to experiment with all the vocations instead of sticking to one as they're all great!

Gameplay:
I think this game fails as a true RPG and I believe it's more appropriate to call this an action game with RPG elements, though it's a very good action game. It can be very difficult at first and stamina management can be an issue early on but if you can stick with it the game becomes a lot easier as enemies don't scale. This does unfortunately mean that some parts of the game can become too easy, but the post-game and the Bitterblack Isle expansion can provide more of a challenge later. I recommend playing on Normal (not Easy) on your first playthrough and then on Hard in NG+ to give yourself a reasonable challenge. You just have to get through the difficult early game.

Unfortunately you're limited to one save, presumably so the servers aren't bloated with too many pawns from multiple save games, so make sure you get your character and your pawn right in character creation! You can only change their appearance once in a single playthrough and won't be able to again until NG+. There is a barbershop you can also use, but the changes you can make are limited.

Pawns:
They are hilarious, adorable, and give this game so much personality. They don't stop talking but this is a good thing. They're quips are iconic and I could hear 'Even in numbers, a weakling is a weakling still.' all day. You can adjust their personality though it takes some work and all of them are funny. Other players' pawns populate your world and you can recruit them on the road or in the cities as well as in the Rift, the place they come from. Likewise people can recruit your pawn and you can earn an in-game currency from it. Sometimes you may get racist or offensive pawns, like young children in thongs, in your world and it's a shame there's no way to remove them or report the creator. If you are easily offended, it may be best to play this game offline and use the default pawns that populate the world instead, but I hope you won't let that get in the way because there are some incredible creations.

Character Creation:
For me, this is one of the best character creators. You have true freedom with their body type and can even make a child if you want to play as one. While it can be hard to make as visually appealing a character as modern RPGs, the freedom and sheer number of options from hairs, faces, arm, body and leg shapes is appreciated, all without the use of finicky sliders!

Conclusion:
A flawed masterpiece that built an incredible world that I can't wait to dive back into with Dragon's Dogma II. I can't recommend this game enough although I acknowledge it may not be for everyone. It may be too easy for fans of soulslikes and may be too barebones for RPG lovers but Dragon's Dogma had something special here. For the price I'd say it's at least worth a try.

The character creation is single-handedly THE most in-depth character customizer ever. I have never seen another come close to the breadth of options you have here. Not just in hair styles, but you can make your character any size or build you want, from a tiny 3-foot tall gnome, to a 7+ foot giant. From a brick wall of muscle, to the lankiest elf possible, to a morbidly obese dude. And the height and overall weight of your character even affects certain aspects of their stats!

And while combat and classes are unbalanced, they went ALL OUT in making each class go absolutely apeshit bonkers by the end. At the start of the game you'll feel kinda bad at everything no matter what class, but just wait until endgame. Every class is somehow broken in their own way (except mage lol, just pretend that's only for pawns.)

Fighter? Dragon's Maw spam, just become a whirlwind of DPS.
Warrior? Get yoself that Arc of Oblieration. THIRTY SECONDS charge time in a fast-paced action game is an eternity, but you know it's fun when you have to measure the damage of a single hit in how many *healthBARS* you wipe out.
Assassin? Become literally invincible because lol, lmao, and just do infinity DPS on any big dude.
Sorcerer? Summon tornados and meteor showers. Not cutscene spells, no. And these aren't small baby tornadoes. You can just summon a damn 50-foot-tall F5 maelstrom of a tornado that launches enemies so high into the air they'll die of fall damage if they don't get obliterated before it runs out. And those meteors? The size of dang semi trucks. In a game that vaguely plays like a souls-like! Dark Souls doesn't let you summon tornadoes.
Strider? Sonic spindash go brrrrrrrr
Ranger? See Warrior, except you kill a pawn to deal 5 healthbars of damage in one homing arrowshot from a mile away because why not.
Mystic Knight? Just spam magical turrets and watch enemies get dissolved. Or like, buff your pawns so they can do the cool stuff.
Magick Archer? You basically become a one-man fireworks show, assuming you don't just set yourself on fire and hug everything to death.

Highly recommend, especially if you have a love for somewhat janky but very fun and charming games with their imperfections.",1690808603,1690808603,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- [b]The Combat:[/b] When I first picked up Dragon's Dogma, the combat is what drew me in. To this day I cannot get enough of it. Although I adore soulslikes such as Nioh and am very fond of the Monster Hunter games, none of them scratch the action-combat itch quite like Dragon's Dogma does. Every vocation (class) feels fleshed out, particularly the Mystic Knight for its powerful and satisfying counter and the Strider/Ranger/Assassin vocations for their speed, dodge and movement based attacks. All of the vocations were tons of fun, but those listed above quickly became my favourites. I must note that the game lacks a lock-on mechanic, but this gives the combat more freedom and an extra layer of difficulty/mastery. Players are encouraged to place their moves carefully and opt for favorable positions, whether it be on the ground or hanging from a chimera's tail.

- [b]The Pawn System[/b]: Bolstering the game's meaty combat is the pawn system. ""Pawns"" are NPC allies created by fellow players. You will be given your very own pawn to customise and use during your adventure. You may choose their class, speech pattern, weapons and abilities. As you level them up, their prowess will improve. While sometimes goofy, pawns are generally a great help and make for good company! Before you know it, you'll have developed a bond with your otherworldly companion. 

- [b]The World/Story[/b]: Gransys, the game's setting, and its creatures are both awe-inspiring and intimidating. The map is laden with strongholds and temples of old, all beautifully crafted with greek and roman inspired architecture. It becomes clear that the world of Dragon's Dogma is ancient, and that much knowledge and history has been lost to time. Might you be one of the few souls capable of accessing the secrets of the universe, of taking up arms and confronting the Dragon? Your trial awaits, newly Arisen!

I have played the PC version of Dragon's Dogma for over 400hrs, and roughly 50hrs on the Switch version at the time of writing this review. This game stole my heart, and now I get to have it stolen all over again when Dragon's Dogma 2 drops.

Introduction:

Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen is a masterpiece that has left an indelible mark on my gaming journey. From the very moment I stepped foot into the vast and breathtaking world of Gransys, I knew I was about to embark on an unforgettable adventure. This game, developed by Capcom, is a testament to the power of storytelling, thrilling combat, and the boundless freedom it grants players, making it an unparalleled and powerful gaming experience.

Epic Fantasy World:
Gransys is a living, breathing world teeming with secrets, danger, and wonder. From the sun-soaked plains to the hauntingly beautiful forests, every corner of the map exudes an unparalleled sense of awe and intrigue. Exploring its vast landscapes, uncovering hidden dungeons, and facing the dangers lurking in the darkest depths was an immersive experience that made me feel like a true adventurer.

Unique Pawns and Dynamic Battles:
The innovative Pawn system in Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen sets it apart from other RPGs. I had the freedom to customize my main Pawn and recruit others, each with their unique skills and personalities. The AI-driven Pawns learned from my actions, adapting and evolving as I ventured deeper into the adventure. Battles were dynamic and intense, requiring strategic thinking, quick reflexes, and mastery of the game's deep combat mechanics.

Freedom of Exploration:
This game truly embodies the essence of freedom. Whether scaling towering cliffs, battling colossal monsters, or delving into ancient ruins, the sense of agency over my actions was exhilarating. The non-linear progression allowed me to follow my own path, and the choices I made had genuine consequences, leading to a sense of ownership over my character's fate.

Fearsome and Majestic Creatures:
The thrill of battling the colossal and fearsome beasts that roam Gransys cannot be understated. Each encounter was a pulse-pounding experience, testing my skills and tactics. From the terrifying chimera to the awe-inspiring dragon, every encounter left me in awe and on the edge of my seat.

Lore and Intriguing Story:
The rich lore and captivating narrative of Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen drew me in and refused to let go. Unraveling the mysteries of the Arisen, the Dragon, and the world's history was a deeply satisfying experience. The game's atmospheric storytelling and intriguing characters kept me engrossed, urging me to uncover every secret and piece together the puzzle of Gransys.

Lasting Impact:
Even after completing the main quest, Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen beckons players to continue their journey with challenging post-game content. The sheer amount of content and replay value is a testament to the game's depth and ability to keep players engaged for countless hours.

Conclusion:

Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen is a powerful and unforgettable gaming experience that has carved a permanent place in my heart. From the sprawling fantasy world to the dynamic combat and freedom of exploration, every aspect of the game oozes passion and dedication from the developers at Capcom. This epic odyssey captured my imagination, making me feel like a true Arisen on an extraordinary quest. It is a testament to the power of video games as a medium for storytelling, adventure, and the ability to leave a lasting impact on players. Without a doubt, Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen stands tall among the greatest RPGs of all time, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone seeking an awe-inspiring journey into the realms of fantasy and adventure.",1690685193,1690685193,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are a lot of pros and a lot of cons, but I spent 90 hours on my first play through (I really tried to do everything) and do not regret it. My con list may be longer but I believe the pros **way** more than outweigh any problems. The game was simply very enjoyable and had a good game play loop formula. Those with little tolerance for old games or poor game design may find themselves frustrated and annoyed.

Pros:
- Unique combat and rpg experience
- You can climb on the giant monsters. It looks a little janky at times, but it results in some awesome moments.
- Pawn system is something I have never seen before and extremely interesting, if sometimes a little frustrating.
- Each class is a completely unique experience. Even something like mage to sorcerer (which is mostly an upgraded mage) is a surprisingly different experience. Melee, Ranged, and Magic are COMPLETELY different from eachother and use completely different mechanics. Classes have great identities. I really felt like I wanted to play a melee class just to see everything that was different.
- Combat is varied and enjoyable
- Giant monsters are awesome
- The dragons are actually awesome, yes actually this time! (looking at you skyrim)
- The story is actually really good but it is basically not there at all for 90% of the game.
- Some quests are actually very thoughtful and have a lot of heart. A lot of them caught me off guard as they are mixed in with empty, boring quests.
- The final dragon fight is exceptional.
- Some of the music is eh, but a lot of it is really good. It makes combat feel very grand.
- All of the three ""Ending sequences"" are very satisfying.
- The end credits for the final ending is really cool.

Cons
- the monsters are very pretty (for 2012) and the monster animations are frequently very fluid and surprisingly natural looking (again for 2012) and lots of the spell effects look good, but other than that the game is frankly ugly. Lots of grays and dark colors. Even the supposedly black pieces of armor are gray in color, which is sad because I think the game could be extremely pretty. The grpahics were dated the moment it released in 2012, a year after skyrim which is no art masterpiece, but looks much prettier than this game.
- There are so little mods from lack of modding tools. Lots of the problems with the game can't be community patched out. You have to deal with them.
- Lots of the quests are just as soulless as skyrim's and many are more annoying.
- Some quests or actions are completely unintuitive. For example, there is a griffon you are hunting and the quest gives you some vague instruction of ""Lure the griffon down"" but what it wants you to do is kill some creature, pick up its corpse (you have never needed to do this before now btw) and carry it to a marked area to bait the griffon. Another quest which annoys me greatly is one called Idol Worship where effectively you are asked by some merchants to get a token. There is no indication of what the correct token is, or any indication there are multiple types of tokens at all. So you could very likely be like ""Oh I found one of those idols I already have it I can complete this right away! :) but actually you just handed in the fake bronze token which gets you nothing and does not expand the shops inventory. If you find the true token later, you don't get to hand it in. The quest is over, you completed it the wrong way. This kind of bad game design unfortunately encourages wiki diving which will spoil a lot of cool things and did for me.
- Lots of just bad or dated game design choices like the quests I just mentioned. For one, the high level DLC area (Dark Arisen content) called Bitterblack Isle is presented to you right away. You might think this is because you are supposed to do it, but this is actually something you do in ""Post Game""
- Lots of points of no return. For the most part these are clearly marked and communicated but it can be unclear if the game really means it closes all your quests or if its just exaggerating (it isn't exaggerating, finish your quests first). The final point of no return in ""Post Game"" is not clear at all and locks you out of a particular dungeon. When you get a quest to hand in 20 Wakestones to someone *that is a point of no return* do not finish that quest until you want the game to be over and stop playing. There is no recovering from that point.
- It is sometimes unclear if you are doing something wrong or not geared enough for an area. This is especially the case in Bitterblack Isle where the monsters are quite strong. The damage calculation is linear, so if an enemy has 1000 magic armor and you do 1000 magic damage it will take no damage, but then every bit of damage extra you deal is straight to their health. This often results in you either being unable to touch a boss, or completely bouncing off of them.
- Magic immune enemies in particular are very unfun if you are a caster. Ironically, there are physical immune enemies which are not a problem for physical characters. This is because a simple enchanted weapon deals magic damage. Thus a melee character can just use one of those weapons and fix it. The casters solution is this: if you are a sorcerer, Giciel and Bolide deal tiny amounts of physical damage. If you are a mage, you got nothing. Other than that you have to rely entirely on your melee pawns to do it which sometimes works alright, but mostly is infuriating while you stand there waiting for your pawns to kill sometimes for you while you do nothing at all.
- End game Bitterblack isle is just unfun (at least for me as a sorcerer) there were a lot of magic immune enemies and other enemies with huge health pools which can one shot your squishy butt. One at a time these enemies aren't the worst but end game BBI likes to throw these enemies two or three at a time, forcing you to cheese them or take forever to chip them down. It really encourages just running past everything. This also combined with most of the BBI enemies are weak to Holy and most characters who aren't melee characters have very few options to deal holy damage. As a sorc you will end up spamming Holy Focused Bolt more times than you can shake a stick at. 


For all of these cons though, I loved the game and thoroughly recommend it.
I had a ton of fun and enjoyed my adventure. One day I'll come back for my second play through.

I'll keep it somewhat brief and say the combat is excellent and feels really good regardless of the vocation you're playing and offers enough playstyle variety to keep it interesting for multiple playthroughs, or if you get bored easily.
There are many large (and small) creatures to fight with a grappling system that sometimes feels really good, other times may leave a bit to desire.

The pawn system is really fun, customizable and interesting. One of my favorite parts of the game [i] and generally team based mechanics do not interest me.[/i] Having one pawn along with you at all times from the beginning of the game feels really cute and fun. 
Building the right kind of team for a tough mission or just figuring out whats coolest aesthetically is really an enjoyable experience.

The world while at times can feel empty often has many little secrets hidden away in weird corners of the map and actually ends up being pretty fun to explore at times. Backtracking can get frustrating at times but there's ways around that in Dark Arisen.

The sound design is solid and the game still looks good.

The writing is overall solid. It certainly improves as the game goes on and by the end had me fully invested.
This is goes into where I think the biggest issue with the game lies, it was released without realizing its full potential. 
That said, I don't want that to be something that steers you away, this game is 100% earns a recommendation from me. So long as you can stick through a slow beginning I have good faith that the majority of people interested will find something to enjoy here.

Buy it, take your time, be patient, get creative and realize the game is more open ended and detailed than you realized initially, and fall in love. :)

A cheap copy of the Elder Scrolls series. The next crazy thing is that you collect so many materials during the game, and you can even mine some stone. But guess what? There's no crafting system at all in this game. No, wait, there is... but it's from the Resident Evil series crafting system. You have to combine only a special series of items, not any type of item. For example, you cannot forge a sword or armor by combining some metal. However, the game also has interesting features that are overshadowed by these shortcomings, such as a unique fast travel system and some mini-bosses. But they are not important.

The game's assumption that players would willingly endure elements such as minimal save points, inconsistent level scaling, and lackluster character development is, to put it plainly, laughable.

One of the most glaring issues in Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen is the lack of indicators regarding enemy strength. Players are left to navigate a treacherous landscape without clear information on the potential dangers they may face. The absence of such vital cues often results in sudden and frustrating deaths, or prolonged battles against overpowering foes. Even seemingly trivial adversaries, like rats or wolf cubs, can wield fatal blows without warning. The juxtaposition of low-level enemies in close proximity to significantly stronger ones raises questions about the game's open-world design, leading to exploration that can yield disappointment. This lack of foresight may find leniency among nostalgics and RPG enthusiasts, but it proves less forgiving for the average player.

The game's storyline and character portrayals suffer from a notable lack of depth. NPCs appear merely as background fixtures, serving either as props to fill scenes or as sources of quest-related information and shallow lore. The narrative, regrettably, fails to engage players on a meaningful level, leaving them with a sense of detachment and indifference. The characters, though present, possess little substance, offering little more than the feeling of consuming cough syrup—bland and unremarkable, but with an added bitterness.

With the passage of time since its original release, coupled with the waning of nostalgic sentiments, Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen reveals itself as a product with diminishing appeal. The unimpressive game design and uneven difficulty scaling contribute to its limited enjoyment, leaving it reserved mainly for the most ardent of nostalgics and die-hard RPG fanatics. Casual consumers, seeking captivating gameplay and engaging experiences, are likely to find themselves disenchanted after a brief hour of play. In many instances, players may even feel compelled to seek refunds, unable to bear the tedium and lackluster offerings any further.

Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen falls short of its potential and fails to garner applause from discerning players. Its design choices, ranging from gameplay mechanics to narrative execution, undermine the overall experience. While it may have its merits for a niche audience of dedicated RPG enthusiasts, the average gamer will likely be deterred by its deficiencies. As such, this title may best be approached with measured expectations, mindful of the challenges it presents for those seeking a more immersive and gratifying gaming experience.",1690090058,1690090058,False,1,0,0.47290685772895813,0,True,False,False

Dragon's Dogma is perhaps the best party-based Action RPG I've ever played, but definitely suffers from lots of frustrating flaws, far more than just quality-of-life issues; crappy balancing, terrible romance, pawns being brain-dead, losing control of the fucking camera, and RNG (DLC purification, basically a lootbox). Yet the over the top, movie-style action and combat strategies kept me coming back, when these flaws weren't present.

Since everyone has already spoken praise, I will mainly be discussing things that haven't really been said before. 

First, the flaws. These issues seem to feed into one another.
First of all the balancing - most of the issues I have with this comes down to the way damage is calculated. One of the most common complaints I hear from new players is that every enemy feels like a damage sponge. Every point in defence seems to reduce damage by that amount; so if you do 700 damage, and the enemy has 700 defence, you will do LITERAL decimal amounts of damage, and enemy health is often in the tens of thousands in this game. You CAN perform heavier attacks or find new weapons, but new players don't know where/how to get these, and it isn't exactly stellar design if you have to consult a game wiki so that you can kill the first goblin in no less than fifty attacks.

The second thing that feeds into this is the world's enemy placement. There is no level scaling and I actually love that there are tougher enemies in the starting area - go off the main paths and you're bound to run into them, even close to the beginning area. You'll have to grind levels and find good gear before you can face them - however there are few places to grind early game because low level enemies are very few, and no good places to buy better equipment unless you know where to go which is something new players will likely not know about. It is especially frustrating if the next quest is locked behind a group of bandits who can only die after a thousand cuts.
This doesn't last long however as once you make it to a certain level you're so overpowered that nothing in Gransys can challenge you anymore.

This brings us to the third thing, Bitterblack Isle (BBI) from the Dark Arisen DLC. Admittedly without it, I wouldn't have replayed this game so much. However I only really look forward to certain parts of the DLC if I am being quite honest. The first third of BBI is something I always enjoy - it really feels like it's balanced towards late-game characters, fights never take long and make you feel like you're wasting your time, but they are still challenging and lethal. It even has a type of surprise encounter in some areas, which remind you of how you felt in Gransys when you ran into a Chimera at level 17. However all of it goes to shit after you beat the first boss of the DLC, because now we have the REVERSE problem that the base game has.

The second part of the DLC introduces enemies with absolutely BLOATED stats, such that even if you were using a damage type that they're WEAK against, it feels like it takes ages to kill them. Many of these enemies are also just reskinned enemies from Gransys too, scaled a bit larger, so they feel so boring to fight against. 
The cherry on top is that many of these enemies can one shot you in the cheapest ways - spellcasters. I'm not against one-shot attacks so long as they abide by a single rule - it is either telegraphed and avoidable (such as death's scythe or exequy) . Spellcasters in BBI however, are just bullshit enemies, who spam these spells almost instantly, even if it takes the player/pawns 10+ seconds to charge the same spell. It feels like the devs are directly going AGAINST their own design, as the director has stated in interviews that powerful magic should take a very long time to cast and drain a lot of energy. Now, there are a consumables to make fighting these enemies much easier, but only to the degree that they remove all challenge. These issues are represented the most in the second form of the DLC's final boss - his health is nearly doubled, and his defence is unbreakable even when using magic he's weak to.

This is where I discuss the purification system. I would like to believe the devs were just buffoons who don't know how to balance shit but sadly it is probably much more insidious than this, and I find it strange it's not talked more about.
In the original Dragon's Dogma - the 2012 release on consoles - Rift Crystals (RC) were pretty much premium currency. One of the key friendly NPCs in Dark Arisen had a dialogue option to literally bring up a store page where you could buy RC, which just so happens to be the currency you need to get a DLC weapon on top of upgrading it. These weapons are incredibly powerful, and borderline required for the second run of the DLC. Keep in mind it is random what weapon you get, so you might not even be able to get a weapon for your chosen vocation, practically forcing a player to play a vocation just so they can use the weapon and farm for more chances at getting their desired weapon is nothing short of mobile game bullshit.

Some other things I hated about this game were things like poor translation, upgraded versions of skills being situationally inferior than their base ones (like Compass/Fullmoon Slash or Escape/Exodus Slash, with no option to use the base version many resort to never upgrading certain skills), and the pawn AI (not being able to force them to consume items, issue commands such as ranged attacks when it's the only way to damage something, or change their inclinations)

Now for some of the better things about this game.
Contrary to most people, I do not find the world boring, just different from what I initially expected. Many first impressions are that the world is huge, but people later discover it actually feels quite small. I don't particularly mind this as there's still materials to collect or enemies to fight, but it does get boring once you've fought every enemy.
Many people don't feel the world is varied enough and I'm inclined to disagree. There are tundras, mountains, crags, plains, hills, old ruins, and foggy forests. Look at any screenshot and you can instantly tell where in Gransys it is, and evenbefore I even watched dev interviews I could tell it was inspired by the English countryside. The colour palette is also green, which I find refreshing to brown 2010s games

The game's take on generic fantasy is also fascinating to me. It takes more inspiration from real world origins of these myths than Tolkien or Dungeons & Dragons, yet it is full of classic Hollywood familiarity. Many will also note the people, language, clothing, and architecture of Gransys indicates a lot of effort in researching broad middle ages culture, from small things like the prevalence of town bells to the names of certain items, referencing their contemporary terms.

I also do not think the story is particularly bad- many seem to exaggerate it, some even calling it ""largely gibberish."" It's certainly poorly executed due to development constraints. The story, mostly takes Buddhist and Nietzschean philosophies and wraps it up in a neat fantasy package. As I was raised Buddhist, I can tell you Dragon's Dogma really made me think a lot about the similarities between these two, and the ending lead me to speculate on our nature as humans and our relationship to religion and free will. This wasn't just pulled out of nowhere; the game throws anime opening level spoilers at you. Does ""finish the cycle of Eternal Return"" sound familiar? It is a reference to the Eternal Recurrence.

Nearly all quests are just escort quests, which means you have to run again through whole map where same enemies are continuously respawning (which is very enjoyable with that nearly nonexistent stamina which is required to run) or hunting quest where you just have to kill some certain enemy. Inventory management is terrible abomination. Main quest is very generic and boring with nothing special to offer. 

All characters are forgetable and your ""companions"" called pawns are just endlessly repeating same voice lines over and over and there is no way to tell them to shut up and because they are just bunch of people who have no free will of their own nor emotions and their only reason for existence is to serve you they make very ""entertaining"" companions. 

And so much praised unique combat is just plain bad, it is nice that you can climb at enemies or target their weaknesses but in the end all ""bosses"" are just damage sponges where you are just repeating same thing over and over, like for example Chimera, just keep attacking snake tail after killing it you just keep attacking goat head and after that you have to keep hitting lion head until it dies, very simple and repetetive.

90% of the Sidequest are bad MMO design types alá ""Kill 10 Bandits"", ""Kill 45 Rabbits"" etc. Why?

Enemies all seem to be insane damage sponges where even low level trash mobs facetank 20-50 arrows. I can pretty much oneshot them with one of my fully upgraded Special Attacks but that feels wrong and repetitive. 

Enemy Leveling is bad. You spawn, kill a bunch of Low Level Goblins. Walk into the forest nearby and face Bandits and Lizards that twoshot you. And it's not a high level forest either because you get a sidequest that leads you way deeper through the forest very soon after where a Dragon waits and oneshots you, your companions and the NPC you're supposed to escort. So I don't quite understand what's going on there.

The Questlog; the UI as whole; is a complete mess thanks to the poorly ported console UI and also doesn't indicate which quest is the Main Quest Line. So currently I have no idea what I'm supposed to do and where I'm supposed to go as the map also isn't very helpful.

Only one Saveslot. I would like to try out playing a Mage but I'm afraid of losing all my progress as there is only one saveslot that the game autosaves and overwrites. I haven't clicked New Game to see whether that's what happens but I don't want to risk it.

The entire UI is a complete mess thanks to the Console UI that was poorly ported to PC.
Playing with a Gamepay is recommended.

All that being said, the combat is very fun. You can grapple enemies, your companions and enemies can do the same. You can customize your Main Companion as much as your own character. If you grapple large enemies you can cling onto them and stab them etc. something that other games only have as cutscenes or set animations. 

You can i.e. jump and shoot your bow midair. Not a lot of games give you that kind of freedom of Movement and Combat. You have your Basic Attacks like Light and Heavy Attack and then another two sets of Attacks that you can bind Abilities to and combine them with your Movement Skills like Sprinting and Jumping.

[code]
+   is positives
+/- is informational or neutral
-   is negatives 
[/code]

+ The combat is top-notch once you get used to some of the clunky aspects. This applies especially to vocations that use “magick”, since casting times are very long for the strong spells, but they are devastating when you match elemental weaknesses. Wiping an entire room out with one spell or one-shotting a monster with a well-placed sword strike is a common thing if you know what you’re doing. Magic classes like Sorcerer and Magick Archer are designed, play and feel fantastic in particular
+ Sound design is utterly unmatched, despite the game being more than a decade old. I have never played a game where sound design included every single little detail to a meticulous degree. General ambience and sound layering are outright done in flawless fashion
+ Hard Mode actually rewards you for the suffering it causes. However, you might get absolutely wrecked by any random hit if you play a physically weak class (like Sorcerer)
+ The Pawn system in its entirety is masterfully designed. Pawns can learn about quests, enemies and locations and give you and other people who hired them information on aforementioned things. They can learn about things and return with knowledge when they are being used by other players, as well 
+ The story cranks up to 11 and then 12 past certain points and the endings are satisfying and fit to the setting
+ You can climb on enemies to strike at their weak points. It’s a little janky, but it’s a lot of fun once you get the hang of it
+ Decent enemy variety. You need a different approach, element or strategy for every single large enemy in the game. For example, golems are completely immune to magic and very resistant to physical attacks but die instantly if you destroy all the “plates” they have on them
+ While there is no direct tutorial, the Pawns you have alongside you teach you how to deal with enemies, hazards and quests. The way the game teaches you how to play is organic thanks to the way the Pawn system is designed
+ Day and night cycle actually matters instead of being a simple visual change. Lanterns are mandatory in dark places and in the night. Different enemies spawn in the night and some quests have to be done at night or day
+ If you don’t like something in the game (like the oppressively limited weight capacity or the jump height), you can use mods to make it more fun or accessible

+/- The only online aspect is the Pawn system, but it’s done in a way that not only makes sense but is fun to deal with. You pay more Rift Crystals if you want to hire a high-level Pawn, but if you are friends with someone, you pay nothing. Your Pawn data is uploaded to the server every time you sleep at an inn
+/- You can send an item as a gift or swap out hired Pawn gear to give most gear and items to another player, which basically qualifies as “trading” despite the game being a single-player in its core
+/- Your character’s height, weight and bulk all affect their capabilities. Smaller characters can carry less, but can fit through some small and otherwise hard-to-access places in some maps and also be carried easier. Tall characters hang their lanterns higher (since their waists are higher) which prevent the lantern form going out when you get into waist-deep water
+/- Voice acting is pretty decent, even though it can get immersion-breaking if you find a pawn that has an oddly-pitched voice
+/- The map isn’t very large for an open-world, but the contents are packed densely
+/- Some animations are great, while some are either stiff or nonexistent. For example, combat animations are great but lip-sync animations are bad/nonexistent

- Unfortunately, close to 60% of the game was cut during development due to time and budget concerns. Even though the game is great as is, one can only wish they didn’t have to cut more than two thirds of the entire thing to ship it. Despite its strengths, the game is still practically incomplete.
- The save system is abysmal, and is a fully valid reason for a lot of people to not recommend the game. You only have ONE save slot, no easy way to manually save and arbitrary autosaves. This means you are pretty much required to back your save up manually if you value your time and progress. Additionally, if your game crashes during a zone transition or mid-save, your save file can be permanently corrupted
- Your Pawn data is uploaded to the server every time you sleep at an inn. However, according to my experience, I rarely could sleep just once to upload it, because it fails at least once or twice every time I tried despite my stable connection
- The infinite consumables and the abundance of money in Hard Mode makes you borderline unkillable unless you are very fragile or made a stupid mistake mid-combat. Even worse, most items are used instantly without any animations or other downsides
- You can deal devastating damage if you use a stackable item that multiplies your damage. While this isn’t an issue by itself, it can make many encounters trivial when used at the right time
- Pawn AI sometimes sucks big time, and they quite literally are incapable of dealing with some enemies even at max knowledge (like how they don’t or can’t dodge Death’s attacks in Blackback Isle)
- You can fail some quests or make them unavailable for the playthrough after certain points, and some of them are not indicated well enough
- Due to the game being a console port, it has some egregious design choices like menu transitions being too long, or having too many menus. Some other things like buying items in mass amounts, forcing you to hold a button also doesn’t help. You even have to go through TWO menus that prevent you from spamming, just to start the damn game (which takes like 10 seconds every time, but feels like 30)
- Stat system makes min-maxing far too tedious. Basically, you get different stat increases per level when you level up as a specific vocation. This means you can make yourself absurdly strong as one vocation while another would be handicapped if you switched over, due to your stats. You can compensate with gear for the most part, but you can’t respec and play as another vocation without using a save editor
- The Pawn Inclination system is too tedious due to you not being able to filter hirable pawns by inclination or forcing your Pawn to stay in one inclination. You can use potions to affect the inclination points, but you can never stop them from changing gradually
- Most items have identical/reused/recolored icons. Instead of 10 different variations of the same item, maybe they could have made them more unique both in function and looks?
- Item descriptions are extremely vague 90% of the time. This includes key items that are necessary for quests or passive bonuses obtained from some unequippable items
- Some voice lines repeat too many times. A notable example is shops (or any important NPC that lets you choose more than one option per dialogue attempt) repeating their lines every single time when they show up

The focus of the game is a good combat system with 3 major classes that play differently enough, huge monsters that you can scale and a variety of switchable attacks. Sadly, all other aspects of the game appear dull in comparison and mostly reminded me of the original Neverwinter Nights campaign, and the world felt more like a set of locations for gameplay to happen in – it’s a far cry from what Bethesda’s and Witcher’s players are accustomed to. There are some well-directed moments in cutscenes, but most quests and dialogues are far from impressive. The pawn system isn’t much ahead of Skyrim’s companions, yet customizing your own pawn to fit combat needs of your character and recruiting other player’s pawns felt somewhat new.
Overall, Dragon’s Dogma is a journey worth taking – with solid gameplay and a plot that manages to justify it. I was annoyed by constant backtracking due to a very limited fast-travel system and repeating battles, but I still enjoyed the game.

When Dragon’s Dogma first released back in 2012 on last generation consoles, not many knew what to expect from the brooding title boasting a true challenge. Demon’s Souls and Dark Souls at the time both proved to be incredibly popular with their highly demanding takes on action RPGs, yet they relied on closed, overbearing atmospheres to deliver their key sense of dread. Capcom’s Dragon’s Dogma was wide open, and free in a way that neither of those two games could be.

What resulted was a game that managed to retain the same looming darkness over a vast, open world full of life and possibilities. The title grew further in 2013 with an enhanced version of the base game titled Dragon’s Dogma: Dark Arisen. This introduced a new area, new quests, new armor, new NPCs, and basically added to the overall dark vibe of the game. It took a solid base and created an even better experience, and now that package and all its glory is finally available on PC.

Before we get into the nitty-gritty of whether Dragon’s Dogma: Dark Arisen on PC is any good, lets get some base details out of the way. You are the Arisen, a human imbued with an incredible power after an unsuccessful stand against a dragon that happens to be the harbinger of the end of days. It’s is up to you to put an end to it.

How? Well see, Gransys, the land in which Dragon’s Dogma takes place, is a mysterious one. One of its many enigmas is a small army of mercenaries who walk the rift. They answer to no one but the Arisen, and you can wield them in your battles against the darkness. This is the Pawn Legion, and the battles they fight by your side help give Dragon’s Dogma: Dark Arisen its singular identity.

These throw-downs are fast paced, but far from easy. One second you’ll find yourself picking harpies out of the sky with a bow, only to find some insane mercenary charging at you with a sword the next. When you think you’ve just gotten a grip on your surroundings, you face some sort of hulking cyclops, terrifying griffin, or huge dragon. Discovering and exploiting the weaknesses of  Gransys’ many beasts will demand coordination and a touch of fearlessness.

The combat system allows for one notably unique feature; your hero is able to grab enemies, sometimes heroically grappling the neck of a chimera, and other times desperately clinging to a cyclops’s legs hoping somehow this will help. For larger creatures, you’ll find yourself climbing across the expanse of their bodies, which is a lot less sensual than it sounds. There’s plenty of excitement to be found as you find yourself scaling one of the many necks of a Hydra, aiming to chop of one of those viscous heads.

Another dose of exhilaration comes from the tension and wonder before grand battles even begin. There is a lot to explore in Dragon’s Dogma: Dark Arisen, and the developers did a great job of fleshing out every corner of the world. Dark caverns, twisted ruins, old houses and cities, sprawling fields, and treacherous mountains each have their own signature feel and always keep you on your toes. Enemies lurk in shadows and overhead, and some stand right out in the open, daring you to test your mettle against their brutality. This world pulls no punches, and your invitation carries no pretense of safety. From the very beginning, you are told only death awaits, and you will fight tooth and nail to disprove this prophecy.

Capcom created in Dragon’s Dogma: Dark Arisen an adventure with the heart of Dark Souls but the size of something much more expansive. Creating a character and exploring this large, beautiful world full of dangerous beasts is nothing short of a spectacular experience, as was true for the original PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 release. It is now two years later, and the dragons are stretching their wings on PC. For some, that may seem like a very late arrival, but luckily, the PC version does enough to warrant its existence and then some.

First and foremost is upgrades to visual fidelity and performance. Dragon’s Dogma: Dark Arisen was always a pretty game, but the shift from last gen to PC has definitely delivered a welcomed facelift. A full range of options are available to your particular rig, including 4K support and up to 150 frames per second (talk about silky smooth). Along with these options comes support for the 360, Xbox One, Steam and DualShock 4 controllers as well as Steam amenities like Trading Cards, Big Picture, Cloud save, and Achievements.

Adding to the package is the removal of microtransactions, meaning every bit of DLC including retail specific content will be available day one. No gimmicks, no wondering if you got everything, no questioning if you pre-ordered with the right store – everything is in there.

What you essentially have here is a definitive edition of one seriously amazing action RPG. Dragon’s Dogma: Dark Arisen manages to live in the same vein as the Souls, sporting the darkness and challenges so many players have come to desire, yet forges an identity all its own. Dragon’s Dogma: Dark Arisen doesn’t adhere to a formula, it creates a sweeping experience, one whose strengths you won’t find elsewhere. The title’s move to PC, even three years in age, has made that fact shine once again.

The main game is solid, the class system is one of the best out there allowing you to swap your class whenever you feel like it, there are 9 classes total, 3 basic, 3 advanced and 3 hybrid and all of them fun and viable even if some more broken then others.

And while it was the gameplay that kept me hooked the story is there too even if implemented slightly unorthodoxly. Some berserk influences on the story are visible with all being centred around causality even if the presentation is not as brutal as berserk.  The game is open world even if it's not the biggest nor most varied in environments out there. Graphics are slightly dated by today's standards especially in regards to some textures but the enemies still look great!

But let me get to the main reason which made me come back to the game time and time again and that is the almost infinite replayability of the DLC. The DLC has it's own story, location and monsters too. It is a downward spiralling dungeon and while some environments are reused it never feels the same. The dungeon is self contained it gives you heals, gear and npc's needed for pretty much any transaction you need. The best gear in the game can be found in here.

My favourite way to play this game was to jump right in to the DLC dungeon after the hydra encounter at like lvl 5 solo no pawns and just get through it on my own. The dungeon gives you everything you need so this is totally doable even if difficult in the beginning. Pretty soon this became the only way i played this game and I devised my own strategy on how to get through the dungeon and it almost never gets old.

Even if I stayed for the DLC the main game deserves at least one playthrough the game is just too fun to play. With that said if you like RPG's with great battle systems, monster hunter like loot and enemies, unique story and some memes you just can't go wrong here, it's a masterpiece in my opinion.",1688733952,1688733952,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I think the open world nature of the main game is quite weak, big & empty, almost zero variety in encounters (You backtrack through a place 8 times, It'll be the same bandits in the same spot every time)... That said 5 bux on sale is worth the DLC alone, main game is definitely fun a few times through though - This drags the overal score down a bit but this is a definite must play for third person action gamers + mostly stat&gear-based &  RPG progression enjoyers.",1688729526,1688729526,True,1,0,0.494061738252639771,0,True,False,False

It's a thrilling journey that combines the best elements of classic and contemporary gaming, resulting in an experience that is both nostalgic and refreshingly innovative.

From the moment you step into the vast, beautifully rendered world of Gransys, you're immersed in a richly detailed environment that feels alive and dynamic. The game's open-world design encourages exploration and rewards curiosity, with hidden treasures and challenging foes lurking around every corner.

The combat system is a standout feature, offering a depth and complexity that is rarely seen in modern games. Each of the nine vocations has a unique playstyle, and the ability to switch between them adds a layer of strategic depth. The battles are intense and require tactical thinking, especially when facing the game's formidable bosses. The inclusion of the Pawn system, where you can recruit AI companions and share them online, adds another layer of strategy and community engagement.

The story, while not groundbreaking, is engaging and filled with memorable characters. The quests are varied and often present moral dilemmas that can affect the game's world and its inhabitants. The Dark Arisen expansion adds even more content, with a new island to explore, new enemies to defeat, and new equipment to discover.

But perhaps the most impressive aspect of Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen is how it captures the spirit of classic gaming. It's a game that isn't afraid to challenge its players, to make them earn their victories. It's a game that values exploration and discovery over hand-holding. It's a game that respects its players and their intelligence. In an era where many games are streamlined and simplified, Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen is a breath of fresh air.

In conclusion, Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen is a must-play for any fan of action RPGs. It's a game that is challenging, rewarding, and above all, fun. It's a testament to what video games can be when they're made with passion, creativity, and respect for the player.

Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen is a fantasy RPG developed by Capcom studio, known for the Resident Evil and Monster Hunter series. As I write this review, the sequel has been announced. I haven't completed the game 100%, but I believe I have enough information to give a solid perspective.
[h1]The Plot[/h1]
If I had to compare this game to anything, it would be a pretty old movie; Dragonheart. It's not a copy-paste, but I think the developers took most of their inspiration from that specific movie. The overall idea of the plot is that while fighting a dragon that attacked our village, we get marked by the beast, thus becoming a typical chosen one with a great destiny, and that's pretty much it. The game is very open-ended with very little story focus, so we can do anything, and the main quests aren't that different from the side quests. This is a positive thing, because we can approach the story however we want, and also by making some story decisions that the game allows us to make (mostly at the end). A nice detail was also that completed side quests can affect the main quests. I remember that during one major mission, a random NPC from the city just came to my aid in exchange for help in the past. However, there's also a downside to this kind of storytelling. We can't get attached to any character because they're just not important in the eyes of the game, which doesn't give them time and dialogue to develop. Unmarked main quests are another problem that makes us inadvertently skip content in other chapters of the game, and since they don't stand out much, each mission is typical and boring; ""go there, kill it, take it, come back here."" The openness of the story also leaves us with no explanation for what's going on, so while most of the game I more or less knew what was going on, the ending comes with a sudden spill information, which made me feel like I was on some strong hallucinogens. It also doesn't help that our protagonist is mute, so you can't hear him at all, and coupled with the fact that we can't even choose dialogue options, we can't ask the simplest questions to clarify the situation (even much older games had this mechanic). It's a terrible way to tell a story that makes sense, but the openness this game provides is very refreshing.
[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Perhaps the most commendable mechanic is the combat system, which is really fluid, and with the plethora of weapons, armor, and classes, so you can replay the game multiple times and experience something new every time. The design of the monsters is amazing, the smaller ones are typical fantasy monsters, but the bigger ones carry an original look and mechanics, which allows us to use their weaknesses, e.g. by climbing on them and attacking weak points. Perhaps the biggest problem with all this, is that climbing is very clumsy, our hero often gets stuck, and the camera is a bigger enemy than the monsters, so we can't see what we're doing in most cases. The locations are mostly original and well designed. But the most important mechanic of this game is the recruitment system of pawns, i.e. people who are completely dependent on us. If anyone has played Middle Earth: Shadow of War, it's just the Nemesis system, only in a much more stripped-down version, where our characters have virtually no characterization or ability to interact with us (we can recruit three of them to our team). Even the game itself doesn't want us to get attached to them, because giving them equipment is pointless and they are trapped with the same level and skills, so in the end we just have to replace them and since they can look pretty stupid and their voices are sometimes very strange, it is tiring to select the right pawn. However, this does not apply to our original pawn, which we can create ourselves, in the same character creator as at the beginning of the game (which, by the way, is very solid and extensive, giving us a lot of options and information about the character). Before I move on to the next section though, I have to criticize the way we navigate the world, and while the map itself is really well done, we have limited fast travel options and our stamina is so limited that traveling is long and tiring, and the fact that enemies after some time just respawn, also does not help to improve the situation.
[h1]Technical Matters[/h1]
I have mixed feelings about the graphics. On the one hand, half of the textures and effects look surprisingly good, and it's all great to watch, but on the other hand, the other half of the textures are of such poor quality that they look like smudged shit on a rainy day. Although it annoys me a bit, the game runs very smoothly and stabely, and in the end, that's the most important thing. As for the voice actors, they did enough work, but they didn't get much to do. However, if we are talking about technicalities, great music makes the game much more fun. I will tell you about one more thing, which in theory can be included in Gameplay. What I mean, is that the UI is ridiculously awful. The buttons often don't work, and there is no such thing as hotkeys in this game, so we have to select everything manually, preferably going to the main menu. Probably the biggest problem here is the inventory window. Some genius figured out that he would divide the inventory into two separate panels, which differ only in that they look slightly different, and only one of them allows us to use armor and weapons. I really don't understand why you decided to make your life harder, by splitting one system into two identical parts.
[h1]Summary[/h1]
A really intriguing game with very refreshing gameplay, and not too crazy storyline. Despite its minor problems, DD:DA in its simplicity is a wildly addictive game, which can be a dream come true for fantasy fans, and probably even more so for D&D fanatics.

PLEASE give it a chance, and kick the ox Arisen! 

The real fun of the game comes in post game, and in DLC content of Bitter Black Ilse. The spells are fun and grand, the combat has so many cool mechanics, the fun pawn system, the armour is so fun to play around with to customize your look, and every class has something unique and fun to add to the game. The replayablity is endless and beyond fun. I can not suggest this game enough.

I just got all the achievements after 180 hours and here is my review of:

[h1]Dragon’s Dogma: Dark Arisen [/h1]

Pros
Combat - Probably one of the best combat systems in games. Your actions are very fluid and different vocations have different ways of approaching combat. You can be stealthy with dodges as a ranged class, practice i-frames and blocking as a melee class, or levitate out of battle as a magic class. I will commend how spells are done in this game as you really feel their power and scale(summoning tornadoes, and meteors that kind of scale). There a lots of anime-ish, flashy looking attacks as a non-magic class. You can climb large enemies and pinpoint their weakness which I feel is a huge innovation in combat. I know Capcom also implemented climbing in newer Monster Hunter games but the climbing here feels more gritty.
Pawn System - You get to make another character to tag along your adventures(although you can dismiss them). The pawn AI gets better as you progress. Also there are alot you can research about pawn optimization if you're interested. There are lots of memes about how dumb they are sometimes but that's just part of their charm to me. Aside from that, pawns can be summoned by other players[spoiler]  as the game lore has multiverses.[/spoiler] Other players can gift items and rank your pawns when they send them back to you. Pawn sharing is my favorite feature of this game. It's rewarding when your pawn returns with lots of stuff and positive reviews :) My pawn personally feels like a starting pokemon, were I feel like I should train them to be the best.
Community - The Dragon's Dogma community is very friendly and you can often request items from them. Lot's of vets are kind towards new players and will teach you what you ask. You may think that for a decade old game the community would be gone but shout out to Karathrax for keeping the community together :)
Art Direction - Dragons Dogma has this beautiful realism to it's world. It has a small game world but I love how cohesive the locations look. The settlements in particular are the one of the most detailed in games. The main town is a realistic looking castle made of multiple districts. The castle defenses, markets, farm fields all look realistic and practical. The starting town is also a thing of beauty - a seaside settlement that looks like a tourist destination. You also got lots of forts, encampments, and ruins. I only wish there were more large settlements. The monsters in this game take influence from traditional fantasy and are designed generically however, their designs are absolutely gorgeous and proves that you don't need to be unique to stand out. This game is also heavily influenced by the Berserk manga and you will see a similar vibe when playing this game. There is a character inspired by Casca which is a big plus.
Character Customization - Again, one of the best in gaming specially considering the age of this game. You can be very specific with your height, weight, body proportions, and face of course. This is the only game were I made a character that looks like me with the same height and weight as me.
Weapon and Armor Design - There are a wide variety of weapons and armor designs ranging from realistic to fantastic. You can tell that the team studied historical armor designs with how realistic some pieces look. There are also skimpy bikini armors, demonic looking armor, and idk, all kinds of different looks. Fashion's Dogma is the real end game.
Day and Night cycle - The game's night is truly dark and lanterns are pretty mandatory if you want to explore during nights and inside dungeons. Enemies will differ also depending on the time. Night time typically has harder enemies with undead and necromancers. Add that to the darkness and you have pretty intense encounters.
Replayability - The game is insanely replayable as it encourages players to have multiple playthroughs. Replayability is mainly influenced by item grinding but it is actually fun because the combat is fun :)
Difficulty Curve - It's very rewarding when you level up and get better gear in this game. Some areas are inaccessible because of how strong enemies are. Running away from enemies is a valid choice and the game does tell you about this. You can however comeback to areas when your strong enough and feel like an absolute beast as there is no level scaling in this game. You can be overpowered and still find it difficult to deal with certain encounters. There are some ridiculous encounters the game throws at you but it's ok because you also can be ridiculously broken with proper planning.
Post Game - Post game is were the real game starts, particularly the DLC. It really takes the pros of the game(combat) and plays it to its advantage. You can easily add multiple hours doing post game content here. You will need to really grind out your equipment to face the stronger foes, but as I have previously said, grinding is fun here because of the combat. Most of the cons which I will talk about next is also fixed in the DLC. Most of my playtime is actually spent during post game.

Cons
Unfinished - This is a game that really suffered from budget cuts. Some parts of the map are not explored if you only stick with the main quests. There are dungeons with reused assets(although there are lore reasons why),and the story was severely watered down. Most of the cons will actually be about these issues.
Story - The story is short and not as cohesive as one would hope for. Characters severely suffer from cut stories that didn't make it to the game. Some character motives don't make sense because it feels rushed. There are parts were character decisions don’t make sense. Lots of the parts of the story will only be understood when you finish additional questlines. Not a lot of strong characters in this game. As previously stated most suffered from budget cuts.
Small Map - The map is small and a large portion of the world map is unused which gives the theory that there are areas that didn't make it to the game. As beautiful as Gransys is, one would wish for a larger area with more varying enemies.
Few random encounters - Speaking of varying enemies, the enemies in the main game will be the same throughout your playthrough. They spiced up the DLC and added different groups depending on RNG.
Quality of Life - I feel like this will be the biggest deal breaker of this game. It truly is horrendous how some feature in this game is implemented. Some maybe a product of its time though. There is only one save file and you gotta backup the save files yourself if you want to be careful. And you do have to be careful as some quests will fail or automatically lock you out if you progress through the main story main story if you are unaware of said quests. I had to restart around 15 hours of gameplay because I skipped a quest that is a quest chain to multiple other quest chains. Skills/equipment etc. have vague descriptions and you gotta go to the wiki to understand what they do. Some descriptions are also straight up wrong. It's hard to identify certain enemy weaknesses and your pawns will continuously tell you about some weaknesses but will not comment on other creatures. If you are not active in the community or read the wiki, expect alot of unpleasant surprises.
Romance system - Your romantic interest will play a role in the story however, the game is very wonky when selecting who your love interest will be. It is a common occurrence were your love interest will not be the one you want even if you feel like you have secured them.
Menu - Cycling through your inventory, equipment, skills could have been optimized and arranged better.

Some very broken mechanics in the game tho: rezzing teammates had no downsides/diminishing returns and it was instant, like what. You could literally cheese any fight that was too hard thanks to that.
Weren't really any cool builds you could do, it was just simple spells/skills that didn't have much synergy.
Enemies were bland and the entire game was a total cake walk, even on hardmode or w/e it's called.
Wasn't any real reason to explore because you just get all your items from the town hub, and there werent' any really good legendary items to hunt down.

Yeni oluşturulan karakter ekranı ve detayları güzel. Combat mekaniklerini beğendim. Ne soulslike gibi ne hack and slash gibi. Kendine özgü bir havası var.

Gameplay olarak her RPG oyununda olduğu gibi ilk başta questleri yaparken kayboluyorsunuz. Yönlendirmeler biraz zayıf. Zayıftan ziyade takip etmeniz ve biraz kafa çalıştırmanız gerekiyor. Bazı questler çok sinir bozucu. (Side questlerin bazıları)

On a more serious note, I find it to be a pretty good game. Its main gameplay loop is pretty addictive, as I've played nearly 35 hours within two weeks. The game does have a fair bit of jank related to the menus' UI and weird K&M controls due to its age and the game being a console port, but it could've been worse.

The game has a few interesting mechanics, such as the pawn system. They are followers that each have their own appearance, personality, battle tactics, and classes/stats. One pawn is your main pawn that you create yourself, and gains XP just like your main character does. The two other pawns are recruited pawns, which are actually pawns created by other players which get synced to the server each time the player sleeps in an inn. You can recruit them for free if they are your friend's pawn, or if their level is equal to or lower than your character's. If they have a higher level than you, you have to pay with a special currency and you'll have to pay exponentially more for each additional level. These secondary pawns do not gain XP, and you cannot change their skillset. When you replace a pawn with another one, you can thank the player that sent them by rating the pawn and giving them an item of your choice. The player will also gain some of that alternative currency that I was talking about.
Your pawns can be talkative (you can change your main pawn's talking frequency) and when all of them are very talkative it can become pretty annoying. The voice lines kind of lack in diversity, so it can get old quick.

Combat is this game is relatively fast-paced, but simple. You have 1 or 2 weapons depending on your class, and each hand can have 3 spells/skills for a total of 6 spells (except for some 2 handed weapons which have 3 spells period). Melee weapons have a light attack which is a combo when repeated, and a heavy attack. You can't really chain light and heavy attacks together, which is a shame, but I found that using your light attacks with varying delays can lead to alternative combos. Everything is stamina based, so sprinting and skills/spells chew up the same stamina bar. If you empty completely the stamina bar, you end up out of breath and cannot do anything for about 8 seconds.

You can also grab smaller enemies to make them defenseless and let your pawns attack them (your pawns can also do this depending on their class and personality). You can also climb up large enemies to hit a weak spot, which looks really cool but it eats up a ton of stamina.

The game's story isn't amazing or anything, but it gets the job done. There are actual cutscenes which are pretty well animated, and there are generic ones that have very robotic motion. Your character is silent, so you'll never hear them talk apart from a few grunts and such. The story has multiple endings, and I've only reached one as of writing this review, so I don't know all the ins and outs of the game yet.
The game doesn't tell you where you can find quests, which can be annoying for some, especially since some optional quests change the outcome of the story. A guide might be necessary to reach certain endings.

The game is very New Game + oriented. When you finish a playthough, it is [i]really finished[/i] and you cannot come back to that save file. You have to start a new game, and all of your stats, classes, skills, items, etc. get transferred to the new save file.

There are several endgame mechanics, such as a sort of infinite dungeon thing where you can fight against really powerful bosses and drop lots of endgame materials and items. There is also the Dark Arisen DLC part, which can be accessed early on in the game, but is much too difficult to tackle at that time. It is target towards NG+ characters. I haven't played much of it yet so I can't really give a very in-depth opinion of that part, but what I've seen until now seemed interesting. You have a really large dungeon with preset rooms but with seemingly randomized loot and enemies, and you can drop cursed equipment which have unknown stats until you identify them with a special currency (the same one you use to recruit pawns). There are missions and a story related to this dungeon, but I've only played the first mission so I can't say too much about that yet.

At the graphics level it's a 2012 game, so by 2023 standards it's not amazing but it does the job done. It looks good enough for me.

In my 60 hours of playtime I had a pretty high number of random crashes though, and it seems to be related to playing at the game's maximum allowed framerate, which is 150 FPS. Since the game auto-saves pretty rarely (each time you enter a new zone) I often lost some progress when it happened.
I also had one of the ending cutscenes consistently crash because of the framerate. Once I enabled the in-game framerate limiter to 60 FPS, it worked like a charm. Some enemies seem to have jittery animation (such as golems and sometimes skeletons), but I'm not sure if this is caused by the high framerate as well.

There is also one thing that really annoyed me. Skill descriptions will only display what their latest upgrade does. For example, if you have a skill called ""Dash"", its description at level 1 will read ""You dash towards an enemy and strike them"". But if you upgrade it to level 2, its description will become ""The range and speed of the dash is increased"", and it becomes impossible to know what the skill originally does. It's really annoying when trying to recruit pawns that have spells that you don't know the use of.

This won't concerning english players, but when I played through the game in French, I've found that the localization quality is pretty meh. I found several typos and subtitles sometimes really dumb down what the characters are saying, so it kinda loses its flavor.

I would've really liked if they added an online co-op mode. You could make it so that the second player plays into the first player's save file as the main pawn or something.

All in all, I really recommend this game, I had a great time with it if you can look past its older console game jank. I'm really excited for Dragon's Dogma 2! Too bad it's also solo-only (as of now).",1688482204,1688483878,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Here's a quick review

PROS:
- You can change classes whenever you want and there are multiple choices to choose from.
- Classes are not gender locked.
- Customizable look for your avatar.
- Open-world game, you can ignore the main quest and do other sh*t,
- You can play with friend's avatar if they have the game too.
- You can change weapons once advancing to better classes.
- Equipped items have their own visuals, unlike other that stays with the generic look.
- Random loots
- Lots of quests and contents


CONS:
- U.I Is quite old
- There are no Hotkeys for Maps, Equipment, and Quest.
- The only save slots only are the ones from resting from an Inn (Checkpoint) and one slot for Autosaves/Manual Save. 
- There are only two default teleportation points (You can unlock portable waypoints later in game)
- Some quests are confusing.


Overall i'd give it about a 7.8/10

This is a review so no spoilers just pointers.

As of making this review the game is currently 5 USD... For that you can't go wrong so give it a shot.

Let me now explain why and give some history here of my experiences with Dragons Dogma.

Started playing this game over ten years ago back when it was released on the Xbox 360. Fell in love with it. With out explaining much, it takes Dark Souls and mashes it with Monster Hunter. On 360 I have endless hours on this game with a perfect achievement score. 

Fast forward few years. Picked the game up on Xbox One and now steam, working on currently 100% the game all around. In short the game has a lot of replay value. Part of the core game is based on replaying the story. Now it might sound like a job but I promise it isn't and is worth it. 

Dragons Dogma I will say is somewhat dated in the graphics department but that's expected. It's an older game but it's a game worth experiencing. 

With the announcement of Dragons Dogma 2, I very highly recommend people checking this out.

As I stated above, Dark Souls + Monster Hunter. Early game is very *don't get it, dodge and duck, run* because the enemies hit hard and some make you think on how you want to proceed. The game teaches you to save often and do gear checks. Base game will start off hard but gets easier and for those who want a challenge the Dark Arisen DLC area will indeed be that challenge.",1688473201,1688473201,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Dragon's Dogma is a boring game filled with cool things.

I realize this sounds a bit contradictory, so let me take a moment to talk about the three coolest things in the game:

[b]1) Skill/Class system[/b]

You start by being able to choose one of three classes, the traditional Fighter/Rogue/Mage choice. Each class has 9 ranks, and gaining ranks lets you learn various skills for your different weapon types. It also unlocks the advanced class for each of the three, Warrior/Ranger/Sorcerer. And once you've mastered those, you unlock three combo classes each combining two of the three archetypes. You don't lose any ranks in your classes when you switch away, and some of the skills you learn can be kept on other classes. It's a little like Final Fantasy V's job system, albeit not as cool, but still quite nice. You get to constantly change classes, and also change the classes of your main Pawn.

[b]2) Pawns[/b]

Probably the only truly unique cool thing in the game, the Pawn system is an interesting system more games might consider. Basically, you have your main character, and your main sidekick (called a Pawn, just to drive it home), and you can choose their classes and gear them out as usual. But for the other two slots in your party, you get to summon other Pawns. And the cool thing is, they are just all the main Pawns of other players of the game. You automatically have access to Pawns of your friends, otherwise you just choose from Pawns that are around the same level as you. Unlike your main character and your main Pawn, these Pawns from other players never level up, so once you outlevel them, you send them on their way (with a gift and a note for the owner, optionally), and then recruit two new Pawns. It's neat! It's different! I liked it!

[b]3) Climbing on Epic Minibosses[/b]

Even the miniboss fights in this game can be massive enemies many times the size of your characters. So rather than just whacking them in the toe, you can jump onto them and climb up them to strike at various points. This is a lot of fun and makes combat feel more epic. I climbed a cyclops's arm and attacked it to make him drop his club! I climbed the ogre's back to knock off his helmet! The ogre jumped backwards into a wall and killed me while I was on his back! This was all exciting, as you can tell from the copious exclamation points.

...

All good stuff. Unfortunately, it's lost amidst a soup of who cares. The characters are pretty much all uninteresting, with the exception of the dragon. The one or two other interesting characters have one or two tiny scriptscenes and then never go anywhere. Nothing really goes anywhere, because the story is also mostly uninteresting. You trudge across the open world landscape slaying some wolves and bandits on your way to clear the undead out of the quarry passage, or stop the evil cult hiding in the catacombs, or visit the witch in the foggy forest, but it all feels exceedingly humdrum. While the final battle against the dragon is suitably epic, you beat it and then it's more who cares; the game just whisks you into the postgame DLC.

Arguably, this would have been a place for the game to shine; it's bad at story and characters anyway, so screw all of that, just run players through a giant dungeon having them do combat. But there's no real reason for it, and I found my motivation lacking. (And it didn't help that my weapons barely damaged the big bosses, which the Internet suggests means I'd need to grind dozens of levels to fix.)

I hear there's a sequel coming out, and I hope the sequel takes those three cool ideas mentioned above, and puts them into a well-written game with a compelling story and interesting, fleshed-out characters. That would be a great game.

1. Combat: the combat is just so bland, if you play a melee class you have to rely on your completely braindead NPC party to help with any ranged attacks and abilities. 
2. Traveling: traveling through the world is so dry, boring, and drawn out due to the lack of any mounts. Yes, there’s SOME “fast traveling” but the fast traveling system is so garbage it’s almost non existent.

And I definitely saw what everyone was on about, but - oh boy - this is kind of a bad video game.

It has a lot of ideas that still to this day are incredibly unique when it comes to the genre:
-mantling and ledge grabbing in world traversal, you can actually find really useful stuff by climbing everything you see
-scaling enemies to stick your knife into them as a central combat mechanic
-magic is essentially a weapon of mass destruction, very cast times but devastating effects for both enemies and allies
-high focus on party synergy

There are a lot of other large or small ideas this game has that I'm kinda bummed did not catch on in the years after this game released.

And now comes the very large BUT, unfortunately the vast majority of just about everything in this game is so badly executed that I just can't recommend this to anyone. Even giving this game a lot of slack since it's so old and it's a bit unfair to judge solely on modern standards of the genre, this still is an atrocious experience. Major annoyances include:

-Atrocious gearing system; item progression is essentially nonexistent, I played through the entire game without finding any accessories that were useful for example, all armor and weapons are just boring stat upgrades which you buy from vendors
-I played Sorcerer, which was probably the worst mistake you can make on your first playthrough of this game, the positive I described concerning  the magic system starts being really f******* unfunny once enemies start appearing that are flat out immune to magic or have very short damage windows to incapacitate them and the shortest spell you have is a 5 seconds fireball or something or enemies just keep knocking you on your ass 24/7 since essentially all magic is offensive in this game and you depend purely on your NPCs for protection
-The fact that about as many people have the steam achievement for opening Madeleine's shop as they have the one for killing the final boss (which not a lot have, since this game has a comparatively low completion rate) tells you how awful the side quest clarity is in this game. For the record, Madeleine is literally the first side quest chain in this game and you can open her shop after after only a few hours. I'm not going into too much detail here since it would take an entire essay to talk about the side quest system, but it is horrendous
-The game's technical and mechanical state has to be seen to be believed, the port is a complete dumpster fire. borderless window mode does not exist, tabbing out of fullscreen mode regularly crashes the game, the game is unplayable on default KB&M button mapping, the auto targeting system keeps targeting random rats behind you while a dozen zombies are sticking their knives into your ass, the save sytem is an april fools joke, etc...
-The story manages to be both nonexistent and stupid at the same time, you could cut the middle 80% of the main quest and would not lose anything of value
-The final quest of the game is, I kid you not, ""grind the same mobs you've been killing for the last 30 hours until you have enough stones so I will open a portal to the final cutscene""; we are not talking about 10 minutes of grinding here guys
-You depend so much on your NPC allies and this game has legit the worst AI I have ever seen in a game, unless you google for hours how to correctly set up your party and pawns, they are going to be a complete liability by the time you reach endgame; don't even get me started on the AI of the numerous escort quest NPCs
-The fast travel system is an actual insult to the player

I could go on for hours about dozens of other aspects how this game is hopelessly compromised in almost every way (which shouldn't be surprised since according to the devs it is very unfinished compared to what their original vision was), but I think you can get the point by now.

Funnily enough, despite this game being so atrocious, I'm following the sequel all the more, since the ideas certainly are all there, the execution was just way too bad to really enjoy this.

Would not recommend this game, the controls are terrible, and the combat is terrible.

To start I was on Hard mode, as I do most games for somewhat of a challenge, and let me tell you this was hard.
Not in a fun away.
Expect to get one shot on hard mode, with no way to utilize years of gaming skills to dodge them between casts or anything. It's a simple run away and don't get hit.

Even after dropping to normal difficulty the combat sucks ass as its stand and swing/cast, run away, swing/cast. The combat system is not unique, at least 3 hours into the game, where it should be hooking you in.

The inventory UI is a nightmare. The quest UI is a nightmare. The save time takes forever, so if you're someone who saves frequently like I do, expect to waste a lot of time going through are you sure, are you sure, yes, yes, yes, saving.........   SAVED. esc, esc, esc. Back to the game.

I had read a lot of hype on this game for years so I was stoked when I finally got around to try it. But simply it is not good. I like a good challenge like Souls games or Outward even. 

This game is a challenge like wiping your ass with sandpaper instead of TP.

I'm playing the game and enjoying it nonetheless. However, even though this game has a better atmosphere and distinct qualities of its own; It has a few major flaws, ordered by worst to bad:
1- The loot. Vast world, tons of boxes/barrels, however the distinct amount of things dropping from those are very sparse. In general, I found dungeon loots also very disappointing, I really wished there was a loot mod alike skyrim's armor/weapon sets. If it is available and I somehow missed it, please don't hesitate to throw a reply.
2- Think of a comedy show; one of the qualities that makes a good comedian is determined by the density of their quality jokes.  You can listen a comedian and get a joke or two to make you smile in a whole minute, or you watch another one keeping you out of breath every 10 seconds. Skyrim is the latter example, DD is the prior one. The world is full of spawned creatures, etc, yet it feels ""empty"". Killing them doesn't leave a satisfactory feeling. They can be tough at times, but they're only for grinding. All of those creatures are there to fill the enormous gap between a few dungeons of this HUGE world.
3- Travel system: SUCKS. There is a stone and a paired portal stone. If the stone is used in the inventory, it portals you to capital. If portal stone is put somewhere int he map, the stone, this time, portals you to the location of the portal stone where you put it. So, you can only portal to one distinct location at a time.
4- Map: The map is huge, because player is forced to ""walk"" it. I haven't encountered any vehicles/tamed animals to transport me so far, so I assume this is the way. You have to walk everywhere. The lack of fast travel in this game is actually by design mechanic. You walk, so the pawns (other npcs in your party) can learn the world. So, by design, the game is boring in this regard. Exploration would be fun only if they put more ""lively"" content in it, not only dull mobs all over the place.
5- Why limitations?: 6 skills/spells is actually limiting the fun factor. Devs implemented a system for giving player a lot of spell/skill choices, but only allow player to use a few of them.
6- Long term player-base availability is not well thought. This is an offline game with online perks. However, the more game ages, the lesser active players, therefore the pawns system becomes weaker. The remedy: Let the pawns level in offline mode. (Or let players have 3 pawns as main pawns instead of one). I think this would make the game very enjoying.

Overall, I am trying to enjoy the game, paying attention to my main pawn and trying to enjoy environment. But this is the 150th time that same rock rolls towards me in the same road by the same bandit mob I killed 150th time. Maybe there are mods that remedy these figures I listed, but if we speak about vanilla, then it is a little bit repetitive because of its mechanics.",1688245177,1688245378,False,2,0,0.496107518672943115,0,True,False,False

Main Points:
- Looks Beautiful
- Engaging story (once you actually get into the game)
- The best combat I have experienced in any RPG
- Multiple character classes
- THE BEST magic effects I have ever seen
- Surprisingly detailed Pawn AI (look into it and you'll see what i mean)
- Lots of equipment and gear to find/buy to upgrade character
- Character creation actually impacts your stats
- Lots of side quests and quite long main questline
- Battles with larger creatures are epic
- You can climb on the larger enemies
- You actually have a party of people (makes game feel a lot less lonely)

TLDR DDDA is a cool, kind of merciless game with intense combat and all kinds of dangerous environments. Might be infuriating at start but personally I find it a lot of fun. Open World exploration too. There is a lot to do but if you know what you are doing and intentionally aim for it, the main story is actually pretty short. New Game+ makes the game almost infinitely replayable as you keep your character progression and items and reset the story and your choices. Game also comes with Hard Mode with faster leveling and a Speedrun mode, which gives you a clock to track your speedrun attempt.

This game has cool combat systems, small and massive monsters, interesting story and lots of cool and nasty mechanics to make darkness actually scary and turn water into a death trap. there are 3 starter classes for Sword/Shield, Daggers/Bow and ranged Magic/support and 6 advanced classes for 2H melee, daggers/longbow, advanced magic and their combinations for Assassin which wields all the starter weapons (except staff), Mystic Knight that combines heaviest defence with magical enchantments wielding Magick Shield and Mace and the Magick Archer which wield daggers and a Magick Bow for archery type spells. The classes allow many types of gameplay and certain classes are very bad at handling certain situations, like Fighter is almost unable to handle flying monsters. Assassin is indeed my favourite class, both because of the widest variety of weapons, gaining skills and abilities from both Fighter and Strider and having the highest Strength growth. Mages and Sorcerers are the type that can charge up and obliterate the battlefield or provide cool buffs and heals, but healing items are also abundant in both stores and in the wild. There is a limited amount of skill and passive slots however, so you have to decide which ones are worth the skill slot. Most classes have 3 slots for melee and 3 slots for a sub, for example the Fighter has Sword weapon skills and Shield skills, Strider has Dagger and Bow skills. The passives are interchangable between all classes, making leveling all classes a good idea on some level. Core weapon skills are tied to weapons and can be accessed by all classes using them, for example any class wielding Daggers can use the Dagger skill to Evade. Mages use all 6 slots for the variety of spells available.

There is a cool system of combining items, creating new healing items, buff items, usable tools and items like bombs and special arrows. Some sidequests specifically require items that can only be combined. Speaking of sidequests, this game has an amount of main quests, sidequests, item fetch quests and a number of mostly optional escort missions which are used to make friends with NPCs. Expect something fun at the end if you get close with one. 

The game has a fun mechanic of creating a party out of generic class NPCs and they come with their own items and skills, but there are a massive amount of them and you can find a Pawn of your liking if you search enough, especially in online mode where other player's main Pawns become available party members. Your main Pawn is a completely customizable secondary character and you can switch their class, equipment and abilities at will. Pawns dont get access to the combo classes however. You will have your Main Pawn the entire game with you and you can collect 2 additional pawns for a party of 4 from the Rifts in certain locations in the game or by finding them on the roads. The game has a selection of ""offline pawns"" but the online pawns created by other players are usually stronger, be it better skill selection or better equipment.

Combat slightly reminds me of Monster Hunter, except you have kind of limited options. If you attack, you cant move or evade or block if you dont use an attack that has movement as a potion of it or have an evasion skill or a shield equipped. Large monsters can and should be grabbed and climbed to reach all of their weak spots and sometimes to weaken them by breaking the section, be it a Chimera's snake tail or a Cyclops's eye. 

Some potential quest decisions are more hidden or obscure than others. Because each class has it's own level up stats and these stats are permanent, the worst mistake you can do for a save file is leveling up too much in the ""wrong class"" or even worse, as a Mage past Lv10. For some reason Mage has the worst level ups. There are also events, quests and characters you can completely miss if you play the main story too fast, the NG+ helps with that, because you start the game over as if nothing happened, keeping your character progression and all items. Character size and weight do have a gameplay effect. Heavier character have larger inventory weight limit while small character can fit places normally inaccessible, but those situations are always avoidable and few. IIRC taller characters are also faster by virtue of long legs. Some equipment is gender specific.

The expansion Dark Arisen added into the game the Bitterblack Isle which not only has the most difficult monsters, also contains the most powerful items and special class specific gear. IIRC The Dark Arisen content is completely isolated onto that island apart from some quality of life improvements in the main game. Btw the only teleport locations in the game are the Isle, the main city and the starting village, and the rest can and will be manually installed by you, the player, wherever you want on the open world, using an item. Dungeons, caves, underground locations and the forest are not considered parts of the open world. You can technically collect unlimited of these teleport point items via NG+, but you can place a limited amount.",1688218931,1688218931,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

My feedback:
- whoever tries to sell you this as some kind of Dark Souls like gameplay is either stupid or deceiving you. I have no idea how someone can come to this conclusion
- only unique gameplay is ""climbing big monsters"". The game downright has all the ugly warts that ""mid 2000s rpg"" have: Every little crap item has a weight, you go slower if youre ""medium weight, heavy weight"" etc, the amount of different items that all do a slightly different thing is overwhelming (feels like 200 or so different herbs, etc).
- You cannot control your pawns. They are downright stupid. You give one a holy weapon enchantment and them casting it is totally up to chance even if you currently fight enemies totally immune to physical damage and order them to ""help me"" (one of the only 3 commands you can give them, the other are ""come"" and ""go""). 
- Dont play fighter or warrior. Someone at Capcom has a hate boner for plated melee classes. There are a lot of flying/floating enemies and even if your enemy is not; sometimes they toppel over but their weakspot you want to hit ist still above standing height for you. So you  jump around like a mentally limited rabbit and try to hit whatever littel weakpoint you can find while the enemy floats 20m above you and you must hope your pawns shoot it down at random.
- The dark arisen content tries so hard to be ""difficult content"", but only achieves it by spamming enemies with stun locks, stagger, and aoe.

I remember playing the original back when it released on PS3 almost a decade ago and it's dark arisen edition. This version brings back that nostalgia, save the fact the berserk crossover equipment was removed due to license issues, otherwise most of the experience is there. One I can gladly recommend.

The game's renown for it's pawn system alongside it's character creation, portions of your character's and pawns limbs affect their carrying weight, movement speed, stamina consumption, reach, and generally their weight. All accompanied by the Vocations (Classes), which fall under the Warrior, Rogue and Mage Archetypes of other RPGs along with hybrid versions that cross lines in between such as being a Knight carrying a Staff and Shield. There are decent bit of playstyles and party synergies to play around with. Pawns are your companions, who can be useful allies once they learn your playstyle and go about it with their class, though they have moments where they can be derpy such as hitting a explosive barrel alongside crates to get loot. Yet, they can be smart at fighting some monsters and execute tactics rather well with right abilities and equipment. 

Combat is quite fun with all the vocations, mages have Wide area and support spells, rogue types have bows that can precisely hit weakpoints, Warrior types can take the punishment and deliver it, too.

The one downside to Dragon's dogma is it takes awhile to travel the map as it's pretty big and there are few ways of fast travel, Dark arisen fortunately remedy this with items you can get early on, saving time on trips that can span hours and putting more into slaying monsters.

My time is actually about 30 or so hours higher because I created an alt account so I could play around with and have a decent, always-available Sorcerer pawn that I had control over the skills of at one point. I've heard other people complain about CTDs and save corruption but I've only ever had five or so total and never had a corrupted save. Maybe it's a hardware/driver thing? Not sure, but the game frequently goes on sale for about $5. Still very much worth it at $30. I originally bought it because of the character customization and fell in love with climbing monsters and the various ways to play. A few cons though:

Pawns are completely computer controlled. Early on this means they're dumb as bricks and can't target a weak point to save their lives. Later on, they can be absolute machines with enough enemy knowledge. It can and will lead to situations where you just wonder what the heck the CPU is doing though.

Stat growths are based on level range and current class. Because of the way late/post-game equipment numbers go up, health and stamina are kind of your more important stats. The game generally doesn't want you to min-max, but it really doesn't want you to min-max as a mage/sorcerer.

Glow effects are kind of obnoxious in the dark. Mods can fix that. In fact, since the game only really checks to see if your pawn is legal when you upload it, mods are pretty safe to use as long as they don't significantly alter your pawn (the big one is making sure they're not in a hybrid class since you normally can't put your pawn in those; definite insta-flag). A nice little allowance for the player.

Buffs are really important for big post-game/DLC enemies. They stack up to four times for some reason but the game's damage formula heavily favors getting over a hump in defenses.

Sometimes the game decides you don't have great footing while climbing and enemies will just flail all over the place, absolutely demolishing your stamina meter.

The post-game/DLC have a lot of randomness and asset reuse associated with them. The post-game areas are generally too large and samey. The DLC's (and, indeed, the game's) strongest weapons and armor are almost all locked behind what's essentially a gacha system of finding the appropriate leveled item (1, 2, or 3) and spending rift crystal currency. The game seeds your purified equipment list from the start of the game and the only way to advance it is to purify equipment of that level. The only way to influence the list otherwise is to set your and your pawn's class to one color before purifying since the list has a choice for each color and it rolls the color based on your current classes.

There's a lot of ways to approach combat encounters or mess around though. Don't be afraid to experiment or look up what some items do (looking at you, skulls). A favorite early strategy of mine, before you can deal reasonable damage, is to hit a human sized or smaller enemy enough to stagger then throw them off a cliff.

DD2 is for all intents and purposes a remake of DD:DA but with actually completed development. There are simply a lot of QoL issues is DA that may turn you off to DD2. Mods can help, but I doubt many would want to go through all that hassle just to try a game out.

Some issues inlude:
- No Fast Travel
- All enemies (except certain bosses) respawn when you reenter an area (this includes everything from wolves to dragons and chimeras (it can get very annoying just to travel from one town to the next)
- Broken romance system 
- Lots of random bugs
- Ultimately DD was a product the publisher did not believe in and so production was cut short and funding dried up (must like Dark Souls 1)

Also, much like Dark Souls 1 this game is AWESOME!!! Seriously worth the hassle of modding away some of the issues, but like I said.

Let's  break it down into four different segments: Visuals, Game play, Sense of direction, and fun. So first we will begin with the visuals. Oh my lord, the game is just absolutely beautiful. The game still looks so good from back when it was released in 2016. 10/10. Next we have our game play. Now I believe the whole pawn system is super cool and Love how you can use other real people's main pawns as your two support pawns. They can get a bit tedious but I'll get back to that here in a little bit. So the overall gameplay is just amazing, I love going through the map's intricately detailed: biomes, caves, and all sorts of lands. Although the map isn't the biggest you've ever seen, but it makes up for it's smaller size with hugely adaptive and detailed levels and areas. Now back to the tedious pawn mechanics... Well I appreciate that the game gives us ai which usualy works really well but sometimes it just doesn't. Honestly they do become a responsibility and quite a burden. Listen, I'm not going to dog on the game for the pawns not listening to the Arisen (The pawn's master. A.K.A. you) and for doing some other annoying things. Although just listen here, The game was originally created plenty of years previous of the Dark Arisen version of the game. Even so, the game was still created in 2016. Anyway, issues aside. 10/10. Here we talk about in the third segment; sense of direction. Like any open world souls game, There should always be a specific goal at the end which includes something like a final boss or something of the sorts. This game pretty much strikes the gold. The quests do become quite long and monotone but when you think of there being a reason of doing it all, to farm experience, or to farm coins to buy the piece of equipment that you really want. That is really what it is all about. 10/10. Finally we have the overall enjoyment of the game itself. The thought of having an open world RPG, you might honestly be excited already correct? If you are like me and like the really grind-y games and/or concentrated tactic based games. This game is honestly amazing. You get a souls-like open world RPG that honestly isn't too expensive and is getting a sequel. How amazing is that! Anyway the absolute variety and game progression without you even noticing it is just mind-boggling. I give this game a 10/10 especially for the people who are new or experienced who are interested in the souls-like open world RPG based games, check it out.",1687917252,1687917252,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

And yet, for some reason, this has got to be one of the best games I've ever played. To put it simply: it's fun. While the world could use some filling out, and most definitely the story could be told better, the gameplay is fantastic. It certainly isn't an immersive RPG, lacking the characterization and choice necessary to achieve this, but it combines the gameplay elements of a beat-em-up style fight system with simple movement and fluidity, and it does it excellently. It's the gameplay that sells Dragon's Dogma, with a large number of flashy skills and magic that doesn't get old.

This game feels rough and not good at all at the early part. Nearly dropped this game because I encountered 3 huge enemies in Abandoned mine quest in my early level 19ish and not prepared at all. That was grueling battle and I do not enjoyed that at all. Nearly dropped the game as it was frustating experience and the save game system is absolute garbage. I pushed on though, because the word of mouth from the community and awesome magic spell in youtube told it me it is a good time in future. 
I played more and unlocked higher tier skills and something finally clicking in me. It was the first time I slayed the Cyclops near the beach. That feeling was exhilarating, the combat starting to get better for me and I played the game day and night like crazy. 
The night time is terrifying, shit so dark I cant even see 5 meters ahead of my character, but my beloved pawn is there to comfort and accompanying me in the darkness, content to know I'm not alone wandering wilderness. 
The journey escorting quest is also exhausting especially to the far end beach and it feels truly like you are on adventure. It is so rewarding when the long journey was finally reached. 
Also Griffin, fuck me I love Griffin in this game. They look so cool and the quest to abandoned tower to slay a Griffin is probably my most favourite quest in the game after the final battle against the Dragon. 

It is the best RPG i've ever played. The combat against huge creature is just unmatched in any other RPG game. Now, waiting for Dragon's Dogma 2 released as I played the newgame+.",1687755589,1687755589,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There is a way to fast travel, but you are only able to get it far later in the game. But my biggest problem is the SIDE QUESTS. They range from pretty good to some of the most boring idiotic fetch quests you will ever do in any open world game.

The idea that its fans purport that this game is this incredible yet overlooked RPG is enticing, but it is so inferior to nearly every other RPG I've played in every facet other than combat. Which doesn't even get much points because it's not even the entirety of the combat, merely its style. Mainly how interesting it is to grapple onto large enemies. Everything else about the combat is mid at best. This game's fans tend to exaggerate how great the combat is in order to justify a game they like. The combat is fun, but that's the only decent thing about the game, it's not good enough to save it.

Everything Wrong With This Game:

1) The World is Bland:
The open world in this game is just a bunch of blank roads littered with empty structures with no rewards for exploring. There are occasional monsters, but they never change, so even the interesting roads where you find chimeras become hideously boring. The game tells you that the roads are shared by merchants and travelers, yet they are nowhere to be seen. You have to follow the main story to get anything to happen. 

2) Terrible NPC Interaction:
The NPCs in this game suck. The majority say only one phrase. These guys are supposed to expand the world, instead they are caricatures meant to provide the idea of an open world. The interaction with the more important NPCs isn't much better. Very few NPCs have anything to say or excite the player to do anything. By that I mean probably 1 of them.

3) The Cities are the Worst I've Seen
Gran Soren is so massive yet so empty, it feels exhausting to traverse. Every district is so unnecessarily large for what it is.  The other towns like the encampment, which is literally empty space, and your home town are not much better. It highly contributes to the game being a walking slog. Everything else I've found is just an empty broken castle with nothing to find. Why is this world so boring. 

4) The Pawns
The idea of a follower that gains intelligence to support you in combat as it supports other players online is very interesting. What isn't interesting is that they are soulless robots that speak the same few phrases all too often. Why would this game make your party members bland robots. No one wants to surround themselves with that. Not to mention the party system the game forces on you does not feel the greatest with how its ancient UI makes it a chore to check basic stats and skills. Enjoy doing that for 3 pawns. I would have much preferred having one robot follower, and perhaps my choice of available NPCS to have join me.

5) Monster stats
Their stats are static. This means that enemy stats are set at a certain value and never change. Why?? This creates such lame encounters where you either annihilate the enemy or are forced to run from an undamageable, one-shotting, threat that is placed between you and an objective, why design a game like that, especially with the lack of variety in tackling an encounter? There aren't available explosives or traps or anything you could use to tackle a much stronger foe, just run you idiot. Such a bad idea. The game tries to embrace this by telling you to run, but who wants to avoid all the tough encounters in games, those are supposed to be what make games challenging and therefore interesting.

6) The Monsters
Goblins, wolves, bandits, and harpies. For big stuff, chimeras and ogres. Rarely lizard creatures. Encounters get boring real fast. The only one they actually seem to have tried with is the chimera, with how you are supposed to fight it by breaking its pieces. Even that is a static process though, you can't choose to defeat the lion head first, or the magic goat. So bland.

7) The Vocations
These are just fighting classes for your character to choose from. This is mostly a decent part of the game. There are 3 basic classes, and 9 more variations that are mixtures or enhanced versions of the originals. But why just present them all to me when I try to change class. Why don't I have to try to master the basic ones to unlock a new class. Such a simple mistake makes mastering a class much more boring. You should have to work to gain more options in combat and a new class should be the reward. Just inherently bad design.

This game is not a must try, or a hidden gem. It's another rpg in a sea of them that are much better. All this game has going for it is a semi interesting combat sequence. Which is unfortunate because I wanted to play a good game. I could probably say much more, but this game isn't worth it. All the people saying it is good or even better than Skyrim are simply gas lighting. Play a good game like Breath of the Wild.",1687723718,1687723889,False,6,7,0.491578966379165649,0,True,False,False

The controls are designed for console and the lazy pc port kept all of them (using the mouse in the menu is really clunky, you try to manage your items in windows covering 4% of your screen, etc). The quest/world design is a piece of crap, especially the escort quests. I took an escort quest once I arrived to the first city, just to realize I have to take the NPC to basically the other side of the map. The path is blocked by creatures that I couldn't even damage, since this piece of crap uses damage reduction instead of damage resistance: basically if your level is not high enough you can't damage the enemy. At all. But with some GRINDING, the battle becomes very easy. After that noone f*ing dares to say this is a skill-based system. Back to the quests, I accidentally took another one, which needs to escort the NPC that I need to speak to for another quest resolution, but he refuses to talk about that. I met some bandits who gave me a quest to dispatch another bandit gang: the same ones I've killed about an hour ago. I kinda enjoyed playing as an archer, but then I took something I thought was a class upgrade, instead my whole attack pattern changed: now I shoot less frequently, but knockback enemies. Which sounds nice but actually make them last longer since their weakpoints are usually covered when on the ground. The inventory management and crafting system is a chore, especially the weights limitations. The quests are not rewarding. The battle system is basically just ""click until the red bar disappears from the opponents head, if your health starts to drop just pause time and eat a f*ckton of herbs"". I have no idea how can it be that so many people think this game is a masterpiece. I gave it several chances and even enjoyed small sections of it (like when I explored and found the water temple very early, and managed to kill the boss in it for good loot), but 99% of the game feels like tormenting myself with grinding and boredom. Too bad since some elements of the world is pretty nice, especially the creature design), and the skill/item/combat/pawn system has some REALLY nice ideas.

Usually with these ""cult classics"", even if I don't enjoy them, I can see what makes it fun for other people. The only thing mildly good about DD is the combat, but that can only take you so far. I also like the graphics just because of the nostalgia I have for PS3 era games. 

It has a poorly written story and an excessively slow pacing. I don't even know what was happening most of the time, but unlike say Dark Souls, the world isn't interesting enough to carry it's mediocre narrative setup. The only dialogue bits that I remember from this game is the mind-numbing chatter by the pawns. Also, this is a petty complaint but please DD, stop using the word ""aught"" so much. It's super annoying.

The gameplay design is aggressively boring. It has a vast open world filled with monsters just standing around doing nothing. There's barely any reward for exploring. There's a stamina bar that depletes when you run so you're constantly walking around empty plains very slowly. The quests feel like AI written radiant quests from Fallout 4. The level design consists of very long corridor after very long corridor. It's just plain bad. It almost feels like an MMO that somehow forgot to add the multiplayer.

Some good stuff:

[list]
    [*] Combat feels really good in this game and you have tons of skills and movement options to play around with.
    [*] The pawn system is rad and hiring other people's characters to construct your party is a lot of fun. Embrace this mechanic! Playing with a big party is a lot of fun, don't think that you need to play duo or solo to be a cool authentic gamer.
    [*] Lots of fun vocations with their own things going for them. It's a really cool that you can do vocation tourism to steal all the really good augments from other vocations.
    [*] Sorcery is actually crazy. If you wanna spend 30 seconds practically summoning the apocalypse, you can.
    [*] The SotC-esque climbing mechanic is really fun and cool, climb all over big dudes and stab the weak spot. It's a good time.
    [*] Great character creator, and making your actual height/weight affect ingame mechanics is so cool.
    [*] Great sound design.
    [*] The dungeon crawler DLC area (BBI) is a lot of fun and it's cool that they let you take it on almost immediately.
    [*] Hard Mode is great. Enemies aren't tankier HP-wise, they're just harder to stagger and knockdown so you can't just spam things that do that as easily. You use much more stamina, so you have to conserve it. You take a lot more damage, so you need to play more carefully.
    [*] People complain a lot about the pawns talking too much but I like it, it's campy and goofy. There's an option to turn it down if you don't like it.
[/list] 

There is a long, long list of gripes though and this is only a few of them (there are like 30 whiny nitpicks I had to cull):

 [list]
    [*] The game just feels a bit empty on content/quests, after ignoring the filler.
    [*] It sucks that stats on levelup is vocation-based rather than picking it yourself. It saves you time but it screws over players that want to be optimal. There ought to be an option to pick it yourself. 
    [*] Getting handed a billion free DLC items upon reaching Gran Soren messes up the power curve for multiple hours. These should have been obtainable by other means instead.
    [*] Inventory management needs more QoL and a better organised UI to make it less of a slog.
    [*] Elder Scrolls-esque problem of being able to spam instant curatives in combat like nobody's business, so you have to put yourself on an honor system to not cheese every fight.
    [*] Many busywork padding quests that you need to just ignore for your own sanity
    [*] They did the Warrior class dirty by only giving them 3 skill slots (every other vocation has 6), and like no interesting core skills.
    [*] Gacha-esque BBI purification mechanic is cringe
    [*] The postgame weather is cringe (I just modded it out)
[/list] 

Give it a go. The start is a bit slow though, so try to power through until at least reaching Gran Soren.

This makes the gameplay exceptional and immersive. I am still a little peeved that I got the blonde dude as my ""lover"", just because I saved him to get the shield. I did all of the princesses quests, I mean come on dude throw me a bone, sheesh.

The worst part about the game: the still-framed NPCs and lack of music. Like, it's pretty clear they had no intention on making the world something you care about, which is kind of disappointing because you're supposed to become its god. That aside, did I have fun playing it? Absolutely. One time I unleashed a cursed dragon on a gorecyclops with bait and they duked it out until death.

The game also desperately needed a ""stay here"" option for pawns, because whenever I was trying to take advantage of the gorecyclops, they attacked them like dummies and got rekt. Also, when is real life going to let me customize a submissive pawn? It has to hit different, that otherworldly peach.

Throughout the game, you have a loyal pawn companion who levels up alongside you. Additionally, you can hire two more disposable pawns to fight by your side. The combat system is surprisingly diverse and engaging. You can change your character and main pawn's vocation, so don't worry about the three basic vocations you can choose from (fighter, strider, and mage). You'll have six more vocations to choose from shortly after. And what's great about it is that you don't lose any progression, weapons, etc., when you switch vocations. So feel free to experiment and find one that fits your playstyle. Some of the quests can be done differently and will have an impact on the ending, but don't worry about it if you're playing for the first time. In New Game Plus, your main character and pawn's appearance will be preserved, but you can modify them at the start or during the game. Don't forget to check out mods for this game. There are mods available that can enhance your gameplay experience, such as ENB (graphics enhancement), increased carry capacity, and spell glow adjustments to make the visuals more comfortable to look at.

[h3]Spoiler Warning[/h3]

Besides the Seneschall being the easiest and most anticlimatic final boss I've ever beaten in a video game, the endings themselves (doesn't matter which) are possibly the laziest I've ever seen, I think the devs where out of ideas and just thought: ""Let's end this on a reveal of a pointless cycle where the MC takes the place of the boss (which is basically a god that can't do any god related things. Impotent-God), let's also make it needlessly abstract so that it feels deep"". Honestly, if the ending would have been a reveal where the whole thing is a simulation, it would still have marginally better than this crap.
It would have been much better if it just ended with the MC just killing the dragon, everyone cheers, maybe marring the beloved, and then game over.

I write super long reviews so heres the TLDR: its Fantastic, a straight up classic. I dont love the story but its serviceable. Hard as nails sometimes, but forgiving enough to be approachable. the sequel is on the way but this is still worth your time. now, onto my rambling.

The story isnt really my thing, but it is compelling as a device for pulling you through the game. without spoilers: a dragon steals your heart, and you need to go fuck him up to get it and your mortality back. on the way you discover that not having your heart in your chest lets you order these little goobers called pawns around. it sounds silly but the pawns are actually a really neat system as you can share your pawn online and it can potentially give other people some quest or enemy knowledge. If you speck the pawns a specific way they can straight up carry you. 

the real place Dragons dogma shines IMO is combat. its hard to put into words, but i guess the fastest way to describe it is watered down DMC meets small scale shadow of the colossus. you can go from juggling some helpless little goblin to scaling a cyclops to poke at his eyeball seamlessly. More importantly though, the game gives you a really wide variety of classes to play. These range from sword and board, to big bow man, to super powerful mage, with many steps between. For me, the hybrid vocations are where the really cool stuff is at. magic archer gets a magic bow that lets you shoot lock on magic bolts, and also you can light yourself on fire. this enables you to activate goblin mode and light yourself on fire to crawl around on big enemies. Mystic Knight is sword and board with a much heavier focus on the board, specifically wanting you to use it to parry and send a big elemental ripostes back at enemies. and assassin...I didn't mess with assassin much, but i hear its insanely good. you can also swap between these classes in the main town. at any point in your play through you can just decide you want a new class, and go try it. However, i do recommend sticking to either physical or magic damage classes for your first run. This is because the weird way this game handles level ups and stat allocation. Basically, when you level up, your current class determines what stats you get. this is great in theory, because it removes the piddling around with your stats on a screen and gets you into more action faster, but the game barely tells you this, so if you play warrior for 40 levels and then switch to mage, your damage will suck. I could sit and just talk about the classes all day, but this is already more than anyone is going to read.

The big downside to all of this is that you will be walking. a lot. and your commute will never just be a simple walk. until later when you get some fast travel items, you will be seeing and exploring the world. but, to the games credit, the fast travel system is pretty neat. you can find port crystals in certain places that will allow you to travel to them. these can be picked up and moved, allowing you to set your own fast travel way points. Also to the games credit, the world is kind of nice to explore. for a game that came out in 2012/2013, it doesnt look Supremely dated. put another way: this game came out a year or two after skyrim. Skyrim looks way older than this game in my opinion.

So yeah, for $30 id say its worth checking out. If you do, some minor suggestions: If you like going for perfect block as fighter, try mystic knight. Its just my favorite class, the parries feel so good. If you like casting spells, i think Sorcerer will tick some boxes for you, but if you enjoy regular mage that's ok too because mage slaps. Magic archer in my experience is just kinda goofy, but its still worth trying for fun. and lastly, dont sweat too much and try to hardcore metagame your stats your first run. try new classes, experiment. all of the classes are worth at least checking out.",1687347453,1687347637,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It is definitely similar to Skyrim/Elden Ring, but mostly I got similarities with Final Fantasy series, and this is NOT GOOD at all.
 
First, some good things about the game:
- It's not long (I’ll tell you why its good later)
- Interesting mechanic with fights in climbing and monsters
- Straightforward story
- Good weapon and skill build choices
- You can kill children (Huuuray, this game has soul!)

But this is it with good aspects. Now cons:
- Horrible graphics 
- Disgusting quest navigation and travel 
- Horrible fighting system (who said that its like Dark souls should perish in Hell)
- Very bad balance in difficulty (tried only Normal and Easy)
- Ridiculous quests with a huge amount of boringness (go to the same location TWICE spending only on the road approx 10-12 minutes)
- Unbelievable stupid decision to prohibit control of your Pawns (companions)  
- Story is weak 
- The last boss is a joke

The fact that the game is short made me finish it. Because after the same quest which told me to go somewhere SUPER FAR WITHOUT ANY FAST TRAVEL - I almost gave up and quit. However, I overcame it and …. Yes, the game was almost got finished. 

I cannot recommend this game for those that truly like DS series, or Skyrim. Instead, go play Dragon Age or FF 12, seriously.

The game does have its differences from those games however; in those games, you went around as a lone adventurer, but here, you go around with a party of four - the PC and three Pawns. The game's also a little more linear than those games, which can be a good or bad thing depending on what you prefer, but at least there's some variables to it. Either way, you get about what you could expect from the examples I mentioned: a while island to roam, plenty of places to explore and monsters to fight and of course, a plethora of personages to help, befirend and/or fight and so on. The game has some mechanics and whatnot that I find unique for a game of this kind, such as jumping on and climbing the big enemies on order to get a better shot at their weaks spots. The game does have some things that I complain about, though I  think one shoud keep in mind that some of the problems/flaws comes fromt he fact that this is a game originally intended for consoles...:

- Support pawns not gaining levels. Now, I understand that the idea is them not being as good as your main pawn, but nonetheless, feels kinda disappointing that the only way to get higher-level pawns seems to be to ditch those you have with you and hire new ones.

- Only one savegame slot. For some games, this works well, bit here, I feel a few more would be good to have - should be at least three or so so that you can make one save game prior to starting a quest, one during thw quest and one after it This'd be better for when a quest may be a bit overwhelming for the player...

- I find it a problem that fighter/warriors get no ranged option(s). Normally, a lack of such is fine in most games, but most games I've played do not have a quest - the sidequest involving the Metal Golem - where you have to hit a target that is out of reach while a powerful enough enemy tries to kill you. This lack of ranged alternatives for a fighter/warrior player means the quest will at the very least take significantly longer than it otherwise would, assuming the enemies don't smash you to bits during the quest...

- I hate it when the pawns forces the player's attention to be on them, because I'm usually busy fightning some foe or another when they do this and can't really help - if anything, it causes me to lose focus and sometimes makes me botch my attack. So if there's ever a sequel - I'm all for the Pawns giving the player a shout if they want to offer an opportunity we might exploit, but no need for forcing the attention on the pawns when this happens...

- I hope there's some automatic targetting in an eventual sequel, because when I make certain attacks in the game, they're all over the place, like the 'run and stab' - it's a good one, but it often doesn't go for the enemy I'm aiming for and that is a minus...

- The whole 'climbing the monster' thing is cool and has potential, but is ultimately fairly messy, because it all to easily gets hard to steer where you climb - I've struggled to climb up a dragon or the like only for my character to climb downwards, or my character was climbing in circles around one of the dragon's legs when I was trying to go for it's chest... I can't tell how much time was wasted either because the battle went awry when my character didn't climb the way I wanted or was killed because he climbed into the wrong place... As I said, an interesting feature, but a messy one.

- I wish some of the pawn's behaviour other than battle could be customized as well. I'm all for 'em picking up items from the ground that I may have missed. But treasure chests... I'd prefer to open those myself and it always feels like my pawns rob me of the fun when they open a chest before me, so I'd have prefered if this could be altered...

Really, just a lot of problems I find with Dragons' Dogma comes down to pawns. They're the elephant in the room, really. Pawns acting stupidly in a lot of ways - carrying a downed pawn towards you when it's a really bad idea to do so (because everyone will get caught in the blast), not using arrows and other items you leave in their inventory in the hope of them using them against strong foes, not targetting the weap point of the enemy - this is especially a probelm against Metal Golems and the Ur-Dragon: the pawns will just mindlessly attack the enemy despite their attacks doing nothing whatsoever...

Pawns also needs one or two more commands, really. I've lost count of the times when I wish there was a ""disperese/scatter!"" or ""Move away from the enemy!"" command to use when pawns foolishy do things like jumping straight into a dragon's maw or fireball when they really should be retreating... Pawns need to be more customizeable, really. For example, for some reason, they as good as NEVER use any arrows I give them - in a playthrough of 150 hours only one arrow in a bundle of ten got used, despite there being lots of times when their usage would've been very much welcome. And they sometimes don't use cures I give them. And in contrast, they often use items I would rather they saved for another fight in considerably less important fights...

Whatever problems the game may have in regards to pawns and whatnot, I still found this a fun and engaging game well worth my time that I'd eagerly recommend to fans of the genre!",1687116959,1687117013,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pawns are extremely annoying when not in combat and often during combat as well- yes, if I don't know where I am, I should look at the map, please shut up.

Second, this is one of the greatest RPGs I played in all it's imperfect qualities.
Sure, no standard fast travel (without items) and a vast amount of the world feels like it could have more. Holy shit, I've never enjoyed a game so much. (Ignore the play time hours, I have much more on console.)
First thing this game punishes you in a fun way for not understanding it and GREATLY rewards you for learning.

Hands down coming into this new, a lot of enemies and quests will be head scratching. Which is fun. There isn't much hand holding so it is up to you to figure out where to go, what to do, and reading things to understand. That's for quests. Sometimes you'll actually have to pull open your quest log to figure out what to do next. That's nice.

Though, the whole thing isn't crippling and has a lot of casualness as well if you like the feeling of just walking around and pressing a button to swing your sword and kill things. There's this difficulty learning curve and drastic power spike where you go from using literal rusted weapons in potato sacks to summoning tornadoes at the snap of your fingers or winding a sword down with the power of GOD to one-hit bosses. You'll find yourself, after some hours playing, how surprising going against enemies again and again changes.

One hydra fight takes two years. Ten levels later, two seconds. There's so much to do. Even when you finish the base game, the DLC is there for some really fun end-game content. Not to mention it also has the perfect pet simulator where you train and build your little NPC side kick and make them the best friend in your party. (or worst if you don't know what you are doing.)

The NPC mechanic is strange. You have the full ability to set their abilities, class, appearance, and even grind out their AI on how they react to the world of their AI intelligence to enemies either through grinding or setting this basic scales that change how they function. You can also use other players and their sidekicks in your journey and rate them for how good they do. Which is nice. Though, not the simplest. The scales of Medicant, Mitigator, and whatever bullshit terms they have for how your NPC will act is not explained well and, when in tandem of others, have unknown results. I had to pull up guides online to figure out which ones are best for what you are going for. I'll be pretty damn sure unless you are a poetic quantum fuckin' scientist, you'll also be doing the same. Why is this important? So, some bad examples of AI are below if you are curious:

1. Depending on what your set, if you are running towards something, your party members will ALSO run forward and then stand infront of you after. Regardless of where. So, for example, you could run towards a chest on a cliff side and watch three NPCs commit suicide right there.
2. A healer not designed properly who will pop their magic EVERY time you get a paper cut but forget their magic when you are dying.
3. A warrior who runs away from a battle and goes back in only to run out.
4. Your mage will think going to pick up explosive barrels is more important than casting satellite fireballs and walk in to get killed.
5. Your warrior goes into battle, banging their shield as a taunt. For the whole fight and nothing else.

Even if you do look up information and take your time to understand these inclinations, you're wrong. Because they always work in very strange ways. This game is a decade old and even now most my opinions on inclinations is ""It might work like this... half the time. but ONLY if you have it set like this, in this order, and specifically done for even stats you can't see."". A lot of what the game is obscure and unwarrantly obtuse about could use work but everything else especially the DMC styled fantasy combat is what adds to all these unique features and create a game completely unique.

Story is mediocre yet strange. It feels like there are things both stagnant and happening in the background at the same time. Also, without spoiling, I am not sure if this is intentional or bad writing/design combined with being dated. So, it's also good? Not in a way where you'll be impressed about reading a bunch of stuff. So for those that don't like browsing through a novel and closely paying attention in RPGs, you'll be satiated by this way of story telling because there is a lot of show and not tell. Many vague and unexplained things.

All that said, it's a wonderful game. If you are wanting to play, do a little understanding of the world map and take the time to learn the mechanics and what you want to do. Maybe read a guide for building your pawn. (Even though technically you don't need to as grinding can make this game become easy mode.) It's really fun. and the story is entertaining although wonky with plotholes and lack of depth at times.",1595320792,1687051693,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False

Nonsensical story, bland, boring world, shallow combat, shitty gear-based progression with flat damage calculations rather than percentage reductions, annoying ""characters"" that are lampshaded with the excuse that they don't have souls, etc etc. 
This game has no redeeming qualities. Side quests boil down to ""go to a location and kill a bunch of enemies"" or ""talk to a bunch of people in the game's singular city"". Enemy variety is minimal, the combat is a button mashfest with free heals (you can carry hundreds to thousands of healing items which can be used instantaneously from the pause menu), and due to its utterly stupid damage calculation, has no room for skillful play and instead requires excessive grinding to boost your attack values above your enemy's defense values lest you waste hours of your time smacking away at enemies for 1hp at a time.
The game isn't even fun to explore in the same manner it is for skyrim or other open worlds with subpar combat; the world has nearly no environmental variety and is rather small, with only 1 major city and a pittance of settlements with little more than a merchant, not even side quests.

The most baffling failure of this game is the combat, which is why I have mentioned it multiple times. This game was directed by Hideaki Itsuno, the talented director behind Devil May Cry 3, 4, and 5, games with some of the deepest and most rewarding, skill-based 3rd person action game combat in gaming history. How this game completely fails to have even slightly interesting combat is such a mystery to me, I always have to wonder if something went wrong during development, or if Itsuno truly did direct.

The game tries to be many things and fails at all of them. Its continued cult classic status always baffles me, as none of the games fans have ever given me counterarguments against the game's overwhelming flaws, and many simply admit that they like the game for no reason and choose to ignore the flaws. Hopefully the sequel will fix all of the issues that this game has, but I highly doubt that it will, all the footage shown looks nearly identical to this game, without even updated graphics. 

1/10, waste of storage space, you couldn't pay me to experience any more of this game.

I played the game to completion on the xbox 360 in 2012, shortly after the game released.

Pros: Pawn system/Combat/Depth of Classes, these alone are worth 300 hours
Cons: Outdated Graphics/Story, both are just Ok

The pawn system is one of the better ideas in ages and hasnt been replicated since, to my knowledge. Your create an avatar A.I to accompany you throughout your adventures. You can adjust their reactions to situations with a simple question and answer setup. These situations are unique to combat/Defense/resource gathering/aggressive nature. Once you have made them. You can then offer them into a database that others can search and rent your pawn from you as a helper. You can share them with your friends. Or anyone that has theirs made you can search buy class/price/lvl. This to me is where it shines. It has a way of creating a unique experience. pawns have such a range or differences that you never know what you're getting and its always fun to find out. Sometimes you get a healing mage that like to wade into the battle before the tank and war. Or your new ranger keeps wandering off to forage. Well these noobies have the ability to learn from situations. Rather its a quest and how to complete it, or the proper way to take a cyclops down in 10 seconds. They learn from their encounters of all sorts. you learn it together and they're able to take it back to their original account. And vise versa, if you're ahead of a friend in the game and they have your pawn. Your pawn will literally guide them through quests with audible hints and movement towards objectives. When you kill mobs. These pawns learn the proper way to kill them. Literally trial by fire. If you kill a wolf with fire and they go down fast. Your pawn learns that. Future fights will bring audible queues from them to use fire. They'll learn their hunting patterns. Some seem to use tracking skills such as smell queues and dropping to let you know of possible encounters near you in the dark. The pawn System deserves an inovation award in my eyes. If they want more single player games. They have to make systems like this.

Combat is Great. So many party possibilities between yourself and pawns. You can master ever single profession in the game through time and combat. Melee hits feel like they hit. Will not be able to explain it. Just have to be there. You or your pawns can scale larger foes such as the cyclops/ogres/dragons/hydras/Chimeras and attack during the fights. Pawns will do the same and some just seem to only do that once theyve learned enough knowledge. Had a rented Pawn scale a cyclops and straight murder him in the eye with his daggers. I got one telling everyone it hates lighting and this one doesnt say nothing. Just casually walks over, scales his back. Is up around his head getting comfy for a stab spree. He staggers him and down he goes. once hes down the assassin is jumping in the air performing jumping heavies on his face. the cyclops flails and gathers himself only to have ol' pokey on his back again heading straight for the eyes. i felt sorry for this thing, it wasnt a fair fight. The first time you come across goblins in the middle of the night, with only a lantern. Or get surrounded and devoured by wolves. youre going to die alot. SAVE OFTEN before engaging anything, walking near cliffs can lead to a slip and fall off the side taking 30m of work off your hands just to send you back to the tavern you started your day off from. Be bold in your adventures but SAVE OFTEN. For a great experience. Take on a healing role. Take your music all the way down and ambient sound all the way up. Grab you a Tank/Melee dps/Caster dps setup and go out into the dark and just wander around for some fights. If its not some of the best combat experiences of modern games ill be surprised. Im not a fan of the industry in general, but this game deserves more credit than it got.

Depth of classes plays right into it all to give you a great experience. Pawns may not branch past the basic classes but you will get branches from the basic classes into more focused versions. You'll retain basic attack combos and class benefits. But you'll change the class up. Rangers can go Longbow/assassin/Magic Archer. Fighter(tanks) see the Warrior/Paladin Mages get a little less variation But a multitude of skills that can make a team of 4 dps mages have some variations. For fun i once had all 4 members as and tried to find pawns that i could design around and we all had the same 3 major skills and all had utilities that could benefit each other. Its was awesome to watch 4 lighting whips being cracked at mobs in the dark. Meteors and Miasma pools everywhere on the battle field. Or watcfhing 3 tanks springboard each other onto a flying Griffon and take it down from the air. The variations are many.

The first two thirds of this game are really good, if not somewhat short, rushed-ish. There were a lot of pieces that worked really well. The story is set up nicely, you end up in a politically interesting position, you have some limited choices to make with limited changes to the story (mostly about which shops you can/can't use), but ultimately it feels engaging. 

You're shown and engage with what you assume is the end-goal, this beast, this dragon of old, come to burn the world. He doesn't do a lot of burning. Or attacking. Or anything really. But you must stop him. So you work towards that, your date with this beast always on the horizon. And you do! 

He gives you a deal, a nice one. Let me just have this little snack and I'll head out for another century or whatever. You can have all the glory. Pretend you killed me. Do whatever you want. 

Or-- take me on. 

It turns out this is all part of the Great Wheel of Fate, the test to prove the will of the Arisen. 

The dragon is sent to find the one who would stand up to it. You do. You get marked. And all of this to fill the empty chair of God. 

It's really interesting. Unfortunately, from a gameplay perspective, everything after slaying the dragon is completely awful. 

You're given this quest to attain 20 rocks for reasons, and mostly it involves flinging yourself into horrifically unengaging monster battles. What was once a striking encounter now becomes Dungeon #9 full of the same high health bad guys and the eighth dragon you've killed since the big one. 

It manages to shortchange its best and most compelling feature, which is the combat. It really truly becomes a drag for the last quarter of the game all the way up until you finally get your rocks and go finish the very abruptly told conclusion. 

In all, the story was fun, somewhat fresh given the tropes it digs into (oh GOD it's ANOTHER medieval fantasy magic game set in a sadsack world), and until it became monster hunter but bad, the combat was challenging but rewarding and fun.

Even at its current ""full price"" of $30, it's a steal. Combat is highly rewarding, with one of the most robust and visually epic looking magic combat systems of almost any game I've played. Your Pawns - the NPCs which you can recruit from other worlds that are player created - add an incredible amount of dynamic interaction. They call out monster weaknesses and strengths, learn tactics, physically grab and pin down enemies to give you time to charge your attacks, point out treasure, and other useful odds and ends, making you feel like they're a thinking member of your party rather than a bundle of code that gets stuck up on uneven terrain.

The story is engaging, and once it's over, you open up one of the more unique Post-Game experiences I've ever seen to keep you coming back for more. If you're ever on the fence about the game, wait for a sale ($5 until 6/20/23 is the biggest steal EVER!).

The combat has really good ideas, climbing on giant monsters is really something I had not yet experienced in my gaming career. Some monsters can even take control of the allies fighting with you, and this surprised me even more. The char I'm playing has more layers of armor, mainly the chest pieces can be overlapped. Cool! 
The adventure is very slow to unveil, mainly because there is no fast travel, if you don't have some magic pieces that - at the moment - are quite rare. So, navigation through the world of the game is slow and often interrupted by various types of enemies that spawn always in the same spots. The world itself is beautifully crafted, with big and smaller cities that offer some exploration and (obviously) some side quests. Unfortunately, the world is developed mainly around a relatively narrow main track, with a few branches here and there to encourage exploration, so the ""open world"" is not so open, after all. The track that goes from the starting village to the main City of Grand Soren (and beyond, but I've not reached new areas yet!) is, as I just mentioned above, narrow and often limited by slopes on one side and mountains on the other, with explorable forests and beaches scatterd along it; but unfortunately if you want to go from point ""A"" to point ""B"" you have to walk (and fight) your way using one and only one track, no alternative routes are possible. It is not like Skyrim, in which if you want to go from Whiterun to Riften you can choose many different routes, absolutely as you please. This is the real downside of this game: free exploration is really limited. 
Dragon's Dogma is, anyway, a really good game that I really recommend, since it has very good combat and it has a really affordable price.",1686623093,1686623309,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
367500,138471407,76561198038037146,0,37,5403,0,5403,1684387639,"Easily among the best adventure games of all time, despite its few flaws.

Absolutely great action combat that goes out of its way to really fulfill the immersive fantasy. When you play a big hulking warrior swinging a massive sword, you feel like it. When you play an athletic scoundrel archer you really feel like it. When you play a fragile mage trying to cast difficult, complex and devastating spells, you really get the reward of feeling like it.

The dramatic gothic-romance of grim fantasy oozes from every pore. From desperately surviving your first encounters with goblins to heroically climbing upon a giant monster to stab it repeatedly while clinging for dear life all the way to the truly most-epic dragon fight in video  game history ... and beyond. I can think of only a few games which manage to give skeletons crawling from dusty ancient tombs the very real chill of horror and fear that they deserve. Alien nightmares erupt around you deep within the forgotten bowels of a mysterious dungeon giving an immediate sense of urgent confusion and the knowledge that sometimes the wise course of action is to flee from an overwhelming foe - if you can.

NPCs are a little bit perfunctory in some cases. This is not an RPG. The characters in the world are there to serve a purpose, not to develop a relationship with or to demonstrate their own personality. Some of them are far more interesting and charming than others, of course, but in the end dialogue in this game (although there's plenty enough of it) is not a major focus of development. Ironically, the soulless pawns that travel with you have the most to say about... everything. Their comments are helpful, insightful, informative or even just encouraging and supportive. Sadly, the ""romance"" system is not really for the purpose of romance, it's for the sake of an important plot point later in the game - one which was handled very... abstractly.

The bad? Well. They're more like complaints, really. The user interface is an archaic and clumsy mess. The game was created with limited controllers in mind, and this makes navigating menus for either inventory management or equipment comparison into a dreadfully tedious chore compounded by how harshly limited your carry capacity is (though this is necessary for gameplay balance reasons). At some point it will feel like you have plenty of options in terms of equipment to compare between, but often it will feel like there just isn't anything you really want to wear (an important consideration since dressing up your pawn is a major motive for exploration, and the camera is over the shoulder so you want to look good for your own sake even from behind). Overall, the itemization is a bit too limited and most equipment just isn't very different from any of the rest (though the few things that do stand out will become your favorites... and you'll never unequip it for the rest of the game...).

The most serious complaint, however, is that the world is ... a bit sparse. Which makes it feel a lot smaller than it actually is. This is difficult to really explain, though, because for the first forty hours you play, you'll discover some random new dungeon or weird little secret and it'll feel amazing - and it will be amazing. Eventually though, you'll realize that for every new little dungeon you discover, you've passed by three blank alleys in Gran Soren with absolutely nothing in them. You can wander around and constantly ask ""why isn't there anything here?"" for hours and hours and hours while exploring. There's nothing behind the cathedral. It's just a big open space where nothing ever happens. There's no point to the huge empty plateau, you only go there for one minor quest and it takes like ten minutes to run across it. Some games from a similar era of game development like the Elder Scrolls managed to pack way more content into worlds of comparable size. It doesn't need to all be on the ""overland"" map (where the drama of traveling to suddenly have to desperately fend off a bandit ambush is a major part of what makes this a grim low-fantasy epic story). But it'd be nice if Gran Soren were actually a city and not just three merchants with a five minute walk to get to the castle where The Quests are handed out.

Even so, any sequel could surely rake in mountains of cash if it were accomplished with even comparable quality.

This one still manages to very fairly earn its place among the greats. If you like Skyrim, for example, you absolutely owe it to yourself to play Dragon's Dogma.",1684389173,1686620182,True,154,1,0.88680732250213623,4,True,False,False

I had this game on Xbox 360 a decade ago, but stopped playing it for reasons I couldn't remember. Seeing the game was on sale, I figured ""why not?""
A few hours in, and I remembered *why* I stopped playing it.
The needless backtracking, the brain dead AI, and the lack of any real way to target your enemies (which made my character aggressively attack the air) were the main offenders in every play session. 

Pawns refusing to heal themselves or others during a battle (the main reason I always had a Mage in my party) and the single save slot system meant having to go to the main menu, *then* press another button to go to the ""Main"" main menu, then load the last save made almost every battle feel like an insult to my time playing.

When the game doesn't throw these issues at you, its a joy to play. Which is why this game is so frustrating for me.

One of my three favorite games ever released alongside Elden Ring and Doom Eternal, except *this is the only one of those three that was released over a decade ago*. This game is a must play, especially when it goes on sale for as low as 5$ every so often, though I would still buy it at full price without hesitation myself.

The level design with strong parallels to Elden Ring (That likely inspired it) where you see great structures and landmarks far off in the distance in the vista that you can travel to on foot and explore as points of interest, and the possibility of running into grand bosses anywhere in the wilderness. The adventure to reach the location of a quest may end up being even grander than the quest itself depending on what grand beasts you end up running in to on the way. The combat throughout the game is also influenced by the day/night cycle as well as what point in the game's main quest line you are in, which means you can explore the same area multiple times and fight completely different monsters.

The combat and gameplay design is an easy 11/10. This is made by the same director and team that made Devil May Cry which is enough to get the idea across on it's own, but rather than making the player controls where the difficulty of the combat is, they took that incredible depth and put it on the AI while giving the player a simpler but still easily satisfying control scheme. Some of the simplest bosses in the game literally have about two dozen unique weaknesses that you can learn over time as you fight more and more of them, with AI depth that rivals the modern Monster Hunter games. And if you enjoyed Shadow of the Colossus, literally any creature bigger than you, you can climb. Want to climb a cow for no reason? you can climb it. Want to climb a Cyclops and stab it in the eye? you can do that. Want to climb a dragon while it's flying? You can do that, but make sure you don't run out of stamina or you might fall to your death unless you hurt it's wings to force it to land. There are also 9 unique classes you can switch between at any time, which also include magical ones with some of the most overkill and extravagant spells you have ever seen in a video game if you want to feel like Megumin from Konosuba casting Explosion. If you want a clearer example of the insane combat depth, go to the bottom of this review where I will post a spoiler about a early game repeatable boss. 

Narratively the game is also pretty good as at the high level the story is extremely well written and is very thematic. The one weakness the game has regarding it's narrative is a lot of the characters have more static personalities and lack character growth, but this is easy to overlook as the main focus of the story is your own character.

If I was to outline any weaknesses the game has, it is a 2012 game with a little bit of jank but nothing that negatively impacts the player experience, and for PC it's a little graphically outdated but it's easy to mod some higher res textures and a ENB in to put it closer to modern standards. Fast Travel is not immediately usable by design to encourage you to run into combat encounters in the wilderness, and to use Fast Travel you will have to place your own way-points using a item with limited quantity. There are a number of points of no return in the main quest line that cut off side quests and aren't always well outlined, so I would recommend prioritizing side quests when you find them. The game also is weak when it comes to tutorials, and primarily expects you to figure mechanics out on your own which can be fun but isn't for everyone.

Regarding the lack of tutorials, when you start the game DO NOT FOLLOW THE PURPLE QUEST MARKER. This is the DLC that is intended for the end-game that the game will immediately give you access to and encourage you to go towards without explanation, and it will put a bad taste in your mouth unless your into CBT because balance wise you simply aren't intended to be able to fight the enemies there at the early stages of the game. 

********************COMBAT SPOILER BELOW********************


To outline the insane depth the enemies in this game have, here is a number of unique ways you can engage a cyclops which is the 1st repeatable boss you will encounter. 
1.) Target the eye by either climbing or shooting to deal maximum damage and temporarily blind it. Watch out for the panicky swings he will do while he can't see though!
2.) Target it's hand holding his club, possibly by climbing it, to make it drop it's club and alter his moveset and lower his reach until he gets the chance to pick it back up again.
3.) Target his tusks to cut them off, gaining useful materials but also sending him into a rage where he will attack more aggressively and blindly, possibly being used to your advantage to kill other AI or lure him off a cliff. 
4.) While some of your party members climb one of his legs to put additional weight on it to set him off balance, target the other leg to force him to collapse, giving you a large damage window. Can also be done solo if you are fast at jumping off the leg and dealing heavy damage to the other leg. 
5.) Targeting the legs in general will gradually make him lose overall balance over time and may make him fall backwards or forward. If backwards, he is defenseless, if forward, he will use his arms to protect himself. 
6.) Climb his back and deal damage there where he can't easily access you due to the poor flexibility of his arms
7.) If the Cyclops is armored, you can trick him into taking his own helmet off by climbing onto his head and jumping out of the way when he goes to grab you. 
8.) If you are a magic user, Cyclopses while generally killable with all magic are especially weak to lightning, and this will paralyze him frequently. If a body of water is nearby, lure him in and get him wet to make it even more effective!  
9.) Dousing him in oil and using fire is also a pretty effective way of dealing so much damage he will fall over. 

The list goes on and on, I can probably make this list about 30 unique facts long but I don't want to spoil all of his weaknesses for you and my point is already proven. And this is the 1st, weakest, and one of the simplest bosses in the game!",1686504842,1686505082,True,2,0,0.498257845640182495,0,True,False,False

Dragon's Dogma 2 is coming out so its a perfect time to pick up and play this gem of an action RPG. The combat is the true shining star of this game, while the story and characters can take a bit of a backseat at times. The story doesn't really pick up until a few hours in but there's more than enough mystery and interesting tid bits to keep you along for the ride. 

The gameplay and combat are fantastic and hold up after so many years. Being able to climb large scale monsters and go right up to their weakpoints is a mechanic I'm surprised no other games have tried up to this point. The pawns are amazing and you can get really funky with the creation.

For a game that’s 10 years old it’s pretty dam good. It looks good and it feels good.

It’s easily a 10/10 for the combat every class has its plethora of abilities with hybrids and what not. The abilities they have all have strengths and weaknesses. If you are a monster Hunter can GET THIS GAME. The world is pretty nice to travel and thanks to the port keys or whatever they are called it’s really easy to get around. You get to create your character along with a main companion. And than you can recruit two more through the stones. Allowing you to mix and match your party. Again developers write this shit down this is how you do action RPGs .

This game is a classic and its worth and its also great for replaying alot.
now with DD2 around the corner I can already hope and tell that DD2 maybe gonna be the my favorite RPG of all time.

The armor progress in this game is one of my favorites, it always feels rewarding to get to the next quest cycle story and get another pair of great looking armor, the DLC armor loop is rewarding and even females look great in heavy armor and not sexualized bullshit armor.

A reductive way to describe it would be to say it has the structure of an Elder Scrolls-type game with the combat of Monster Hunter. But even that fails to do it justice, because there is so much about Dragon's Dogma that's unique.

Firstly, the character creation. Dragon's Dogma has one of the best character creators I've ever seen. It's extremely versatile, and things such as character weight and height actually have subtle in-game effects. You can easily make characters that look good, or you can make some absolute monstrosities. 

However, in Dragon's Dogma, you actually get to make two characters: your main player character, and then a second character called your pawn. Your pawn is your main companion throughout the game, and never leaves the party unless they die, which is hard to have happen. You individually level and gear both characters, giving you a huge amount of control over how your party approaches situations. Additionally, your pawn even changes its tactics based on how you play, and can learn information about areas, enemies, and quests you encounter. The coolest thing about pawns, though, is that when you play online, pawns can be shared between players. This means that you fill up half your party with other characters made by other players, and that your pawn will be assisting other players who summon it. Pawns will still learn information while helping another character, so you may boot up the game to find that your pawn has brought you some items and learned about enemies or areas you haven't even seen, and will be able to give you hints about them the first time you see them.

The combat in Dragon's Dogma is probably its most memorable feature. You start out being able to pick between three classes; mage, fighter, and strider (rogue, basically). However, as soon as you get to the game's major city, you are given six other classes to pick from: specialized variants of the three basic classes, and hybrids of them. Each one of these nine classes plays differently and each one is viable to use. You can also change classes at any time for almost no cost, and even carry over some of your skills and abilities, giving you tons of ways to play. One complaint I have with the game is that the two pure caster classes aren't very exciting to play as, since casting spells mostly involves standing still while your character waves their hands around for like five to ten seconds. While the big ""nuke"" spells are very satisfying to pull off, this slow, stationary casting makes for very slow gameplay that can be annoying if you get interrupted. Luckily, you can make your pawn do the casting and get the incredibly powerful effects of spells while doing the more enjoyable hands-on combat yourself.

Fighting enemies in Dragon's Dogma is never not fun. Almost every enemy has unique behaviors and characteristics which make them interesting to fight. Most of the time you'll be fighting smaller-sized enemies such as goblins or bandits, but even they have their own special tactics and abilities. However, the combat really shines when you start fighting the giant enemies. For instance, the first one you'll probably fight outside the tutorial is a cyclops. Most cyclopes wear helmets that protect their weakest points; their eye and their legs. You can break the leg armor by hitting it, but your weapons will bounce off it most of the time. The helmet can't be broken, BUT! If you jump onto the cyclops and climb up its back, it will realize that it can't reach you because the helmet is in the way, and it will actually reach up and remove it, letting your ranged characters strike the exposed eye. You could also shoot at its tusks to break them and stagger it, or cause it to trip by having a particularly heavy character cling to its leg, or climb it and just stab it in the back a ton. There are so many ways to fight these big enemies, and the combat always feels fluid and dynamic. It is just so insanely fun.

The visuals and sound aren't the game's selling point, but it's by no means ugly. The world is realistically designed, with one major city surrounded by landscapes and small camps. The city is filled with buildings, people, shops, and has distinct districts. It is one of the few cities in video games I can think of where I could actually see how people would live there. The rest of the world is diverse, but realistically so. There's not going to be a desert right next to a tundra, but there are rolling hills, and caves, and forests, mountains, beaches, cliffs; it feels like a real place.

The story is pretty good. It's very back-loaded; the first part of the game mostly involves gaining favor with the duke so he'll let you go and do things actually relevant to the story. The 'final boss' is super fun, but the true actual final boss is an insane pushover that makes the game feel pretty anti-climactic. That being said, the meat of the gameplay lies in optional areas and the DLC, which both have fun and unique bosses. The DLC has its own self-contained storyline that shines a bit more light on the narrative mechanics of the world and has some new characters.

In conclusion, Dragon's Dogma is terrifically unique, and some of the most fun I've had playing video games in my life. I keep finding myself coming back to it, even though I've beaten it at least 5 times. It's by no means flawless - some of the deeper mechanics are pretty arcane to try and figure out - but it's so fun and memorable that those flaws are excusable. Fantastic game, highly recommended.",1540595438,1686000564,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The combat is foremost where the game is strongest. There is a large variety to the classes, their abilities, and a very satisfying weight to fighting. One of the most distinct elements of the combat is fighting relatively large enemies that players can climb on. While this feature can be very fun when it wants to be, it's littered with frustration. Trying to grab onto a large enemy whenever they're moving often results in the player being displaced and grabbing onto a part they weren't aiming at. If players are grabbing onto a part of the enemy that they attack with, and they attack, players will take full damage even if the attack didn't actually hit them. The controls for moving along an enemy are extremely inconsistent and will sometimes invert to make movement entirely incomprehensible, or the camera will shift to a ridiculous angle where the player can't see themself; or the enemy will thrash so much the player can't function anymore. Yet for melee classes contending with this extremely unrefined mechanic can be vital as without it there is not much for them to do versus large enemies besides monotonously whittling away at their legs.

While the magic in this game is uniquely intense it is balanced by having players charge up each super spell they want to cast. If players are interrupted by anything the entire spell is cancelled and has to be restarted. Consequently magic gameplay is mostly running away from enemies, charging up spells, and only a portion is actually spent casting spells. Elemental damage is ridiculously imbalanced. A vast majority of enemies are weak to fire, to a comic degree, so the existence of spells that aren't fire is questionable. A non-fire spell may deal only a fraction of the damage a fire spell does against many enemies, so even though there are multiple elements they're mostly not worth using. And, because of the awkward weak spot locations on enemies; when a spell is unleashed the awkward hitbox may or may not actually touch that vulnerable spot as players can't precisely aim many spells. So the damage of the spell will vary arbitrarily.

Three classes in the game don't actually have an evasive or defensive action. So three classes can't actually do anything to avoid damage besides jump or run away. Not only is this boring, and shallow, it also means certain attacks are not actually avoidable when playing as that class. Because certain attacks simply come on too fast for manual movement to outpace them. And one of these classes is meant to be on the front-line. Some enemies and obstacles are even blatantly designed without certain class restrictions in mind, such as enemies with weak-points located so high on their bodies that melee classes can't realistically reach them.

The combat is also stifled by the asinine statistic build system. Each time players level up their statistics are automatically and permanently increased based on their class. So even though players can freely swap to any class, and are encouraged to do so for unlocking perks, each level up slowly dooms the player to have a specific build which will ultimately make them more or less effective at certain classes. And certain classes have explicitly worse statistic increases per level than others. Players can only have one save slot in this game by the way, one character.

The companion system is interesting, and like everything else in the game it is situationally fun and situationally not. Building a companion up is a nice experience but controlling and shaping their behaviour is pointlessly obscure and tedious. Companions will often speak to help the player but their dialogue is absurd. They will say the same thing over and over every time they encounter the same situation, they will often speak one after the other with no pauses inbetween, any semblance of realism is shattered by the total lack of refinement in their dialogue system. Every single time the player breaks off a cyclops tusk they will be reminded to pick it up, every single time they encounter an enemy weak to fire they will be told that enemy is weak to fire. Surprise, almost everything is weak to fire. It's baffling that the developers made such an overwhelming amount of enemies weak to one element specifically like this.

The computer behaviour on enemies and allies alike is awful. Sometimes they just won't fight, an enemy or ally will simple pace around their opponent. Sometimes enemies will perpetually run away for no reason. The pathfinding on some is atrocious, they will run in circles or go serpentine pointlessly. Companion mages are especially bad, they will often cancel their own spell charging or use inappropriate spells for the situation.

The world is largely empty. There are very little points of interest that are actually of interest, it's mostly just generic scenery and chests full of disposable loot. The game is absolutely inundated with consumables and pick ups which aren't worth the time to use. Between the lack of speaking animations on characters, the amount of enemy recycling, the emptiness of the world and all the unrefined mechanics this game feels like it was made under a distinct budget.

There is also a hard mode, which is similarly unrefined. Increased enemy damage merely means that players will potentially be knocked out instantly by maybe half the attacks in the game. The increased enemy resistance to stagger turns combat into a thoughtless damage race where strategic crowd control is entirely unreliable. While the increased gold and experience drops imbalance the game progression, and overwrite rift crystal drops which are eventually vital to upgrading equipment.

And of course this game is absolutely full of ridiculously sexualized clothing and obviously biased sexualization in general. Quite annoying that while the game gives players decent control over selecting a monogamous partner, certain quests force them into a romantic encounter with a specific character anyways.

The music is fantastic though. The story is decently interesting and unique, has some great twists and characters. But it's only told through scattered obscure quest encounters which fail to produce a comprehensive, consistent narrative even though a very consistent story is unfolding as the game progresses. Yet as unique as the overarching lore is, the rest of the game is extremely uncreative. Generic land mass of plains and woods full of generic enemies like wolves and bandits. Virtually all of the fantasy enemies are generic ones ripped from human mythology like cyclops and chimeras.


A large part of combat depends on the enemy grabbing mechanic which is extremely sloppy, inconsistent and frustrating to manipulate. Magic and elemental weakness are completely imbalanced. Atrocious ally behaviour that constantly rambles about either the same things or says things that make no sense for the moment; unrefined computer behaviour in general that results in enemies and allies alike not fighting or pathfinding properly. An empty world which offers little reward for exploration besides chests with disposable loot and extremely scant quests that can be completely missed. The story this world tells is actually quite unique, but players only experience it vaguely through a broken up series of quests that don't carry the narrative well.

Also it's worth noting that when the Dark Arisen expansion was released players were forced to purchase the whole game a second time if they wanted to get the new expansion; because the expansion was straight up only accessible through that re-released copy of the game. What an abhorrent scam.

Overall this is an okay potential game to spend time on for players that really enjoy role-playing experiences, but it just has a variety of lackluster problems that make it less than appealing from a critical standpoint.",1600753851,1685453619,False,5,4,0.449507951736450195,0,True,False,False

Dragon's Dogma has been one of my favorite games ever since it was released. Though when it was first released around 10 years ago, the content seemed a bit lacking and I never finished it.
Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen adds a lot of content outside of the main story. The whole Bitterblack Isle plot adds greatly towards the lore already established in the main game. The relationship between Arisen and Pawn was made deeper and more intricate.
Dragon's Dogma was a pioneer in its combat systems. The vocation system, as well as the Pawn AI behavior growth makes playthroughs very different each time. Climbing huge monsters, unleashing amazing spells, and having team coordinated attacks are all amazing.
Where Dragon's Dogma suffers is the lack of content, monster variety (as a lot are only reskins), and a generally empty open world. This most likely was a result of the lack of time the dev team had, aiming for an ambitious project but not having enough resources to reach their vision.
With Dragon's Dogma 2 in the horizon, I have only great hopes.

I have read and watched so many people raving about this game, and I imagine it could be really good, but it makes playing it so terrible and frustrating that frankly I cannot be bothered playing it - I play games to have fun, fun with a challenge, but I shouldn't be being irritated at every opportunity by really poorly thought out game decisions and interface decisions (this has nothing to do with difficulty of the game, which seems to be pretty easy, though I accept I have really only done the tutorial and opening.  The ""tutorial"" is a really poor way to bring players into your game, you constantly keep getting in the way of and interfering with the player's ability to have involve themselves into the game and have fun.  In combat the screen gets locked every time one of your moronic AI team mates thinks to say something - I don't care what he says (it's not important and it never is), and interrupting my combat part way through constantly so I cannot relax and enjoy the satisfaction of the combat.  

You then forced me through what could have been a passable player setup back around 2010 (and maybe not even that late, it was dead before Skyrim arrived around 2012), with inconsistent keys being used to make selections - why have you taken a completely different approach to menus than basically everyone else - that can be a good idea if you are improving things, but you really aren't and instead you replace the familiar with an inconsistent unfamiliar mess.  Then at the end you tell me I have to choose one of three classes that will lock my ability to explore and enjoy this world before I have even gotten a taste of it - NO THANK YOU, this is not acceptable, it is not good enough.  If you wish to create a world for us to explore than you need to do it in a way that allows us to grow and adapt within your game, and I have no interest in wasting my time in a game that doesn't.  I hope that with the sequel you make better choices, and I will be interested to see what you have done, but if it suffers from these same failings, I will be a refund for that (I have not refunded this product, I could have refunded it but I am hoping that the proceeds will help towards creating a better sequel).",1685171313,1685171313,False,0,4,0.362880557775497437,0,True,False,False

I wrote this long review to cover a number of details, mainly focusing on the pawn system which is one of the selling points of this game.

This game is from the Playstation 3 era. I originally played over 100 hours there. It's a fun action rpg where you fight mythical creatures. It stood out from other games at the time because of the pawn system (NPC hirelings) who you can put online (sadly you can't make parties with real people). If you aren't playing online the game will generate pawns for you which are close to your level. They can be found in the rift, or walking around in the game world as you travel (they will only stick to major roads and will not follow directions unless they're in your party).

You only get a single MAIN pawn - this is the one who you can fully customise and control the behaviour of. The two other pawns you hire have their own behaviour and physical appearance which cannot be altered, and are defined by the person who owns them - you can see details about them when hiring. Any weapons and armour you give them will be considered a gift which is gone forever. However, items you pick up off the ground can be given to other pawns for them to carry, and they might use them during a fight. 

These OTHER pawns don't level up with you like your main pawn does, so you will occasionally need to reform your party to keep it strong.

You can sit with your main pawn at a 'knowledge chair' and it will ask questions about its behaviour. The way you answer the questions will change its 'inclinations'. These describe how it will behave in battle e.g
- target strong or weak enemies first, 
- pay more attention to your safety or assist other pawns first, 
- make preparations before a fight and use healing items or let you be the one to support them. 

I found the names of each inclination confusing. They aren't explained in the official documentation, and the answers given by the pawns for each question didn't always explain if it had changed its behaviour in a way that would benefit you. 

It is best to read about the inclinations, how they effect pawn behaviour, and how they can be altered by your play style at the Dragon's Dogma wiki (this is useful info because you can accidentally change their inclinations with your play style even after telling them to behave a certain way).

If someone hires your pawn while you're not playing and takes it on a quest you haven't done or fights an enemy you haven't seen, it learns how to deal with that - e.g it might discover a weakness to fire or ice. When you come back to play, your pawn brings that knowledge to your game and will point it out to you when the time comes, and have voice lines to discuss it (though it might not mention it if you have told your pawn not to speak). 

If you decided to swap a pawn out of your party, you can send it back to its owner with a gift and message which goes to that player. Seeing different pawns people have made is part of the fun.

----
Crafting and combat:

There is a crafting and item combining system where you can make items from raw ingredients (collect herbs and mushrooms to make different potions, put raw meat and fruit/vegetables in sealed containers to preserve them, etc), so you need to carry some tools around, it's important to combine things for fighting powerful enemies because some of them might almost one-hit kill you. 

Tools you make can also be used against enemies e.g a pot of oil can be thrown on an enemy to make them more flammable. Pawns will also throw items at enemies if they have the right inclinations (I gave some bombs to a pawn, which he used, but sometimes he missed his target).

Another part of the combat is grappling. You can grab an enemy from behind while your pawn beats it up, they will also call out to you if they've grabbed an enemy. You can grab and climb larger enemies to prevent them from being so mobile, and some enemies can be pulled to the ground by grabbing their legs and putting them off balance. 

You can pick up smaller enemies and throw them at others. In one dungeon I picked up enemy zombies and threw them into a pit, which was easier than trying to 'kill' the undead. Enemies like skeletons are weaker against blunt weapons like clubs or maces, because their bones are broken apart.

----

Regarding your own character creation: 
There are skill sets called 'vocations'. You can switch between them at towns and can unlock the 'augments' from different ones. They include things like increased health, reduced fall damage, resistance to magic damage, etc. However, each vocation is locked into using certain types of weapons and armour. Your player character has access to special hybrid vocations that combine a mix of others (e.g The Assassin is a mix of Fighter and Ranger but has unique augments).

When building the physical appearance of your character, the weight of your character will effect how much they can carry, and how quickly their stamina regenerates (based on the wiki - lighter characters restore stamina more quickly but can carry less than heavier characters).

----

In conclusion, it is an interesting game with a lot of unique quirks. I have read a lot of the negative reviews here and people are frustrated by the AI, questing system and the empty feeling of the game world. Dragon's Dogma was definitely a product of its time (2013) and tried something that no other game had tried. When compared to similar to games today it does feel a bit shallow, and more like a prototype in something bigger. Dragon's Dogma 2 has been announced, so hopefully something much bigger and better is coming in the future.",1579826894,1684717036,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I think the pawn (companion) system is great and really interesting and fun. I especially loved the custom pawn you create at the start who sticks with you through the entire game. The combat is fun too, a lot of fun moves, abilities, love the climbing on top of enemies mechanics and I love how the pawns interact with each other and enemies in combat situations. I loved the pawns ""personalities"" where they would give tips and tricks for certain enemies and locations and they had their own ways of communicating. But that for me is also where the good stuff ends. 

I didnt like the open world, I found it boring and repetitive and the loot was also boring and repetitive. After a few hours I just started sprinting (with a mod cause there is no unlimited sprint in the game meaning you have to jog everywhere which is painfully slow) through all encounters cause it was all just the same. Even a chimera gets boring after killing one 8 times. And I didnt bother to explore cause I found it all boring and uninspired

The story and quests are extremely boring. Its one of the first RPGs where I skip pretty much all the dialogue and even some cutscenes because its so boring. Also this game, like many others, suffers from ""give the main character random ass quests that have nothing to do with him, the game, or his role in the world"". hello mr. Arisen, savior of the world, commander of the pawn legions, dragon´s chosen warrior, can you please go fetch my kid cause he is hiding..... Also another RPG where I didnt bother with any of the side quests. 

Difficulty was fine. I played on normal, never died to enemies but still had fun in combat. The final boss is piss easy though. Also after beating the final boss I found out the game turns into a grindy NEW GAME PLUS game where it gets harder everytime which I wasnt interested in so didnt do. 

Now I still recommend it because of the pawn system and the combat integrated with the pawn system. Would I recommend it full price? no. But on sale, yes.

Firstly, you can either min-max your build by focusing 3 different paths (full strength, full magick, hybrid) based on the final vocations you want to play, or not worry about it too much and play what you want because endgame gear is very strong (there is also a save editor where you can reassign your stats, if you really want).

Secondly, go through NG normal mode. You can pretty safely explore the majority of the map from the get go, but there are some harder enemies lurking that you can avoid early if you don't want to tango. Be sure to repeatedly hit up the quest boards, even the ones from the start of the game (these will update every so often with new stuff), and look for NPCs in the world that give quests as some are missable. Don't sweat it too much if you do miss anything.

After NG, start NG+ and run through that. You'll have a decent idea of what to do now, and you'll gain more port crystals, so this will go much quicker. Sometime before ending the game again, clear Bitterblack Isle at least twice through (most recommend level ~80+ to start).

Lastly, once you're done with at least 2 BBI clears, enter hard mode NG++. From here you can go back to BBI early and finish up your leveling very quickly since hard mode gives double XP. Hard mode isn't very hard if you're a decent level. However if you are struggling to clear BBI the second time through in normal mode, then I'd recommend sticking around for a bit until you're comfortable with the majority of it (except for a certain scythe-wielding maniac, don't worry about it too much).

Once you're capped then you're free to farm BBI, enjoy the vocations, style on everything, and watch Infinite Cringe videos in anticipation for DD2.",1683969225,1684491965,True,2,0,0.518348574638366699,0,True,False,False

This game has some strengths mainly the character creation and many role playing elements as they relate to the world people diss the travel i like it it makes for a real rpg experience, the combat however is where this game again completely falls apart which is sad cuz its supposed to be the main draw but is a total and complete failure, i would go off about its horrible balance and incredible repetitiveness but ill just restate it literally put me to sleep multiple times because its so boring. My favourite part was when i went through all of the combat and long ass quests and horribly generic and badly written, boring story just to have my one choice in the whole game what even are rpgs anymore. I could legitimately write a undegraduate thesis paper on how horribly balanced this game but i think the amount of people who never played this game for again after a few hours of gameplay and one death speaks for itself.

I bought this game at 85% off because I saw all the excitement about the sequel announcement and I was curious. I actually think it has a lot going for it. The combat at least is pretty fun; it has a good core gameplay loop. My frustrations stem from how you're asked to move around the map. It's a big map, which I appreciate. The problem is the cumbersome fast travel system. You have to buy a consumable item to fast travel and there are precious few places to which you can actually travel. 

This wouldn't be so bad if it were easier to get around the map without fast travel, but it's not. Your walking speed is a snail's pace, so you have to run to get anywhere and running consumes stamina, so you can only run for about 15 seconds at a time before your character gets winded and has to pause to breathe. Seriously, my character is supposed to be a monster-slaying hero of legend and I apparently have better cardio in real life than they do. 

Even that wouldn't be so bad if you weren't expected to keep running back and forth around the map in every quest. I've found that most of my quests so far start in a town and ask you to run halfway across the map to slay one monster. 

All that to say, I think there is a lot of potential for the sequel to be great, but they're going to need to make some serious quality of life improvements.

Very unique and innovative systems which to this day I haven't seen in other games.

The graphics are a bit dated but the remaster from a few years ago definitely seems to have helped with that.

Combat is really the strong suit of this game. It's not only visceral and impactful but it's varied and just plain fun while also having what may be the MOST INNOVATIVE systems I've ever seen. Climbing on ANY monster like Shadow of the Colossus OR grabbing and holding normal sized mobs while you or a pawn critically hits them. Also things like being able to springboard your pawns off your shield to get up to the bosses head just to give another cool example.

The pawn system is also very unique and works flawlessly. They're not only ""followers"" but offer very interesting insight into things such as the zones and quests while also having very unique ""personalities"" or inclinations as they're called. Some are more talkative and helpful while some are more aggressive in combat and/or looting chests and crates etc...

Definitely worth a buy even in 2023 onwards and the sequel was just announced during the 10 year anniversary so now is a great time to experience the original.

The only issue I had was with my brand new AMD card it didn't run very well and had some UI glitches and artifacting even though I have a beefy card (which is common for the higher end newer AMD cards). However I found a simple solution...

IF YOU HAVE A NEWER AMD CARD DOWNLOAD DXVK FROM GITHUB AND SIMPLY PUT THE FILES FROM THE x32 FOLDER IN THE GAME'S MAIN DIRECTORY WHERE DDDA.EXE IS LOCATED AND IT 100% FIXES ALL ISSUES.

Basically the DXVK software allows you to run the game using Vulkan instead of DirectX 9. It works with any older games btw you have issues with and the game not only will run without bugs but also run super smooth.

Its combat system is varied and rewarding: it encompasses nearly every single fantasy archetype you can think of while also rewarding player strategy. See that griffin flying in the sky? Cast a flaming meteor at it to burn its wings and bring it crashing to the ground. What about that chimera lurking about? Grab a giant sword and cut its snake tail off. And what of the giant cyclops? Shoot an arrow at its eye to stun it, then slash at its legs to make it topple over. Indeed, there are countless fun interactions like this from start to finish.

Moreover, the game has many inventive features, the most prominent of which being the pawn system: upon creating your custom companion character, other players may recruit them in their own worlds. Pawns become stronger and smarter as a result of helping other players in their journeys, which is an incredibly cool mechanic. The game is chock-full of awesome features like this.

That isn't to say that Dragon's Dogma is perfect—that's far from the truth. The game has many flaws, such as a crappy inventory system, a lackluster story, annoying damage calculation and a tiny world (relative to other open world games,) but if you can look past these issues then a truly one-of-a-kind experience awaits you.

They're finally developing the second one.
Basically monster hunter with classes that are more fun imo.
This game has aged extremely well and continues to age extremely well, I could play this game over and over without getting bored simply because of how much variety there is in the classes and combat. No two encounters feel exactly the same. You can even customize your companion's classes and abilities so there's tons of different combinations.
The early game is a little slow but it's only for a few quests. Definitely picks up after you get access to the other classes.
You can optimize your build if you would like but I wouldn't recommend doing so as it requires leveling up as specific classes. This is mostly a problem with the ""Hybrid"" classes (Magic Archer, Magic Knight). Though there are mods to fix that. (There are some good mods for this game that make it even more enjoyable)

Overall I'd give this game a 9/10, the world doesn't feel 100% absolutely packed at all times but it gets pretty damned close. (I also don't like the fact that you can fail certain quests if you complete other quests too early)",1683388567,1683388567,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The main thing to Dragon's Dogma is quests and taking on massive boss fights. You're going to find out how big and scary they are. Daimon, the devil I personally found hard. The story I love it... despite it being a little underwhelming. Very unique kinda game. The combat is decent... I mean, I like it at least. You can climb onto enemies, massive or small. There's 9 classes to choose from which are called Vocations. The fact that you get your own NPC pawns to be-friend during your most darkest times, that says a lot about Dragon's Dogma. I think the fast travel system is alright. Fast travel kinda sucks. Why? Well I mean, theres ""portcrystals"" you gotta place them around the map/world... Not sure what the limit is. You'll use a ""ferrystone"" to teleport. A large amount of funds are required, I guess that's why it kinda sucks. This game also has it's challenges and level of difficulty to an extent.

Very unique, open world, fantasy game at your doorstep. I've tripled the amount of hours i have in this game compared to Skyrim, that says a lot. I like it more than Monster Hunter World. Oh and I suck at it and Skyrim LOL.

As you dive deeper into the game, you'll enter a place called BLACKBITTER ISLES. What is this place you ask? Well, my friend, It's where you find the biggest, the strongest monsters in the game. The first time I entered, I literally died constantly, in-fact, I still die even now. The game produces some decent soundtrack, decent dialog, decent graphics. Day/Night cycle is awesome, but at night you can barely see anything...to the discomfort of knowing that a giant cyclops may be staring you down from 20 meters in the air. [b] [u] Here's a list of some vocations/classes this game has to offer: [/u] [/b]

[b] Fighter: [/b] Equipped with a sword and a shield. Shield in another hand. Has access to any three sword skills - and any three shields. 

[b]Warrior:[/b] (MY Fave Class) Equipped with a great-sword or a big hammer, I honestly love this class. When you penetrate ungodly blows to the monster's it's so satisfying. Best class, absolute heavy hitter power. 

[b]Strider:[/b] Two daggers and or a short bow. It's a pretty good class for long range attacks which is awesome. Access to unlimited regular arrows, limited to special arrows. You can equip three dagger skills - three shortbow skills. 

[b]Ranger:[/b] Long bow and other long ranged weapons. I personally prefer a long bow rather than short. Ranger skills are mostly around sniping far enemies. 

[b]Mage: [/b] Defensive spells and offensive spells. The mage can fire magical bolts. 

[b]Sorcerer: [/b] Mostly produces offensive spells. (You get the idea, I won't list all the classes)

[b]Conclusion?[/b] If you like slaying monsters, climbing them, you'll like this game. You want to explore some very dark places with some spooks n horrors? This game has that. Dragon's Dogma has good replay-ability. It'll never stop giving you a challenge, my best advice to you is that you prepare for it. The game is well worth playing. Take up arms and fight. So, look, it's now or never, Arisen.

I felt the need to add some more: [b]The bad? [/b] The game doesn't really disclose where you can find side quests. I almost struggle with that every time. Or their location for that matter. You can only save 1 game file at a time.  It's tedious and frustrating when you have to do everything yourself. But hey, everything is about patience and learning!

My only cons are:

-Travel speed: It's a big world and you get no option of a mount and fast traveling is very limited. You have to run around everywhere on foot. I love the teleport crystal system of creating your personal own travel points, finding them in a dungeon felt really rewarding as well. To improve on this issue in the sequel I would say either A) Infinite stamina while out of combat or B) Adding some form of mounts. The slow world travel is what turns most people off of the game which is really a shame.

-Improving the Warrior Class: Every vocation in this game feels and plays great, except for Warrior. The warrior vocation is very limited in what it can do as the number of skills you can normally equip is halfed. The hyper armor of your skills is also mediocre at best so getting your big hits in is really a gamble. Warrior certainly needs a rework for the sequel.

-Improved Menus: Dragons Dogma features a great variety of items you can use and a crafting system. The problem is that these systems are aggravating to use due to the inventory UI. A UI overhaul for menus and inventories could greatly improve the quality of life of the game and would encourage to further utilize the crafting and item systems that were overlooked because of it. The crafting system is also a bit difficult to use since you basically need to use a wiki or write down recipes. 

-Enemies not available until post game: A large variety of enemies can't be fought until the post game or in the Darkest Isles expansion zone. Per example, you can briefly encounter a hydra near the beginning of the game but you do not actually fight one until the post game. A lot of enemies in the main game are the same few ones recycled with different varieties

Other than those fixable issues most people in the community agree on. Dragon's Dogma is literally one of the best rpg's ever made. Wide variety of weapons and armor. (Almost) Every vocation feels unique and great to play. Enemies are fun to fight against and more.

[*] Grigori's voice is enchanting and inspiring...

CONS:
[list]
[*] The environment isn't much to gawk at.
[*] Enemy variety is scarce, especially in the base-game.
[*] The world could be bigger, maybe with more cities/towns. 
[*] Not entirely a deal-breaker, considering the pawn system, but: no true multiplayer/co-op.

I originally played this game (a lot) on the XBOX 360 back when ""Dark Arisen"" first came out. It was a lot of fun back then, in spite of the performance issues that were present on the console at the time- (even back in 2013, the 360 was definitely showing its age).
The performance on this PC port is great- as it should be, given that the game is a decade old.
The keyboard-and-mouse controls aren't bad at all, which is sadly something of a rarity when it comes to ports.
(""Real Yakuza Use A Controller"" and all that jazz)

The visual upgrades honestly don't seem to be that outstanding, but that could be because I haven't played the 360 version since I was fifteen years old. I'm sure if I went back to try and play it on console, it'd be a noticeable downgrade.
The game as a whole has a very consistent style- somewhere between an anime aesthetic and semi-realistic graphics.
It has that early/mid-2010s color-scheme that every game at the time had: ""Brown = Realistic"" AKA ""Everything needs to be gritty/dirty/ugly because muh Skyrim"".
Everything becomes especially de-saturated after the story's mid-point (You'll know when.)
I usually prefer something more on the saturated side.
High Fantasy > Low Fantasy in my book, the real world is bleak enough. Give me some vibrant colors to go with my RPG.
That being said, in this case, I think that it fits. You can tell that the developers had a vision for the world and stuck to it- they weren't just muting the colors for the sake of making an edgelord's paradise.

The gameplay is some of the most fun I've had in an action-RPG.
Usually I gravitate more towards the classic turn-based style, mostly because most ""Action-RPGs"" boil down to ""Dodge>Attack>Dodge>Attack"", or in the case of Bethesda's RPGs ""Attack>Heal>Attack>Heal"".
No hate on games that do things that way, they definitely have their place in the industry. I likely have more hours in Bethesda RPGs than I do in any other developer's games, after all. They're doing something right.
That being said, every fight in this game rewards the player for actually using their brain.
Monsters have elemental weaknesses to exploit, critical-hit points on their bodies, specific behaviors to memorize and exploit as you learn their patterns, it's wonderful.
Being harassed by a flock of Harpies? Use some flaming arrows / fire spells / AOE melee attacks with a fire weapon to knock them out of the air, then finish them off on the ground.
Giant Cyclops spawn in the woods in front of your party? Jump on his legs, climb all the way up to his eyeball and start punching it until he falls over.
Bandits trying to plunder your corpse? Find a way to knock them over, pick them up, and throw them over a nearby cliff to finish the fight quickly.
There are so, so, so many ways to deal with fights. The variation in monster-types combined with the variation between classes and skills brings so much to the table.

The ""Pawn"" system- (it's the game's companion system)- is one of my favorite features of the game.
Basically, in addition to creating your player-character, you also get to create a companion that follows you throughout the entirety of the game. You customize their appearance, voice, and even their combat behaviors to an extent.
Everything that you can tweak on your own character can be tweaked on this companion. It's a brilliant addition that I'm surprised hasn't been used in more RPGs over the past decade.
Your pawn ""learns"" as you play the game, with a ""Knowledge Panel"" that slowly fills-out as you reveal more monster's weaknesses. This brings an extra aspect of progression to your pawn that makes them more and more useful over time.

The story is absolute dingus, there's no two ways about it.
I get that they were going for a ""simple, generic fantasy"" story, but come on. At least try.
The terrible voice-acting for some characters (English Dub) definitely doesn't help.
The ""Bitterblack Isle"" expansion is substantially better in regards to story- but only because they took a step back and left most of the plot-points implied- with exposition dialogue being kept to a minimum.

The music is... honestly, it's pretty forgettable. The main-menu's music being the one exception.
Everything in-game is very understated- to the point where most of the time you won't even realize that music is playing.
An Elder Scrolls Game, this is not.

""Why is there only one save-slot?""
Because this game is meant to be replayed *after* it's finished. It ties into the story itself.
I've never had any issues with my saves corrupting/deleting before, after having played nearly a dozen full completions.
You even carry over your armor and weapons from your previous play-through, which gets you past the introductory areas in about half the time- so it's not quite as much of a slog as you might think. I personally like to sell these carried-over items to buy new equipment for a different class- because who wants to play the same character over and over in an RPG?
That being said, if you like to meta-game and make your decisions irrelevant by save-scumming your way through every RPG you play, this might be a deal-breaker for you.
If you're unhappy with a decision you made / the outcome it brought, then do things differently in your 2nd run.

TL;DR
The deep game-play, progression, and companion system make this one of my favorite RPGs ever, in spite of a lackluster story and mediocre music. Also, Bitterblack Isle is one of the best expansions I've played, and I've probably spent more time there than I have in the main game.",1483222914,1682082234,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

To this day, I've yet to find a game quite like Dragon's Dogma. Between the innovative and dynamic combat and the unique pawn system, this game is a true hidden gem!

The best part of the game is definitely the combat. You can climb enemies to reach their weak points such as scaling a Cyclops to jab your dagger into its eye, grab onto a Chimera's tail to cleave it off. You or your pawns can even restrain smaller enemies! Your strategies even change based on the class you play and the pawns you bring with.

The second most notable feature of the game is the pawn system. Basically it's a companion that you design and train how you'd like. You choose their appearance, gear, class, personality, and how they approach combat. Then you can share your pawn with other players or restrict who can see them. Other players can hire your pawn and bring them on their adventure. Your pawn can then come back with knowledge about the places, quests, and enemies that they encountered which helps them grow and be more proficient in combat and helping guide you! It's a very unique feature that, given it's novelty, is implemented quite well!

More on the combat: the enemies are also very unique and fit perfectly into this great blend of medieval fantasy setting. There's goblins, cyclops, chimeras, hydras, giant lizards, griffins, and many more!

The class options are also quite varied for you and your pawn. Each feel different and have a clear focus on what they bring to the party. There are eight classes in total: Fighter, Warrior, Strider, Ranger, Assassin, Mage, Sorcerer, Mystic Knight, and Magick Archer. Your pawn can be six of those; they cannot be the Mystic Knight or Magick Archer. They're considered hybrid classes and would likely cause imbalance if pawns could be them.

This would be even longer than it is if I went into all the classes but I would like to highlight some things that standout to me. Sorcerer truly feels like you're a very powerful magic user. From the animations to the spells themselves, if you've ever wanted to feel like a badass wizard, that's your class. Mystic Knight and Magick Archer are two classes I've basically never seen in any other game. Magick Archer being my favorite. It's as the name suggests, an archer that uses magic. Your arrows are completely magic and can track/hone in on enemies to a degree. They exploit elemental weaknesses and have huge utility and some support skills. Mystic Knight uses a tower shield and focuses on reactive, countering gameplay while enchanting their bigass shield to exploit elemental weaknesses. They also get a magic cannon where they lob magic orbs at enemies by hitting a magical sphere. It's pretty great.

While I absolutely love this game, it does have it's flaws. Many people will tell you it's the story and I don't really disagree. I think that Dragon's Dogma has some interesting lore and story, but I don't think it was executed very well. It's hard to pick up on and understand some of the setting and world building at times.

The other flaw I would highlight is the lack of details around building your pawn. Today, there's a lot of information online about how pawns work and how to understand to build them, but the game itself really does not explain at all what the inclinations mean or how they influence your pawn's behavior. I would recommend looking into it a bit so your pawn will behave more how you expect. They will never be perfect, but can absolutely be effective even on their own if trained right!

This was very long, but hopefully it finds someone who wasn't sure about playing the game and helps them to decide to check out this amazing, hidden gem! I recently played through the game again and had a blast! I hope that if you decide to play, that you find it as enjoyable as I do!

At first I thought the game gave off such a DULL atmosphere, the colors dead everywhere. MAN was I wrong when I thought I beat the game for the first time...
I think of it now and see that the dull colors add to the rustic medieval fantasy feel. I see it well done in this context. 

The pawn AI is actually helpful, most of the time, I feel like your pawn truly mimics YOUR play style. But also sometimes you find yourself shouting at them ""NO! YOU USELESS PIECE OF-"" ""COME HERE!! WHAT THE HELL HELP ME"" ""I KNOW WOLVES HUNT IN PACKS""
HOWEVER- when I thought my pawn useless and I went on adventuring without them- I actually found myself wishing them back, they WERE helpful. The lack of pawn is very noticeable to say the least lol

Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen is an action RPG game developed by Capcom. It is an open-world game that allows players to explore a vast fantasy world filled with danger and adventure. The game is known for its innovative combat system and unique mechanics, which set it apart from other RPGs.

One of the standout features of Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen is its combat system. Unlike other RPGs, where players typically rely on a combination of button mashing and leveling up their characters to progress, Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen requires players to use strategy and tactics to defeat their enemies. Players have to choose their weapons and abilities carefully and adapt to different enemy types to succeed. You have three classes to choose from, I had the most fun with the Archer class.

Another unique feature of Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen is its pawn system. Players can create and customize their own pawns, which are essentially AI-controlled companions that fight alongside the player. Pawns can be customized in terms of their appearance, abilities, and personality. Pawns can also be shared with other players online, allowing for a sense of community and cooperation.

The world of Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen is vast and immersive. The game is set in a medieval fantasy world filled with magic, dragons, and other mythical creatures. The game's graphics are stunning and the world is filled with beautiful landscapes and detailed environments. The game's sound design is also impressive, with a score that sets the mood and enhances the overall experience.

The game's story is compelling and well-written. The player takes on the role of the Arisen, a chosen hero who must defeat the Dragon and save the world. Along the way, the player will encounter a variety of interesting characters and factions, each with their own motivations and agendas. The game's story is told through a combination of cutscenes, dialogue, and exploration, allowing players to immerse themselves in the world and the characters.

One of my favorite aspects of the game was being able to climb certain emenies and attack ( or chop off) areas that make enemies weaker or less threatening.

In conclusion, Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen is a must-play game for fans of RPGs and open-world games. Its innovative combat system, unique pawn system, immersive world, and compelling story make it a standout title in its genre. While its difficulty may be a turn-off for some players, it is ultimately a rewarding experience that is sure to provide hours of entertainment.",1680979507,1680979507,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You are the chosen one. You are following a story where you are hunting down a dragon. The game has lots of free-roam and there is an aspect of collecting items that I particularly like. I enjoy replaying dungeons to collect loot to get better armor. 

The choices you make in this game matter and there are often times more than one ways to complete a quest.

1 - The swordplay is awesome, I really enjoy slashing around with the weapon and the attacks of melee classes.
2 - the aesthetics are wonderful, real medieval Europe look to the armor and weaponry. The clothes, especially.
3 - Generally it's beautiful. the monsters, the landscapes, the sky, the scenery, the buildings all look absolutely gorgeous.
4 - magic, while i've not fully explored it as of now, looks beautiful and varied, heavily elemental but it's tied to a weakness/resistance mechanic and so plays astonishingly well.
5 - you can turn off the speech lines of your companions. Trust me, this is a good feature.
6 - Monsters of lore are included in manners in which they are described through history - Chimera are literally three headed, hydra resemble serpents, wyrms and draconic creatures alike are all done justice to, truly
7 - there is a gear upgrade system which isn't too complex and exploring, even when searching for resources, is actually fun rather than a slog (ahem, AC Oddysey, ahahem)
8 - Enemy AI can be rather challenging, as opposed to a braindead model that has no idea how to take advantage of you.
9 - enemy types have individual strengths and weaknesses
10 - there is a mechanic in which wind tunnels are formed in the landscape, and your character can be caught in the draft. as in, pushed about. and their size and strength stat actually effects how well they can fight the forces of it. This is gorgeous.
11 - You can stagger enemies with attacks and, once staggered, grab them. if they are the same size or smaller than you (aka a human or animal or human size monster like a goblin or a harpy), you pick them up like an item. this includes bats, mice, rats, wolves, rabbits, goblins, hobgoblins, harpies, zombies, humans, etc. you can in fact then THROW them. the ultimate disrespect. Now, you can still grapple larger enemies - you CLIMB them like the absolute unit you are, and claw your way to their weak spots to dole out your relatively small fury with whatever weapon you wield! a cyclops irritating you? grab it's leg and march to that big beady eye! you are as badass as you want to be!
12 - even in death, you are a badass. I have died in this game and thought ""that was so cinematic that i wish wholeheartedly that i'd been recording"" - if you're wondering, i was launched off a cliff by a stone golem when i attempted to claw my way up it's arm.

9/10 from me - only flaws being that it's a single save file, which is overwritten whenever you save, it autosaves or you begin a new game. annoying but not a gigantic deal if you're cautious. that and the ""pawn"" system has some flaws - most of the pawns you get, being unavoidably AI, are rather birdbrained. some of them will even run off to grab things from the woods if you're travelling.

- I don't like being forced to have AI companions, and their AI is bad
- AI companions constantly repeat the same voice lines
- As a mage, I feel like my attacks do nothing. Cast times are long for actual spells and my main damage spell takes maybe 1% of a health bar. Otherwise I sit there quick attacking which also takes practically no health off.
- There doesn't appear to be any way to aim my spells at a certain target

The action benefits from the history of fighting and hack and slash games in the development team.

The high difficulty of the game makes the game rewarding to beat the first time, as well as the second time and every time after that.

The grind can be pretty fun, and you'll want to because my one big complaint is how short the main campaign is. I've played before on console so I knew to try and drag out the experience (could do great with daily needs for the MC) and even so I could probably end the campaign in under 80 hrs in the main game. Bitterblack makes up for this pretty amazingly, getting lost in it and facing all variety of intense enemies is a whole game in itself. 
Inventory, equipment, and upgrades are all pretty cool, not over complicated but you really have to work to get the materials and meet the right conditions to max out. Items matter, they aren't over abundant but you don't have to farm them either, except for the higher level upgrade requirements and top tier gear.

It's a social experiment to determine the obsession necessary to complete the most frustrating non-game imaginable. There's no way this giant turd could have been made by accident. Every choice was obviously focused on the most aggravating gameplay. 1) There's 2 inventory screens. 2) There's no map button. You have to hit Esc to get to the menu to get to any page (quest, map, etc) and inventory because there's a key (I) to access inventory but's it's a slightly different inventory than the menu inventory. 3) The ""light"" takes the new world record for most idiotic light source. So it's dark most of the time; 50% of the time outside and 100% inside (tombs, catacombs, caves, etc). And most time is spent indoors. More than enough magic, actually too much, but not one reasonable, REASONABLE, magic source of light. You have to run around with a lantern that you must refill every 3-4 minutes of gameplay with oil that you must constantly be looting (insert looting simulator here) to keep it lit. Many places that require a light source, and I mean require because it's completely pitch black without it, also have pools and streams and falls of water, yes waterfalls and every instance extinguishes the lantern. Now, to turn it back on you have to 1) Hit ""I"" to open inventory 2) Click on ""tools"" 3) Click on lantern. If it's not on the first page you''ll have to drag scroll the page to find your lantern because the mouse scroll isn't configured or configurable with mouse scrolling (another gripe you'll hear about) 4) Click on lantern again to open the options menu 5) Click on ""put away"" 6) Watch character action of putting the lantern away (you must watch this or the next parts are unavailable) 7) Repeat all actions again to equip the lantern, so hit ""I"" to open inventory 8) Click on ""tools"" 9) Click on lantern 10) Click on lantern again to open the options menu 11) Click on ""equip"" 12) And now you get light again. Then you run 3 steps and the lantern goes out again. I  s h i t  you not this will happen 10-20 times in a row. More than enough to lose your  s h i t. A true test of self-masochism. Ok now 4) (because all of that was #3) Doors always close behind you. Small but still annoying. It's a pain having to turn around an open the door I just opened especially since there's a considerable amount and it's takes time and it's an annoying timely little action. You have to stop, the toon lifts it's hand, the door slowly opens and you can't even run up to it and open it, you have to stop moving completely while you're button mashing to open the door. Just another straw on the camel's back. 5) Every quest is a chore. There's no logic or reasoning. It's never simple. I have to google just about everything to the point where I'm using a walkthrough. Quest can be missed and all non-main quest can be  failed permanently. Many side quests consist of killing a number of certain creatures. If you like to explore, and chances are you do if you're playing this type of game, you'll get many quests after completing them by chance but not getting credit. So now you have to do it twice. There are instance that can lead to no more main quests. I finished a main quest only to be left with no more quests. I wasn't listening to another long cutscene. I was supposed to talk to a certain person but there was no record of previous conversations . I was in quest limbo until I talked with a certain individual. I had to use the guide to know what I needed to do. They really could have left it in the quest log. 6) Way too many categories in the inventory menu and way, way too many items that could go into category. What a clusterf uck! This one get's another world record. There are literally thousands of ""Curatives"", ""Tools"", ""Materials"", ""Specials"", and ""Others"". So many in fact that they didn't have enough icons to represent them so there are ""Curatives"", ""Tools"", ""Materials"", ""Specials"", and ""Others"" that all have the exact same icon. sometimes there are 10+ different ""Curatives"", ""Tools"", ""Materials"", ""Specials"", and ""Others"" that all have the exact same icon. This gets overwhelmingly confusing to the point where you just don't care about the game itself. It's a giant looting simulator on steroids. 7) Mouse scroll button is essentially useless. I believe it's used for one useless task. I used it once to discover how useless it was. 8) Your pawns are morons. These suicidal idiots will throw themselves off cliffs at every opportunity and it's a fuc king pain to get them back. You'll always lose them on your way to a boss with no way to retrieve them, or a giant run backwards to a riftstone just to revive them. Hoping to hell they don't find a hole to jump into on your way back. 9) This one is huge for me. There's only one save, ever. Only one game can be played and one save per game. You can manually save but it also auto-saves and you can't turn it off. So just about every action is permanent. The auto-save is terrible and will eventually fu ck your game. 10) Quitting the game is a pain. It's one of those bulls hit games that make you return to the title screen, then make you wait until it orders you like monkey to press any button to continue, because that's what I want to do when I want to quit a game, I want to continue. WTF!? So now it goes to the screen that allows you to ""Exit"". Basically this game is laughing as it's giving you the finger while buttfuc king you.",1679528209,1679528209,False,4,6,0.443219304084777832,0,True,False,False

It definitely should have been up in leagues with Skyrim because it's literally Skyrim but with better combat. Unfortunately it released with a bunch of big giant games.

You shouldn't really play the game for the story.
Decent character creation that has impact on what your class will be and what feats you'll be able to do like if you're tall, you'll be able to climb higher or if you're fat, you're a lot less mobile and lack stamina which this game has a lot of running to do unless you use the infinite ferrystone which you get at the capital, Gran Soren's bank.
Ferrystones are consumable items that let's you fast travel/teleport to areas with portcrystals or portcrystals that you place physically in the world.
Companions are the online aspect, basically you can use your friend's or random people's created NPCs to help you on your adventure.
Bitterblack Isle is an end-game area, don't do it yet unless you want a challenge. You get here from a quest a Cassardis at night-time docks.
Speed run mode exists.
Only 1 save file, so do not mess up.

The questing can be stupid because you do the smallest thing and you fail a questline so you have to read a quest guide. But I learned that you shouldn't really care about failing a few because you'll be playing New Game + anyways. 
Overall just read a  quest guide and most importantly do not fail the Lost & Found questline early on because it could lock you out of a region. I'd avoid doing the main questline because it's easy to complete and if you progress too far, you automatically fail side quests.

Here are quests that you should do based on Relevant Rewards:

 [*]Dying of Curiosity
 [*]A Troublesome Tome
 [*]Chasing Shadows
 [*]Land of Opportunity
 [*]Escort Duty [i](Has prerequisite quests but also a valuable item the Gold Idol which you duplicate and forge. Do not make the little girl you are escorting angry, be quick with tasks, and do not push her. You get the reward by talking to her afterwards unless you do some cheating and parkour to get the item on a pillar)[/i]

- Terrible balance. Enemy fighters are ridiulously overpowered compared to other enemy types. 
- Absolutely ancient save mechanics. There's only one slot and it gets automatically overriden all the time. 
- Awful ingame menus, overloaded with buttons. 
- Loads of quests that give you basically no directions of where to go
- Quest do not give you any information about the required level. You get some quests early on where you absolutely don't stand any chance against the enemies. Super fun!
- Annoying health system that forces you to rest at inns. 
- Fast travel system heavily overcomplicated and unflexible 
- Progress sometimes requires you to do perform certain actions. What are those actions? Well have a guess, game doesn't tell you. (Example: To get past the waygate to Grand Soren you have to have a rest at the encampment earlier in the game. Have fun finding that out without google.)

I am in love with the vocation system and how each one has their own unique levels. I myself spent quite a bit of time alternating between the different vocation to level and just try them out. Each one is unique in their own way and most strive at one specific thing. 

The pawn system was an interesting approach and take on the idea of including a Multiplayer system into the game. A lot of pawns have been crafted by players to benefit the player in crucial ways, Whilst others are just kind of put together because they have to be. Sometimes it felt like I was babysitting my pawns having to pick them up a lot, but other times they do an insane amount of damage against downed monsters that makes a fight of 5 phases feel like a fight of 1.

The story was insane. The first time I played through this game I was interested but it kind of felt basic... that is, until you kill the dragon, Then man oh man what a strange turn that took. When I started playing this game it felt like such a cliche story line. You're a specially chosen Warrior or whatever destined to kill a dragon and save humanity. Cool right? Well then after me doing a bunch of stuff and quests and whatever 26 hours later I finally went ahead and killed the dragon. Died, a lot. But eventually pulled through it, and I kind of figured well that's probably the end of the game. Well, have I never been more wrong. Entering the Everfall was where I had become more interested in a game than I had ever been. Especially the second time. The phrase, ""The ever turning wheel"" makes soooooooo much more sense once you finish the game a second time, and seriously it had my jaw on the floor I was so shocked. Very good and very well put together story.

The combat in Dragon's Dogma is also fantastic. The climbing feature onto monsters double, triple, even 4x your size is a really cool feature. I killed many MANY cyclops in this game and it so fun to scale the creature  to his head and plunge a sword directly into it's eye and it feels rewarding doing such a thing. Even with Golems where you have to circle the entire creature to take him down, and the Wyrms are just a whole different story. Unfortunately I wish the final boss battle had a better climbing feature because trying to hit his heart as a Warrior did not work very well. My pawns ended up doing most the damage but every time he was down I was able to wail on him. But I've played games with worse fights.

Now for the thing I am not too fond of with this game. The story line the second time you play it is not that long especially with the side quests. By the end of my first play through I was a level 52. By the end of my second I was 67. Then I though okay, I'm going to go Bitterblack Isle. Yeah, still not able to do it. Most people recommend between 70-80 in order to do it, and yeah it's difficult alright. Which I am not opposed to but I'm not too fond of getting one shot because of one bad move. So I thought okay well I can't do this because I am dying way too often. So I went to fight the Ur Dragon, which I also can't do because I need to be level 100. Plus, I have to be a range character to even defeat the creature. Now, it's more so my fault I know because I don't really want to play the game through 2 more times just to get to the levels in order to do such a fight, so I think I'm going to just not do the harder content because questing, and killing monsters seems to not be enough to get to those higher levels without just Cheesing the leveling system. So yes, it's of course my fault for lacking the patience but I also am not that determined to do the those particular boss fights anyway.

Directed by my favourite game director and godfather to my children, Hideaki Itsuno, it felt more surprising it took me this long to get to it than anything else. Not to say I avoided the game; I bought it on PS4 in 2017 with full intention of playing it. The problem was, as an 18 year old in school, dedicating a ton of time to a JRPG, or several, if you have a backlog like mine, is tough. As a 23 year old who's currently unemployed? Much easier. In addition to my obvious love of Devil May Cry 3, 4 and 5, the explosive reaction to Dragon's Dogma 2 also served as the final push I needed to finally take a look and see just what the mad man's dream project was. Standing at the end of the game, I can say this.

Dragon's Dogma is the best ""9/10 7/10"" game since Devil May Cry 4. Fitting, given Itsuno directed both games one after another, and they were both subject to incredibly obvious time and budgetary constraints. But what do I mean by that?

A ""9/10 7/10"" is my personal term for a game that, structurally, is a bit of a mess. Using DMC4 as our example, the game's blatantly held back from being all it could be. Its level designs, especially Fortuna Castle and the forest, are messes that display blatant padding (to say nothing of the infamous dice game, easy as it may be to cheese), there's some aggravating enemy types and a pair of outright bad bosses, and the game's second half is the dev team running out of time and money so they had to make Dante run backwards through the game. To those uninitiated, DMC4 sounds like a tire fire of a game from that description. But it's the gameplay that serves to help me look past all that. Depending on who you ask, some may tell you DMC4's insane levels of depth and complexity still rank it above 3 and 5 for them, in spite of those games being more complete and arguably having more to them at first glance.

Dragon's Dogma is no different.

In JRPG fashion, the intro is a slow one, combined with a surprisingly steep difficulty curve. Stamina and weight play a huge factor across the game; the former being exactly what you'd expect, while the latter is a hard limit on the amount of items you and your party members can carry. A cool idea on paper, a nightmare if you hit the cap while exploring and have to do some menuing to trade things between party members to claim your spoils. An incredibly limiting fast travel system leads to a lot of walking the expansive overworld with a specific item allowing you to plant expensive fast travel points where you desire, and expiring side quests that the game makes no attempt to warn you about. All of these make for a game I'm sure many have dropped over the years.

And yet, Dragon's Dogma makes for one of the most enthralling JRPGs I've sat down to see through to the end. The pawn system makes for a great way of building community in a game thats still a single player JRPG and making every playthrough feel unique in a way I wish Xenoblade Chronicles 2, a game I also love to death, had gone with in place of its cumbersome gacha-lite system. While not up there with Itsuno's DMC works in terms of pure depth and complexity, combat between the various classes are a blast as long as you're well prepared for enemies you need to fight at a range and have a mage for healing, and it only furthers my opinion on the pawn system, as any you hire will gradually learn things like quests and ways to dispatch enemy types from the players who hire them, or casting magic in sync to power up a strike. Combined with the ability to scale enemies to provide a sensation of felling a giant beast in a way few other titles can replicate, a ton of moves upon each vocation, an expansive extra dungeon in the form of the Bitterblack Isle, and a fantastic soundtrack to cap it off (seriously, the first time the track 'End Of The Struggle'  blasts during the climax with a major boss is a life changing moment), you've got near endless amount of combinations to make a playthrough feel unique.

While its story is mostly window dressing and you can absolutely tell it suffers from the fact that Capcom higherups kicked down the doors and told Itsuno ""Hey, wrap it up, we don't care if it's not ready yet"", there's a likeable cast throughout (especially Mercedes, the indisputable best girl) and the ending to the postgame left me floored in ways I haven't felt since Asura's Wrath.

And yet, as much as I loved my time with Dragon's Dogma, to the point I'm close to nabbing every single achievement at the time of writing, I still see a mountain of potential. The power of current gen platforms, combined with the budget, time and goodwill that Itsuno has earned after Devil May Cry 5 was a smashing success, are doubtless to make the upcoming Dragon's Dogma 2 the equivalent to this title as DMC5 is to 4: Over a decade removed, but treated with every bit as much love and care as it deserves, and without losing any of its identity in the process, each serving as a true successor to woefully unfinished masterworks.

The game visually looks okay for being made in 2013, but suffers from the blandest color scheme I have ever seen. I understand it's supposed to be some sort of dark fantasy atmosphere, which is fine, but the environments look so utterly boring that I struggled to remember where anything was. Dark Souls has the same color scheme yet still manages to look interesting environmentally, for a comparison.

The story makes no sense thus far, as my character had their heart ripped out for no reason by a dragon...which made my character undying or something. The side characters give no explanation of what happened, and the player's companions (Pawns) are blank-slated idiots who couldn't tell you what color the sky is.

Combat is somewhat fun, but I couldn't figure out a way to dodge attacks. The strategy seemed to be to not over commit or to stunlock weaker enemies. Either way, it wasn't extremely engaging.

Finally, the story missions were mostly frustrating. The only exciting part came when I fought an ogre thing and shot it in the eye for increased damage.
The last mission I played involved escorting an oxcart that moves at a snails pace, all while a legion of monsters tries killing it. This would be boring enough if the enemies posed a challenge, or if an unavoidable boulder didn't roll directly into the ox, depleting about 50% of its health. I lost interest after somehow completing this mission.

In summary, this game feels like if you mixed Skyrim's open world and Dark Souls' atmosphere/gameplay style, but only took the bad parts from both of them.

- Gigachad Mystic Knight class lets you enchant your shield and let it explode in your enemies' faces. If you wanna be a battlemage, you should try this game
- Very immersive companion AI. They have their own personalities that shows in combat, but also have certain experiences and knowledge that they will share
- Badass combat/magic system.
- Game has large enemies and is designed for them. They move appropriately to their surroundings, not tripping up or getting stuck every two seconds, and you can even climb them during combat.

Cons:
- pathetic carry weight, paired with dozens of ""miscellaneous"" items that can be combined in various ways (but you have to guess every combination). For me it causes some headaches
- cryptic story and lots of riddles or lack of direction (gets particularly bad if you start playing after a pause)

Gameplay: Challenging but not too challenging, of course, it may show it's age (a little bit), it's still functional, personal favorite was the climbing, something about just climbing up the Cyclops just to dice it into sushi is just...wow, not to mention that when you start the game, you are LITERALLY sent to the tutorial first, that being that and a prologue mission to the game really sets the mood (somewhat), let's not forget: Pawns, their mechanics are impressive (i.e: if you and your party of pawns created by other people charge into a boss room, the pawn's personailty will change to fit your style of adventuring) oh and character creation too, i think you'll know what to do when you see that, speaking of which, The Story.

Story: To be honest, it can be a little slow at first, As I did mention, the prologue mission sends you straight into gameplay, no cutscenes until the end of the prologue. then you get sent to the character creation stuff, blah blah blah. then after all that's done, the actual story slides back a bit, as usual, I can't really explain much about the story, but this one I really can't explain much but all I can say is this: Near the end of the story, things might get a bit crazy

Music: Banger, and this game gave me two personal favorites: Eternal Return and Into Free, it's a little bit of a mish mash of music genres between Hard Rock and Orchestral music (I'm pretty sure you could even hear someone shredding a guitar in the background while fighting a boss)

Note: if necessary, feel free to look at the DD Wiki, it can be helpful at times (just don't accidentally spoil yourself the story)

Overall, was it worth finishing the game after 9-8 years? Yeah, it just feels accomplishing, makes me miss my Xbox though lol, so in my humble opinion: 9.9/10, Thanks for the childhood memories, Capcom.

I fell in love with the combat and the introduction to Gregory the dragon at the start of the game. I didn't get around to finishing it because I moved onto other titles, in my head I built up Dogma to be an entire game just like that opening. After over a year I came back to it and now have played way more, something I partly regret because now the fantasy of what I thought the game was has been washed away and underneath I see what it really is.

Dogma draws you in with a fantastic intro to a dragon who curses you and sets up perfectly in a way that makes you want to lean everything you can about it, it's power it's backstory, it's world and so much more. Too bad the dragon barely appears for the rest of the game. Instead enjoy running fetch quests for random boring NPC's that no one likes or cares about whilst other people stand around dropping exposition that almost never even has anything to do with the dragon. 

Whilst doing fetch quests enjoy running out of stamina every 10 seconds as you go from location to location. Don't you dare explore off the main path and try collecting items because your character will run out of space and you'll have to spend 5 mins passing everything onto your NPC Ally to carry after every fight. 

When this happens you'll learn the joy that is the menus which are clunky to say the least. For example to fast travel you'd think you could just click the location on the map right? Wrong! You have to go searching through your innovatory for an item that lets you travel and then it brings up a map. Then you still can't just click where you want to go. You have you scroll through another clunky menu. Why is it so overly complex for such a simple feature?

It really does feel as though the further into the game I get, the worse it becomes.

As you can see by my hours and my now positive review, things have changed. The writing grew on me, the story turned to be much more interesting than I thought at first glance, I came to appreciate the artstyle for its genuine attempt at blending ""fantastic"" with ""sensible"", and the gameplay...Good lord, the gameplay.

Let me put it this way; Dragon's Dogma has the best goddamn combat in an action RPG. Not even the Souls games can compare. To this day, I haven't seen any other RPG that has even attempted to make combat as dynamic, fluid, exciting, and just f*cking sick as DG's. It starts clunky at first, but once you get used to the controls and unlock a few more skills, it gradually opens up in ways you couldn't have imagined when you first started playing the game. Battles are chaotic, methodic, brutal, and the best part is it doesn't have to rely on gimmicky pre-scripted scenes to make them look awesome. Warriors hit like trucks and manouvre just as bad as one, landing bow shots is satisfying as all hell, and magic is a spectacle to behold and stupidly overpowered, as it should be. DG's dragon fights make Skyrim's look even more pathetic.

Developers keep making and designing huge, gargantuan monsters to fight, and every time, the only thing you do is hack at their feet. But Dragon's Dogma says ""f*ck that noise"" and lets you interact with bosses in ways almost no other game lets you. The Cyclops has a helmet that covers its weakspot? Climb on his head and have him take it off. A Troll is kicking your *ss? Trick him into charging towards you and watch as he falls off a cliff. Gryphon about to take off? Grab onto it as it does and force him to land. And I haven't even mentioned the regular enemies. With so many options and ways to approach fights, rather than becoming a chore or something you dread having to do, combat is the meat and bones of the game. It's so, soooo f*cking good.

Play this game, seriously. If you can power through the lackluster early game, you'll find a diamond in the rough like no other. There's still a lot of things that could be improved, but the things that it does well, it does them really well. This game came out in 2012, and no one has learned anything from it, and that's a crying shame, because Dragon's Dogma is some of the most fun i've ever had with a combat system in an RPG.",1515012261,1677923357,True,1,0,0.446839034557342529,1,True,False,False

Fast travelling essentially doesn't exist until the start of mid-game and is plagued with possibly the worst stamina bar ever. Dated UI and odd design choices for a few of the systems. Coupled with amazing combat and engaging enemies, it's an 8/10.

~

This game has so many things wrong with it. Funky fast-travelling system, an affection/romance meter that's odd at best and wildly jank at worst, possibly the most awful stamina bar I've seen in any real time RPG. Despite all this, Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen sits comfortably in my top 10 games of all time, all thanks to it's innovative combat, unique pawn system and a diverse set of enemies that will test your skills.

The gimmick that separates this game from other similar RPG's is the pawn system. A pawn is a companion that you create and will follow you, watching your every move and studying certain parts of the map. If the pawn notices you climbing onto a chimera's tail and smacking the ever living f*ck out of it, it will slowly start doing the same. At first, it's a little clumsy. However, keep doing it and with the proper gear and knowledge, your pawn could potentially take down dangerous enemy all on its own thanks to your teaching.

This game also has an online function. You can employ other people's pawn and view their entire kit, down to the rings they wear and skills they've equipped. You can also see how well they can take on specific enemy types, what area's they've fully explored and see what quests they've done. It's honestly a fun past-time to just go through other people's pawns and wonder who they came to that build. You can also witness how they operate in battle and if they take down an enemy in a way your pawn hasn't seen before, they'll learn from it and adapt it into their own playstyle.

Of course, the system isn't without its flaws. Sometimes, it'll follow your bad habits and spam a move that it really shouldn't, making the fight drag out more. With this system, your pawn can turn into a beast slayer, cooperating with your every move to take down enemies swiftly and efficiently. However, if the sysstem doesn't seem to work out with you of you can't be bothered working with it, you get... a normal companion like in any other RPG that has varying degrees of usefulness. The system, honestly, is just a win-win scenario in my eyes.

Very fun game. An interesting story (though nothing groundbreaking) with amusing plot twists, deeply satisfying combat and a fun system with your AI companion that can be min-maxed for your own enjoyment. Very solid 8/10.

When you go to the game save location (Steam Library Folder> your user data (a number)>367500>remote> DDDA.sav) you'll see after playing around, you can do multiple saves during the game, but they all write to the current game save, in other words you wipe out everything before it for your current play session. This becomes a freaking bad issue when the game freezes during a save and the current save ends up corrupted, Then you are just out of luck for today's play session, there is no backup of current progress. 

You can see in the save folder there is one or more backup saves, but they will be for previous play sessions.  For myself after spending 2 hours in the game, I ended up with the game freezing, a bad save, the game now won't even start based on last current save, and when I looked in the save folder, the last save in there is at the end of my last play session.  This is not the first time I have lost large amounts of game play time and ended up having to repeat. 

Now there is DDDA Save Game mod available at Nexus mods. It is in fact an .exe, I have it running and it does not do what it is supposed to do. It's supposed to make a copy of every save you create-Nope. It infrequently makes a save., so instead creating a save for every time I told the game to save, the most recent save showing is from the end of my last play session, not any better than the game. 

Based on this, at this point, after being ready to quit, I decided  to try to make this work. Now after every significant point in the story, I select “save and continue”, tab out of the game, go to the save game folder and make a copy of the current save so I have sequential saves of it.  This is more work than you should have to do, but as I said the game is decent and I’ll cross my fingers this works adequately.

28Feb23 review update- My scheme of keeping my own backups has improved my experience a lot, and I can now recommend the game, combat is fun, I started as a fighter, but I'm not yet clear on cross training to other classes. So far just as a fighter, things are going well.",1677295392,1677640536,True,0,0,0.512969553470611572,1,True,False,False

at first glance it seems to offer everything i wished from a medieval fantasy rpg but it just annoys the hell out of me.
You see im constantly looking for games where i can swing a huge ass sword just like the guy from the hit chinese anime show berserkman (rip eiichiro oda) heck they even added armors from said cartoon
But meele fighting in this game just sucks ass. fighting small stuff like humans and goblins is ok but combat with big enemies as a warrior is just boring as shit, you either climb on them and punch them in their faces (which is by far the most effective but boring way) or punch their legs which might just be as effective as taking a piss on them.

the last boss of dark arisen for example is probably the most boring fight in the game as a warrior, just take look at it if you want [spoiler] https://youtu.be/W__uLPutbh4 [/spoiler] your personal experience fighting that guy as a warrior will most likely not differ much. (i cant explain the silly jump spamming in the 2nd phase its really not needed, just climb)
And the game is completely unbalanced, im not even saying its too hard (trust me it isnt) it feels like there is no middle ground between dealing basically zero damage and popping a damage buff item and killing every boss in less than a minute.

And then there are wolves... wolves exist in this game only too annoy the player nothing more. They deal barely any damage and dont have much health BUT they can grab your fucking leg and drag you which is just annoying enough too make me feel like removing every canine on this world from existence. (they can also spawn right next to you) 
The sentence ""Wolves hunt in packs arisen"" which you have probably already red multiple times in various exhentai comment sections will be engraved in your mind for the rest off eternity if you wont disable pawn commentary. (there is a similar line about goblins)

Also pawns (your followers) are introduced as beings lacking emotions and willpower which makes them the second most boring thing you could have as a follower in a game next to stones. Luckily capcom added a variety of cliffs you can use to remove pawns from your party in case they annoy you as much as me or you simply fear the touch of men like the protagonist from aforementioned chinese cartoon.

Then again i hear people say that the magic combat is really good in this game but sadly im not a girl",1668676516,1677372246,False,5,0,0.476789951324462891,1,True,False,False

The only problem was the world didn't have enough to do in it and the pacing can be slow at times, but that's what people also said about red dead 2.

Jokes aside, Dragon's Dogma is...well, you'll love it or you'll hate it. Or both. There's a special place in my heart for DD that I absolutely love the game, but just as much I don't think I can stomach playing through it all again. I played the pre Dark Arisen version on console before purchasing this on Steam and was completely entranced by the experience. At the time (and maybe now), no other game gives a similar experience. And that's both good and bad.
To start with, combat. You're given a few options of your starting build to choose from and it really boils down to magic, melee, or missile. And which of these you choose is going to be how much you enjoy the game. Later you are given further options, which boils down to pairing two of those three options. Along with your pawn (an assisting NPC that you create) and what companion pawns you choose (you are able to add two pawns to your party that are from other players or pre-built characters from the game). Combat has a heft to it. I enjoy playing heavy melee characters in these sort of games and this was no exception. Striking enemies causes a momentary slow in the action, emphasizing the hit. You can cling onto larger enemies and crawl around on them, not unlike Shadow of the Colossus, and attack them. You can focus on key points of some enemies. Such as the legs of larger enemies to make them fall down or striking the tail of other enemies that makes them lose focus for combat and a bonus item to gather from them.
Battles can be very unforgiving, as can the rest of the world. You can stumble into areas that you're not ready for. Large enemies can roam around the map and attack you when you're not ready and under leveled. Day is more merciful than night, which you're warned about many times to consider sleeping until day. And the plot of the game revolves around a cold and uncaring nature for you and the rest of humanity as well.
The world has a certain quality to it that consistently feels old world and harsh. Characters largely speak in a dignified English and many have a haughty attitude befitting someone who has survived and done well in such a world. Other characters stand out well in their delivery and behavior. And there are a range of secrets and interconnected dialogues based on your decisions. You CAN miss quests easily in this game. Whether through starting a certain quest that continues the story and leaves behind what you missed or choosing wrong or through simply taking too long to get to it. And sometimes you have to actually think about your actions and do them. Mass Effect style of declaring everything you do before you are locked in and have to do it, this is not. And that all adds to a bit of realism and believable to the world. You're not the only one in it and others take their own actions, whether you are involved or not. 
Sadly the plot isn't as deep and enticing as it could be. It starts out well, giving you a reason to take your actions. But as you go along, you start to question a lot of the motivation and reasons behind what you're doing. There's also a few points in the game that are just...they make no sense. You'll also end up backtracking to old locations a couple of times, sometimes RIGHT AFTER you just got back from that location. It's like the developers forgot they used that location a moment ago and were ready to get it going again. 
There's a lot of variety locations, however. As much as the map makes it seem like the game world is huge, it's actually pretty restrictive. There's a good bit to explore and the world contains a lot of small secrets and tricks along the way, but mountains and other restrictions will keep you from a large portion of what the map seems to promise. 
A wide variety of enemies is also present and the way they fight is also varied. This is one of the best features of the game, especially in the enemies that you can climb on. From darting wolves to bandits that fight based on their own class to skeletons that shamble forward slowly, however don't stumble easily, you'll have to change how you respond to these situations. There's a lot of preset traps and ambushes as well. Which at first is a delight, however it wears off a bit after that first time.
I recommend the game, but consider it hasn't aged as gracefully as it could have. The various mechanics are antiquated compared to modern games in many ways, but holds a particular charm if you let yourself get caught up in it. The graphics and environments however, are still beautiful and pleasant to experience. That said, I strongly recommend waiting on a deep sale.

It was dope, so many choices of play style, you can switch classes as you go, lots of gear to pick up and your choices matter. The main game story line isn't overwhelmingly long so you can play it little bits at a time or you can do all the side quests and all the side stories and play all day. The Dark Arisen part of the game is like one big maze dungeon with the best gear and strongest bosses, you can go into it pretty early on (if you like challenges) or right before you finish the game. (If you want to check out Bitterblack and waited till the end, go to it before the last jump down the Everfall after you collect the wakestones) Bitterblack has it's own little story based on  writings you find while exploring, but it's not crucial to the main story.  You can play this game like a hack and slash or you can customize your move set gear and augments to min max; it's cool that you get to choose how complex you want your character to be. After you beat the game you can load your save and the game will let you keep all the gear that was in storage, on your character and on your pawn, in-case you want to start off well equipped on a replay. Try the parkour! Farm xp! Make a Waifu pawn that goes with you everywhere! When you have to make a choice let the npcs die!

When I always see this game I feel like I played it just last year but in reality this game has stuck with me since 2016 which is a good while at this point. But even back then I never heard of this game, I think I literally just stumbled upon on steam and was like ""the heck this looks cool af!"" and bought the game, one of the best purchases I had made. 

The gameplay is great and smooth. You are the cliche ""hero/chosen one"" protagonist and have to save the world thus you get bunch of cool powers. Firstly you got the weapons, weapons are based on your class (which are called vocations in this game), so if you pick the base fighter class you go with sword and shield then you gotta spec into the warrior class to get a two-handed sword. So you basically have your standard Warrior rogue and mage classes. BUT here is a lovely twist I LOVE with this game. You can mix classes, so you can mix a warrior and a rogue and you get something different, mix archer and mage and you get something different, mix warrior and mage you get a mystic knight. Or you can choose to stick with whatever base class you had, so a mage goes to sorcerer or fighter to warrior. A lot of class choice and you can respec into anything you want to a lot of freedom in gameplay style.

But more on the gameplay and less on the classes. You basically got light attacks, you can jump and attack and you can grab stuff. Yes you can grab stuff. Meaning you can grapple an enemy for an ally to hit it, you can throw a barrel, if there is a huge monster you can jump on it and climb it to cut of a specific part or do damage to its head. It's super fun. Then you have a set amount of abilities you learn and can cast. So all in all the gameplay is very interactive and gives you lots of options. 

Now I mentioned allies before. In this game as I said you are the chosen one. As the chosen you have something called ""Pawns"". Pawns are a great mechanic in this game and serve as companions, you can have up to 3 of them for a full party of 4. And you get to create your own Pawn while later hiring other pawns from a ""pawn library"" where they get preset classes and armor. But you can change everyone armor. 

Secondly the world is great, it might feel somewhat empty at times in my opinion but in general it is very dense and populated. I feel like I come across some scary monster or a group of enemies here and there and wonder why they are there. It peaks my exploration when I'm going to a quest. 

Story wise the game is fine, nothing great nothing bad but I always enjoyed the cliche sort of storytelling. 

The biggest crux I have with this game is that it has aged a lot. UI is rough at times and quite clunky, takes some time to get used to and the game itself doesn't look the best. You probably gotta download some mods to smoothen the experience or at least smoothen the graphics. But if you don't mind dookie graphics then all you gotta do is get used to the UI. 

Ultimately I gotta recommend this game. It's wonderful, I've beat it a few times and had many playthroughs trying out all the classes and different combinations you can pull off. Go grab this game and have a good time!",1454493949,1676466716,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Basically everything that isn't directly related to combat ranges from mediocre to awful, but luckily, you spend most of your time stabbing things in the face, and almost everything that isn't related to combat is just an excuse to get you into combat so you can stab more things in the face.

The setting is incredibly generic and lifeless, the plot has exactly one moment of greatness that it immediately does it's damnedest to spit upon and remove any sense of accomplishment from, the characters are as deep as a puddle, and the art design and voice acting are pretty meh, but I kept coming back to it anyways, because the things it does well are just so damn fun. 

So what *does* this game that misses the mark on virtually every hallmark of a good open-world RPG do well?

-Combat is a perfect balance of tactics and satisfying, brainless obliteration of cannon fodder enemies. Difficulty feels right for the vast majority of the game, the animations are smooth and satisfying, and there's a wide array of skills, with almost none of them feeling like total wastes (at least as far as the player character is concerned--there are some skills pawns just generally suck at using effectively).

-Speaking of, pawns are fun. At the start of the game, you get to create a companion character to accompany you on your journey, who will gain class levels and abilities alongside you. Furthermore, to round out your party, you recruit two other pawns, with the option to use player made pawns. It's fun to see what sort of characters other people are adventuring with, and it adds a little more intimacy than simply playing with a variety of generic companion characters would've, and it also gives you the option of taking some rather silly characters on an epic fantasy adventure (I happened to defeat the main antagonist with Hatsune Miku in my party and I'm still cracking up about it).

-Pawn AI and tactics can be surprisingly awesome, it really just depends on the inclinations and knowledge levels of the pawns in your party. For the most part, the AI is competent, and while it can be hard to find pawns that work well together, when you do, it can actually be really shocking how smart the AI is, especially in boss battles. I've seen my pawns execute complex, 3-person tactical maneuvers to devastating effect, and even had my life saved by a pawn catching me at the last second when I was falling off a flying boss on more than a few occasions. The moments of brilliance aren't super common, but they're always satisfying. They also learn from your playstyle, and it can be really fun to watch them pull of your own maneuvers. I utilized jumping attacks a lot, and sure enough, my main pawn soon started seeking out high ground and leaping down onto enemies.

-Boss fights are great, especially the first go round. Each one feels unique (excluding a few, more difficult, reskins towards the end of the game), and requires its own unique set of tactics, and the scale of some bosses is really epic. They aren't terribly hard once you know what you're doing, and a few of the more common bosses may start to feel like a chore, but they generally remain quite fun and exciting through most of the game.

-Adding to this, the boss battle music is great.

-There's a Shadow of the Colossus style climbing feature for bosses, and while it's clunky, it still adds a lot and opens up a lot of new tactics. 

-Magic feels awesome and deservedly powerful. The effects are very well done, and it opens a lot of utility.

-The character creator is really solid, and height, weight and sex of your character all affect their abilities in minor but impactful ways, which is a little bit gimmicky but still fun. It also leads to moments of hilarity. I will never forget my poor, scrawny main pawn literally blowing away in a gentle breeze. 

-The game runs quickly and stably, especially for a console port. It's a shame the UI wasn't adjusted for PC, because it's clunky and tedious as is, and the textures aren't amazing, even for its age, but all in all, it's a very good port.

-The dragon is great, as both a character (dare I say, he's the only well-written character) and as a boss fight.

-A lot of the things that it does poorly are at least funny. Accept this game as a really goofy medieval fantasy experience with fun combat and you'll have a good time.",1676351351,1676351351,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Battles with giant monsters feel epic thanks to the ability to climb and attack different parts of their body and above all, the combat isn't afraid to let you have fun with wacky strategies.

Unfortunately, whilst the story isn't awful, I don't feel like it is told particularly well, and it ends just as it starts to get interesting. Characters are also all a bit flat with generally mediocre voice acting so it's hard to form any sort of connection with them. Most quests are also quite boring other than the main quests, and characters seem to just teleport around for plot convenience which is quite immersion breaking.

Conversely, the background music is quite good and the combat tracks can pop off, mixing electric guitars and choirs. It fits the tone and the few vocal tracks can be quite chilling. The map is also a decent size, but can look a bit samey and doesn't feel very rewarding to explore, though I do like how it is hidden before you explore it much like Elden Ring. I will add to this that I think the graphics aren't great for a game from 2012, but that's not a major issue.

I think the character creator is quite good, you can have a very unique look and things like your height and weight affect gameplay. There are also other cool gameplay systems here that most RPGs don't have, like the monster climbing, pawns and item combining, but also things missing that would have been appreciated, like a mount or artisan skills.

I had a few issues with cutscenes freezing and CTDs, which were quite frustrating as I missed key story parts, but they didn't occur too often.

Before playing Dragon's Dogma I was mostly only comfortable with Skyrim-style button-mashing combat or styles that allowed me to pause and think about what I was doing. Dragon's Dogma actively encourages you to try out a wide variety of skills and abilities, and it introduces things at a nicely gradual pace so that you have time to learn them thoroughly before moving on to the next thing. It also made me much more comfortable with fighting huge bosses.

That being said, once I tried out all the builds I had any interest in I stopped, and I'm usually someone who plays games for the story in a fairly completionist way. But the limited fast travel and inability to wait/rest through the night got old, and the story, characters, and lore weren't interesting enough to make up for it. It was a good learning experience, but I probably wouldn't play it if I was already comfortable with, say, Dark Souls combat.",1675982432,1675982432,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It took me nearly 80 Hours to beat it, and i am sure i really enjoyed nearly evey minute of it. This game knows how to be fun while giving you a lot of things to do. And i never did those same boring side quests. 80 Hours is really a good time for a game like this. And i am sure that i will play more because there is 9 classes in the game and every one of them is unique. All different skills, passive skills,builds, armors,weapons,animations... And i only fully discovered 3 of them. Story is nice but the storytelling is not great. It doesn't matter that much in my opinion in the endgame. Because final is really bittersweet. I will not forget the ending for a long, long time. Truly remarkable. Enemy variations are the first place of its kind. I've never remember a game like this to have all those different kinds of enemies. Each of them needs different tactics. I am really sucked in Dragon's Dogma's world. It feels so natural that all of things i've ever witnessed. And the pawn system. So original and magnificent. What would be more fun to build one character ? Build two characters at the same time of course :) Pawn's AI System is nice too. Not the best but nice. I remember some times that they just decide to jump off a cliff. But they did great in fights. As a programmer i know that Knowledge system need some really big effort and efficent programming. Knowledge system is when your pawn,or a pawn in your party fights and beats a monster, they learen what that monster is vulnarable and not for the next fights. Training your pawn is really important. And i want to say that animations and the all visual effects are really great too. Lighing looks great. When your sword got a fire buff and it shines on a dark dungeon it feels like i am about to kill a god. This game should be a book : How to make a GREAT RPG.

Positive : 
+ Enemy variations and all of the different attacks. It is a real challenge. It feels like i am really living in this world.
+ All Classes,builds and weapons. So much to try and all of them promises fun.
+Pawns and Pawn system
+Different places
+ Mount and climb mechanics. There is just so much ways to kill a boss.
+Bitterblack Island is a perfect DLC for this game. It is really challenging, adds tons of weapons and armor,a short cute story, and badass new places. Bosses too.
+When i hit an enemy, i know that i hit him real hard. Strike feeling is great,even if you play an archer or a sorcerer. Opposite of Skyrim.
+Different weaknesses of all bosses makes all one of them unique fights.
+A couple of soundtracks are great. I will listen to them after i stop playing.

Negative :
- Story would've been a little bit better. Especially the storytelling.
- Sometimes you just run,run,run and run. No shortcuts. It takes time and boring.

Aaaand Dragons Dogma 2 is on the way bois :) I can't wait. Dragons Dogma is already one of the best RPG's ever made. It has the chance to be better then even Elden Ring. Thank you Capcom for giving us this masterpiece and thank you again for making a sequel.

Forewarning: lots of criticism and debatable complaining

This game is a very good JRPG but it's also a very flawed game. This is a pretty good representation of a game that takes a classic fantasy setting and does a lot with it. More often than not the negatives outweigh the good but ultimately I do recommend this game, with great caution. 

The story is... debatable in its quality. The gist is that a dragon attacks your village, you foolishly try to fight back, and then it steals your heart. Now you have to get your heart back and also there's a bunch of soulless minions at your adventurous whims. This game takes a big influence from classic fantasy and uses many recognisable monsters to great effect. Supposedly, this game was not even *near* to what the vision of it was. The number I've seen of how much of the final product we got bounces around 40% but this game is visibly lacking in many areas. The story is very short and you can easily beat the game in 8~ hours, not including Dark Arisen, but that's a whole other beast. Near the halfway point, you can see how the story just cuts straight to ""okay cool let's kill the dragon"" and it's a little disappointing.

Fortunately, the gameplay is really good. The best way I can explain it is that it's a mix between Dark Souls and Monster Hunter, and I've only played one of those games. That's the short of it. It does have its issues, however. 

-It's a JRPG so naturally it's very grindy and there's some min-maxing that occurs with the stat growth system(not enough word count to explain it here). It also takes *forever* max out every vocation and its skills. 

-This game has some cool knockdown / critical hit point mechanics and it's a lot of fun to see an enemy get knocked on its ass.

-There's a lot of debilitations(status effects) that provide a fair amount of strategic variety to the skills you can use and tactics you can use against your enemies.

-There's a TON of equipment in this game. This game, similarly to Dark Souls, has adopted a variety of names but I love the name ""Fashion's Dogma"". A lot of the equipment, especially when max upgraded, provides a variety of resistances so you can mix up your armour and it won't be a huge problem. A lot of this game is about avoiding being hit to begin with, so fashion it up GAMERS.

-A huge negative of this game's gameplay is that it is so tedious and, sometimes, difficult that results in a huge part of the ""guide"" community for this game suggesting that explicitly exploiting the game's systems and mechanics is part of the game itself, which I obviously disagree with. You do need to use several exploits to avoid stress and frustrations with how clunky and annoying 

-This game relies on crowd control and stun/lockdown *a lot*, to an un-fun extent. The base game itself isn't a huge issue as it's incredibly easy to just grind past the difficulty curves but BBI is  a pretty big outlier of this entire game and there's a lot of discussion of when and how you're supposed to tackle BBI. 

-Without going to in-depth because this is a huge issue with the game that I can't fit into this review, the pawns in this game are badly implemented. Their AI is beyond bad and in my experience they contribute very little if they're any class other than fighter or mage/sorcerer, but even then fighters seem to do nothing half the time. I've had many situations where pawns will stand around doing nothing or will stand within spell zones and just die because they lack the proper AI to avoid attacks and have any kind of self preservation.

-Final point, connecting with the last point, this game does not have a lot of counters to many abilities / enemies and lacks damage mitigation for most classes. There are i-frames but they are limited to assassin, fighter, and dagger skills. It basically boils down to: Don't get hit and if you do you die and that's your fault. This is, of course, stupid. To keep to my relatively short point-by-point system here, I'll explain it later in regards to BBI, but this game has severe balancing issues.

So... BBI. It's honestly the only real reason to play this game in my opinion and it's pretty much the only part of the game where I get genuine satisfaction and enjoyment out of coming from an experienced player's point of view. It's the DLC of DD and it is seemingly up in the air as to whether not it's the bad part of DD or the good part. I personally think it's good but it's very clear it's not balanced in regards to DD nor a single playthrough. There's guides that will tell you how to get to max level and beat BBI within 8~ hours but that's... insane. It completely removes the actual gameplay loops and twists you have to jump through in the process of playing the game. It's like playing a Final Fantasy game and just cheating in max level, all items, skills, etc. It removes the whole point of the game itself.

I can narrow my many many many issues with BBI down to 3: The dragons, Death,  and Daimon(the final boss). A bonus is I'll complain about the overall balancing and abilities you'd otherwise not see in DD.

The dragons: The dragons are fantastic in this game and they're fun to fight but BBI's suck. Translation: DD's dragon spawns are very few. There's 1 single dragon before the post-game segments in which there is... 3. Not many. BBI has *many* dragon spawns and they are absurdly strong to boot. There's stronger variations of the three dragons(Drake, Wyrm, Wyvern) and the Cursed Dragon. Ironically enough, the Cursed Dragon, who is the big spooky one, is the weakest of the bunch but it can only be damaged via hitting its heart. All the other dragons either deal absurd amounts physical damage, magic damage, or just throw you all over the place. I played the game on PS4 as well and usually Wyverns would just spam maelstrom but in this version, it seems they don't do it anymore. Fire drakes just spam tail spin(which can 1-2HKO easily) and arm grab(same deal), and the Wyrm either spams comets or lightning bolts which, again, easily 1-2HKO you. The Cursed Dragon just kind of sucks. So, yeah, they kind of suck and you'll encounter several of them, They really mess up the flow of BBI.

Death: Death is the ""secret"" boss of BBI. To cut straight to it, the biggest issue with him is that he's resistant to essentially every attack because of his ridiculously high defence and magic defence. I wouldn't have an issue with this if he didn't lack an actual weak spot and wasn't the one single enemy in the game that can only be defeated explicitly with exploits. He's is THE speed-levelling exploitable enemy. He also has a scythe that insta-kills which goes back to the whole ""pawns don't know how to avoid attacks"" issue. The pawns are basically just fodder for Death, and often times Death disappears after getting at least 1 kill, so the whole encounter just doesn't work unless you're willing to follow a guide step-by-step to get... very little for your efforts.

Daimon: He's the final boss for BBI. He has two phases. The first phase is accessed via a single run through of the dungeon, and the second phase occurs when you run through the dungeon to fight him again, and all continuous fights have 2 phases. Altogether, you probably go through like, what, 20 health bars with 2 phases? He's not a bad boss but again, consistent issue with BBI. It's not balanced for what DD is. 

The bonus: A lot of enemy abilities in BBI are abilities that 1HKO e.g. Great Gamble, Seism, Maelstrom. The overall balancing is off the rails for BBI, ranging from 1HKOs to huge defence values on enemies(meaning you need to grind to do any damage).

I really enjoy this game. It's very unique, it's fun, and it's also incredibly grindy and tedious. Do I recommend it? Yeah, sure, maybe. Just be cautious that there's a lot of bullshit and outrageously bad balancing, resulting in some crazy difficulty curves.",1669821488,1675504059,True,2,0,0.514285683631896973,3,True,False,False

Across both platforms I have concluded this game belongs in the list of best fantasy rpgs of all time and had sooooo many unique ideas that were ahead of it's time or still unique to this game. The combat itself is basically still untouched (besides maybe monster hunter) as you can climb all over massive beasts while they fly up into the air and create some really weird but cool class combinations. 

The online component to this game had massive potential and was one of the features ahead of it's time as it let you heavily customise your companions build/looks and share them online for others to hire and use in their game (and vice versa). You get rewards if someone likes your companion and keeps them long term and even has a rating system when finished and option to give the host a gift. The game itself is likely considered open world but it isn't generic far cry locations they are mostly unique and have rewards for exploring. A sequel was finally announced for this game and I am beyond excited with the possibilities as DD is truly a unique game that sticks in my mind despite what some consider minor flaws but was near perfect for me.

PS a TON of great stuff and sections of the map are optional so if you wan't to experience most of the game do the side quests (not including sign post quests they are mostly filler) as it will take you to some great locations and get some unique loot. Lastly when you finish the game there is an expansion location called bitterback isle as end game and it's massive and worth playing if you want more to do.

It feels directionless most times and you will wind up running, running out of stamina, stopped to catch breath, then running some more only to find out you have caught the eye of a superior beast who will absolutely kill you and reset you to the last checkpoint. The first few times I tried to get into this game this was my experience and it caused me to bounce off. The first 3 hours of the game are unbearably slow, and this is around the time you will begin to notice if you chose the right starting class. Pro tip: you can kick the ox to make it move faster, just remember it can die. There is hope for those of you who are at that point and realising you  wanna do more than what you currently can with the class you have. The first class you choose will not prevent you from beating the game at all. The problems with not building a streamline character come once you beat the game and want to do all the juicy New Game + grinding and levelling. No need to restart if things are not working for you, new vocations come soon after the first couple tutorial missions. 

I just beat the game at around level 65 or so. It can be done sooner though. Took me around 70 hours or so to get to NG+.

The story is goofy fantasy and serves it purpose, but honestly go look up a few  guide videos and at the wiki from time to time if you are confused as to what to do next. Its open ended and wont hold your hand for what quests you need to do next. 

BIG WARNING! there are quests that can be failed and you can permanently lose rewards. Its worth using a guide to help with getting the most out of the game. Really the story is spoil-able and still fun, its not as bad as spoiling other games and its probably gonna let you see more of the game than you would just playing blind. There is a quest involving an NPC being put on trial. Once you accept the quest a timer will start, collect the evidence needed to acquit him or find him guilty, just dont have both types of evidence in your inventory if you want to save him. you have in game days to do it. 

Oh also you cant really reset your class levels so if you are wanting to make a min maxed perfect build then make sure to have a guide and understand what levels you need to take and when.

It's super annoying to send everyone to Bitterblack Isle at the very start of the game. I had no idea it was endgame content, there is a marker on my map I can't get rid of and it starts from the home town. So I go there just to waste time and find out there is no way I can do that yet.

Having 1 save slot is brutal. I can't experiment with other things at the same time without completely deleting my main save. I'm fine with having 1 slot per character like Dark Souls, but literally 1 save slot sucks.

The pawn chatter is INCREDIBLY annoying but since they often state what the weakness is of what you are fighting it's detrimental to turn it off in the settings. They will overlap with each other like ""They hunt in -"" ""They hate fire!"" They hunt in packs they hate fire!""

But it got its issues: I just HAD to install a mod in order to stop wasting stamina outside combat (running). The map is pretty big and the stamina gauge takes a long time to fill up. The game does not give you any kind of mount, so you must run A LOT in a HUGE map, so I almost given up the game and only keep playing due to this mod. 

Another annoying thing is about the quests that fail just because. There's no reason explained in the game as to why some quests do have a tiny window in order to complete them.

You're given no motivation for playing the story missions.  Without spoilers, something was taken from you and you want to get it back. Why? You're doing just fine without it. People say there's a dragon threatening the land but you never see any signs that there's anything wrong. You may as well get on with your life the way you'd already planned it.

Only one class has any sort of lock-on ability for ranged attacks, and spells take a long time to build up power to cast. The starting armor is some of the best in the game. I finished with a few pieces of the starter gear because I never found anything better.  Your torso and legs have separate slots for ""clothing"" and ""armor"", but which is which seems completely arbitrary. Playing a female character I ran around half the game in my panties because the ""clothing"" slot was a set of thigh-high leather leggings and my ""armor"" slot was boots. I eventually found a pair of trousers that had stats only a little bit worse than my underpants, so I got to cover myself.

The ""pawn"" system rubs me the wrong way. Your party members are called ""pawns"". You get to customize one of them. You can borrow two more from other players. This is the extent of the online interaction, you trade your pawns around. (There's an offline mode where you hire randomly generated pawns instead.) Pawns look and act human, except they have no free will. This reeks of a last-minute rewrite when someone pointed out, ""Um, guys? You know, passing your party members around to be used by other players seems a whole lot like slavery, or at least pimping."" So they added a few lines about pawns having no free will and now it's all okay.  But for creatures with no free will there seem to be an awful lot of them wandering around the countryside unsupervised.

Despite all that, I still enjoyed it.  The combat flows nicely. The landscape is pretty. It's fun to plow into a horde of low-level goblins with your weapons set on ""puree"", and being able to climb up the large enemies to get at their weak spots feels appropriately heroic.

- Really worth it. A fantastic and rewarding combat system sustains the game, a bit clumsy and rough around the edges, but nevertheless of epic scope, specially against big beasts. Varied, flashy and fun skills. Countless personalization options, weapons and armors for the discerning fashionista. Interesting pawn mechanics, but lacks control and information. Generic main and side quests, with an excellent soundtrack to round out the package.

There is an announced sequel to this game and it has the potential to be an Action Combat RPG which redefines the entire genre. I love this game and think it can develop into a massively successful IP if the sequel lands well. I carry a strong belief alongside all my fellow arisen that Itsuno will deliver fantastically with the sequel - whenever it's ready to come out.

[b]As for who this game is for?[/b]

[b][u]Long story short:[/u][/b]
If you are looking for a game with captivating combat systems and lots of variety in skill choice and class selection, this game is for you. If you like the idea of climbing on top of massive enemies, gouging out their body parts as your companions rain hellfire and steel upon them (or stare in awe with their thumbs up their a**es, depending on the inclinations your pawns have), or perfect timing a parry and blinking behind a Hobgoblin and slicing his throat open, then this game is for you.
The spells in this game also make you feel like a god. Summoning meteors? Calling forth tornadoes? Yea, you can do that. And it's not a small a** tiny tornado either. It's a big boy.

[b][u]DON'T PLAY this game if:[/u][/b]
- You want a captivating, well written story (The story is really only truly refreshing and epic towards the very tail end)

- You want to explore a huge diverse world with a variety of locations and themes (The world  is decently large - but with one setting: generic european high fantasy forest/highlands)

- You want to experience fascinating quest structure and/or NPC interactions (There are some cool interactions - but i'd argue quests are typically far from unique or interesting in structure.)

[b][u]IN CONCLUSION[/u][/b]

There are a variety of other problems with the game and great things it offers, but it really comes down to if you want to experience a well made combat system with a variety of classes and custom-made/picked party members in the form of pawns.

You'll learn to find other aspects of the game to appreciate if the combat is enough to keep you interested.

It's almost always on sale and for like $5.00 its most CERTAINLY worth it. 5 bucks is like an extra large king sized Hershey's bar these days. I can eat that in like 30 minutes. 30 minutes of chocolate induced sickness, or potentially hundreds of hours of fun? Hmm, I'll let you decide.

Do i enjoy the game?
221.9 hrs on record. (cross 4 consoles, more like 800+)
59/59 achievements.
Owning it on 4 different consoles.
A bit.

Jokes aside, this game is Fan-Flipping-tastic!
Do i think it is Flawless? Gods no!
But even with it's flaws, you'll see that this game is a Gem that unfortunatly was highly under-appreciated, it went under almost everyones radar when it first came out, thankfully it has gotten a lot more well deserved praise over the years. (even a Netflix anime that i found out about Today, watching it after finishing this review)
Dragon's Dogma is a game whos story is not told upfront, they're not Explaning the story, YOU have to figure it out. Oh the npcs will talk about the lore of the world, sure sure. But they will Not do some dumb story exposition, you have to figure it out and puzzle it together yourself.

You CANNOT fully beat the game on your first playthrough (unless you know EXACTLY what to do, but then it's not your first playthrough, now is it?) Quests will fail, you might get annoyed, but do not worry, The game has a bit of a ""hidden"" New Game+ function, ones you have beaten the main story, you will unlock Hard Mode, and doing so will reset you back to the Start, with everything you had obtained previously (if you want you can change the difficulty back to Normal immediatly afterwards) also gives you a chanse to remake your Arise and Pawn, even change Gender if you see fit.

What makes Dragon's Dogma so appealing is, not just it's hidden story, but the combat itself, now, you might think that the attacks/skills are mediocer or basic...at first, then you realize, those 3 classes you chose from the start... that's not all the Classes, oh no, there are Many more, and you can change class as you see fit (aswell as making some epic builds by combining perks from other classes into your prefered class). But what i love with it's combat is that unlike the majority of games, if you fight a Massive 2-4 floored big monster, what do you do in 99% of games? you start attacking their toes...riveting.
In Dragon's Dogma however! if you use the Grapple button, you will start to CLIMB the bigger monsters, reach their weak spots, knock off Armor, or cut off limbs (on Chimeras, Hydras and Evil Eyes) So here you are fighting a Chimera, like in the Tutorial, a Chimera is a creature that is a combinating of a Lion's main upper body+head, a Goat growing out the back aswell as a goats lower body who uses Magic, and the Tail is a Snake that both spits Poison and can even grapple your party, if you keep slicing the Snake, you will cut it off, removing it's Poison abilities, if you keep attacking the Goat, it will lose it's Magic abilities, and if you kill the Lion then the goat will pretty much go insane, it does not prefer Mele combat so it will panic and jump all over the place.
But my favotire thing is when you are fighting a Gryphon! you grapple onto it as it takes flight, you climb up on it's back, you equip/unsheat your Flame weapon and start attacking, Setting it's Feathers ablaze, sending it crashing to the ground! (watch that Stamina tho)

The lore of the game's start is as following.
You, a regular normal Fisher from Cassardis is enjoying another peaceful day, when all of a sudden! a DRAGON attacks!
Everyone flees in terror, including the guards who were there recruiting (understandable) but You? Not you! you pick up a sword that one of the  guards dropped and you Run towards the dragon to fight it headon!... it does not go well and it knocks you on your ass, the Dragon (whos name i will not say, you'll have to figure that one out yourself, part of the story) deames you Worthy of being the new Arisen, so it says some words in the Dragon's Tounge and then pierces your chest with it's claw, stealing your heart!
But you do not die, just fall unnconsious, when you wake up, the Dragon speaks to you in your mind, the words he said in his own tounge ends with ""if you wish to face me, take up arms, Newly Arisen"" so you go to the table, pick a class out of 3 (again, don't worry, many to choose from later) and you are off to do your Arisen duty, and reclaim your heart!

The start of the game might feel slow, almost kinda boring? But it will ramp up soon after!
And when it comes to quests, you don't always have to follow what is said, if you know where to go (or by accident) to the location it Actually takes place, you can go there immediatly, like finding a secret meeting held by some conspirators in the  city, quest is telling you to talk to like 8 different people so you Figure out where to go, but you can just Go there immediatly and get the same results, time saved!

Now a fair warning, the game is not that big. the size is well and good, but it's no Elder Scrolls.
Quests are not that many (think like, 30-50) but they can drag on quite a bit, so it's no 30 second quest or some such crap (mostly)
And a complaint i have seen/heard MANY talk about (which i honestly do not get) is that your Pawn (and 2 hired) Talks constantly, i will admit they DO talk a lot, but they're not Aggrovatingly talketive, people are just over-exagerating.

Now, with all that said. Take up arms, Newly Arisen! For their kind does Not face the Toothless.

Side note: Do yourself a favor and look up the OG Theme.

Also a warning! Since this is Dark Arisen, you will unlock access to Bitter Black Isles insanely early, STAY AWAY FROM THERE!
A woman will end up standing on the dock at Night, the map will show a Purple swirly thing, IGNORE IT!
Bitter Black Isle is very late game content, i would recommend TWO playthrouhgs before you try to tackle that place, you've been warned.",1604415295,1674731687,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

How do you fight flying enemies as a melee class? You can try jump attacking them, but you don't jump very high and swing even less than that. Some classes have attacks where the hitbox goes kinda higher up, but you can't use them while jumping. The fighter class has a skill to try and draw them down by bashing their shield, that doesn't always work. So, the answer to the question is, you don't. You stand around wait for the ranged classes in your party to snipe them out of the air.

The game has a romance system where the character with the highest relationship status to you is set as your ""beloved"", how do you choose this character? Do you maybe gift them plenty of their favored gifts? Maybe straight up gift them a wedding ring? No, various quests you do throughout the game raises the relationship status with characters, as well as just talking to them. the status also decays over time, so there's half a chance the blacksmith you were talking to or the merchant you just did a quest for is selected as your ""beloved"" in the ending instead of the pretty dark-skinned french-accented tomboy knight you gave 2 wedding rings to. There is a save editor on the Nexus, by the way, funny that.

How do you allocate your stats for specific builds? Maybe you want a higher magic stat for a specific build you want, do you allocate skill points to your magic stat? No, you play the magic class for something like 50 level-ups because stats are automatically allocated based on the class you were playing when you level up, so in order to optimize the class you actually want to play, you have to instead play a bunch of other classes you don't care about to get the necessary stat points, as well as passive skills that are locked behind class progression but can be used on any class, that part is okay, and kinda cool. The stat thing is not, and hey, did I or did I not mention the thing about the save editor?

How do you know what strengths and weaknesses different enemies have? You listen for your NPC followers to shout them out, if they know it, or check the wiki. There is no ingame bestiary.

How do you tell your archer follower to stay at a distance and use their bow instead of running in with their daggers? You play a ranged character yourself and hope the lesson sticks.

How do you tell your support mage follower to stop enchanting your weapons with fire against fire enemies? You use a frost weapon and hope the lesson sticks. And that the same support mage doesn't overwrite your frost weapon's element with a fire enchantment.

I'm still gonna give a thumbs-up, because it is fun. But man, I sure do hope the sequel irons a bunch of this stuff out. I mean, they can keep it all if they want, but let me shake off weapon enchantments given by the support mage, add a character that lets me re-allocate my skill points manually, let melee classes target flying enemies better, and for the love of all that is good, make the wedding ring actually hard-set the beloved.",1674672474,1674672631,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

I'm slightly turned off by the fact you have limited way to defend yourself as dodge is not available to most classes meaning unless you have a shield or play dagger melee quickly turn into a damage trading fight and especially in Dark Arisen its not viable because mobs can one shot you even with high end armor.

A must have for any action rpg fan. combat is the show and story and quests are just there to facilitate the great combat, class, and gear systems. Great exploration as well.

Okay so I know this says that I have 5 hours in the game BUT I have owned the game on GOG since the PC version was available there, AND I also own the game for the Nintendo Switch. I bought the game on STEAM for the ease of use on my new steam deck so I could play the game on the go. While I could do that on the Switch, I like the deck a lottttt more because it is larger and I have some pretty big hands so it is more comfortable for me to play that way plus I only have to take my deck and not the deck and switch both if i want to play this game.

With that said, I have at minimum 300+ hours in Dragons Dogma so I think it should go without saying that I highly recommend this game. Here are some bullet points on why I like it.

-----The Good-----

- GREAT combat
-Multiple classes you can switch to at any time when you go to an inn.
-Fun loot to collect
-Pawn system grew on me a lot over time
-I like the party customization with pawns and gear
-the different classes actually change up the game play quite a bit
-trying out new class abilities/builds is very fun
-Dungeons are a freaking blast when you find them
-large monsters really steal show. Feels monster hunter lite at times with a sprinkle of show of the colossus.

-----Now for some of the Meh-----

- The open world is fun to explore but can be a slog at times due to back tracking and repetitive enemies although I don't think it is as bad as some people say

-The Fast travel system can but some people off a bit. You drop a stone on the ground and and teleport from major towns and back. you can drop multiple stones and leave them there to make your own teleport network but stones must be acquired from exploration. teleporting is free with the eternal stone added in the dark arisen version. you get it as soon as you make to the capital maybe 2-3 hours into the game.

-dialogue is not very good and feels unnatural at times (although i feel like it makes sense for Pawns)

-the story starts slow and does not pick up for quite a while and will leave you scratching your head for quite a bit. ESPECIALLY at the start.

-there can be a severe lack of direction at times but some people like that

-lots of hidden mechanics. for example, if you make a large character in the creation system, you can do more melee damage. Skinny/ tall characters run faster and short character can be lifted by larger characters. the game does NOT tell you this at all.

-Night time is VERY dark. some people love this, personally I hate it and avoid traveling at night but that's what the devs were going for. I wouldn't have made that design choice myself but i know a lot of people really like that feature.

-The post game DLC area is very hard. You have to be leveled up and geared correctly and you must still have a large amount of player skill of your own. BUT I love the dungeon. The dungeons are a highlight in DD for me and they are few and far between so I personally love the large end game one. 

- the graphics. Personally, I have a very very high tolerance for bad graphics and jank in games, I can appreciate good graphics but its never a deal breaker for me if they aren't great. The game is a xbox 360/ps3 game and it shows. I am completely fine with the way the game looks but a lot of people are graphics snobs so this might be hard on those types of players eyes



-----The bad -----

The music. I love the main menu theme but I honestly do not like the ambient music they have in combat or when traveling the open world. It drives me insane. This is a personal opinion for  people and I have never seen other popele complain about it online but I for one do not like it at all. I turn it off in the menus or if im just grinding for exp I listen to my own music.


I want to mention grinding real quick since I but it in the music section. - This game is not grindy. you can play the game to completion without grinding once. But if you want to level up a class fast or get some high level gear quickly (before youre normally ready) you can grind if it so pleases you. Personally I like grinding some times just to unwind but if you hate it, you do NOT need to do it at all and will never feel like you have to. Id argue that if you do, you will make the game a bit to easy.


------STEAM DECK----- 
 - The game runs great in hand held mode EXCEPT for during the character and pawn creations menus. I could not get the controls to work there and had to hook my deck up to my dock. after I got through the pawn creation section, I have had no issues with handheld mode since. I also did not have the issues in creation with a controller, only the steam decks handheld controller was an issue at the very start.",1674324375,1674324552,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Dragon's Dogma feels like a combination of the best parts of games like Shadow of the Colossus, Devil May Cry, Monster Hunter, Dark Souls, and Skyrim, with worldbuilding inspired by Berserk. Basically all of my favorite things were combined into one. Dragon's Dogma is completely bursting with life and passion, despite not getting the time or money it deserved in development. I have probably double my hours here if you include the time I spent playing on Xbox 360. It may not be a perfect game, but it is my favorite.

The combat is amazing. Some of the best in any game. Every vocation feels distinct and fun and immerses you into the class fantasy more than any other game I can think of. Even the default attacks feel good. Classes are split into red, yellow, and blue, for melee, ranged, and magic, with 3 hybrid classes that combine them in different ways. The red classes, Fighter and Warrior, have real weight behind their attacks, with some of the best Big Sword Gameplay in any game ever, chopping through multiple enemies, whacking them into the sky, slapping them across the room. Blocking and parrying is great, and there's even a way to build a Mystic Knight that is basically devoted to parrying as your main attack. The yellow classes, Strider and Ranger, feel light and agile, and bow combat is insanely fun. You can fire arrows like a machine gun, or expend all of your strength with one powerful shot, among many other moves. I'm usually a sword and board kinda guy, but I've spent a lot of time playing the other classes in Dragon's Dogma just because they are all so fun to experience, and I always end up returning to using a bow. It even feels good to play with a controller, and I usually hate aiming with a controller. The blue classes, Mage and Sorcerer feel like absolute gods of destruction. Some of the endgame spells feel like complete chaos, summoning a tornado or carpet bombing an entire forest just to kill some poor goblins. My personal favorites, though, are the hybrid classes: Mystic Knight, Assassin, and Magick Archer. Mystic Knight is all about big shields and big tanking, and is able to exploit every elemental weakness, Assassin is the ultimate monster climbing class, with a move devoted to just obliterating a monster's weak spot by stabbing your sword in and wiggling it around violently. Magick Archer has things like homing shots, sticky bombs, and bouncing arrows, which makes for a very fun toolkit and a playstyle unlike really any other game I can think of.

On top of the classes feeling so great to play, the actual approach to combat is amazing. Every major monster has a unique mechanic that you have to learn to take it down, and knowing what element enemies are resistant and weak to is often vital. Don't worry, your pawns will let you know. Repeatedly. The most important thing, though, is CLIMBING. Shadow of the Colossus style climbing up a huge monster to stab it in its weak spot, holding on to flying enemies for dear life, trying not to be thrown off. It just wouldn't feel the same if I was poking at everything's feet, and it makes a huge difference in a game like this. You can fling your pawn into the air to grab onto a flying dragon and knock it down, or grab onto a flying harpy until it can't bear your weight anymore. Very few games have so much verticality in combat. There are also nice ways of being able to buff up and prepare for fights, with usable items intentionally designed to LET you abuse the system to get an advantage, there is literally an in game system for item duping, and many effects stack. You actually use your items in this game instead of hoarding them for the entire duration.

The character creation was one of the best for its time, and still holds up great. You can see that they worked around the limitations of the engine mostly by giving a lot of preset options, but there was a lot of care put into the sheer variety of options given, that many games still to this day completely overlook. 

The pawn system is a unique approach to a singleplayer game. You are able to create your own pawn basically as if you have a second character, and hire two pawns created by other players. Its like having a party in an mmo in a singleplayer game, except every one of them is lobotomized. They talk way too much unless you tell them to shut up (which you can) but I personally love it. The game is an unintentional meme generator, hearing your pawns yell WOLVES HUNT IN PACKS every single time they see a wolf. The actual intention behind it is interesting and adds a lot of flavor to the game, and it is genuinely helpful on a first playthrough, as they will make comments about locations, items, quests, enemies, and generally try to help you take the best approach to things. They also learn how to fight different types of enemies over time, and learn more about quests as you do them, and even carry over things they learned by helping other players, or in other playthroughs. After many hours spent with your pawn as your companion, you get attached to them, and your friends may too, since they are able to hire your pawn for free and regardless of level. In a way your pawn is indirectly including you in someone else's playthrough and their memories of the game, and I think there is something special to that.

The armor and weapons in the game look amazing, blending realism and fantasy is my favorite aesthetic. There are also layers to clothing, with a bottom and top layer for your torso and legs, so you can get a pretty diverse combination of looks. You are also able to upgrade every piece of equipment, so if you like something a lot you can pretty much take it to endgame. This is a top tier mechanic that I wish was in every game. There is even a way to upgrade things further beyond, but I don't want to give it away because I think its cool as hell when you find out how on your own. I also really like the way you get the endgame gear in the base game, and the way you get the even more endgame gear in the DLC, which gives you a lot of content in the postgame.

I think most of the story is great, but unfortunately it is the main part of this game that is lacking. It's very clear that development didn't get the resources it needed, and the devs have said as much. You can see the threads of genius, and places the writers wanted to explore, but simply couldn't go as far as they wanted. Some of the main story moves rather abruptly forward, and I know the early game takes a bit of time to get people hooked. The pacing is a bit messy. I love the worldbuilding, though, and the lore of the game does feel mostly complete. Grigori makes for a fantastic antagonist throughout, and I definitely think the best parts of the story are toward the ending of the game, and on Bitterblack. The ending is still phenomenal, and I also think the approach to New Game+ is very, very interesting.

The endgame and DLC deserves its own recognition, because I think the actual best part of the game begins at the end, and a lot of the endgame systems feel really innovative especially given how old the game is now.  Without spoiling too much, there is an endgame area before the true ending of the game with a lot of interesting mechanics involved, that you could grind indefinitely if you really wanted to. They then took this idea forward into the major DLC, Dark Arisen, with what is almost a pseudo-roguelite mode with fantastic and challenging fights and really good reward progression on Bitterblack Isle. I've spent more time in Bitterblack than in the actual main game, and I still have more I would like to do there. It's practically its own game. Discovering I could kill a certain something on Bitterblack is one of my peak gaming memories.

Cool battles against giant monsters of mythology and a giant chicken.

But I dont understand why people are saying it is a masterwork. it is very far from it.

The ridiculously bad:

The menus are terrible to use with Keyboard + mouse. Terrible. Usable, but you have to be very careful to not screw up. 

The combat for a Mage is very clanky. Aiming is random.

The default keybidings were done by someone who have 3 feet fingers or never played the game. Redo them asap. Some arent configurable, so get used with using BACKSPACE to save and accept stuff. Yes, backspace.

Getting arrested because you mistaken pressed the wrong button sucks. The fact that it automatically saves when you get arrested just sucks it x2.


The silly:

Companions talk too much and say a bunch of dumb stuff. ""Did you know a lot of people die by falling? "" ""wolves hunt in packs"". You can turn it off though.

The good:
Setting is interesting. Combating with useful companions it is quite cool. The plot so far is pretty decent, nothing crazy but fun. Mages do feel powerful, at least in the beggining.

It is a fun game, worth it`s price, but people acting like it is the second coming of Jesus are way too hyped.

I just finish this game for the first time and here is my review for Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen [spoiler] also, in 69 hours, nice [/spoiler]

What I Like:
[olist]
[*] many class (vocation) to choose from
[*] simple yet engaging combat
[*] spells feels unique and powerful.
[*] High replay value
[*] you can climb big enemies
[/olist]

What I don't like:
[olist]
[*] you can't decide what stats you want to improve every time you level up. To improve your stats, you need to be using certain vocation when you level up. which is kinda suck if you want to optimize your character.

[*] unless you have a certain augment (its like a perk) your character will get tired a lot (especially if you are a hoarder), which makes travelling a slog.

[*] you have a house but YOU CAN'T SLEEP IN IT. YOU HAVE TO SLEEP IN THE INN NEXT DOOR

[*]awkward affinity system (you can call it romance system if you want) Its awkward because your character (in a cut scenes) almost didn't say anything while your potential ""lover"" is awed by your mere existence.
[/olist]
Nitpick's
[olist]
[*] I feel like many elements of this game is borrowed from other Capcom games, like Resident Evil 4 and monster hunter.
for example (its in spoiler so I don't ruin your experience) [spoiler] when you kill a monster/enemy, it has the same decaying animation as resident evil 4's decay animator (they even go melt almost similarly), and when you open a door using lever or button, the camera move the same way as re4. [/spoiler] but its fine though, just a bit distracting for me.

[*]pawn (your companions) hiring system is both a curse and a blessing. In this game, you have a main pawn (made by you) and hired pawn (made by other people who buy this game) most of the pawn you hire when you play for the first time is from people who didn't finish the game at all, so many of them are incomplete or not that good. There are some hidden gem pawn that can carry you through difficult parts of the game but its hard to find such pawn at low level.

The open world map and enemy placement do need some more improvement but it is beautiful nonetheless. The open world map is connected in a very interesting way. Go stand on a high place and you will see the key locations are in front of you in the horizon, albeit very far away.

The weapon and armor aesthetic in my opinion favored female character more than male. Everything looks good on female character and just meh at male character. Female character really looking good on almost anything. For male character, you can expect bulky design for all armor and looking stupid in magician attire. But of course it is just my opinion.

Dragons dogma is a rpg by capcom and is one of the best cult hit games i have ever played, the only way to explain this game is if you were to take devil may cry, monster hunter, dragon age/elder scrolls, shadow of the collossus, a pinch of dark souls and good ol D&D and mix it together you would get Dragons dogma a game about a hero known as the arisen who has had his heart stolen by a dragon and is on a quest to take it back. 

on the way you will be guided by the pawns who are emotionless puppets who you command as party members and you have 3 + yourself for a party of 4. Only one pawn can be customised which is your main pawn the other 2 are pawns other players have made and you can ""rent"" to help you on your journey.

speaking of customisation this game is deep, with a characters creater that allows you to be male/female young/old, hair + colour and physique which for the time this game released what pretty impressive stuff but thats not all, the best part is the freeform class system, what does that mean? well basically you are not railroaded into picking one class, there are classes in the game which determine your weapons and gear you can use but you are free to change constantly which one you want to be allowing for different playstyles, your stat increases when you level also scale slightly different depending on which class you play when you lvl up, allowing for some interesting character growth.

there are also a lot of classes im talking warrior, strider, ranger, assassin, magic knight, magic archer, mage, sorcerer and many more each with their own unique attributes and play styles to bring to the table. for example a mage and sorcerer both use magic but as a mage you play a more supportive role with buffs and heals but as a sorcerer you wreak havoc summoning tornado's, meteors, giant ice storms the magic in this game is just nuts. basically no matter who you are there is definitely at least one class you'll enjoy.

The feel of this game is great to, it hasn't age at all, movement is solid and controls are as good as modern rpgs.

What has ages however is the graphics with them being slightly washed out and pale looking at times, this is a game that doesnt have a whole lot of colours and the overworld can be a bit boring to look at.

the story is also extremely vague but not in the darksouls way where its deliberate, this game just doesn't explain its story too well which is a shame because i understand the story and it is good, really dark depressing and hopeless similar in vein to the NieR series where the game masquerades as a simple adventure game ala zelda but devolves into something much more dark by the end.

but the pros more than make up for the cons and its a entertaining game through and through with its amazing combat where you can climb up large enemies like a dragon whilst they are flying and stab at their weakspots making them plummet so you can hak at them, its just such good stuff.

I reccommend and hope this games gets a long deserved sequel.",1631719981,1673125721,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

 by far one of the best games i have ever played extremely satisfying  enviroments unique and challenging enemies lots of quests npc followers loot now the loot isnt everywhere but when you find some its special also you get to climb on monster and hit them with things most games dont let you do that and it has a really detailed character creation system that actually has impact on how you play the game from how much stamina you have to whether you can fit in a hole or not also the magic is different in this game no mana bar it actually uses your stamina which is really interesting also basic attacks dont use stamina (every class) and when you level a class up you can  use secondary skills from it on other classes also epic boss battles  

 overall  9/10  the reason its not 10/10 is it honestly needs a little more loot from enemies plus maybe a bigger map but overall great game definitely should play at once the whole way through",1672911698,1672911698,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It has aged like wine, in most respects, with graphics probably being its weakest aspect (still, the game is not ugly by any means, and with mods it looks spectacular). Even hours upon hours over the course of a decade, the game still draws me in. Would recommend it to any fan of Berserk, Monster Hunter, Shadow of the Colossus, and fast arcade-style combat.

Being an avid Monster Hunter fan at the time of this game's announcement, when I heard there were similarities, I decided to download the demo (on PS3). Fell in love.

PROS: The combat is arguably the best out of any 3D action RPG. It's classic Capcom, with fast, responsive controls akin to the Dungeons & Dragons series.
The character creator - Not only does the way your player character is created (as in, how tall he is, etc) factor into different in-game stats, but the amount of equipment that you can pick up, put on, and look bad ass it pretty extensive. Fashion's Dogma is superb.
The bestiary is pretty extensive. You fight everything from huge cyclops, to flying griffins, to drakes, to Chimeras, to bandits that can have the same abilities you can have. At night time, in classic Capcom style, you get zombies and undead warrios... hell, you even fight Death itself. 
The music fits the setting pretty well. The tunes don't get old, even after all the time I've logged into the game.

Cons- The story isn't the greatest. While it has some interesting parts (especially near the end), for the most part, it's a pretty generic fantasy story. 
The pawns, while useful in battle, and cool as a multiplayer component, talk too damn much. Eventually their chatter becomes a meme like Navi off Ocarina of Time.
It lacks a proper quick-travel system. You do, however, get port crystals which you can use to teleport at points where you've dropped them, which if placed stragetically can become a very good way to quick-travel. But out the gate, there isn't really a way to quick-travel between places.

And that's about all I can think of. Overall, I highly recommend this game. While the story isn't OMG AMAZING WOW NEEDS A PULITZER IN FICTION 10/10, it's entertaining enough to where doing everything that's available (and there's plenty to do) isn't a chore, or necessarily boring. Where the game shines is in the gameplay. This Shadow of the Colossus meets Monster Hunter in Berserk's world mash-up is probably some of the best time you'll have with an action RPG.",1601352540,1672707874,True,10,1,0.610436558723449707,0,True,False,False

Bit overwhelming at the start because they basically give you access to all mechanics at once but only explain them over time. But you get to create a character as you wish, both looks and skills, without having to think about skill points. The pawn/companion system is novel, too.

One thing it lacks is good story pacing. Story mostly happens at the start and end. Inbetween it all feels more like doing sidequests. Good thing the combat is fun. Being able to climb upon bigger enemies is cool.

I had a great experience playing this. Yes, the graphics didn't age well, but nothing that will hinder your gameplay. The combat and exploration is fun and interesting, unfortunately limited by the small amount of skills you can equip at the same time (3 for each of your 2 weapons/shield). Satisfactory plot, although simple. Cool boss fights, a limited amount of common enemies, but enough to have fun. A good game overall.

However, the freedom of implanting your own teleportation points makes it user-friendly. Another aspect of the game being user-friendly is how it pauses when you consume potions or in this case ""Curatives"". I know, there are opinions that this feature makes the difficulty rock-bottom. However the weight feature limits what you can bring since the character's equipment also quantifies on that aspect. If you are looking for a souls series but a little tone down and not quite stressful, this is the game. There are enemies that can one shot you if your equipment is not really optimal or underleveled. While underlevelled equipments also means that the DPS that you emit cannot kill your target plausibly. By plausibly, I meant in the terms of time-efficient and worth efficient. By time efficient is when the boss can be killed by a time you are comfortable with and how do you fare in lasting for that time. By worth efficient is the confirmation of your rewards if it is worth it by spending for all that effort. So grinding for equips and levels is still a must if you want to move forward story-wise or equipment wise. The class system in the game is unique since the passives you have learned in other classes can be equipped to your current class. Which means that variety and diversity of builds here is high which is good for me since I am trying out several classes anyways. If you are bored in a class I recommend trying out other classes, since boredom isnt the only thing satisfied when trying out new classes but passives that might help you in the class that you might like the most. Moreover, the equipment upgrades in this game is quite fun since there is a certain mechanics that you should do before maxxing out these equpments. Another is interactivity. Interactivity however in modern games means multiplayer communication. It is comprised of chatting, and trading, etc. However this game, utilize so called companions which practically speak and their behaviors can be modified. It is a new form of communication that the game invented to help your co-arisen in their journey. In your case, your main companion or ""pawn"" 's behavior can be customized by yours truly (with equips and class). Which makes it like playing with another person since your craft can be utilized by others. Like your child. I recommend this game 7/10",1672587101,1672587101,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you want a quick summary, this game is more than worth it after all these years. It has almost everything, and with the sequel starting development recently, in maybe half a life time we may even see some of the weaker areas strengthened.

Ignoring Bitter Black Isle (BBI, The DLC) for now, DD is set in the vast duchy of Gransys and provides a wide range of areas for exploration. There are plenty of quests to do, lots of interesting encounters, but more importantly the combat, which is the core appeal of this game. Unfortunately this means the role-playing takes a bit of a backseat, but the story itself is more than one would first expect from such a game, and I would suggest you pay attention to.

To explain the combat would take me years, so to summarise, at the start of the game you have three basic vocations: Fighter, Strider, Mage. Next, the advanced, but by no means superior: Warrior, Ranger, Sorcerer. Finally, the hybrid, who are not available to pawns: Assassin, Magic archer, Mystic Knight. Whilst the weapons and armour may stay the same between certain vocations, each play incredibly differently to each other and have different skills to take advantage of their strengths and cover for weaknesses.

Pawns, again, would take far too long to fully describe - they are the npc followers that help you throughout your play through. At the start you will be able to create your own, and then level them up along with you. They have no autonomy over their equipment, so it is up to you to decide what they wear and use, but aside from that will start off as bumbling fools, and as you fight more monsters and learn more of the world and quests, they will gain more and more knowledge. It may take several play throughs, but pawns with a high enough knowledge of certain quests can show you the way to complete them, give useful insights, and certainly turn the tide of battle if they successfully know how to exploit the weaknesses of a boss.

Now for a quick summary of BBI - incredible. That's it, it's incredible. It condenses everything fun about DD and plops it all down into a nice, linear dungeon that will take you hours and hours to beat. It features many more enemies, incredible atmosphere and unforgettable bosses. It's only for high level players, as the damage you'll be doing early game is atrocious, but it won't take too long to get to a point where you can more comfortably track your way through and beat it. After defeating the final boss of the dungeon, it will also switch enemies around to keep things fresh.

To conclude, I would recommend to everyone, especially if you enjoy combat-focused RPGs with very deep systems at play. Pick it up as soon as you can and have a wonderful time. And remember:

And it clearly shows.

what starts off as a grand epic of the underdog-arisen against an almighty dragon soon turns into incoherent storytelling. There is no overall story thread, no main quest that you can refer to if you want to refresh where you were, nothing. And this is the MAIN story line. I'm not even gonna mention the side quests

Fighting: 
is quite fun to be honest - being able to perform combo strikes with the companions as well as having three sets of possible strike types that are easily enabled by hitting ALT or CTRL is a really nice touch. On top of that, being able to climb huge bosses is quite fun as well. Unfortunately, the fighting system + class management is very constricted. For instance. you wanna start bashing skulls in with a two-handed weapon right from the start? Well, forget about it - not before you reach a ""rank"" in the organization that ""worships"" you are you gonna be allowed to take up a different weapon. Similarly, if you want to be a warrior but wear light clothes to save some weight and gain additional speed, well, that ain't happening either. Not to mention that you can't loot the bandits you slay for weaps/armor. An the rotten cherry on the cake - I learn skills as I progress, but I can't even use them all at once? Really?

Companions: 
pawn system has been praised a lot, and I agree - it's innovative insomuch as to allow players to share their pawns. But from that gameplay standpoint - those are mindless slaves that 1) you cannot communicate with 2) won't offer you any side quests 3) though having no will of their own (as one ingame NPC puts it), they seem to have enough will to advise you on how to do the quests (the tips are welcome but the inconsistency is not). I can continue the list, but I think I made myself clear

The world:
beautiful, there's no denying that. Some locations seem quite lively as well - with NPCs going back and forth on their business. This is no more than an illusion, however, as the Gran Soren - the capital of the kingdom - is almost dead. There are hardly any centry guards, NPCs are scarce. Right outside the capital there are bandits lurking about - no patrols by the great Duke? Where the MMO part comes into play is the mob respawning - I go through a location clearing it thoroughly. 2 min later I'm going back the same way, and lo and behold, all the mobs are back and ready to kick my tired out-of-curatives ass.

This is one of the greatest games you've probably never played, in the same category as Witcher 3 and Skyrim but not quite reaching their level. The narrative is bread-and-butter fantasy but with a uniquely JRPG twist. Class system is good overall, with each class having something unique and fun to offer. Character building is a thing, should you wish for that intimate level of involvement. Gameplay is smooth and reactive with intuitive controls. Combat is fast but fair, and individual mechanics are mostly good. Nearly all of the frustrating elements are minor (lantern goes out if you touch water, items degrade in quality over time), the only significant drawback being the expansion. Some players may take issue with side quests disappearing at random as main story quests are completed; however there is a reliable guide on Steam forums which players can use to achieve 100%. 

Bitterblack Isle (the expansion) has a wonderful Castlevania aesthetic, but unfortunately features MUCH copy-pasting and significant balance issues with monster NPCs. While some players may enjoy the possibility of being one-shotted even at level 200, the randomness with which monsters appear and the unfairness of certain fight mechanics make exploring more stressful and tedious than fun. The expansion also took a note from MMORPGs, making drop rates for advanced armor and weapons extremely low (less than or equal to 5%). While some players may enjoy this, IMHO such design has no place in a single-player game, where gear should be a guaranteed reward for overcoming challenges. Many players try to circumvent the low drop rate issue by ""godsbaning"": they save before a chest, open it, have their character commit suicide if the desired item is not inside, then reload and try again. Although this is a successful strategy, the consequence is that the game becomes a veritable slot machine for several hours while players endlessly load and reload until getting the item they want. (If randomized loot was a dev goal, then boss drop mechanics of about 20-30% would have been much better. That way players could still have fun fighting the bosses while trying for loot.)

That being said, as a lifelong gamer in my 40's, this game still features boss battles which have been the most fun I have ever played, and hands down the best final boss battle of any game out there. There is also a sick and twisted pleasure I derive from some of the assassin class ability animations - especially when playing a short character. Generally speaking: this is a good game worthy of your time, and definitely worth picking up on sale. 

I personally can't wait for the sequel.",1671655482,1671655482,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I consider this game to be my favorite game of all time. I bought it on every system I’ve had since the 360. I have an ungodly amount of hours playing across all platforms. 

Just some things I’d like to see in the second game. 
1. Night based missions/quests, build on the random encounters of the first game. 
Give the players a reason to go out at night then make them pay for it. 
2. Keep all the Vocations from the first just refine them and add more. Also let pawns have access to the advanced vocations.
3. Keep the armor system the same!
Maybe add color dyes so you can make your characters armor match the way you want it. 
4. Do the Bitter Black Isle just cut apart and sprinkled about the map. Like mini dungeons.
5. Maybe a World Tear system where if you beat the game the whole game gets harder if you choose to restart. 
6. More community events like the Ur Dragon. 
7. Cooperative play.

That's right, you only have ONE save slot. Never start a new game game unless you're in NG+ Bitter Black Isle and have absolutely no other game to play in your library. Since you can change classes, and they rely completely on your equipment stats + attributes, there is no need to EVER EVER start a New Game. NEVER DO IT.

This is a great RPG if you enjoy exploring, long boss fights with tons of good reaction/smart thinking needed, and managing a few resources/units. Not so much managing units, though. Classes are varied, and have a lot of equipment that can be shared inbetween them, making it very easy to grind for XP/Points and master new ones for the very-OP passive skills each one gets to purchase. Mages are ICBMs made of cardboard; rogues are quick, can handle ranged combat seamlessly and can dodge/reset stance to reduce vulnerability windows; warriors are frontline aggro-sponge, but can also dish some freight-train-sized pain, along with very important stuns and ""lifting"" moves for buddies.

The true fun of classes comes with the mixed-jobs, like Mystic Knight or Magick Archer. Assassin is also very busted, but MA takes the cake; since your pawns cannot take these jobs to play as, they become very unique, and can make use of other basic jobs' accumulated weapons/skills too. Not to say advanced jobs aren't good, IE: Ranger is also one of the best damage-dealing ones.

Overall gameplay is balanced around jobs having active skills to perform certain ""events"" during fights. These come to stunning a monster, cutting off a limb, exploiting a weakness, or even disjointing armor. Things become quite complex when you realize climbing large monsters is quite important, and can make the difference between easy and hard encounters. These ""events"" are very much necessary, and not always play in your favor. Working to be changing the tides of each bossfight in your favor is one of the strongest points for fun in DD, as they demand some knowledge of what your moves/buddies' moves do to monsters' behavior.

The pawns are this game's low-point, because they are lolsorandumxd. You can, with a bit of fiddling (buying and equipping only the right skills, shouting the right commands, and giving only right items), setup your own follower very well and have them do useful things forever, and online. The issues start with the other 2 followers (which you must summon from a server, and are created by other players like yourself).

Since ""casual players"" pay much less attention to minmaxing their follower (which really isn't necessary for the vanilla game), you may end up starting Dark Arisen's (expansion) campaign having to summon better pawns than your current level (10lv~20lv>), and the currency overlaps with the one used to get new items from a certain vendor. If you get through this ""early game"" on the DLC where you start looking for pawns with ""THE RIGHT SKILLS"" and ""THE RIGHT AI"", and ALSO ""THE RIGHT GEAR"", BBI

Play it, it's dirt cheap and you can get mods to overcome flaws/ameliorate annoyances. One thing I find very annoying after playing for so long after some playthroughs is equipment and item weight — which is limited per character. The capacity is something I find to be there just to stretch the gameplay, so I use a mod that gives me infinite carry capacity.",1670776786,1670776786,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

At first I thought it was a bit too intense because I kept getting wrecked trying to do anything but just pick your battles and save before you try certain side quests because some might be a bit too much. (note your first encounter in the Cassardis sewer you'll find out fast) 

Not much for great items you can find randomly out in the open world but if you want to find minor items you need or want, they are out there. I've never found armor though but I haven't made it far yet but don't think armor and weapons are found in the open world. Maybe I'm wrong?

So why do people love this game? The combat and character creation is just that good, arguably the best of any action RPG. If you can put up with all the dated and bad design decisions you'll have a great time.

You can grab onto both large and small enemies.

The PC port's overall performance is very good; I've only encountered a small handful of bugs or crashes in my hours of play. Dragon's Dogma is a game worth playing if you're tired of the seemingly copy-paste RPGs of today.

Most ingenious equipment system where  you have under clothing and armor separately. Also character customisation is so good, being able to choose body proportions and height as you wish. This has some jank as bigger characters have bigger starting stamina pool and carry weight but smaller have faster stamina recovery and can go to places where bigger ones cant. Realistically this means like 1 place in the whole game.You can buy during the game a metamorphosis item from firs encampment which enables you to chance your appearance from main menu once. You can acquire a permanent option to chance your appearance in post game from the same place. Extra jank is when medium characters have smaller *light* carry weight capacity than slightly small characters. In average-mans playthrough this is slightly annoying since carry capacity makes you move slower. This can be circumvented by dumping all loot to your pawn.
Pawns are quite interesting addition to game making it this pseudo-multiplayer where you customise other character, which can rented to friends or random pawns through games rift system. Do not worry my friend since all the multiplayer function can be disabled in the options menu if you don't want to show your pawn to strangers online by setting it to so friends or nobody can summon your pawn. There should not be anything to be ashamed since few people seem to enjoy making childlike characters in the skimpy clothing so your pawn can't be much worse what people have made/seen already. I myself saw my friends pawn to be skimpily clothed woman full-sized this time so at least my friends taste is not so repulsive. Your pawns AI can be quite bad at times since game does not tell you about importance of pawns inclinations this is affected by answers you choose in the end of the pawns customisation so here is a few starting ones: 
For melee classes (red) SCATHER/MITIGATOR, mage (starting blue) MITIGATOR/MEDICANT and for every other MITIGATOR/CHALLENGER. Inclinations can be chanced by your actions or buying potions at the first encampment. These potions can be quite expensive at the start of the game, but you will get the currency plentifully at the end game.
Combat is enjoyable and you can encounter strong enemies quite early making replaying it is a blast. If you are starting out I would recommend buying better weapon at the general goods store in the starting town since games defence mechanic works so enemies defence works as a quite direct attack - defence = damage so even small numbers can make a difference. And from damage we get to the quite controversial topic: minmaxing. In my opinion minmaxing is not needed in any other than minmaxing playthroughs since your stats that come mostly from equipment outweighing your character level and/or minmaxed stats. Minmaxing does helps you break through some enemies defences more early, but this is just for an advanced players or for your second playthrough. 
Replaying it might seem huge hurdle since game has only one save slot, but you can circumvent  this by going to folder C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\Steam ID(some numbers or something)\367500\remote and creating a backup copy of the DDDA.sav file.
Story of this game is background for this adventure which you embark and is not really necessary to follow anything else than: kill the dragon. Story is there and has some interesting points, but you have to really dig for the full picture since some random NPC:s do tell pieces of it and you have to piece it together yourself.
Game also has some missable items and quest, but in newgame+ you can breeze through the game fast so missing something in your first playthrough is not big deal. Of course you can play any way you like so don't let this half-old-man tell you how to enjoy your game. So I hope you enjoy or have already enjoyed the game as much I have, since this game is one of my favourites even with its jank and all. In my opinion jank makes it more lovable or it might be just me inhaling fumes of pure copium coming from my PC for not being able to handle current year games.

tldr: Good combat, adventuring is fun, story can be skipped, need to go to files if you want multiple save slots and janky as hell, but one of my favourite games.

It's open world may not be on the scale of Skyrim or have the intricate npc conversations of Dragon Age but the game excels in an area the other two slightly lack and that's the combat. 

The action combat is what makes this game shine, whether you're coming up against gigantic Ogres or Griffins circling you from the sky, the combat is built in a way to give you most the enjoyment out of every encounter. 

There are drawbacks, some systems the designers have decided to go with may not satisfy some of the more hardcore audience but that's one for yourself to decide.

With the addition of post-game content you can easily see yourself getting at least 100+ hours plus out of this title and with the game currently on sale for under £10 it's a steal!",1581596913,1669587582,True,7,0,0.570778429508209229,0,True,False,False

+ Deep combat system with loads of customization in the form of different ""vocations"" (classes). Can rank up in each vocation, mix and match skills/passives, and target specific stats from each vocation's leveling. Combined with weapon choices (primary/secondary) and companions, there is an abundance of ways to slay baddies.

+ ""Pawns"" (AI companions) are actually intelligent and competent in combat, for the most part. You can customize your personal Pawn's AI to behave a certain way to better suit your needs.  Better yet, the Pawn learns as you do and will adapt new strategies depending on how you play.  They also level up separately and are fully customizable (appearance, gear, vocation, skills, etc.). They have their own inventory where they can auto-use consumables and tools, so no worries about micromanaging. Even their dialogue is helpful; often giving a clue about your current quest, calling out found items, or alerting you to enemy weaknesses. Definitely one of the best companion systems I've ever experienced.

+ Climbing on large monsters and slicing them up while you hang on for dear life is awesome. Other games with oversized enemies will have you chopping away at an ankle, which seems like a bit of a waste when designing behemoths to fight.  Capcom loves to add verticality to their fights to make them feel more dynamic, as well as let the player appreciate a larger portion of the enemy design both visually and mechanically.  Dragon's Dogma keeps to that philosophy and does it well.

+ Fast travel system doesn't feel as immersion breaking or ""cheaty"" as some other RPGs. Fast travel is done using a consumable, which you can get a reusable variant of if you explore enough.  Also, you're able to place your own custom fast travel nodes using crystals found throughout the world, and you can move these crystals at any time by picking them up and placing them elsewhere. Certain points of interest will come with a built-in fast travel node that cannot be moved, but otherwise used like your custom nodes. It feels much more rewarding to find one of these crystals/consumables through exploration and being able to use fast travel like a tool, rather than just a QoL feature baked into the game from the get-go.

+ Plenty of post-game quests and harder monsters to kill once main quest line is completed.


[h1]Negatives[/h1]
- Main story is lack luster.

- Hard to tell if you are hitting enemy weak points; there is no visual hit indicator, only a slight audio cue that can be obscured by other combat sounds.

- As with many RPGs, this one also suffers from having a TON of random loot strewn about. It's hard to tell what is useful and what is junk.

- The UI and menus are a bit dated and can be hard to navigate quickly at times.

- Item stats are confusing at times; when buying/equipping an item, the increased/decreased stats are based on your totals in those stats, but when viewing the item in inventory it shows just the item's stats. The UI also doesn't show if you will lose a stat bonus completely when equipping an item; for example, if your current armor gives +100 HP, and the new armor does not give any bonus HP, then the UI will not show the -100 HP when comparing stats on the equipment management screen. The difference would only be shown if the new armor piece also had some number of bonus HP.

- Combat, though fun and action packed, can feel clunky and unbalanced at times due to slow, locked animations. This is especially seen with slower weapons/skills such as the Warrior class and its weapon types. Many of the slower skills are obsolete either because they are too slow, allowing enemies to easily step out of the way even unintentionally, or they just don't do enough for when you do get that one, big hit.  Normal light attacks are much easier to land and often reward the same or greater damage than many skills and heavy attacks.

- Light from some spells is blinding, especially at night, and makes it very hard to see enemies.

- Voices are frequently desynced with mouth movement

( looking at you ACTIVISION, EA, ROCKSTAR, And UBI SOFT, and yes even you CAPCOM although not as bad as the first two listed)  the character progression system is well thought out, and fulfilling the story arc is engaging, the monster variety is good, and the game doesn't nerf later game cross classes for the sake of balance, instead it rewards you with powerful classes that make the late game easier which is also part of the progression system that allows your character to become more powerful as they progress.  for instance, with the right gear, the Arcane Knight is powerful  same with the strider/warrior class, they provide additional benefit by being more flexible and adaptive to the combat. 

and even after this many years, the game still looks great!

unfortunately, games like this are from a bygone era, if you want to experience what it was like to pickup a FULL game, for 60 USD, with all gear, and cosmetics, already unlocked and achievable in game, and with minimal/no game breaking bugs, where you DON'T feel like you shelled out money to be one of the group of en mass retail beta testers, then give this one a try",1669561108,1669561108,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game has great potential but the flaws... there are quite a few, many of very easily fixable.


1. There is a singular game save slot. ONE save slot, period. And you can't even ""quite"" save on it manually. What do I mean by ""quite""? Allow me to explain. The game autosaves in some moments, at some checkpoints, and you ""technically"" can save the game manually... and the game sometimes saves when you enter new locations or finish quests, but as it turns out, it's very 'picky' when to treat something as a 'checkpoint' and when it's ""just a random save"".

I was exploring the game world for quite a while, and slained A LOT of monsters, spent multiple HOURS doing so, and then expected the game's 'checkpoint' to be when I entered a certain cave for the first time which was filled with monsters and randomly generated treasures. Just to be sure, I made a manual save. 
I then  came across some monsters... which were absolutely unkillable. I assumed I was either too low level or had wrong loadout (loadouts... another thing I'll mention). Either way, I died, and then went ""Ok, this doesn't seem to work out well... guess I'll come back here later"".
I pressed 'go back to checkpoint', since I either expected to get back to one of my last saves, or the cave entrance, or at least at the quest that I completed somewhere nearby the cave and I was notified 'game saved'. Logical to assume I'll go back to one of those saves, isn't? There's only one save slot after all, and the game told me it saved on multiple occasions, checkpoint had to be somewhere nearby right? WRONG! Turns out the game rewinded me MULTIPLE HOURS OF GAMEPLAY BACK, at a checkpoint somewhere in some city. Oh, so I guess all the manual saves didn't mattered, as well as entering some new locations, same for quest completions and multiple ""game saved"" notifications.
Great... so why even add an option 'continue from a checkpoint', if the said checkpoint happens once in a full moon?
And want to hear something extra ""funny""? The moment you load a ""go back to checkpoint save"", the game autosaves imminently, overwriting your manual saves with that at a ""checkpoint""!

...This... is just on multiple levels... one of the most idiotic, poor game design choices I've ever seen.

2. Some monsters are STUPIDLY tanky

3. Grabs and stuns. Seriously, sometimes you just find yourself getting grabbed/stunned so many times that you might as well grab yourself a cup of tea and lean back since it just takes so much time you might as well. Ugh, so annoying.

4. Pathfinding. (seriosly, your 'teammates' just won't stop walking off cliffs...)

5. Loadouts.
If you're somewhere in the wilderness, enter some location, and turns out you don't have one f'ing element needed to defeat an enemy(all attacks deal next to no damage to them unless you hit them with the 'right' element), you can't just go into options and set it. Maybe you previously didn't had enough points for those abilities and only now farmed enough to unlock them on the way there... so, can spend points there? Or rearrange loadout? No! You have to get out of that place, backtrack all the way to a nearest city, go to a trainer, and THERE you can swap/learn skills. Oh yea, so fun, not annoying at all.
Oh by the way, did I mentioned you have 6 skill slots? It sounds reasonable, right? Not quite, since 1. If you have one mage in the party, you can't make them a cool battle-wizard, casting fireballs or what you want, since then everyone else in the party will be next to useless against foes vulnerable to only one element! So the mage HAS to be a buffing-servant for the remaining members of the squad. One slot for healing spell, another for spell that removes many negative status effects THAT DON'T GO AWAY WITH TIME, and then another 4 for elemental buffs to weapons for the party, since many enemies are vulnerable to just one element, so to 'be prepared', you need to have fire, ice, lighting and holy damage types of buff-spells to weapons of your comrades. Either buffer, OR a battlemage(and if pick the latter, other members of the team are then almost useless), and with two mages, not only you would've had your party very vulnerable in close-combat, it wouldn't be good comp-wise.

The situation is even worse when YOU want to play as the mage of the group, and don't want to have 2 mages since it doesn't work very well for the team composition. You then are forced to either play a role of buff-doofus, buffing/healing your party(so fun, exciting...), or play as the 'battle mage' and then have all 3 remaining members of your squad useless against an enemy that's basically immune to just-physical attacks.


6. Out of 9 available classes, only two are capable of blocking. Why not all of them?! Why can't a two-handed weapon user, that struggles with mobility, block with their weapon? Mage block with their magical staff? Assasin or Strider with daggers? No because reasons! If enemy is about to hit, grab or tackle you, you can only try sprinting away - often resulting in getting hit and/or shot in the back. Not to mention there is no ""tactical roll"" like in soul-like games to save yourself with. ( No roll may be a good choice, since in medieval setting most people wouldn't be able to roll, wearing all the armor and/or tools, but I'm mentioning this as yet another reason to give player option to block, not just as two classes but others as well!)


7. Character respecialization. It's allowed to switch from a mage to a warrior during the game. That's good, would be quite unfortunate to not have that as an option. BUT, as you started the game as one class, every level up you got, added certain amount of points into your Strength and Magic, and it won't 'swap' with your class change. Mage level-ups add next to nothing to strength while leveling up magic, and if you swap to a non-magic user, your stats won't change with you... so your strength and HP will stay low, severely handicapping your character, permanently. Only ""cure"" for it is to start a completely new game.

8. There is no ""transfer all"" option, when you want to transfer materials from your inventory to storage, you have to move each and every item separately, one by one, over and over again troughout the whole game.

9. ""Ser"" instead of ""Sir"". It's a small thing, but often small things are the ones that matter and can really annoy or/and hurt the immersion.

10. Another small thing but it's that moment where you just scratch yourself on the head. Whenever you change something in the settings, anything, even adjust game audio, when you press to 'save the changes', the game needs multiple seconds of loading to save them. Umm... what? Why it makes this game buffer?


I don't mean to $hit on the game or the developers, I say this because I care. Just... how those issues could've make it to the final product? How could those things not been fixed over the years?
I'm really disappointed... it could've been so much better. It's just hurtful to see something not live up to it's potential. Potential which is definitely here, but there are some very poor design choices and lack of patches.",1668563211,1669407861,False,6,1,0.499819695949554443,0,True,False,False

On PC, it is much, much prettier of a game, and more stable.  On the original platform I typically ran into issues with the hardware trying to render particle effects for spells at the same time - which based on my build happened all the time.

As for the game itself...

It's still pretty unique, even today as far as action RPG's go.  There are some souls-like aspects (mainly restricted to the flow of combat) which would make some sense given the time it came out, but also borrows a lot from say Shadow of the Colossus in that they approach large scale enemies much differently from FromSoft.  Any enemy can be either grappled or climbed on, and in many cases it is required on a larger boss.  The weak spots are not exactly hidden most of the time, but it can add a level of interaction in the fights that is lacking from the usual 'sit behind the big boss and poke'-ness of say many Dark Souls encounters, something that the designers had pointed out themselves in interviews if I remember correctly.

The classes are also pretty interesting to dive into and encourage branching out into different builds to some degree.  There is some min-maxing of course to be had in being very specific in how you chose each class and when, but once you have access you can change your own class at any time and swap out skills.

One other nice unique feature is the pawns - a system for NPC management.  In the PS3 version, this was pretty limited as the servers have been down for ages.  However on PC it is still active, which makes it a lot easier to find better pawns.  The pawns are basically NPC's that other player's have sort of 'raised'.  You get your own initially, and this is the NPC then that other players can summon to help in their party (if I remember right to a total of 4 including your own character and main pawn).  The pawn comes geared with the same equipment and skill that the player had set on them.  They also learn battle tactics for different enemies and can shot out clues when encountering a given monster for a weakness to exploit.  You can both rate and give tribute to the original player for a pawn when leaving your party, or give items directly to the pawn - which you cannot take back if equipped.

Story wise the game is somewhat lean on the surface - as the main quests don't have a ton of depth to them except on the ends of the main archs.  This is fleshed out a bit more though in the side-quests, and also probably still has much more overt story than Dark Souls.  There are cut-scenes and such but don't go in expecting say Mass Effect or something along those lines.

Overall I really enjoyed it once I dug in, and would recommend to any who enjoys action RPG's.",1669236493,1669236493,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Dragon's Dogma is an action third person sword and sorcery game.  If you have played Monster Hunter, this game features Monster Hunter combat mechanics in a truly interesting dungeons and dragons realm.  Sound awesome?  It is!  Most encounters in the game benefit from the player learning how to use all of the new skills that they acquire on their way to level 200.  Then come the Quick Time Events (QTEs) and one hit kills. 

The one hit kills, I can forgive.  They are lazy, common enough conventions that are easily avoided for the most part.  But a QTE for the end vanilla boss?  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.  

Anyway, the combat for most of the game is fun, the art style is top notch.  Pick it up for a fiver, run around in game and have a blast.  Just remember, when some NPC tells you it's time to kill the dragon, just turn off the game, uninstall, and say you did.

Haha, QTE for final boss.  Barf.  I hope that is a trend that stays in the grave.

But this game is fantastic. From the moment you start playing, the game is ever getting easier in a meaningful way. 
This is one of the only class-based RPGs I can think of where every single class is fun to play, AND the ranger class doesn't suck. (In fact, they are the best).

This  game excels for two major reasons:
You get to fight giant monsters, who's different body parts react differently to damage, and you get to climb up such foes.
And you are always on the hunt for better equipment/ the materials to upgrade your existing equipment.

The attention to detail, and respect given to our culture and heritage, being able to live out legends, is quite simply amazing and I feel deserves recognition.

Truly a glistening gem standing out from the sea of blandness and mediocrity. I highly look forward to DD2 which has been announced, probably more than The Elder Scrolls VI. This flew so far under the radar due to almost no marketing, but has a die hard fan base, achieving a cult-like status among a small but passionate group of gamers. It's worth every penny and is a game I would recommend anyone who likes gaming as a hobby to at least give it a try, the two hour window steam gives you to play and still be able to refund should give you a good enough idea what the game is about, and hey if you don't like it you can just refund it :)

Beyond simply being a cult classic, dragons dogma is an experience in and of itself. Playing it can be rewarding, depending on what you want out of a game. 

Hilariously, The length of this game entirely depends on how much of a completionist you are. Ive sunk HOURS into this gaqme just destroying barrels for their contents (not all at once, mind you, but overall). If I see a destructable or a chest, I HAVE to open it. 

Lets talk some pros and cons!

Pros:

Engaging and unique gameplay
Unique follower system, allowing you to construct a pawn, and share that pawn with other players with a benefit to both

large, relatively open map that you can freely explore from minute one (Just beware of enemies throwing you around a bit)

MONSTER CLIMBING! It reminds me of shadow of the colossus in that you arent just hitting feet, The whole monsters can be hit, clung to, magicked upon, pinned with arrows. You name it.

The combat itself is very interesting and enjoyable, while also being mostly shrouded in secrecy. The game relies on learning how each monster functions, with hints sometimes being given by the pawns in your team. As those pawns get kills, their advice becomes more and more useful. Some mobs require planning and familiarity to beat, and a calm mind at that. 

Equally dark and humorous, the quests vary from being silly, to being downright MESSY and dark. And I love that juxtaposition. Its like if demon souls and shadow of the colossus had a baby. And that baby was then raised by elderscrolls. 

Cons: 

The story is MOSTLY walking. The first playthrough is much much slower than subsequent plays.

Combat can be trial and error, making sure you have the right team, the right weapons, the right skills, etc. It can be a lot to take in. 

You can sometimes die in one hit, however USUALLY you know why.

The pawn system is interesting and cool. But it's not all rainbow and sunshine.

* There's A LOT of missable content. A lot of unique quest items are needed in multiple quests. You WILL miss content if you don't play with a wiki open.
* Some quests are quite obtuse - in many cases the is no quest marker or even a pointer in quest's description and you just can't know where exactly you gotta go and at what time of day.
* The main story is extremely forgettable besides the dragon threat looming over you. All I know is that there is a dragon and a duke.
* The pawns, while cool and all, are extremely frustrating sometimes. You can give them commands but they are so vague they might as well not exist. In some cases the pawns will do their best to not do what you might want them to do, like casting a powerful spell on an enemy. They will do anything - jump around, try to heal your 1 missing hp, follow you around so close they can smell your sweat, cast a long multi-step spell and then stop as enemies come closer (even though as a player you can forgo casting the last step, the pawns do not know this), but they will not do what you expect them to do - shoot at the enemy.
* There's definitive QoL issues and ""CapCom-isms"" that I despise - Game has 2 main menus for some reason when starting the game, and a ""PRESS ANY KEY"" screen on launch that has a long animation.
* A lot of unskippable cutscenes, especially for mundane things like pressing levels and boss intros.
* The game does have online server bullshit, although its optional and you can play offline. This is most frustrating when sleeping to change time of day - as sleeping is when you upload your pawn to the server in a lengthy 10-20 second long process.
* Keyboard controls are a mess. You cannot open quests or the map with a keybind - you gotta do it through main menu. Map controls are garbage. Using skills requires you holding and pressing multiple buttons.
* Without the DLC ""Dark Arisen"" the fast travel is extremely prohibitive - basically it's a consumable item and there's 2 fast travel points by default. You can create your own fast travel points, but their number is very limited. And it's a big problem considering how much you will be running around across the map. The DLC adds an infinite fast travel item, but the number of locations do not change.
* Stupidly the ""Easy Mode"" difficulty removes or hides many quests. Why the fuck is that even a thing.
* There's only one save slot, so save scumming is quite limited. This also means if you missed a quest, you cannot go back without restarting the whole game. Be expecting to lose significant progress due to some bullshit insta-kill enemies.

Some more cool stuff:
* You can re-customize your character at any moment, both class and looks
* There's an item duplication merchant with quest implications

The Dark Arisen DLC:

In my opinion is quite bad. I wouldn't hate it nearly as much if it wan't for the EXTREMELY frustrating ""gatekeeper"" bosses that are so spongy and require very specific tactics. I also think you are expected to complete it twice, and fuck that kind of game design. Other than that it's just a bunch of corridors and much harder enemies.

This DLC also gives you some overpowered armor that will be better than the stuff you get near the ""post-game"".",1668905682,1668906305,True,1,0,0.522058844566345215,0,True,False,False

The enemies are menacing, and it feels like a real victory once you defeat a dragon or other giant creatures. The pawn system is very unique and offers a lot of new things to learn and to try. Image having your own team where you are the hero, but pick a tank, a healer, an archer and so on to accompany you.

You can find much better reviews elsewhere, but here are some tips:

- you can hire friends' pawns for free
- the ""From a Different Sky"" quests in the Pawn's Guild basement can be a decent way to earn rift crystals if nobody's hiring your pawn; don't sell them, you can put them in storage, and retrieve them in NG+ to instantly solve the quests again
- check the steam guide for missable quests, cuz the games sure as hell doesn't warn you
- buy wakestone shards as often as possible
- there are more merchants in the game besides in the two towns
- carry some skeleton keys and airtight flasks on you just in case
- look up the pawn inclinations and what they do, and make sure you give your pawn the ones you want (there are clear favorites among the fanbase but YMMV)
- when you get to Gran Soren you can retrieve an Eternal Ferrystone, allowing fast travel to Cassardis and Gran Soren, and later any portcrystals you find and place yourself
- place your portcrystals near high-traffic/frequently visited areas to cut down on travel time (although, getting to know the world by traveling through it a lot is also a great experience if you don't mind it)

Dragon's Dogma is an amazing game set in an immersive medieval fantasy world with visceral melee combat and powerful magic spells set alongside thrilling moments in intense battles.

After finishing Elden Ring, this game almost feels like spiritual predecessor. With it's large open world, there is much to explore and it does not hold your hand gently. Instead it teaches you many things the hard way. And without any guidance, the game can sometimes feel a bit gruelling.

Yet it still has it's own unique elements which make it stand out from other games, such as the pawn system and climbing onto monsters to target specific weak spots. The graphics are obviously far from next-gen, however for an older game it is still quite serviceable and holds up.

Unfortunately this great game is buried beneath a very thick layer of both bad game design as well as bad UI/Ux design. The game's severely lacking in QoL features and at the same time offers many questionable design choices. Just to give a few examples:
The game does have a very limited autosave feature and relies on manual saves for most of your journey, a bit like Skyrim, but it not only lacks a quicksave/quickload feature, it's not even possible to just load an older save, directly from the escape menu. Instead you have to first quit to the title menu and then press ""load game"" from there, which then automatically loads your latest save. Also there's only one save file, which means you have to manually navigate to your save folder and make a backup of your current save game if you want to create a new character.
This kind of idiotic design is found throughout every aspect of the game. Be it game menus (map, equipment, journal) that cannot be accessed via hotkey but only via the escape key menu (with the exception of the inventory) or the map that shows basically nothing and is a nightmare to use.
Every menu is designed in such a convoluted way that takes you many more button presses/clicks than actually necessary which gets incredibly annyoing to use really quickly.


I'd say this game is a prime example of 2010s Capcom game design as those issues are found in almost all of their games of the last decade. Anyone who's played the older Monster Hunter games will know what I'm talking about. I'd say the roots of those design choices go back to the early resident evil games as the menu navigation of those games is very similar to what this game has. Thing is in RE you had a max of like 12 items to manage and very few other menus...here however you have a full party with each member being able to hold a ton of items in addition to the player character and that just doesn't work with such an oldschool inventory management approach.
Ultimately this whole thing is a constant struggle against the many quirks of the game that becomes really exhausting after a while, which is a shame cos I really wanted to explore more of this world, but I just can't.

That being said, I'd still recommend this game to anyone who isn't deterred by this kind of janky design because what lies underneath all that stuff is really friggin good.",1667772792,1667772792,False,6,7,0.50383991003036499,0,True,False,False

Anyway,

I played this game back when it came out on xbox 360. Maybe xbox one but I think it was the 360. Absolute banger. Combat was fun. Mounting monsters, combo-ing elements, dropping fucking METEORS on kids and getting slaves to follow you around and heal you or fight for you is just cool.

I feel like it's not as good as it was back in the day because 1) I have experienced it already. Even though it's been like a decade or something, I know what to expect and how to handle things. Even if I'm playing new classes. 2) So, so many games I have played since then that all do something similar but maybe better in some aspects and worse in others. Game just doesn't feel as unique or special anymore. But that's also a sign of times changing. When I originally got this, I picked it up from Gamestop on a whim with no knowledge of it and was blown away. Now, it's not really possible to do that with games because of the amount of press every single game gets when released.

Classes are pretty unique between each other. Your slave guys can be built to support you, along with you can choose the ones you recruit to help support you as well. Its age definitley shows but it's still a very nice RPG that everyone should experience at least for a little bit. That being said, I can easily understand why some people would pick this up and find it kind of dull. There are some spots that are empty. Some of the fights do drag on and some of the quests are ""wtf where do I go and can I please stop fighting roaming mobs and just do this fucking quest please.""

Here's my point by point comparison between the two:

Classes - winner Skyrim
Every class in Dark Arisen is OP eventually with the right end-game gear, but some are just painful to level up with, and you pretty much have to mix and match your leveling to build a decent character.

Quests - winner Dark Arisen
There's a bunch of kill X creatures types of quests, sure, but there are a lot of very interesting quests with backstory that give the game depth.

Equipment - winner Skyrim
Seriously in Dark Arisen gear (except end game) is all but meaningless. I always just vendor everything I get. I don't even try to check the armor stats any more because I know it will always be worse than the gear that you're given for free when you choose your vocation. You will buy a weapon from Gran Soren, and that will be about it. You will just level it up a bit.

Crafting - hands down Skyrim
Dark Arisen is absolutely terrible at this. Most people don't even bother with it except to make certain arrows, or stamina potions. It's a complete waste for the most part. 

Game Mechanics - Skyrim
Dark Arisen's UI is clunky. For example, to switching from special arrows to normal arrows requires you to go into your inventory screen and select the arrows that you're currently using, and unequip them. There's no hotkey or anything for that.

Storyline - Dark Arisen
I won't ruin anything, but Dark Arisen did a much better job of putting together an interesting storyline.

Magic - Skyrim
Spells take FOREVER to cast in Dark Arisen, and targeted spells like healing are nearly impossible to aim properly. Fortunately your pawns can do it as if they were born to it, but good luck trying to heal your party yourself. Now the spells in Dark Arisen are sick, powerful and fun, don't get me wrong. You're just going to find yourself getting your face bashed in a lot instead of getting spells launched due to the insane casting times.

Played Dragon's Dogma for about 5 hours today. 
This is a very rambling note I just wrote to a friend, but I think it details some things well.
Very interesting game. A lot like Skyrim. Quests, companions, mines to explore, leveling. Learning curve is different. One weird thing I had to learn is that Warriors get special skills for sword and hammer but they are all under the sword tab. Like, I have a ring of swords, only, I don't use a sword, I use a huge hammer. In this game, sword = hammer and vice versa. You just go with it.
Skills are the same, like slashing strike, with a hammer. Upward thrust, but with a hammer.
You start out and make your guy and then it has a pawn system. You make essentially a traveling companion that has their own AI. I made a healer/mage named Wendy. When you level up you can go to an inn and buy new skills. There's no new stats that I can find. You just get better spells or better skills. And you do this for your lone personal companion too. They loot for you, heal you, cast lightning, randomly talk about the area or shout ""Goblins!""
A bit later you can rent pawns. I rented 2 magic users that do the same as your personal companion, but you can't adjust skills or armor or anything on them. They have their own dialogue, loot, help you in combat but require no input from you.
The graphics are both simple, yet extraodinary. My three mages are all blasting spells all the time in battle.
You have one save. You can save any time, but if you say, start new game, that save is gone. You can''t ever go back. If you want to go back to save before you were thrown in jail, nope.
Travel is a bit terrible, night is the same, all surmountable.
Dark Arisen is essentially when they ported the game to PC, so you get an Eternal Ferry Stone that will port you back to one of two major cities from anywhere, any time.
I had a quest to clear out a mine of three Ogres. TERRIFIC battle. Took me like 90 minutes to finally win.
Good times.
I did almost quit for like 3 hours but now I'm hooked.
I just bought the wrong things after I discovered I needed to level up Wendy and then found a tab I didn't see earlier with the things I should have bought. So, something to drive me forward to go out and get her some more levels.. But I didn't know I had to do that for 10 levels so she will be much more powerful now.
I came into a town and there is very sexy woman standing next to a monastery. She has on a bikini and a sword on her back. She is level infinite and you can hire her for 3 million gold.
This game is both clunky and unique and has wonderful little touches, like how the ogre grabbed one my mages, leaped off a ledge and then ran off with her.
Clunky, like in the swords/hammer thing, and don't expect a lot of random weapons, I've found very few. And maybe you get a higher level class later, but right now, being a warrior means I have access to swords and hammers. Bows too I think. But there aren't like claws or tridents or atgeir or exotic weapons.
I don't think I was clear earlier. I can't select or direct Wendy in combat. The only time I can interact with her character at all is at the inn to buy new skills. You're not controlling 2 characters. Just you.
Thought I should clarify as I don't really like making up a party of 6 and managing their attacks, weapons, gear, attacks, etc. So, I like that I can have a party - but it's just me I'm directing.

A wonderful game on which I have spent thousands on hours on PS3 and looking forward to do the same on PC now that I can, a nice story, an extraordinary battle system and a huge world to explore, made even better from the presence of Bitterblack (that adds a whole new world, with new items and enemies and another story).

The game is really good, but it may take a bit of time before you realize that or appreciate it. I didn't become what I would consider to be truly familiar with a lot of the games systems and intricacies until about 8 hours of gameplay. On the grand scale of a big RPG that obviously isn't a ton, but for some people that could be what they expect out of an entire game. 
There's really a LOT on offer here. Just so much meat in nearly every aspect of its gameplay. The writing and dialogue is pretty weak, but every other facet of the game shines, especially the plethora of post-game content. Speaking of post-game...

Overall Thoughts
* semi open world
* JRPG disguised as western RPG
* leveling and upgrading is addicting
* spend a fair amount of time in menus
* some level scaled areas

Pros
* good story
* fun and fairly intuitive combat
* snappy and responsive controls
* overall decent visuals
* you can climb the large enemies
* pawn system means you get to rotate your party members a lot 🙂
* pretty epic boss fights
* plays nicely with keyboard and mouse
* companion AI isn’t half bad

Cons
* sometimes textures look bad
* somewhat empty world
* crafting is not intuitive
* fast travel is very limited
* pawn system means you have to rotate your party members a lot ☹️
* because of the pawn system, sometimes you don’t feel that invested in 2/4 of your party members",1667181863,1667183499,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Touch deep water and die to the brine which is just a cheap gimmick so they didnt have to add swimming.

So
dark souls kinda ruins most 3rd person meele games. you expect games to have a reason to take every action. and be fair
atleast that's the game ""people""(PR) blame
I know a low bar. but still too high for the ""community"" of people who play games... except all the community does is talk and bitch about people with complaints and then go ""Grind"" or something and suffer all manner of time sink boredoms just to ""get to the good part""

but yea in this game's case.
i don't know . Stagger is the way. but if they don't. you fucked.
It's made by the guy who made dmc. I didn't know that and i kinda forgot how to just hack and slash and have fun. 
I thought so. I played older games that i never did and thought it would be the same overhype .bullshit. but no. within the first 2 encounters I know what the game wants
and all hack and slash and i mean PRE-Dark souls. iike 2004. had dodges. DMC did too and they all had the same ""now you know"" thing.

So yea the combat is ..as the PR gamers say ""flawed"" .. its .. broken.. you will get hit unfairly and think ""wait that's not unfair i just need to adjust my eyes"" but nope. you can't cause they start randomly in the middle of an attack


the game is a mess. to start they give you a side quest and in completing it you will reach a bandit group. normal bandits.. Easy . Fun. These? Have a sword and shield dude. who does not stagger. kills you in 1 combo where YOU are staggered. .. your entire party.. and takes like 2 damage when you attack. cause there is a stagger damage threshold. 

And then they throw you into a dungeon that has a troll that's far stronger than the ogre you killed at the start for some reason?
actually the reason seems to be the devs want you to run. and use the contraption in this specifc region to unlock less deadly routes that are dark. and get to the end of the dungeon that way. And then there is an undefeatable boss that AGAIN you have to run away from.. and there is the same contraption but in another place you have to pull as you get ""chased"" to create tension. 

but it took me 33hrs to get here cause i was trying to see where things are .explore.. the combat must be SOMEWHERE. I MIGHT be able to figure out the world right! All i remember is wander aimlessly. Reading skills trying to plan out what skills i want and then it not making a lot of difference. wasting time essentially.
in 8hrs i felt like i played dark souls 2 times. Even shitty mosnter hunter the boss fight lasts 15mins I feel like i spent 1hr...granted i spent 1 hr just running after it but its still 15mins

i spent more time now reading the wiki , seeing youtube reviews and reterospects to understand what the game wants from me. 
And.. well.. the youtubers hype it up to all heavens . except josheph anderson but i don't trust him he makes intellectual content for the sake of intellectual shit.
the wiki shows there are a LOT of side quests. about 70-80. yet i see none. so many enemy types. yet the land seems barren. 

there is something weird about japanese chinese korean devs. I didn't expect to bundle the japaense with the chinese and koreans but ... that's what it feels like
the Jp CN KR players are all highly skilled fast reaction time
And the JP CN KR devs are all scummy bastards who rely on grind , unfair damage and all around time wasting.
the JP devs in specifc use their ""Oh in JP look so culture so mystic"" bullshit... Their games ""SEEM"" deeper. because they fucking obsure everything and write like Shakespear is still alive. their crafting is god forsaken. the western RPG is just as bad. But the JP make it look like it might be good and deep and its the same 5 items with 20 different combinations to make. or items you think ""cool"" and never use. 
it still feels cool. because they wow you with combat. well.. combat animations. and alude to ""there is something more"" . 
But there isn't.

Just go check a wiki for main quest progression.
I thought i was doing sidequests aimlessly .

I know i shouldn't judge a game before i complete it. But just like the witcher. I KNEW it would be a waste of time. And in the end it WAS a waste of time. I felt fucking empty.not good empty like after a novel like ""I just spent 3 days fucking wander aimlessly. and then it all ended now cause i've seen everything.. this certificate and credits scene says so... why the fuck did i waste my time?""

now to complete the game. and have me to a complete 180
GOD PLEASE I WOULD NEVER BE HAPPIER TO BE WRONG>

completed it. Took 50hrs felt like 2-3. and i regretted every minute. Except using Skullsplitter on big enemies.. but that was just big fast damage

this is supposed to be an action game right?  not dark souls. not.. poke and then walk around. 

oh and it was touched by the monster hunter team I AM SURE OF IT. game lead. enemy lead. Ai lead. animation head. Enemy animation. its like they invaded. but they worked on everything capcom makes.
The bad animation telegraphs. The literal dragon is down so it flails and suddenly gets up The animation IS EXACTLY like that. not so so. EXACTLY .
WHY. they had DMC team. DDDA fans obsess over dark souls (ds is easy ds is nothing ds is not this) , but good animations have been th birth of games. DMC 3 in 2004 or something had animation so good they made Dante must Die mode..

i wanted to complete BitterBack asile to have the DLC under my belt as well. But no more. I can't . The dragon isn't a reaction challenge and i dont have time 

in everfall
there was a room with 2 chimeras and a skeleton summoner floaty big mage. and i was like ""cool lets see""
and then they spawned  hellhounds (wolfs , no stagger , spit fire) and i just quit. 

I hit enemies was fun. i got hit. which wasn't my fault. 
I don't want win given to me. I just want to make my own mistakes. 
i want to see the hit comming towards me. given the chance to avoid it and fuck it up on my own. and learn. 
Its an action game. i want to attack , dodge , and get back. not wait for the enemy

DDDA fans be like :- positioning 
in an action game? more than that. You want to cheese the game? no game is positioning based. fucker think beating a game is fun. no its playing well

why does every game i love and come back to relax to turn out to be some weird dragon i can never defeat. 

fuck capcom. Fuck mt framework. Fuck sandbox . Fuck IDsoftware
Fuck any game that comes out of the old and people say ""niche , undiscovered gem underrated""
Yea ive come to learn they are all that for a reason
All of them have an illusion of being grand. not a game
and most have awesome soundtracks

1 good came out. DDDA doesn't run 60fps stable on a 1060 i5 8300 16gb ram. 
Weird.. 2016 game. MT framework. CPU bound.
SO.. i somehow went mad saw its taking like 60-70 but the temps were 92-96C. 
undervolting did nothing and i remembered randomly. The Watts your cpu matters not volt.
So i saw Watt >25W = temp > 95C
So i limited Watts and.. this game runs on 60. MHW runs on 60
wtf?
other settings like disable HDR , lower Draw distance. set CPU thread count from 7 to 8 in ini files did not do much
game crashes like a bitch. but that isn't me. Its randomly happens a lot and once i started saving a lot.. I didn't crash once

what's worse , if this game's goal was story. find out what happens in the end , story is reasonably paced , i wouldn't have said a word
this game is about novelty of gameplay mechanics. Not good gameplay",1631457934,1666584266,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Dragon's Dogma is an open world RPG. You create your character and class and march off into the world talking to NPCs, doing quests, leveling up, and eventually beating the big-bad-guy. This is absolutely nothing new, so how does Dragon's Dogma distinguish itself?

If you take a little of Dark Souls, DMC/God of War, Monster Hunter, MMORPGs, and Skyrim you'll have an idea of what you're in for; but just a bad version of all of that. It has the combat pacing and speed of DMC without the depth. It has the stamina/health system of Dark Souls without the atmosphere and tight combat. You have the big Monster fights of Monster Hunter but without any of the preparation or complexity. And then you have MMORPG quests without any Player Characters to make those quests any fun.

Much is lauded about the Pawn system. And I can actually agree on paper it's very unique. While you create one player character, you also create one follower. Those 2 toons are permanent and never change. You can then hire 2 mercenaries (""Pawns""), which are actually characters created by other people that are uploaded to the Dragon's Dogma server. Hiring the different classes to help suit whatever encounter you are doing is a great idea. In practice you'll just stick with whatever class you're missing and trundle off. Moreover, because these are essentially generated characters and not characters that exist in the world, they have essentially no personality and you don't care at all if they die, since you'll just pull new ones off the cloud server anyway.

If you've heard the story is lacking, you'd be right. NPCs wander around aimlessly. You'll have no interesting dialogue with anyone, and certainly no tough choices or moral dilemmas. NPCs are just quest givers, again, as if this was an MMORPG. The world itself is both small but tedious to navigate. Monsters respawn at whim, and the lack of a horse/vehicle to travel around means you'll be walking and sprinting everywhere, ever mindful of your stamina bar. This is compounded by the complete lack of knowing how difficult any quest is. You really have no idea if any given quest is something you can achieve at your level. You'll plod off in the general direction, get destroyed, and have to limp back home and pick a different quest. This is made more exacerbating by the save system. While you can save anywhere, it doesn't save automatically, and you can't save in combat. Falling 3 meters can be lethal, but even when you learn to avoid that if you find yourself stuck in a bad encounter and forgot to save, you better hope you can run away or you'll have to reload from however long ago that was. Normally, you can just quick saves in games like this, but well....

This is very obviously a console port. Menus are terrible, inventory bloat is annoying, and saving your game requires 3 submenus instead of F5. Graphically it's dated the way games that try to realistic often do. Lighting & shadow effects are very poor and character models are hideous. Animations however do look good and the big set piece boss fights are impressive. 

I was already dreading playing this game after 4 hours, and after 8 hours i had to call it quits after the [spoiler]Water Altar[/spoiler], so my experience is only up to level 20 or so.

+ some monster combat encounters are cool. I really liked chopping hydra's heads off
+ well-built overworld and decent dungeon crawling (especially The Dark Arisen Dungeon)
+ pawns pick loot from the ground, so you don't have to... when they feel like it

+/- pawns existence makes you not feel so lonely, which is common in open world games. Unfortunately from the beginning you see them more as bots than as people. Even the lore doesn't see them as humans.
+/- janky, mostly because it attempts to do a lot of pretty original stuff - have you even seen a piece of meat that is burnt on the outside and raw inside? that's how this game feels like
+/- you can change the class almost effortlessly, but it it's not a reset - the stats you gained on one class carry over, so you can break your character if you want to min-max

- UI is obviously terrible
- encumbrance management makes sure that you don't forget how terrible the UI is
- there is too much running through the same locations over and over again
- story goes nowhere - there are characters, an overarching narrative, but it's barely an afterthought. I would actually say that there is no story, just ""story bits"" here and there. Like taking a 1000 pages script and picking 50 pages at random - would this be a coherent story? Sometimes, but mostly not. You don't get a chance to get attached to anything. The one question that was constantly on my mind was ""but why?"" and there was never any answer. No one even asked the question.
- difficulty is all over the place. The difficulty comes from two sources - spongy enemies and huge damage spikes, which come in the endgame. There can be no other type of difficulty since you can quaff litres of healing potions in an instant (TES-like). The most difficult enemies I encountered in the game? Not dragons, cyclops or hydras. These are easy. But a bunch of tanky wolves shooting fireballs... or this one enemy `spawning the same wolves in infinite quantities`. The biggest issue are the staggers...
- being unable to move my character because of staggers and stun locks started to be really annoying. There seemed to be no answer. Wolves are the worst and I just gave up in the middle of The Dark Arisen Dungeon, since I got bored and wasn't looking forward to more of the same (haven't finished the main story, but I think I was close)


It's not a great game, but it's not a bad one either. In the end I choose to give a negative, since the ""Very Positive"" rating at the time of review is too generous.

While the game would probably be good enough without it, the pawn system is clearly what sets it apart from its competition the most. In short: the game is meant to be played as a 4-men party where one is the player, one is the player's pawn, and the other two are other players' pawns. A pawn is a character that you build alongside your main char that is controlled by the AI and supports you during the game. You can customize its class, skills, looks and even its ai. Pawns can learn how to fight specific enemies and also give you hints during quests. Having 3 AIs with different behaviours and skills, that you probably will have to rely on a lot if you're a purely physical or magical fighter, makes for very dynamic and memorable battles.",1666137869,1666137869,True,1,0,0.531835198402404785,0,True,False,False

The story follows a number of similar beats; game opens, dragon attacks, your story begins, you travel to Gran Soren (Whiterun), Griffin attacks, you join guards to slay monster, whitebeards are on vacation so you meet with hobo in Stonehenge, and blahblahblah slay dragon blahblahblah.

The dragon is basically Alduin, but scary.  If I recall the Alduin fights correctly, you just yell at him a few times, he lands, you whack away, and he dies.  The dragon in this game, however, challenges you to either sacrifice a life to make him go away, or face him in battle; he then has this huge, crazy build-up as he chases you throughout an ancient ruin, taunting you all the while; then you have an epic (and challenging) final battle against an overpowered opponent, and... the game doesn't end.  There's more to the story!

Duke Edmun is like Jarl Balgruuf, but interesting.  He is said to be the previous ""Arisen"" (basically, bootleg dragonborn), who previously slew the dragon.  For much of the story, you run fetch quests for him, and then spoilers happen.  Sorry, not spoiling!

Then you have the game's ""vocation"" (read as class) system, which you can change at any time.  Almost.

Plus, there's a good variety in enemies, as opposed to just bandits and draugr.  Much more interesting.

All dressed up to the brim
Said he'd just came down from a place
Called ""Highland Rim""
Well, he said he came to ride the horse
The one they call ""The Brute""
But he didn't look like a cowboy
In his Continental Suit
We snickered at the way he dressed
But he never said a word
He walks on by the rest of us
As if he hadn't heard
A thousand bucks went to the man
Who could ride this wild cayuse
A meaner horse was never born
Than the one they called ""The Brute""
The horse that he was looking for
Was in chute number eight
He walked up very slowly
Put his hand upon the gate
We knew he was a thoroughbred
When he pulled his sack of ""Dukes""
From the inside pocket
Of his Continental Suit
Well, he rolled hisself a ""Corley""
And he lit it standing there
Blew himself a smoke ring
And he watched it disappear
We thought he must be crazy
When he opened up the gate
Standing just inside was
Fifeteen hundred pounds of hate
The Buckskin tried to run him down
But the stranger was too quick
He stepped aside and threw his arms
Around the horse's neck
And pulled himself up on the back
Of the horse they called ""The Brute""
Sit like he was born there
In his Continental Suit
""The Brute's"" hind-end was in the air
His front end on the ground
Kickin' and a-squealin', tryin' to
Shake this stranger down
But the stranger didn't give an inch
He came to ride ""The Brute""
And he came to ride the Buckskin
In a Continental Suit
Well, I turned around to look at Jim
And he was watchin' me
He said, ""I don't believe
The crazy things I think I see
But I think I see the outlaw
The one they call ""The Brute""
Ridden by a cowboy
In a Continental Suit""
""The Brute"" came to a stand-still
Ashamed that he'd been rode
By a city cowboy in
Some Continental clothes
The stranger took his money
And we don't know where he went
We don't know where he came from
And we haven't seen him since
The moral of this story:
Never judge by what they wear
Underneath some ragged clothes
Could be a millionaire
Everybody listen
Don't be fooled by this galoot
This sure-'nough bronc buster

I got 100% trophies on ps3, ps4, and pc.

Graphics-For being 10 years old, the graphics still hold up.
They aren't the best on the market but they play into the game so well. even to today's standards they are good.
8/10

Audio-The Music, Sound effects, and voice acting.
The music fits the theme of the game very well, the music during combat is exciting and ends leaving you feeling triumph with every boss fight. The music during cut scenes set the mood so well every time, supporting in the best way.
The voice acting is the most amazing, and you can often times hear loops of the same dialog over once in a while.
give the guy who plays jester a raise.7/10

Gameplay- Dark Souls meets Monster Hunter. on the easier difficulties and early areas, this game is very welcoming, you only really fight goblins, wolf, and the occasional bandit. None of them prove to difficult, or to easy the pacing is well.
But as you draw further into the game you find more difficult enemies.. or more difficult areas to fight enemies.
Something as simple as a cyclops can slap you off the face of a cliff ending your life, Making every fight with a large enemy or boss very rewarding. Knowing you can best enemies no matter the circumstances.
At higher difficulties and at end game, The enemies are ruthless, and unforgiving. you can find yourself in a situation of dying over and over if you dont play the fight just right.
The Climbing mechanic is okay, its not amazing, but its also not terrible. it leaves a lot open for creativity, but you dont miss to much by not using it.9/10

The Loot/Gear- Finding equipment to use early on is.. well it isn't, the equipment you can buy is slightly expensive to justify early on but can be done.. That being said, finding equipment comes at a good pace. You aren't SO reliant on gear early on. 
When you do find a new weapon or armor piece, it feels so gratifying. this does reward people who like to explore every single nook and cranny, and people who like to do every single quest.
95% of the gear looks amazing and feels great. and for the other 5% you don't even notice it long enough to matter.7/10

Trophies- A large portion of the trophies you get by just having fun playing the game.
But if you're looking for all 100%, be prepared to stab out your eyeballs.
There is a never ending list of quests that require you to run errands, stand around waiting, or preform tasks that have no relevance anywhere else. 
None of them are really that hard, and only a few are really time consuming so don't be scared going into that.8/10

Customization-Character creation is pretty unique, as your choices effect actual stats and mechanics in the game, though not enough to make anything unplayable or not viable.
Not to much to say here, maybe 7/10.

NewGame+. This game is heavily influenced by newgame+, Your fast travel is better and better with each play through making it worth to speed run the game 1-2 times before setting out on uncovering the map and hitting everything. Newgame+/10

Class System- There is a slew of classes, from your generic fighter/archer/Mage. But also with creative hybrids.
They all have their own unique play style, and they are all viable. Play whats most fun to you they all are great.
8/10 


The pawn system- I could write a novel here but instead im just gonna say, if you want to know about it read someones guide or something. I just throw my pawns off a cliff and play solo so i dont have to hear them blabbering. Rook/10


Final Thoughs.
As far as a single player rpg goes, this really is cream of the crop in my eyes. It does so many things so right, and so different in the best way possible. It rewards creative play style and thinking. all around very polished.8.5/10",1664762652,1664762695,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

One of the auto saves happened when i hire a pawn on the rift, then i entered a dungeon and finished it after more than an hour. and i manual saved after it. then i stopped playing.

Today, i just started my game just after a couple of minutes of long walk and forgetting something back at town, i decided to load the last checkpoint (thinking it will just load my manual save). But unfortunately it load, my autosave yesterday. the one on the rift, just before the dungeon run.

now it ruined all of my progress for several hours.

its a unique experience, but if you're not careful with, autosaves, manual saves, returning to checkpoints. you can ruin your entire progress.

It is surprising we have waited this long and are still waiting for the sequel, Dragon's Dogma 2.

            My biggest hang up is there are no Mounts and the only ability to fast travel is those stupid portcrystals that are in limited supply. They are heavy, so you can only take a few at a time, and you have to have already been to the place to put them down where you want to come back. It's not like other games where you can just discover it and you can fast travel later. In fact, other games reserve that for HARDCORE MODE but this game has that bullshit on EASY! Also, every single time, you have to defeat the same enemies on the way to your destination over and over again EVERY SINGLE TIME!
           There's even one enemy where you are NOT supposed to defeat it and by the time you find out, your potions are used up, your party is dead and you're going to die by whatever is waiting for you next. That enemy is the Black Chimera. 
       There is another wild card enemy called the Cockatrice where the first time you encounter it, the game waits to tell you until the LAST POSSIBLE MOMENT that you need to get special potions or else it will Petrify you to death.....but the town, which includes the ONLY APOTHECARY WHO HAS THEM is closed off due to the attack from this thing. It's like they were purposely trying to be irritating! I had to lose about 2 hours of game progress to go back to a check point and stock up, which included 4 gathering quests that I had to do over and turn in. 
       WIth all that said, the game is visually stunning, the lore is fascinating, and the combat itself is pretty well thought out. It could use more detail with how you command your pawns, besides Come, Help, and Go. I wish I could give them specific orders like ""Mage, Attack the Lion's head, Rogue, Climb the snake to chop off the head, Tank, keep the Goat head distracted so the mage doesn't get whacked."" 
         I also like how you can change your class through the game, but I highly recommend NOT doing that until your vocation is completely maxed out, and max out your new one BEFORE you get to a key point in the game. 
         All things considered, this is a good game to pass the time, while not perfect.

Found it when I was looking for a good Elder Scrolls alternative and I was impressed by it all. However, I depart my first playthrough with mixed feelings.

-I love the concept and the story was intriguing throughout. 
-The pawn system is a unique way of having a customisable follower and I adore this game for that. 
-The fact that you can change class for both yourself and your main pawn is brilliant and more games need the variety that this has.
-Every fight against a monster feels high stakes and challenging and even if the battle lasts half an hour, it has felt tense and exciting throughout. However, one or two of the bosses have felt a little underpowered for how much they were built up, such as [spoiler] against the Seneschal and Salomet [/spoiler].
-The customisation of your character and your main pawn is extensive, few games do it as well as I think DD has done. 
-The armours all look brilliant and you could reasonably play with armour that is very much sub-optimal and still have a good time. The customisation is again impeccable.

I would definitely recommend finishing the game, including all the post-Dragon content, and seeing the story fully end. The lore and the story behind the whole ending is brilliant and I aspire to that level of interesting world-building but despite this, the ending felt a little unsatisfactory to me, no matter which path you choose. This has made me a little reluctant to replay and clean up all the quests I didn't complete the first time, though I will come back again for another play, as it is, honestly, a really good RPG all things considered.

I do recommend it: basically because it is a masterpiece, although I have to say that I hoped it would have aged better. It is heavily conceived for console and it becomes very odd to play in 2022. The controls are horrible and the game has excessive loading screens.

Leaving aside the poor adaptation for PC, the game itself is a masterpiece for being such an old game, although today, having played countless other games, it becomes very strange to follow and get into the plot. In addition, the IA is not as clever as you may guess. The menus are pretty awful and hard to understand, player customization is very limited, and the story is pretty simple. However, it adds some interesting stuff and mechanics (reputation, crafting, etc) that makes the game interesting.

I do think it has to be in any bookstore for having marked a milestone in history, although it is not easy to play nowadays. If you have the change, get the music DLC, it's a masterpiece.",1664120406,1664120703,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's fun climbing on enemies I'll admit but sometimes you can clip right through the texture. Also through the game assets.

the graphics arent anything impressive, but some places in the game still look amazing regardless of that fact. like the blue moon tower.

Hasta ahora no hay un juego que entregue lo que este juego hace:

- Combate ágil versatil con muchas armas distintas y habilidades (el cambio de arco a espada por ejemplo no es igualado en ningún otro rpg que haya jugado
- Variedad de enemigos para usar esas habilidades, incluidos pequeños goblins hasta grandes dragones.
- Variedad de armaduras (Fashion Dogma) desde las armaduras más gruesas hasta las bikini armors este juego ofrece una de las más robustas personalizaciones en cualquier single player RPG game.
- Companions: un ""pawn"" que puedes personalizar como gustes y dos adicionales que puedes obtener directamente de otros jugadores que también diseñaron su pawn. Este sistema incrementa el sentido de aventura en equipo y lo lleva más lejos que Skyrim donde solo puedes tener un compañero sin MODs. 
- Diseño de calabozos, el equipo se esforzó en hacer los calabozos experiencias immersivas y no cuevas copy paste.
- Sistema de mejora de armas que alientan al adictivo grind, lo cual en este juego es un placer gracias a su gran gameplay.


No todo es genial, lamenteblamente:

- La Historía es presentada de una forma poco pregnante así como el worldbuilding parece pulido a medias.
- Lo anterior pega también a las interacciones con los npc que tampoco terminan de cuajar.
- Las gráficas ya están algo obsoletas sobre todo en el cabello de los personajes así como los rostros
- Hubiera sido genial poder cambiar de arma o clase ""on the fly"" y no tener que ir al menú o a un Inn a hacer los respectivos cambios.
- Un modo Online hubiera sido genial.
- El sistema de pawns es genial pero también hace que estos personajes sean genéricos y no tienen una personalidad real que pudo haberse arreglado con más compañeros predefinidos en la historia.
- El sistema de fast travel es limitado.

This game makes use of the videogame medium like no other. Games are replayable, social, and explorable. Dragon's Dogma utilizes these idiosyncrasies perfectly in the best game of this decade filled with thrilling combat, lore, and humor. 

[b]replayability[/b]
Most games include New Game+ as an extra, but Dragon's Dogma’s story is told in an infinite cycle. If you like to minmax, make unique characters, collect all the fashion items, unlock all the crafting recipes, pursue your one true Beloved, or just analyze a rich story and setting, you will replay the game many times. Initially, bandits will be nearly impossible to fight, but your character will be mowing through them before NG+. However, there will be a few challenges even after a NG+ or two in the main campaign. Bitterblack Isle and the Ur-Dragon, will be challenging even at max level. Nothing besides your personal ability stops you from entering any area or facing anything, though.

[b]single-player with optional pawn trading[/b]
This is a single-player game with online connectivity. (Offline with pre-made pawns is always an option.) As the Arisen, you will have complete control over the development of one fully-customizable party member known as a Pawn. It will fight by your side, learn from the behaviors you exhibit (if you loot everything, your pawn will learn to loot everything), study monsters through battle, and automatically be hireable for RC by other players to benefit from your training. If that other player shows your Pawn a new strategy, it will bring the new information home. The Pawn system also allows for reviewing with helpful/funny preset comments and trading via gifts. This way, you can actually earn recognition for the Utilitarian/Challenge pawn with a Triple-Dragonforged Delta Guard. 

[b]exploration[/b]
I’m still learning things after hundreds of hours across platforms! The map is big and extends far beyond the scope of the story. It also has a lot of hidden verticality for bizarrely competent platforming. The From a Different Sky quests really highlight this feature. If you like lore and story, Dragon’s Dogma has an inexhaustible amount of lore to investigate. The setting of Gransys has a rich history, evidenced in the variances of architecture, quest and NPC dialogue, and the costumes of the other Arisens. The characters are all interdependent and political. 

Many people accuse the game of having minimal story. It’s true that the main story line dialogue is [i]mostly[/i] to-the-point about you being an undead hero of prophecy come to rid the land of an ancient dragon (or just run some errands for the Duke who wishes to delay you at all costs). However, dig deeper into their motivations and relationships, and there is definitely plenty of story. They don't spell everything out for you.

[b]best combat ever, easily in line with Monster Hunter or Dark Souls[/b]
Today, my Arisen oiled the wings of a Griffon with arrows, and grasped onto its legs as it lifted from the ground to flee. Holding on for dear life as the Griffon was gaining altitude, my Arisen gained a firm grip and drove fiery daggers into the beast’s flesh until both its wings were set ablaze. She rode the burning griffon to the ground where her pawns finished it off. I was so scared the whole time that I’d lose my grip. That wasn’t even a quest, just a random encounter. 

[b]romance[/b]
Dragon’s Dogma subverts the Damsel in Distress cliché. The Arisen can be male or female, and the “damsel” can be nearly any NPC in the game. By any, I mean you can seriously accidentally get married to gross old men, pre-married women, and children. There are tricks to getting who you want, but something always seems to go wrong and you end up with Fournival or Caxton as your Beloved. It lends some anticipation for the climax cutscene. 

[b]ridiculous people[/b]
The characters are as ridiculous as the dialogue. The cast includes a foreign rich girl who pretends to be a knight, an overly flirtacious girl who opens a shop with access to an exclusive master weaponsmith through unreturned favors, a villager who pretends to be an adventurer only to die along the easiest paths (voiced by Vic Mignogna no less! haha!), a rarity trader who frequents the local counterfeiter, [spoiler]the dreamy Night’s Champion[/spoiler], and so many others.

It's a less ambitious and more limited game than ""Skyrim"", but has way better combat (although not as good as the one in ""Dark Souls"", the game that made ""Skyrim"" obsolete). It would be toppled by the likes of ""The Witcher 3"" and ""Kingdom Come: Deliverance"", but it's still playable today. 

Story and characters are not memorable, but there are some cool boss fights, like the hydra, the chimera, the ogre, the golem, the griffin and, of course, the dragon.

I'll start with the obvious, pawn system - the Skyrim equivalent of follower.
Game lets you borrow two, plus one permanent customable pawn. You design it to your own liking, other borrow if they need, and it's the greatest selling point of this game for me. Until I realize the AI is so messed up.

AI casters tend to spam HIGHEST spell like meteor swarm, lasting 15-20 seconds under constant threat and may accomplish NOTHING. Because small fries like goblin die in 2 seconds, and a sneeze from sub-bosses interrupts casting.

And it's frustrating that some spells literally fill your entire screen, including healing spells. It gets worse in end game hard mode when healing could take 20 seconds and 1 hit from sub-bosses puts you back.

Furthermore, AI casters may cast spells in MELEE range. The combat range is really short. In comparison, Skyrim's AI is not much better but the spells aren't interruptible and have very short cast time.

Also, fortunately in Skyrim they don't have huge ass cyclops/gorecyclops swinging literally five/fifteen metres hammer, hitting everything in the process, including your poor mage pawn who should be a dead, dead weight by now. Pun intended.

And unfortunately, you can't get rid of the mage, because some enemies (read : enemies, not bosses) are immune to physical.

The game is balanced around four characters, unless you spam periapts of cheese.
Therefore you, the only human, have to nit-pick mages, summoning 5 each time, from a laundry list of mages. Because they need correct inclination (AI behavior), otherwise no matter how godly the gear/skillset is, it's busted.

So some people feels compelled to play a mage, as the moron among us is better than the AI.

To make it worse, the upgrade system requires, you, not your pawn, to wear the gear you want to upgrade, and kill any type of dragon (drake, wyrm, wyvern).

This process they name it : dragonforged. It was novel and awesome until it is a problem because some gear can't be worn unless you're the correct class, or gender.

The gender isn't a problem unless you want to dress your follower, ahem, half naked.

But the class is a problem.
Because if you play a mage, you might want a fighter/warrior pawn to tank. And you can't wear warrior gear.

So you ended up going back and forth swapping pawns and changing class, available only in cities/towns -only to suffer your patience tested. Because you're invested as mage, your physical stats are lacking, your physical skills are lacking - so you rely on moron AI.

Fortunately, game is really forgiving when you messed up your build - otherwise it would be terrible since multi save is not possible, back up save does not exist some side quests fail if you progress main quest.

Ultimately after continuously harassed by your ultimate archenemy, death itself, and grinding yourself to max level, max gear, and you fight him on equal term, your pawn goes apeshit and HE FLEES. If this is not infuriating then I don't know what infuriating is.

IN MY OPINION :
Dragon's Dogma could have been a mainstream, comparable to Skyrim, but never did, because it's drained down by boatload of issues.

Some of them is literally trivial, such as spell description missing basic necessity like stamina cost, damage modifier, cast time and only has vague explanation like ""summon a pillar of ice blah blah"".

Saw a guy upgraded his pawn's meteor storm only to rant. Because the upgraded version took 50% longer to cast, on an already long cast time, in which he probably have finished his coffee when the spell came.

Going for the thumbs down despite having 124 hours in this game, cleared hard mode, level 200, plenty of enjoyable moments, because when I'm buying something I always find thumbs down most helpful in finding deal-breakers.",1662025225,1663221661,False,6,8,0.481120526790618896,0,True,False,False

Every enemy is beatable sure, but my GOD is it obnoxious to hit random enemy and see literally no change in their health bar, and then just sit there smacking them while they 2 shot stagger you, and constantly one shot your pawns, and you just run back and forth between your pawns resurrecting them as they basically fight the enemy for you while you hit them as much as you can, hoping the enemy doesn't accidentally notice or hit you and instantly kill you. From lizards to bandits with more health than most dark souls bosses, to 2 dozen wolves that just flee, leap and down you, flee, leap and down you, I've never encountered more obnoxious enemies in any game. Doable? sure. Fun? Fuck off with that. Gets better later? Cool, explain why the beginning has to be awful? No seriously, why is it necessary for the beginning to be genuinely trash? No? No actual reason? Cool, gonna uninstall and play literally anything else. Playing DS2 and 3 at SL 1 with only starting equipment is more balanced and fun. Not even joking, it's genuinely more fun. Also, WORST stamina travel system.

If you're here because you've heard endless praise, I'm hear to remind you that Avatar also made over a billion dollars, there's definitely been zero drops in quality for pokemon games, the Kardashians are apparently worth worshiping, and homeless people apparently just don't want to work for a living. Not everything a large group of people say and think is entirely valid. Sure, the game has really fun combat, lots of options, and some great spectacles. But fuck this, I'll just play any dark souls, shadow of the colossus, or any other half decent fantasy rpg. Hell, unmodded Skyrim is more fun and engaging than this. Don't care if it gets better, or I've ""chosen the wrong way to play"". What game gimps 1 of the only 3 starting class option? I refuse to believe I'm supposed to choose fighter or caster, or just grind levels in the opening area. And if that is the case, take ONE class in game design, present a game concept with half these issues, and regardless of the positives, I just don't think you'll get a very good grade on that assignment.

Also! FUCK THE NAME CENSORSHIP. apparently any combination of letters that, in any european language, isn't aggressively G rated, it just censors that part of the name. Censors a LOT more than you'd think. Your name includes a series of letters that are a dirty word in Finnish? Censored. In game characters have names that have some random bad word in some random euro language? Censored. It's a single player game for fucks sake, and they even added a moniker system for when you show up online, literally no reason. Potentially good game with so many confusingly obtuse design choices. Like a triangle shaped car that requires you to enter a unique password for each gear you want to shift to, and a trunk that slowly crushes your stuff the longer you drive, but everyone swears can be the fastest, most fuel efficient care of all time if you can just get used to it.

(+)
1. Game Mechanics:

* Most people don't like the fast traveling mechanic in this game, especially in the beginning of the game where the travel crystals are rare (I forgot what it's called it's been a while)
But for me it makes the gameplay more interesting (realistic) and makes you appreciate the environment in this game as you travel.

* 1 thing that I wish I knew before playing this game was, there is a thing called min/max a character.
Where your character or your pawn stats increase based on what job/class you picked when you leveled up.
(If you are the type of people that are concerned with character stats, I suggest researching this 1st, or be prepared to delete your save)

* The pawn (companion) mechanic in this game is certainly unique, and not bad. But it still lack a few things in my opinion though.

* Combat mechanic in this game most certainly without a question is the best.

2. Good DLC (Dark Arisen):
* Soulslike, and I don't mean just the environment.

* Soundtracks don't disappoint.

* New mechanics.

* Definitely a treat for end game player, especially for someone that finished the base game for several times.

In past 5-7 years I've played Risen, Gothic 2 and I liked them. Maybe except Gothic ending. I've played a lot of Souls-likes and platinum'd them. I've been trying to play Skyrim 3 times but couldn't, not my cup of tea. I mention this on purpose to be clear.

But I've dropped this game. Extremely boring and poorly designed.

Combat system is awful. I've started on Hard difficulty, right away noticed it's most likely not designed for 1st playthrough, because almost all enemies, except the smallest were killing me in one or two hits. I've played mage, mage + rogue hybrid class. You don't have any defensive mechanics, except Roll from latter class later in game. I don't even think it has i-frames. Point is, archers shoot your seeker projectiles, big opponents are very fast and have charge attacks. Small opponents are also quick. All casts and bow skills took stamina, which you need to run away from danger, the only possible way. If you overused offensive skills and drained all stamina, character falls into fatigue, being extremely slow and unable to act. Companion can run to you and recover a bit, but not always. I've even installed mod for unlimited Sprint. At first glance everything became a little more bearable. But still extremely boring.
I swapped diff-ty to normal after ~10 hours. Enemies were doing much less damage, more forgiving stamina managing, but..nothing changed dramatically. Didn't have fun. Played for several more hours and didn't return to it since.

Another bad part of the game is Health management. The more hits you take, the less Max HP you have until you rest in town. So, at some point, while still playing at Hard Mode I've had half hp all the time. I'm looking at you human archers. On top of that the most effective way of healing is to have companion with long ass single healing  aoe cast. Potions aren't common and don't regen much. Maybe I failed to see or understand smth, idk.

Also never liked mute protagonists. I know it's for immersion or due to lack of funds. But considering amount of voice lines and chatter from companions, latter isn't the case.

I swapped difficulty to check the story and...there isn't much story. Dragon stole you heart, you want it back. You've made some research, received Jester hat at court and that's basically it. That's all the story for 15 hours.

The only feature I liked - classes. There are basic, advanced and hybrid classes. So, you start as Mage, then you can pick Sorcerer. Then you can pick either Magic Archer or Mystic Knight. And no one forbid you to play as the Fighter (Warrior) or Strider (Rogue). Basically you can play every class in the game in one save. The only requirement - small fee to unlock it. Progression isn't bad too, but let's keep it short.

TL;DR: I didn't like because of multiple questionable game design decisions, boring story.

But also it commits the cardinal sin of just being boring, there's little of interest to find if you do go out and explore every little nook and cranny making it feel very unrewarding.

Combat - fell floaty and lacking punch. I think as only certain classes can block or dodge that leads quite a bit to it feeling like you can't be responsive.

Quests - the usual boring chosen one kinda deal. I will say one of the few well implemented ideas is that you can make forgeries of things. Want to keep that item you've been told to go get for someone, make a forgery and give them that instead... buuuut, maybe down the line this'll have some unforeseen consequence.

Bitterblack Isle was a significant improvement. It felt dangerous and interesting to sulk around in. But by that point I was so done with the game I had to force myself to keep heading through.

Also bonus points to some weird bug that makes the game take a screenshot every time you get an achievement so I've not got tons at as a cutscene is fading in to start, haha.",1662592177,1662592177,False,1,0,0.448275864124298096,0,True,False,False

Playing in a party of 4 (With 2 being Pawns) made the combat flow stand out to me since I wasn't the only one contributing.
Solid 8/10
A few things you may be curious about

Teleportation:
Yes, you can only teleport to select locations. You can teleport to the 2 main towns and through the story you can get Port Crystals to place down at a spot you want to teleport to (you get 3 iirc). At most you maybe have a 3 minute walk. Traveling really isn't that bad. Check your Storage at an Inn and there should be an Eternal Ferrystone there for unlimited teleports.

Combat:
I played as Sorcerer so I was much more passive. You can select the classes of your Pawns to customize how you want your team to fight. You are usually a party of 4. Climbing up monsters is pretty satisfying, although you almost never do it as a mage class. Sorcerers get crazy spells which are awesome to use. The only thing I'd want to add is some sort of roll button. My only method of dodging was either sprinting away or jumping. 

Graphics: I mean, this game is 10 years old. It looks decent by my standards. There is an ENB and textures mod if you really want it to look better.

Story: A dragon shows up to your home town and you are brave enough to challenge it. The dragon easily defeats you and steals your heart, making you an Arisen. The dragon beckons you to defeat it once you are ready. You go on an adventure and fight a bunch of monsters to try and take down the dragon. That's a basic summary without much spoilers. I quite enjoyed it tbh. At the end there are some quests I feel like could've been flushed out more with dialogue but it isn't bad by any means. The entire cycle the game revolves around is extremely interesting to me.

How long to beat?
The bare bones ""beat the dragon"" took me 30 hours. The post game content took 10-15. There is DLC called Bitterback Isle that I did not get to, which is even more content

the spells are cool, combat is enjoyable and rewarding, and having the freedom to change your class (vocation) at any point in the play through grants so much versatility and helps to combat stagnancy.

Dragons Dogma is a good game, decent graphics for its time and runs smoothly. Lots to do which gives it massive longevity to keep you coming back for more. Huge selection of weapons and armours as you progress, all upgradable with specific materials you gain from exploring, mining and killing stuff. Good selection of classes, skills and spells to keep each play-through fresh and with Game+ mode you just keep getting stronger.

BUT! After 450+ hours I have some negative, if not a little infuriating points you may wish to consider. [b]Pawns[/b]
Your companions called (Paws) are there to help support your quest, either with combat or healing. The problem being they are morons who often do very little when it counts, except do nothing, get killed and need constant reviving. Even after hundreds of hours training, they are still more of a hindrance then a help in later game, seriously dumb as mud!

The devs love putting treasure chests on the edge of cliffs, and Pawns love to hop over things... you guessed it, they jump off the cliffs! You can summon them back later [i](before you say YAY!)[/i] all the inventory they were holding for you, including rare crafting materials has now vanished.  Seriously don't trust them with your valuables, actually just don't rely on them much at all.

[b]Affinity[/b]
Got to love some romance in a game to add some personal depth, Dragon's Dogma has that.. well sort of. By giving gifts and doing quests you gain affinity with NPC's, practically anyone is fair game with only a couple of exceptions.  But.. it's about as accurate as a fart in a hurricane, and as reliable as the Pawn's IA. You could literally end up with anyone you do quests for, or the same person over and over with every play-through. A big glass bowl they could all put their car keys in would have been better.

[b]Combat[/b]
While I can't fault the actual combat system, it's pretty good and fluid throughout, many ways to play changing the whole dynamic of the game.  Then you get to Bitterblack Isle, the Dark Arisen part of the game which is mostly fun, challenging with greater rewards.  Crazy boss fights and lots of new dangerous foes, dark dungeon crawling... Until you reach higher levels where challenging just becomes a tedious.  Long bouts of button bashing, being knocked on your backside, grappled. Getting hit with spells over and over is fun, the residence of Biterblack Isle can cast more spells in half the time and a never ending pool of stamina to do it with. 

Apart from the much later game it's a good fun, but that's why it only gets a 7/10 from me. Infuriating at times, but not enough to ruin the rest of the game.

It is a charming, corny, and janky game that in 2022 feels like an Early Access title. The story is barely there and really not worth mentioning at all other than the absolutely hammy English dub. The quest system was not very good in 2012 and is pretty horrible 10 years later. Where Dragon's Dogma shines is its combat system, it is very fun and rewards experimentation. While the combat system favors ranged attacks more than close quarters, pretty much every class is playable and fun to do. Magic Archer and Sorcerer can be outright broken once you nail the mechanics down and equip the right abilities. 

The game can be done in about 20 hours with the ""Dark Arisen"" release adding the Everfall and Bitter Back Island that gives a more satisfying conclusion to the story. Bitterback is an extremely hard dungeon that can be very rewarding if you stick to it and experiment with the great combat mechanics. In Dragon's Dogma your team consists of ""Pawns"" which are basically blank slate humanoid servants that follow you around. You get one fully customizable Pawn for yourself, and can choose various user created Pawns that other players made as recruitable members to your team but do not level up. While their dialogue can be annoying, the Pawn system is pretty neat with the Pawns learning your playstyle and adapting to it. Another interesting thing about the Pawn system is that if you recruit a Pawn that has already done whatever quest you are currently on they can give you hints on what to do next if you are stuck.  

Dragon's Dogma was an underrated title when it came out in 2012, it plays like a mix of Monster Hunter and Dark Souls that rewards creativity and dedication. A major gripe with the title is their really is not a good fast travel system so you will have to run from place to place rather frequently which can actually take quite a while. To alleviate that I recommend getting the infinite running stamina, increased jump, and increased carry load from Nexus mods to decrease potential frustration.

The game is fun depending on which class you choose, but you can respec very easily part way through with no penalty other than you may have bad stats since each class gets a different distribution at level up. Classes to avoid are mage, sorcerer, and warrior. Spellcasting is tedious and better left to pawns, the warrior's attacks are so slow I can't stand it. I favored the ranger or assassin, fighter is meh because there is no need for a tank and the mystic night can do everything it can but better and augment weapons for the whole group. You will run around a lot at first (hiking sim plus baddies), it gets a lot better when you can start using the portacrystal system which allows you to place fast travel spots around the map, only 5 at first but then 10 on your second playthrough. Overall pretty good but put enough time in and you will get to a high level and balance goes out the window with most things being helpless and then a few enemies on bitterblack isle will still be very dangerous (instagib capable) and hard to kill even at high levels (hours to kill 1 time).

Pros:
-Character customization
-Pawn(helper) customization (you can also chose their class, spells, equipements)
-Pawn system
-Climbing system. If you play something with a sharp edge (i.e. fighter, assassin etc.) you can actually climb on big monsters and stab them in their weak spots.

Mixed:
-Music is mid. Sometimes i almost wanted to put it on mute and put a personal playlist.
-Spells. Some class have really cool spells and can have 9+ spells simultaneously, while other class get some really useless stuff and only 2 spell slots. Not much personalization of skills too

Cons:
- Armor/weapons. I didnt feel like any weapon was GODLY or had a HUGE advantage over another. The best armor you'll play with is found in the main city and purchasable, so there is really no incentive on trying to find better gear. (I cleared the game easily with the armor sold in the main city)
-Atmosphere. There is absolutly no change beside a night/day cycle. No snow biome, no swamp biome, no scorched earth biome etc. Always in the same grassy land/forest.
-HUD. The HUD might just be the absolute nail in the coffin for this game, it is absolutly NOT user friendly. You cant press I to acces inventory, nor M to acces the map, or Q to acces quest. You have to press ESC everytime, and then chose what menu you want to open. On top of that, if youre in your inventory and want to equip a cool new sword, you have to open up another menu just to equip it. It is really not genuine.

- You feel a sense of satisfaction progressing the game and completing challenges (mostly the DLC island)
- Monster climbing
- Pick up a monster and throw it to another monster. Pick up your allies and throw them to their deaths, or to a monster to deal dmg with them. Pick up objects from the ground and throw them to deal damage.
- You can change classes (vocations) as many times as you want, get all permanent perks and progress all of them (downside, you'll get stuck with whatever stats scaling they had when you were leveling eg. you played sorcerer the most -> 0 strength, max magic permanently).
- Early levels are unforgiving for melee classes (eg. low lvl tank experience: instant death from a wolf bite if not blocked), pretty neat
- Lighting: lantern is a must at night if you dont already know where you are. Night time is almost pitch black, but a clear sky with a moonlight is enough to navigate the main road. Lanterns have to be refilled every now and then.

[b]Cons:[/b]
- Combat can be incredibly clunky for some classes, but quite smooth for others.
- No animation cancel (you started a 2 second action? well, i guess you're stuck watching it: lantern, climbing, skill, dialog, etc.)
- Action queue (you accidentally pressed a button 2x? you wanted to switch on that lantern? well, you're stuck watching your character turning it on, then off for 6 seconds)
- Some spell effects are a constant flashbang, blocking all view
- Pawns are incredibly dumb (they like to randomly jump off cliffs to their deaths if you're sprinting)
- AI is ridiculously dumb (avoid escort quests, some npcs start spinning and running in circles, get exhaused, run 1 meter, get exhausted again, and can also just jump off to their deaths for no reason even without sprinting)
- Most random dialogs gave me brain damage (avoid talking to anything that's not a quest related dialog, you'll regret it)
- Pawn dialogs = unfinished placeholder tooltips (eg. ""If you're tired, rest."", ""You got lost? Just look at the map"", ""The outside world has treasures, but dangers too"")
- Most quests are relatively boring and simple
- Nothing can influence the outcome of the main quest. Even if you choose a different ending, kill the quest npcs, etc, you must continue the predetermined storyline. Your character just dies after an unacceptiable outcome.

Overall a mixed experience, but you can find a playstyle and content you can enjoy. For 5€ on sale, max ~150hrs is quite a deal!",1662232820,1662232820,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Let's break down my biggest problems with it so far: (Please note that I'm playing as a mage on easy mode as this is my first time playing this game, though I have decent experience in this genre)

1. The save system pisses me off to no end and actively makes the gameplay experience worse. Turns out this game has two save systems, checkpoints, which the game determines and lets you load from the save menu, and the most recent manual save, which you can only return to upon death. For example, you can't be losing a battle and go into the Loading menu and choose to load you last save, which may be right before the fight you lost. Alternatively, it lets you load the last checkpoint which will drag you back any amount of time or progress then will immediately save over that manual save. So if you load your last checkpoint by mistake you lose all your progress beyond that point permanently. I hate this so so much.

2. Being a mage is extremely unintuitive for first-time (keyboard) players. The game does not tell you how to use your abilities. I had to look through vague control settings to see if there was some better way to do magic than shooting 4 light-balls since I purchased many special spell abilities (the cool shit mages should be using). Turns out to access the menu for THOSE spells I needed to hold down L or R control before it would show me the keys I needed to press to enable the use of the actual spells. There is no way to make your primary or secondary moves on the basic move screen that only lets you physically hit things and shoot some shit damage light-balls. At that point I was many hours into the game and never once was any of that mentioned. It felt wrong for a game to have such a shitty magical system so I had to google my solutions to find out why my mage couldnt do any damage to anyone. This along with the mages devastatingly low beginning health (unknown comparatively with other classes, maybe they have the same amount of health, just better physical defense probably) means on easy mode you might survive 3 hits from non-archer bandits. And the bandits never stop coming.

3. Quests and openworld areas don't tell you how difficult they will be. There might have been some kind of number value somewhere on the signboard, but evidently I've missed it every single time. Otherwise you can walk from a basic zone to a zone with a 15 bandits right next to that basic zone with no indication you're doing so.

4. The weapon menu and inventory are clunky as hell. The controls for keyboard are an awkward mix of keyboard and mouse where sometimes the mouse will be able to select things and sometimes it wont be. As well every character has their own exclusive inventory that you're constantly trying to shuffle items in between. I can't help but think there could have been a better way to do this.

5. Early game has way too many combat encounters. Every minute I spend travelling between cities during the day will have at least 2 minutes worth of combat encounters with random garbage enemies like bandits, goblins and wolves. Not to mention it's incredibly difficult to judge how hard the combat encounter will be as sometimes all enemies are aggroed at once and they'll wipe the whole team and sometimes it's just one or two enemies at a time, which will be easy peasy to clear out. Frequently I'll encounter a troop of bandits is either a TPK or a breeze and there's no way to tell which it will be, even on easy mode. This is my biggest pet peeve with the game. You spend so much time in overly frequent combat for several minutes at a time that you can't get anything done.

So many small things in this game just make it so damn frustrating as all getout to play.

Here are some good things:
- Lots of unique looking character customization options for yourself and your pawn companion.
- I like the concept of a constant pawn companion who will grow beside you. I made mind a warrior so he would always protect me (mage). I generally enjoy the concept of pawns even if they talk a bit too much about nothing.
- Games visuals have held up well enough for a game this old.
- Becoming a suicidal/arrogant dragons chosen champion is a cool concept, even if everyone hypes up my abilities way too much early on XD I'm literally a fisherman with a staff, stop pretending like we actually killed that hydra instead of it running away lol",1661981699,1662085829,False,1,0,0.436267733573913574,0,True,False,False
