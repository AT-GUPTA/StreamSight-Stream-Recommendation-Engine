to actually play it and have the full experience you have to constantly pay it for features you would expect the free version to already have. it's ridiculous to see 32 species of animals and only be able to hunt 3 of them, and then find out that you have to pay real money for rifles, ammo, all the different kinds of permits...

i decided i had enough when i saw that even bait and calls cost real money. while the latter could be reused, the former is a consumable and it makes zero sense to make it unavailable to people that don't want to pay a monthly subscription for playing an essentially singleplayer videogame

this way of implementing microtransactions (can they even be called micro if you transact sums that rival some AAA titles' prices?) is outrageous and predatory. games need money to be made and maintained, yes, but, in my opinion, simply adding ""shortcut"" purchases and some ""premium"" vanity items could've easily funded it too.


it sucks because the base game is actually fun. the way the guns reload, the way you use the mating calls, that moment you catch movement in the brush...

all the while you're surrounded by a forest that, although rendered at a very low resolution, looks gorgeous. also, the map is enormous, though the slow walking speed might be the main culprit for making it feel so big.


the only reason why i could recommend this game is if you just want to try and see if you like hunting sims at all. since it's still technically free, all you will lose is your time (and based on the fact that you read some random guy's review of game called ""theHunter"", you clearly don't value it much).

if you do end up liking it - they have a one-time purchase sequel named ""call of the wild"", but honestly, with how aggressive its dlcs are (and how much stupider its ai felt like to me), I'm not sure I'd recommend it either.",1488115289,1656970319,False,10,0,0.600599288940429688,2,True,False,False

Memberships are no more, all members are permitted to hunt all animals (given they have the right calibres to do so). REAL MONEY ECONOMY IS STILL A THING but now at least you now are able to hunt all the animals and play multiplayer with your friends without paying for a subscription. Some item in game are a bit over priced like the jeep with the jurassic park skin thats priced at $50 USD (diffence between $50 and $5 is just a skin and a roof) (although there are other jeeps for like $5 USD). Other than that i found myself really getting back into this game after 2 years. Actually being able to go out and hunt with my friends without a subscription has actually change my review of this game! I may have missed some aspects of the recent updates on account of not touching it for two years but I have to say my review (and opinion) has somewhat changed for the better.
TL:DR: Animals and multiplayer sessions are now open to F2P players but guns still cost real world money (insane in game money prices)

The developers of the theHunter have done something very different and I think that is why there are so many negative reviews. So instead of purchasing a whole game and just blazing through a story line to have it sit at the bottom of a pile of new games after a month or so, the dev's have made an online store / outfitters, (which is exactly what it is. welcome to cabela's.) where you can purchase just the gear that you want. there are no weapon unlocks; no clothing upgrades; no higher-powered uber ammunition that is going to kill 3 deer with 1 bullet. Instead, you open ""Store"" and buy what you want for gear, wether its a treestand, a bow, some duck decoys or a dog.

This was a very smart move by the dev's and I can appriciate the new approach. I would however like to see a better use for gm's (game money) so it may be used on a broader range of items. currently it is used to buy licenses and replenish consumables. The em's (electronic money, purchased with your dollars online) are for your weapons, clothing, and other equipment and pets.

I think it's this new style of purchasing stucture that players have a hard time with as many reviews just say ""Let me buy the whole game"". When in fact you can, just in small pieces at a time that would cost you a fortune.

Personally I think this is a 5 star game. I found no bugs. I do however wish there was a way to increase the detail distance beyond what seems to be about 250 yards or so, but its not game breaking and allows the game to run smoothly. 

My advise:
Download it. Give it a shot. Spend some time in a few different areas. Focus on big game. Do ""Missions"" for whitetail and mule deer to get your gm's up. Find out which +2 species are open for hunting on facebook (Check to see your weapon can kill them legally) and do those missions too, the gm's earned will pay for a 1 day, 7 day or 28 day license on an animal of your choosing. (purchaseable in the store).",1488034735,1488034735,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are a few things I will be going over and I will include a brief pros and cons list at the end. This review is my opinion only.

SOUND:
In game sound plays a very vital role in theHunter as you need to listen to your surroundings for nearby trotting animals. The sounds this game uses is phenominal and very immersive on my Dolby 7.1 Surround Sounds headset. Although this game's sound is amazing, having a decent headset is almost a requirement.

GAMEPLAY:
This is the most realistic hunting game on the market currently. Tracking and stalking your prey, lining up your shot, and the satisfying feeling of nabbing your big buck is amazing. Not every animal is able to be hunted when first starting out, but with time you are able to hunt every animal in the game without having to pay for a license. The game has a free week system in place where a select few animals are free to hunt for that week. However, if you want to full game experience and unlock every single item in the game for you to use whenever you want, then you need to fork over ~$360.00 in microtransactions on their website. 

STORY:
This is a sandbox hunting game with zones. No story mode for this game, though I would've liked to see a Career Mode of some sort. Certainly not needed for this game.

GRAPHICS:
This game has a gorgeous atmosphere at its highest settings, though it is super intensive on your graphics card. If you don't have a great graphics card, your game will not perform all that well and the lower settings pale in comparison to this games highest settings.

REPLAY VALUE:
With the ability to hunt with your friends this game is fun as a get away from your other games. For the serious hunter, unless your buy an absurd amount of items with real money (including lincenses for other animals), this game will get boring quickly being limited to a very small selection of huntable animals.

MY OPINION:
I absolutely love this game, but it comes at a price. Being listed as a Free to Play game is certainly misleading, but it can still be a truly Free to play experience with patience. Earning in game currency takes a long time to accumulate, and the best items can only be bought with real money. The hunting experience this game delivers is unrivaled and extremely satisfying. Just remember that this isn't Call of Duty and you can't run and gun. This game takes patience and dedication if you want to nab yourself a great trophy animal.

Would I recommend buying this game as a Free to Play game? Sure, as long as you know going in that you won't be able to hunt every single animal in the game all at once. If you want to hunt a certain animal, either purchase the lincense (which will expire) or wait until its free for the week.

PROS:
+30 different species to hunt
+Huge hunting reserves
+Great atmosphere
+Most realistic hunting game
+Fun to play with friends
+Competitive tournaments

CONS:
-Expensive microtransactions
-Steep learning curve

I hope the developers realize they would make more money if they sold it, with everything unlocked, rather than make it free.

Does this game deserve 40% negative review? short answer: NO. Long answer: Still no, but I understand why its so low. This game is advertized as a ""free to play"" game. This is sadly not the case. This is a pay to play Hunting simulator. And let me tell you, this is the single best hunting game ever made. Hands down the most fun and imersive hunting experience I have ever had the pleasure to enjoy. I love this game and always will. TheHunter classic will be a game I come back to again and again for two reasons. 
1) Like I said above this game gets hunting right. From big game to small the team at EW has done an amazing job creating beutifull hunting reserves inhabited by great looking and beliveable animals to hunt. Its a blast to shoot bucks and ducks alike.
2) I have spent too much money not to get the most out of this game. I think I am sitting at about a $250 bill when it is all said and done. From guns, blinds, lures, callers, bait stations, tents and any hunting equipment you could think of I have bought something of it. But here is why this game is sitting at 40% negative on steam review.

The majority of reviews here are from people who downloaded the game, played for a hour and quit and uninstalled when they saw what is free in the game. Which is not very much. You can always hunt for free with licences for Whitetail deer, all the rabbits and pheasant's. They also give you the means to hunt all of these animals. For free equipment you get the .243 bolt action rifle, 12ga single shot shotgun (not free when I started years ago by the way, bonus for new players now!) and unlimited free ammo for both guns. You also get binoculars, deer bleet caller and a camera to take pics with. You as a free user can also join other hosts multiplayer games but you yourself can't host a game without membership. You can complete missions for specific animals and earn in-game money to buy consumables with. You cant get any weapons with the mission money. You can however earn the premium curency by entering and winning competitions (you are unlikely to win so I dont really count this).

 By now many people will already not want to bother trying this game if you have read this far. 

Try it anyways. 

Trust me here you cant get some really fun hunting done with what you have a free user. Its basicly a demo so why not give it a try and see if you like it. And if you do like the game then buy a membership package. I recomend the $54 one that gives you a year of licences to hunt all animals and a bunch of new weapons and equipment to get you a really good start. With that package you dont really need to buy anything else to get the full experience out of the game.

Here are some tips to get free stuff in game (dont say the devs never gave you anything).

By verifying your email you get a free rifle. Do that in your account info in the launcher. Aslo if you send a referal link to a friend (find that in the launcher sidebar) and they make a TheHunter account you get a ground blind free and your friend gets premium curency and some free equipment. So get a friend to try with you, and if they decide to buy a membership  package (you will get the following rewards depending on what package they buy) you get a premium engraved .308 rifle, engraved deer ""grunt"" caller and a two person tree stand all for free. Also in steam there is a free dlc equipment package that gives you a bunch of consumables for no cost.",1486801339,1486801339,True,4,0,0.538461565971374512,0,True,False,False

-Gameplay
The gameplay in the Hunter is bad. It's an open world hunting game, so you think they would hold the gameplay, specifically the shooting, at the utmost importance. Well the shooting is atrocious and I can’t say much for the other aspects; You can shoot a deer in the face, factoring in wind and distance, and it'll miss. One thing this game does well however is ""the hunt""; stalking prey. The game manages to create an atmosphere where you are immersed. Trekking over large areas of land in search for a deer or bear, but the game takes you right out of that immersion; with it's payed content and pay to win elements. To have a better shot at taking down what you're shooting you have to pay real money for a better gun. Otherwise you're stuck with the default pea-shooter. That is if you've payed to be able to hunt certain types of animal. Which in a sense adds to realism, considering you need licences to hunt certain animals, and immersion because you'll be ""stalking"" animals much longer in search for the few that you can hunt. But that level of realism seems ridiculous to me. It’s restricts the playability of your game. 
In regards to paying to hunt certain animals an update was added. Adding a rotation of animals that players who have not payed for the ""licences"" can hunt. A good start to fixing that problem in my opinion.
Additionally to having to pay for certain animal hunting licences and for ""actual weapons"" If you want to play an online game with just you and your friends private from the public. Guess what, you have to pay... again. 
I know this a free to play game; a genre where Micro-transactions are an everyday occurrence, but this is taking the piss. Let's hope that the new game that's coming out at some point this year addresses some of these problems. Buy either making the game cost something right from the get go or doing micro-transaction for purely cosmetic items, not game changing items and certainly not fucking ""Hunting Licences""

Yes it's pay to play but how do you think the developers pay their staff and all their overheads. I'm also gonna say YES it is bloody expensive and I was very much against this game for that reason. I don't believe in micro transaction in fact I hate them with a passion but that said, If you buy a years sub which is £29.99 you would have all the tools to hunt all species minus the callers which would cost another £20. Yeah it's nearly £50 but this game will last you longer than a year and how many on here pay that for a game that lasts 2-3 weeks and then get ripped into buying DLC's for that game. Once you've shelled out that £50 you can then still hunt for free after that years sub. You keep all that you bought(Guns,Callers,Suits.etc) and then can hunt all the free animals for free. So you pay £50 and then this game will last you forever. I hated this game when I learned it was pay to play and I avoided this game like the plague but once I played this game I was hooked and bought a years sub within 10 mins of playing and since have over 500 hours of play. Yes I have invested more into the game but that was my choice and I didn't have to. I play this game everyday and absolutely love it, you get nothing for free nowdays and to get something out you have to put something in. If you don't like the pay to play model which in fairness grinds my gears, may I recommend The Hunter Call Of The Wild which is out next week 16th Feb. This is gonna be a one off payment($29.99, so maybe £25 UK) but will be backed up with DLC's but saying that, If you see the new hunting reserve in COTW, it would fit the whole of the hunters reserves inside it.

You have to pay for the full privilege of the liscences and other weapons and events though. Which is fair enough imo. It's not free for the developers and they put their own time and money into it. And why shouldn't they make money out of it? It's called capitalism.

Moved to steam short time ago been paying since 2011 and will continue, Yea, it's not 100% free to play but the part that you can play is free...

It's a sim so much of it is the same as real hunting where you have to buy your gun,calls etc.
The game has been going strong for 7 years and dev's are still making new maps and game to hunt along with hunting gear as well.. 

If your mature enough to hunt and don't cry about free to play nibblets give it ago.

Besides it's a great tool for the in-between season cravings lol!!

Probably the most immersive animal hunting game I've ever played, with very satisfying kills (Especially if you worked for that kill for the last half-hour.). But as a reviewer, I have to mention the paying. Pretty much everything in this game requires you to pay. For example, you can't hunt animals without first buying the ""license"" for them with real money. Basically, they give you a taste, then offer you the rest for cash. And while this isn't necessarily an evil thing to do, nor is it unheard of, it would just have been nice to know that before I installed it.

If you don't mind paying a lot of money to actually experience this game fully, then I think you might enjoy it. Unfortunately, I never tried everything, as I wasn't willing to pour that much cash into a game that says ""Free to Play"" on the tin and then doesn't let you actually play.

P.S. I think some people would agree with me on this. If they added a base price to pay to buy the game, then removed (or just reduced) the other hidden costs, then this game would be vastly improved.",1485587693,1485587693,False,0,0,0.490601480007171631,0,True,False,False

I would like to recommend this game but I can't because its pay to progress in most cases, I mean yes of course there are payed things in the game because the dev needs to make money off of the free to play module but the way the dev are using the free to play module, the non paying people are extremely limited. fun game but extremely limited if you don't spend the money.

if you don't spend a dime expect to get the following

able to hunt Whitetail Deer, Pheasant, Cottontail Rabbit, European Rabbit and Snowshoe Hare.
You get a .243 Bolt Action Rifle (Wood) (and 243 carbon if you confirm your email) and a Single Shot Shotgun for free.
You get free ammunition for the two weapons above.
As a guest you are free to explore any reserve you like in single player mode.
You may also join multiplayer games
You can participate in Competitions and complete Missions (missions must be reset with real money after completing them all)


if you don't spend a dime expect to not get the following

As a guest you cannot host multiplayer parties.
Guests cannot take in-game profile shots (avatars). They are limited to the standard avatars.
Guests have a limited trophy shot functionality. They cannot pose the animal's body, and they cannot pose their hunter character along with the animal.

note: if you buy a weapon you'll either have to buy a subscription membership of 3,6 or 12 months or keep buying ammo for the weapons you bought that are not premium. premium ammo for premium weapons you'll need to buy more ammo regardless of your membership status",1485249498,1485336685,False,2,0,0.500476837158203125,0,True,False,False

With The hunter, it is pretty simple. Most of the negative reviews are about the free to play model, this game and dev have been using. I get that. No one should really have the courage to call this game free to play, because, lets face it. What is free, is probably less than 10%. With that being said, you are doing yourself a diservice to rely just on those reviews. In todays world where most of the developers are looking for a quick money, with scaming tehnicques and half made games, I have to commend the devs of The hunter. They held their own and never pretended. The high wall of pay to play in this game was set from the start. This way you realized quite early,wether this game is for you or not. If you ask me, I would prefer this any day, then to see a game I loved and enoyed go down the scam and p2w model under the hands of greedy and uncompetent devs. Everyone has one, there is no need to go personal with the names. With The hunter, there is no pretending. It is what it was. 90% pay tp play. And to be fair, for the game bein about the hunting, it is probably pretty acurate in the fact that, the hunting is a costly sport, hobby , wathever you want to call it. You just cant go out and bag an nimel without some sort of licebse for it. Well The hunter provides that realism ;) When yourealize that, you have an option. Just move along, or try it. Try what it has to offer for free.

If you decided to try, you will find, that while there are heavy limitations about an overall content of the game, what you are given for free is a beauty in itself. You are free to explore beautifull landscapes, listen to the sound of wind in the forest rustling through the trees. Hear the birds, the rivers, oceans. Experience the sun on the misty morning, with a hint of rain. Climb up a hill to discover aincent relics lying about. Hear the animal calling eachother over the peaceful land. When you spot a deer, you are quite able to take one down too, and probably for a moment disrupt all this serenity.

If you decide to play the hunter for free, you must recognize that you must do your best in the limits you have chosen. Once that is clear to you, you will realize the game is still quite enjoyable, if you are wiling to take what its offering to you for free, and make the most of it. I realize however how this is a problem today for probably more than 90% of population, so used on quick gratifications, and getting everything delivered to them right away in full size, not realizing that once they get everything thrown to them they get fed up quicky with it, so they just dump it on move forward. You see, the problem therfore is in your way of viewing the world, your way of percieving, what you want, need , and what is good for you. All the people here, with negative reviews, they would never even been able to play the game like The hunter, because they dont have the patience, the caurage, and the peace in their mind , to even enoy the game. Does this make the developers right for making so much content of this game pay to play? There is no right or wrong. It was their decision, and here it is where it stands. So many players are willing to spend money in games for vanity items, to get new skins for charachters and what not, but they find it hard to spend money to buy themself a new rifle, so they can go hunt the animal they want. Its the same money, just in one case you spend it for something totally usless but in another you spend it on something that will add to your experience.. But if you believe that This ecperience should be granted to you for free, from the start, then you are probably quite young and naive, or havent been living in this world at all. 

The hunter itself is a beautifully made game, and I enjoy it a lot.

There is a way to earn the in game premium money for free, by just playing. While it is pretty hard, I have done it. And that was the whole new level of experience and enjoyment in itself. Just saying.

Neither does the game teach you anything (much) about hunting, tracking, survival skills, skinning, rangefinding, zeroing in the weapon, navigation skills etc., nor does it make good use of it's multiplayer or co-op feature at all. It also doesn't present a realistic scenery or ecosystem.

The most realistic hunting game ever produced? Well, I'm not sure about that one. The tracking feature is a joke, wildlife is non-existant.  Wildlife doesn't interact with each other, there are no mating seasons or dynamics in terms of animal behavior.

Like a pick in minecraft.(example) so spend five bucks to get somthing a little later you will need to again. or the liscenes (sorry for spelling errors) will give you a day a week or so and is VERY pricey for a free to play.

 i am really a sucker for hunting games and survial games (dont starve i am scared of my 700+ hours) but this just has a huge pay wall that unless you like playing this for 3000 hours you are not going to get past.

i say not a good game but the first few hours were fun adn so were the first three deer kills i had. i would say 10 to 20 hours and maybe once in a while game but other then that dont fall into the cash loop, its just not worth it.",1485069319,1485069319,False,2,0,0.488643497228622437,0,True,False,False
