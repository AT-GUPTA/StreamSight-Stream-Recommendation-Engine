I've of two minds on this game. On one hand there is a lot of classes and skills. But on the other hand the best plan for the harder curse levels/overlord is to push as much dps as possible. There is no damage mitigation that can save you. Just keep dodging and pick the best runes/skills to max your dmg potential. The problem is that this tends to funnel you into just a few different meta games and this sadly makes 90% of all those classes and skills feel lack luster. I quickly found my goto skills/runes and just copied those to every class. Your reward is a few more passives shared across all classes and a few situational rune unlocks. In fact unlocking every class fully increases the pool of skills and makes it harder to get the skills you want. This is a problem for many 'survivor-like' games, but it's pretty pronounced here with the shear number.

I feel like there needs to be some (more) tools to limit the skill pool as they continue to add more. Maybe more banishes or a way to filter types/elements?

All in all I feel like this is pretty mid. Not bad enough to downvote so I'll recommend considering it's early access. Will adjust later.",1708938987,1708938987,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

For the first time in ages I've actually turned off videos on my second monitor so I can focus on the game. Bright colours, pretty lights, great music and regular dopamine hits are a great combo.

I can't say too much else about the gameplay yet since I feel like I've barely done anything but I do have one potential criticism that doesn't appeal to me as a new player. 

It feels like this game will be grindy. Please don't make us grind so many different weapon materials. If this were a live service game with a subscription or (god forbid) micro transactions then I'd understand the appeal of a grind to keep players in the game or to avoid buying materials with real money but since it was a one time payment I don't think you need to pad out the playtime like this. A good game doesn't overstay it's welcome.

I have some suggestions on alternative methods that require less grinding.

1. Weapons could be unlocked when you hit prestige milestones, unlocking new playstyles as you play the game. This does have drawbacks such as making you play said class instead of grinding the materials with any class for variety but if you enjoy the class it shouldn't be an issue.

2. Drastically lower the material costs. You get around 250 basic ore from a successful run and it doesn't increase at higher difficulties from what I've seen. The second unlockable weapon on Barbarian will be 6 or 7 cave ruins for the basic ore alone. Even if the material cost was just halved it'd make the grind see less daunting to a new player.

3. Have the weapons be looked behind an achievement. This could encourage exploring higher difficulties or even descending into the void to unlock a new weapon. The obvious drawback is the difficulty but it'll be a reward for getting good at a class. 

Just some thoughts. I love this game so far though

Edit: This game is just fantastic. The classes have good variety and the class specific skill trees are really nice. My biggest gripe is that the challenge increase as you apply more curses is more tedious then fun. The attack spam isn't hard to dodge if your quick but not being able to get close to bosses in melee is making runs really annoying.

I find myself coming back to it but I think that has more to do with my compulsion to check all the boxes and fill all the bars and less to do with whether or not the game is actually enjoyable to play.

+5% bonus to a generic stat is not a fun, interesting, engaging, nor meaningful choice. I thought the games industry figured this out back when it figured out escort missions are objectively bad.

The graphics are barely serviceable. The classes seem like they're different on the surface, but playing any of them for more than 30 minutes reveals they're all the same thing. Even unlocking their 'unique' abilities is a joke because they all boil down to the same mechanic: gather some meta-resource and then get a temporary buff.

There's so much crap on the screen at any one time that an option had to be added to reduce the opacity of the effects on the screen so you can see the telegraphed danger zones on the ground. When you have to add a feature like that into the game, it should clue you in that there's a fundamental flaw with the way you've designed it.

The game mechanics are so shallow that no matter what build you pick you eventually hit a wall where you're just moving around the screen dodging red zones on the ground. Everything else just falls away at that point. I understand this genre is kind of passive compared to other types of games, but this feels extreme.

I think overall i give it a D+ grade, mostly because for all it's attempts to seem rich and engaging, I think my frustration with it comes from the illusion it puts on about being much deeper than it is.

Everything you expect from an action RPG / Vampire Survivors’ clone : unlockable assymetric characters, weapon crafting, skill tree, runes, etc. Comes with a lot of grinding, but since runs are fairly quick (from 20 minutes down to less than 10 the more powerful you get) it doesn’t bother me.
There’s no storyline and no in-game tutorial, so you have to figure out everything for yourself, but there’s not much deepness so it doesn’t get confusing.
Don’t know why this is still in Early Access.
Also, I don’t know if it would please hardcore gamers who can spend 20+ hours a week in it, because there doesen’t seem to have much more to offer than grinding and unlocking stuff, but it’s still fun and satisfying, and you get lots of stuff for the price.",1708117974,1708117974,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

It really pisses me off how Bosses are actually untouchable in this game. For some reason if you approach to boss in melee range he then either will smack ground with AOE which is about 5 meters in length or will dump out ground hazards at your spot and hazards do not disappear while boss is alive. Which leads you as player to run around the map and if that was not enough other bosses have sun beam  that spreads across entire map. One boss casting this sun beam is stationary other one is following you wherever you go. It does not matter if there are obstacles or walls in the map these beams go through. You can't even concentrate on single boss because you have to watch if there are creeps that shoot projectiles at you because that happens all the time, cant even stand still for a second when you already get targeted by something you dont even see on your screen because they shoot projectiles across map. Very fking fun devs.

Now, the enemy types in this game look VERY FAMILIAR like very, as if they are copied from other game, i dunno but i think it might be Dota 2.  This is what i noticed. Scorpion channels ability ""shakes up ground"" that looked very familiar. In dota there is hero called Sand King (scorpion) who has ultimate ability called Epicenter that after 2 second channel damages ground around you.
Next enemy creep - snake that casts poison in straight direction. In dota there is called Venomancer (snake) who has ability called Venomous Gale and also can be cast in straight direction.
Next enemy, this one is boss - I dunno what is this type but to me it looks like steel golem who casts saw in straight direction. In dota there is hero called Timbersaw who has ultimate called Chakram and also does the same thing.
Enemy Boss with sun beam ability. In dota there is hero called Phoenix that has Sun ray and also can cast long beam for a great distance.

Talking about the originality. Bah.

About status effect also sounds very familiar - Hemorrhage that deals X damage over 10 seconds. For every meter that target moves, there is a 40 % chance that the target will take an extra damage. But in dota there is hero called Bloodseeker who has ultimate called Rupture with this effect ""Causes an enemy unit's skin to rupture, dealing massive damage. If the unit moves while under the effect of Rupture, it takes a percentage of the distance traveled as damage. The damage is dealt through magic immunity and is not lethal.""

Game is WAYYY To GRINDY. I was about to craft tier 2 axe for default character, however the requirements are mind blowing - 1.2k Tin when you barely get 2 - 3 tin per node, 60 platinum which can be found in Scorched Valley but the best part is THERE IS NO PLATINUM in that map, i have been playing this map non stop and not a single platinum has been found and you need 60 of those. WHat kinda of BS is this?

They also haven't added a use for legendary materials and I really wish I could trade them for stuff I actually need. Secondly is the skill tree and that it takes to long to complete with small rewards that don't feel as if they contribute much (at least to me) . Once you hit level 20 on any character you unlock their ultimate ability were every so often you can enter this mode. So realistically once you have hit level 70 (for the final weapon) there is no need to play the character, unless you want to grind materials or skill tree points. Another thing is that there is to much grinding, you have to grind curse levels so you can level up your characters quicker and you have to grind the materials for their weapon of that character (which you don't even know what materials you need for the weapon until you can unlock, so now you can't prepare for it) and then the skill tree. The final issue is the music that makes me want to rip my ears of because I've been listen to it for the thousandth time. Please hire a real sound designer.

the first few hours are ok, but pretty soon the game becomes unplayable due to the clutter on the screen, that's when you find the GFX setting that lets you set a transparency value for the effects, eventually it becomes clear that the only valid setting for the transparency slider is 100%... multicast, attack speed and +1 units, etc will make any value over 100% transparency unplayable, eventually the game is about how many +X casts you get, not even about %s anymore, the game quickly degenerates into a game where the damage output doesn't matter (you cant see it anyway) and the input of damage is an insta gib, you just die if you are touched, so all you do is dash around while everything dies, that's it. you can get to that point by the time you uncover 5% of the talent tree and not even one of the extra weapons... they are all pointless, and the talents are all meaningless, it doesn't matter, just put points and don't bother thinking since all that matters is how may hits you get to proc adding debuffs...


i tried really hard to find any semblance of skill based gameplay (50+hours), but there's none here, just stay away from the bad circles, and hopefully everything dies, after the 10hrs mark of /played every map is the same, you NEVER lose due to a bad play of poor choice, you lose just because  a wave of monsters spawned and your 342095 casts deleted it too fast, so you trigger a force spawn of a wave that kills you due to positioning,  you get a bunch of red circles and... woops, you cant dash all the way out of the bad pools of whatever it is, since all the gfx are set to 100% transparency... so i cant even see.

they recently added more meaningless talents, so yay... more clicking. and the grinding is VERY annoying, 99% of the stuff you unlock is actually worse than you you start with and when its better its maybe the second or third upgrade, spending tens of hours to unlock a max upgrade is a waste of time, they are all bad. and i get it, they cant BE better, because the base game already breaks, you don't need more damage, more casts, and say you do get those ""better"" kills or stats... whats the point? you cant even see it.

i tried to push my way trough the grinding, but i cant bring myself to do it, its just too boring, and there's zero skill involved, even the randomness is removed since not getting your dream pick of skills is very rare.


Army of Ruin does the VS clone thing way better, because it shows restraint, yes you can (eventually) make some crazy builds, but it remains grounded and death comes due to poor movement, bad CD management, or just pushing you luck to try to force a specific build with rerolls or banishes. Halls of Torment is even better than VS, and it allows for a lot of build theorycrafting and gathering the items to make the build possible is fun and not too frustrating.",1697990575,1707681819,False,18,2,0.601460278034210205,0,True,False,True

Now comes the bad part.
Although have many class, the spells pool are mostly the same. And most of them are useless. Only 3-4 combos are OP. and for buffs and totems, multicast seems useless after you reach 100% of it, which is quite easy to reach.
The skill tree is big but it's just repetitively giving the same stats, only more expensive.
But that's minor comparing what's I'm about to say,
The game raising difficulty by monsters attack more often and hit harder. As the game goes harder or longer, you only get annoyed instead of joy or satisfaction. To a point you have to keep walking and dodge 100% focus, not the fun kind.

Now some details, for the spells, even you are lucky enough to get your perfect combo and passive, it's still almost impossible to beat the 4th cycle. The boss HP jumps like 8 times each cycle. DPS is not much of a problem if you get the perfect combo. The defense is, boss attack will 1 shot you.

When playing Soulstone Survivors, I feel my mind slowly rotting from over stimulation. With games like Brotato, I actually enjoy walking around killing enemies, upgrading my character, meanwhile with this game, it just feels like mindless sludge.

With Soulstone Survivors, it feels like i'm forced to just surrender my brain into being turned into slush just to unlock new characters in hopes to make the game feel somewhat fresh. It can be really difficult to unlock some characters and weapons since they cost so much, which makes you play more, turning your brain into soup.

This is all just my opinion though and I know that many other people love this game and that is fine. It's just not for me.

I've become a big bullet hell player over the last year. Vampire Survivors hooked me on Game Pass. Then, I picked up Halls of Torment here on Steam. I played both games to 100% completion (until new achievements were added).

Soulstone Survivors does not capture the fun those two did. It's alright, as I unlocked each map tier and maxed one toon. However, I can't see myself pushing through with everything else. The grind is less rewarding, mainly because everything is too similar. Other reviews of ""avoid the red"" are 100% accurate, and it can be very annoying because there is so much happening on screen that you do not see the red.

Most of my games devolved into me running in an orbit around where I thought the big baddies were and simply watching their health bar drop.

I don't wish to be too harsh. It is still in development and has some fun for the price. If you compare this to one of the other big hits, I would seek another option until they zero in on the gameplay a bit more.",1706741195,1706741278,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I believe the devs were already working on game called Rogue Soulstone and pivoted with the rise of this sub-genre and it took off to the point where they suspended development on the original game to focus on this.

I didn't pick it up until 2023's bullet-heaven fest and even though it's above the general price of games in this genre I think the content that's here is definitely worth the asking price and it goes on sale pretty frequently.

[b][h2]Gameplay[/h2][/b]You start the game with 1 character unlocked but there are currently 14 available in the game with more to come. You select 1 of 5 maps, the only real difference is the placement of obstacles, the majority of the damage I took while playing was down to getting stuck on these. As you play you will unlock higher difficulty modifiers for each map which reward you with extra soulstones and resources.

The enemies here are not your typical ""walk into you to damage"" as with a lot of other bullet-heavens, all enemies have their own attack patterns. After you defeat a certain number of enemies Lords (Bosses) will spawn, the faster you defeat enemies the lower health the Lords will have. There are only 7 Lords in the game and they can all spawn on any map, I kinda wish each map had their own map-specific bosses with different type weaknesses as that would give more reason to play different maps other than materials.

You have 6 slots to take skills, and there are a lot of skills in the game. One thing I love is that you continue to get offered new skills when you are capped, allowing you to keep switching them out until you finish your build. The only real issue I have with the skills is that everything else feels weak in comparison to the electric ones, to the point where there isn't much reason to experiment, since Lords have more health the longer it takes you to kill the enemies, you want to take stronger skills or you are always fighting an uphill battle.

I really love the use of endless mode in this game, I don't usually as I feel they are kind of pointless, but here you are given the option of boss rush and regular endless. Both of these allow you to farm different materials and are vital in upgrading your skill tree and weapons.

There are 3 types of meta-progression in the game, weapon upgrades, runes and the skill tree. Weapon upgrades are my least favourite as they simple add some positive and negative stats and give you different starting skills that you inevitably replace anyway. Runes are unlockable bonuses and you can have up to 7 equipped. The skill tree is absolutely huge, this allows you to unlock an active ability for every character as well as a tonne of stats, some of these abilities are weaker than others though and I would love to see them buffed.

Regardless of all these positives, there is one big issue that I and a lot of others have had and this progress loss, a game or PC crash will completely wipe the soulstones you have collected in a session as they only upload to steam cloud upon game close, this basically meant I had to restart after every run to ensure I wouldn't lose anything. A simple fix in my opinion would be some form of profile system that automatically saves while playing.

[b][h2]Achievements (256/256)[/h2][/b]The achievements are really easy, if you're good enough it's practically just playing 1-3 matches with each character and upgrading all of their unlockable weapons as well as a few other ""beat x on y difficulty"" which are trivial if you put a lot of upgrades into one character.

[b][h2]Music/sound[/h2][/b]I think some of the songs in this game are an absolute jam.

[b][h2]Settings/Accessibility/Misc[/h2][/b]There are a tonne of visual settings but I will consolodate my favourites. You can view damaging effects on healthbars, customise crosshair and reduce opacity of skill effects (you cannot see the screen in a long game) so extremely welcome. Completely customisable key binds, mouse control and controller support. A bunch of languages are supported.

[b][h2]TL;DR[/h2][/b]One of the most polished bullet-heavens, with frequent updates and a responsive dev team. Unique gameplay with a fun and useful endless mode. A huge skill tree adding a tonne of replayability. A lot of achievements tied to unlocks but are fairly easy to work through.

Most of the issues I brought up in my review have been or will be fixed. I also highly appreciate the very transparent and humble dev talks. As I see things now, the game is a 8.5/10 maybe even more and it is only getting better. Big ups from me!

So where do I begin, guess I will start with the TL;DR : I wish Steam had a scoring system, this game IMO as of right now is about a 5.5 maybe 6/10 at most, but, even thou you probably have heard this a million times, I actually mean it, it has THE MOST potential out of any survivors like in the genre as it combines elements of ARPGs like Diablo and whatnot with the Survivors elements and they fit VERY well. BUT in the mean time, this game has A LOOOOOOT of problems that hold it back hard.

So lets start with the review:

The Good:
- A lot of characters with a lot of cool abilities.
- Each character has a multitude of weapons that once unlocked give abilities and power ups for the characters, making the sense of PERMANENT progression feel good.
- The Rune system is great even thou it has some issues.
- The skilltree is a bit lackluster but very good idea nonetheless.
- Game looks and feels amazing (when it works).
- The music is great.
- Each character also has 3-4 abilities which you keep unlocking as you level them up, also these abilities are globally unlocked for all the other characters.

The Meh:
- A lot of abilities are copy pasted with just different aliments to them ( for ex. Chaos Bolt, Lighting Bolt, whatever bolt, all look and do the same thing with a bit of a color variation and aliment they inflict). Not a huge problem as the game does have plenty of unique abilities but even so, thought it is worth mentioning.
- Many abilities have the same effects which in certain cases reduces their uniqueness (but not always).
- Most of the ingame level upgrades are pretty much just number increases, nothing very interesting, there are a few more unique upgrades but even those are VERY meh. Not a huge negative as this game has a huge amount of abilities to choose from, so its more of a different mentality compared to other survivor like games but it would be nice to see some cool upgrades that do more than increase this or that.
- Has plenty of maps but as of right now, the way the game works, none really bring anything besides different materials to farm (which as of right now are mostly useless and made for future content). As for the bosses or mobs, all are the same from what I could tell. Still, a nice addition to at least freshen up the playthroughs I guess.

The Bad: (Honestly it has so many issues I will probably miss a lot of them so keep that in mind):
- The balancing is utter garbage 
- Some characters are so clearly better than others its not even funny, for example you have a class like the Assassin which I LOVE in concept but it is absolute trash in high difficulties (ill get to that later) and than you have something like the Chaos Sorcerer class which completely trivializes the game with zero effort.
- Performance even thou its better now, it is still terrible ( and NO I do NOT care you can make your abilities invisible, that is unacceptable and why the fuck would I play it if I cannot even see my cool stuff).
- The way this game scales difficulty with curses is hands down, and I swear I am not exagerating, the WORST I have seen by a mile in any survivor like game. I cannot understand how or who thought it would be a good idea to make difficulty literally mean completely cluttering your screen with non stop area abilities, breaking performance, having a insane amount of enemies swarm you, multiply bosses numbers ( yes you heard that right, even one boss clutters the shit out of the screen, imagine 3-4-5 AT ONCE and they never despawn, so if you do not kill them fast enough, haha, tough luck, the next batch spawns with them, at some point your screen will literally be only bosses and you moving with 1 fps no matter your hardware ), the towers shooting shit are a incredibly dumb idea since this game already has a massive clutter issue so they should be removed asap its a fucking nobrainer, at some point in difficulty you start having a invincible dude following you and pretty much destroying you if he touches you (so imagine the delight when you cant see shit on screen and have 10 fps how fun it is to run from him) and there is much much more but I think you got the idea.
- The variety of builds quickly becomes a novel concept as you start to realise the only viable way to go is pretty much to pick as many aliments as possible in your build as the mobs scale way harder than you in the later part of the run and only aliments scale enough to kill them. So basically with a VERY few exceptions, you will end up with the same build all the time making choices of skills and upgrades pretty irrelevant in high difficulties.
- Some skills are cool in concept but just dont work (like the new random portal, makes you feel like you are using flicker strike from POE, all cool, but also pretty much kills you without fail all the time eventually as it will tp you inside the area of bosses) and some skills simply get so laughably outclassed by others it just makes no sense to get them (for example, anything that DOES NOT scale with aliments, so just pure damage or scaling with armor, hp and whatnot are utterly useless as they will NEVER scale enough to do damage in the late game so they are rendered virtually unusable) and some skills just do not work as in high curse endgame you have to nonstop dash and stay at a distance or ur fucked, so anything close range is pretty much gonna kill you, so again, useless.
- A lot of runes do nothing and will never be used, even thou as I said, it is a cool concept.

Conclusion: As you can probably see I have written a lot more in the negative part, but make no mistake, I do like this game and want it to get better, but there are just so many issues right now that I had do mention at least a few of them. I feel like the developer has in his head a lot of cool concepts and ideas but they just cannot seem to put them in practice at all and I am a bit irritated that instead of fixing the vast amount of severe problems the game has, they keep adding new content that is mostly rendered USELESS as well because of the issues.
I am very lenient on indie games and this is a early project so I will give it the benefit of the doubt and I still think there are enough hours to get in the game to make your money worth (thou that is mostly because of how survivor games work not necessarily the game itself) and for that reason I will give it a positive review, BUT when the game releases, and if it still has these problems, I shall change and update it accordingly.

Thanks.

This game is a lot of fun and I like the depth of systems, builds, and characters available to play. Right now there are quite a few characters in the game already, and I've enjoyed most of the ones I've tried. You can get some pretty cool builds going with stacking damage over time effects, cleaving the hell out of everything, or even running around with a zoo following you. Some of these are stronger than others, but who cares as long as each of them is fun.

There are 5 stages with stacking difficulty levels allowing you to get materials to craft yourself weapons for each of your characters, giving them a few abilities as well. Once each of these abilities are unlocked you can also use them on other characters if you want to do some goofy stuff. I also really enjoy the built in mechanics for most of the characters but some are much clunkier than others. 

The Barbarian for instance simply kills a set amount of enemies and he gets Bloodlusted, increasing his movespeed, armor, and damage by a percent of each of these. The Beastmaster however, can follow a trail of tracks on the ground to potentially summon a pack of raptors to fight for a moment or so. The problem with this though, is at any given time the ground is covered in about a million red indicators that you probably shouldn't walk over unless you want to end your run prematurely. Because of this, it's very easy to get baited into following the tracks as the Beastmaster and end up dying for it, which brings me to my next point...

Visual clarity. You have the option to turn down the opacity on all of your animations on the fly with a hotkey. This is such a good quality of life option. This isn't where my issue lies though. The problem isn't so much SEEING the bad on the ground, it's simply that at a certain point there is so MUCH bad on the ground that you can't actually play the game and spend your time constantly dodging. This isn't that big of a deal against trash mob enemies, but when there are multiple bosses (3 or 4), or even a couple of elites you can't even really get close to them to begin to even damage them because the amount of clutter on the ground simply will not allow you to because as one of the big red circles is disappearing, 2 more are spawning in it's place. 

My suggestion for this, if anyone who works on the game ever happens to read this, is to simply stop allowing as many normal/elite enemies to spawn during boss rounds, or slow down the interval at which they spawn during bosses. This is what Death Must Die does and it makes boss fights feel much more fair. It also doesn't help that as you're fighting bosses (that you can't get next to because of all the bad) you're inadvertently killing more trash, thus spawning EVEN MORE BOSSES, to where you can potentially end up with like 5, 6, 7, or 8 of them on your screen. 

Please for the love of god stop counting the enemies killed accumulation difficulties with 3 or more bosses. This isn't making the game more difficult so much as it's making the game into a slog, and a chore to even get through when you're a few stages into an endless run. The bosses are ALREADY ramping up health, damage, movespeed, AND attack speed (including channeling their abilities within their indicators to the point that you have to react to them very quickly) to the point that they're difficult on their own without 500 smaller enemies cluttering the field.

That rant aside though, the game does have a really good progression tree and a Rune system that's well thought out. The unlock progression for characters does feel good and each of the characters having a cosmetic option (though I'd like to see more) is cool. 

Overall I do enjoy the depth that this game offers and runs are in general pretty fun. Each of the characters brings enough diversity that you can theory craft a lot of different builds and feel rewarded for it.

It will give you something (or lots of things) to grind for and will probably keep you engaged for a while. It has great performance and is fairly priced. I believe their are a few things that could be improved upon such as the ""endless"" mode, but these things are more my personal preference and i would still highly recommend this game.

 Pros:
1. Great graphics
2. great performance (im on a 3060 with 16 gb ram) i haven't had a crash yet
3. awesome skills that have cool synergies
4. an expansive skill tree to unlock perma buffs
5. characters have unique skills they can unlock later on that offer a new way to play that character (such as an enraged mechanic or the ability to summon trebuchets)
6. a fun and engaging grind (this could be considered a con i suppose but as someone who enjoys fun achievement/ level grinds, this game offers both)
7. lots of debuffs and dots that can be inflicted on every enemy (including bosses)
8. a good but small soundtrack
9. you can increase/ decrease the visibility of your skills with the d-pad on controller
10. a small and seemingly committed dev team to support

Cons:
1. Their are only 5 maps to play on (as of now)
2. The game lacks a true endless mode like vampire survivors (their is an endless mode that scales the enemies dramatically. so while you spend the first 10-15 minutes getting op, you really only get another 15-20 minutes of enjoying your op-ness until your going to get one shot or the bosses become too tanky to justify continuing.)
3. you only get a handfull of banishes while the skills in the skill pool are continually increasing. 
4. armor power and block power seem pretty weak due to the scaling. (ive tested armor/block power quite a bit and I have better matches when i just focus on my offensive skills and increasing my health here and there.)

The controls, mechanics, animations, and sound are extremely well polished now as of 2024. Game plays very smooth for the most part. Depending on your skill choices, the enemies on screen, and your graphics setting, you might hit some frame drops when it gets really crazy. I haven't had any crashes or severe performance issues since the initial months of release. 

Also as of 2024, this game is now arguably the most in-depth survivor game on the market. The only real competitor to this is the actual original Vampire Survivors. Soulstone has a good roster of characters each with their own different weapon choices(that must be crafted with special materials). There is also a large collection of skills that only some classes have access to unless you use a special rune to unlock all of them. Which brings me to the runes. While they are a little bit lacking in my opinion, the rune system does add an extra layer of depth to the game play. You can load a set of runes that change how your character performs or how skills are distributed during the match. The most recent addition was the overhaul to the class skill trees. While the skill tree doesn't provide game breaking talents or anything, it is yet again another extra layer of depth. You have to really work to get through all of the skill trees to unlock the special alternate outfit for each class as well. All of this provides you with incentives to grind the endgame so that each match has a sense of purpose. 

The core of this game is now set after the much more rustic early access version.

So what are the cons?

- Red circles galore. Enemies and towers will constantly launch aerial projectiles at you which are indicated by a red circle on the ground. On the higher difficulties, you pretty much spend 99% of the time dodging red circles unless you're just wiping out the entire screen before anything can attack. This makes boss fights extremely frustrating especially if your playing with the curses that summon multiple bosses at a time. Melee classes need to invest heavily into movement speed and adding area to their attacks to extend it's reach or you will never be able to get close enough and stay in range long enough to make a dent on the boss. So yes, I spend the majority of the time just circling a boss(or bosses) dodging red circles and just praying my damage will eventually wear them down. The developers have acknowledged that this is among their top player complaints that they would like to change so there is reason to be optimistic for a change. 

- Environmental collision. This one irks me a lot because it is somehow responsible for more than half of my deaths. The dash in this game is very good...almost too good that if you accidentally dash into a wall, tree, or even worse...some kind of enclosed corner, it takes a while to recover from this. You will essentially be vulnerable during this time. Remember the red circles? If you collide with the environment during a dash while red circles are chasing you, it's almost certain death depending on the level of difficulty you're on. At the very least, we should be able to dash through trees (the worse offenders). This of course can all be avoided by simply getting good and just having absolute awareness of your surroundings. It's just that sometimes in the middle of all the chaos on screen, you will accidentally dash into a tree and that could be your death.

- Defensive traits. While the offensive stats and traits are excellent in this game, I feel that the defensive side is sorely lacking. You can invest heavily into armor, blocking, and HP but you will still very likely get 1-2 shotted against bosses and elite champions beyond the first level (if you are climbing infinite portals). There are a couple of niche defensive skills like the fire shield that seems pretty worthless unless you devote a dozen level up upgrades to it during the course of a run and even then, it's still lackluster.

Recommended? Yes. This is now a well polished product with tons of content and depth to unlock/explore. Only when you start to really dig into the endgame will you find some annoying flaws.",1699715987,1706380934,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

*Where as Vampire Survivors makes you look forward to each increase in power you can buy with gold and you feel yourself getting stronger over time, this game instead will barely make you notice them and have you start off the game so powerful that the tiny increases you grind HOURS for feel worthless. 

*Death Must Die makes each run exciting with its powerful items that can drop and random shrines you can find, where as this game will make you dread pressing the ""play"" button because each run is exactly the same.

*Unlike this game, Halls of Torment makes its grindyness feel worth it by making achievements actually require different builds and strategy that vary in difficulty, which I look forward to with each update they release that brings a new challenge. 

*HoloCure has a similar large roster of characters, but their characters actually changes how you play each game slightly. This game will have you ignore most characters specialities, because they often require you to stand idle or make bad movements, which is an awful design in a game where the ground is littered in red circles that will 2-3 shot you and go off nearly instantly in late game, even if you go full defensive cards. The biggest change you will notice is by playing the death knight, which removes your dash, making the end game strategy of spamming dashes impossible.

Please just play any of the above instead, or try some of the following: Keeper's Toll, 20 Minutes Till Dawn, hell even low quality coomer games such as Beautiful Mystic Survivors, Kagura Survivors: Endless Night or Wedding Witch is a better experience than this game.

The game bascially REQUIRES you to disable all your spell animations because it is so awfully designed that they end up filling your entire screen, making it impossible to see anything that's happening and will strain your eyes incredibly with prolonged sessions.

The game has hundreds of interruptions because you reach levels in the 100's each run and each time you level up, your choices boils down to ""pick highest rarity card"" which gives a boring stat increase, unless its one of the few impactful cards such as +dashes and movement speed. Theres a reason other games autopick this stuff for you once you have established your build...

There was 0 challenge in my entire 95 hours playing this. Or let me rephrase that: the only challenge this game offers is trying not to get 1-4 shotted while you get distracted by the content on your second monitor, as you try to kill the boredom of playing this game.

I have only played it this many hours cause i'm dumb enough to care about steam achievements and I tend to 100% a game before I review it, which means I will have to do their future ""content"" if you can call it that, which I have very little hope for with how bad this game is in its fundamental design.

Only buy this if you don't plan on 100% it and you are already done with all the other games I suggested.",1706290537,1706291163,False,149,8,0.680869460105895996,12,True,False,True

A great fantasy roguelite with a vast array of characters, skills, and spells to learn and try with each of your runs. Master your build and cheese every level to grind out resources as you slay your enemies over, and over, and over again. This game, though cartoony, looks great. The soundtrack is incredible, and the game-play itself is tight and easy to learn and master using a x-box controller. Soulstone Survivors has a unique way of hooking you in almost instantly. I was certainly no exception to this, and twenty-seven hours were gone in a flash. In those twenty-seven hours, I had an absolute blast, but just as quickly as I was hooked, I found myself burnt out and ready to move on. Regardless, for an early access title, the time spent was absolutely well worth it.

How ever, I couldn't help but feel that there were a few things lacking. The game, like most roguelites, is highly repetitive and becomes more and more grindy the closer to end-game you get. That's to be expected, but a little more variety wouldn't go amiss. The Curses feature adds an extra challenge to your run, but you'll find yourself fighting the same mobs and bosses, listening to the same soundtrack, running the same build, while moving in the same circular pattern, all for that next upgrade. I deeply enjoyed experimenting with the various classes you could unlock with new builds here and there, but I had wished that there were more than a small handful of boss fights to learn. Additionally, this game would benefit greatly with a co-op feature. I would have loved to play this game with a friend.

Do take the above paragraph with a grain of salt. This game is in early access, and thus, not yet complete. On a positive note, the developers and community managers are active in engaging with the player base. They have released roadmaps and the game has received updates since its released, with more still to come. With that said, Soulstone Survivors has had a great start, and the potential to be something great when given enough time in the oven to cook.

The endgame is just not very fun.  It's very repetitive.

Every run with every character feels pretty much the same.  I could go for a bleed build or a poison build or a summoning build or an all fire build.  They all feel pretty much the same in the end.  I am picking the same generic passives on level up for every build.  The ones that are good are good for every build; and the ones that are bad are bad for every build.

What makes matters worse is that I can't even see what I'm doing.  I have to turn off my ability graphics so I can see the 1000 enemy AOE attacks that are being fired at me every moment.  I could be shooting fire or swinging an axe or spitting poison - I can't actually see it and they all do the same thing after a while anyways.

I don't see this changing any time soon, either.  It seems like most new content is just adding new weapons for the classes.  This lets classes branch out into other builds, but since all builds feel the same anyways, it doesn't really matter much.  It just changes which active skills you plan to take before ending up in the exact same gameplay.

What I liked :
- the ability to go on with all your progress for another run (or more if you choose to) at the end. This is really fun, being able to get even stronger and get a spell to max aoe to hit almost all the map with it at the same moment.
- skill tree. Nothing more to say, I just like big skill trees and completing them.
- weapons crafting and runes

What could use a rework :
- you can basically put your brain on pause while playing. You just need to run in circles while aiming with your mouse, and that's it. It would be more intersting if there were less spells and really unique ones, and if they were not cast automatically.
- too many upgrades for the same purpose. You can upgrade cast speed and mutli-cast, damage in general and damage for each spell, aoe in general and aoe for each spell... 
- you can be fast, strong, resistant, apply several effects and get high hp at the same time. Nothing really pushes you to choose one type of upgrade or another.
- aside from spells, heroes are not really unique. You get to unlock a special ability for each hero in the skill tree but it's just another way to deal more damage. The way you use spells even turns barbarian, swordmen, etc into ranged fighters. Which makes being high hp and stacking armor points kind of useless. 
- same problem with maps, they only bring different materials to farm, but enemies are basically the same, they just have a different skin. Bosses are the same too.

I still recommend it for those who have some time to kill, one run lasts less than 15 minutes, just don't expect strategy and having to optimise your build. It's a good one overall.
I hope they will try to make character building system trickier and add more ""non-damage upgrade"" ways to get stronger.",1705414161,1705414161,True,2,0,0.5,0,True,False,True

4/10
I have about 170 hours on steam deck, which somehow didn't sync with my desktop steam. I played that much because it kept me distracted on the steam deck while on the move. I didn't feel like anything with a story at the time just mindless distraction. For this reason it's good.
It was okay at the start but the end game is an AOE dodge simulator. Every game is basically dodging AOEs and the builds don't vary much.

I'm gonna start off with the good stuff though.
The music works pretty well for the most part, being pretty catchy and fitting the gameplay very well.
Another thing is the characters that you can play as, being pretty well designed and creative, with a lot of awesome skills, weapons, and trees.
However, while there is a lot of creativity in the characters, it is very obvious that the focus was put on to them and practically nothing else.
The levels have no uniqueness to them other than how they look and some of their wall placements, so there is no reason to pick one over another. You would think that the reason to do so would be the enemies, but the enemies for each area are barely unique at all as the reasons for why they are unique(if there is any, I'm just assuming they have some differences but I genuinely can't tell) make the smallest of differences. And whats even worse is that unlike most games, there aren't any unique bosses to each area, and it is the same 7 cycled through randomly, which removes even more reason for you to have preferences of map. Having some sort of creativity in the boss design and enemy design would go a long way in fleshing out this game.
While I do have problems with these, they alone wouldn't ruin the experience in any way, I mean my review is recommending the game. There is enough variety with what character you play and what weapon and runes you pick. It would just be nice if they were improved to make the game that much better.
The biggest problem lies with the difficulty curve. The game starts off pretty fine and does a good job of laying out the mechanics to newer players well without making it feel overwhelming, and for a while the curses do a good job of making the game more difficult in interesting ways. However, once you get to Curse Level IV, you realize that the developers stopped figuring out creative ways of adding difficulty and just started throwing more stuff on the screen for the sake of it. You notice it at IV, but its not too bad because the concept of 3 bosses is still sort of interesting. But Level V and Level VI don't have anything interesting going on and it makes me wonder why they even bothered with going past IV.

Final Conclusion:
The game is pretty solid with a lot of fun, but the longer you play the game the more you notice it's problems, and I feel that instead of adding more classes, skins, and weapons, they should focus on trying to add more uniqueness to the enemies, bosses, levels, and curses.

However the grind is insufferable in this game, and I am saying this as someone that genuinely likes to grind in games.

To give a better look into what I mean; This game has a lot of different characters, which is genuinely nice as they do feel like they play different due to their abilities and starter attacks. This on itself, mixed with the 'rune' system is genuinely a lot of fun! The problem comes in when you realize EVERY CHARACTER NEEDS TO BE LEVELED SEPARATELY, AND EVERY CHARACTER HAS A DIFFERENT SKILL TREE YOU HAVE TO BUY SKILLS FOR!
At first I really liked the idea, but quickly it just dawned on me how every separate grind just felt horrid and unfun. New character? XP/Money/Resources won't be gained quick enough. Focusing on a single of the 3 requirements? Feels like wasting time due to dividing the work. Grinding Money/Resources with a leveled and strong character? MASSIVE waste for the XP that goes absolutely nowhere.

I really hope to see some massive re-balance before the full release of this game, as this is just an absolute joke... Allowing for more cross-progression between classes, and evening out the xp/money/resource gain would go a long way, or maybe just a bigger damage/survivability increase for lower level classes to not have the game feel like it kicks you in the nuts every time you play a unleveled/low level class would be HUGE.

There's a good many characters, each with different play styles from bow archer to heavy armor and healing paladins to minion spawning necromancers and elemental mages. Each character can level up with gameplay and forge 3 additional weapons with different abilities and play styles for that character. Think your fire casting mage now does aoe damage around them, for example. 

There is also a ""runes"" (character enhancement) system that allows collecting materials in games (smashing rocks of minerals, primarily) which are spent out of game to enhance individual character stats or global stats for all characters. Each character has 20+ enhancements to unlock after unlocking all global ones first and some of them heavily change the way you play by fleshing out that class better. 

BUT - the game has really slow progression early on and a few of the materials you need to craft better weapons are way less abundant than they should be. It often takes several runs on a specific map to collect enough of a resource and you will likely have to target maps for a couple runs to have enough for a new weapon (of the 3 craftable per character, so often enough it becomes a chore).

It’s so satisfying once it gets going. The first exposure to the game is a bit overwhelming with all the different screens (characters, crafting, runes, skill trees, etc). The first game is slow as you bonk each creature with your weapon. However once you get going and start being able to unlock part of the skill tree and more characters, progress through the maps, and add more curses to raise the difficulty - it’s a blast to play. The gameplay loop is satisfying. Being able to see how far I can progress, earn resources, and then being able to invest those into making my characters stronger or reaching milestones to unlock more things is something that I enjoy doing. Each run has felt substantial.

Once you clear a map you can increase the difficulty by enabling curses. Each level of the map provides more curses and more bonuses. When you clear a map of it’s Lords you can keep going “deeper”, making it harder, requiring more Lords to kill. So far I’ve been able to get to 25 Lords, where 5 will spawn at a time. It gets so intense when there number of creatures have already been killed that new Lords are spawning as soon as the existing ones were killed. I love it!

One important tip, once you start getting to the point of multiple Lords you will want to go into the graphics setting to make your attacks more transparent so you can see where the enemy attacks are going to land. Otherwise it’s going to get difficult to see everything.

Much like the other games, you have multiple characters to choose from such as a barbarian (starting character), Pyromancer, Legionnaire, Chaoswalker, Assassin, and Beast Master to name a few. Each class comes with a different set of abilities that are available to them at the start.

There are a total of five stages that you can choose from. You pick a stage to start with and once you clear the that stage by slaying all the Lords (bosses), you are able to advance to another round. You can choose from two different modes by beating the first stage; Overlord (red portal) and what I call the Infinite mode (purple portal). The Overlord portal increases the number of bosses to correspond with the level of the dungeon you are on. Example: Stage 2 yields two bosses per spawn, stage 3 spawns 3 bosses at a time and so on. Upon every completion of the first stage you unlock curses which add new features to the dungeon.

You are also able to craft gear (only weapons) with the materials that drop from the stages via the ores that randomly spawn on the stage. Each weapon comes with a different starting skill and all, but the starting weapon, has a special skill that can also be unlocked.

You have skill points that can be used to increase stats and gain extra abilities and buffs. You also get to use the Rune system and skill system that gives you, yet, more buffs and features that you can mix and match with the class you choose to fight with.

There are a few cons, the biggest one (in my opinion) is the amount of visual clutter from all the abilities. There's also the fact of the five stages get stale as you get into longer and longer times of surviving. The materials that you can get per map seem minuscule as you get into the 3rd and 4th weapons of each character. You spend more time running around the map, killing the little mobs and slowly whittling the bosses down to stay on the stage to gather materials. You can also get stuck on environmental assets like the trees and stones. Just watch where you are running and dashing to!

Overall I would give this game an A+. With only 21 hours at the time of this writing, I can say I still get excited to open the game, pick a character to level and have at it!

However, some criticisms are valid. At high overlord levels you really only use dots and run around avoiding poison/frost and that damn super laser beam. 

I ended up using just a few builds in the end as I really just wanted points to fill out each character and get the ""buy all skill tree nodes."" and the only way to do that is grind points by pushing overlord levels. I could get to OL 5 with all classes but really only a few build variations. 

I would recommend making some of the class mechanics more useful. I pushed OL5 on the legionnaire but didn't use the catapults at all. How about buff the catapults like a summon so it can lay down dots otherwise they really are not worth the effort. 

I would agree with the need for more viable end game build types, but looking at what others did on Youtube or Reddit some things work much better than I would have expected and it is fun to experiment. An option to create a test build and use a dummy room to gauge dps, dots, etc would be nice.

This is largely due to the heavy use of telegraphed enemy attacks that do high damage, especially from elite enemies and bosses. Unlike Vampire Survivors or Army of Ruin, it isn't really possible to stand still and simply annihilate everything before it gets to you, at least not that I've seen. Movement speed and deft use of dodge charges are required to stay alive in SS, though some characters can tank damage a little better then others- The Paladin and the Legionnaire are two examples. There can get to be a crazy amount of enemy telegraphs on screen, especially when playing on increased difficulties.

SS has a large amount of playable characters (14 so far, with apparently more to come) and build options, including more different damage types and debuffs then I think I've seen in any game, and a large circular skill tree that greatly expands once you've purchases all of the initial center nodes and reach level 20 with characters. Characters also have individual experience levels that unlock new starting weapons and additional active skills. Characters are limited to specific types of skills they can use initially, and some characters have pretty big boosts or penalties to certain stats- the oddest one by far is the Death Knight, who starts with a huge movement speed bonus and immunity to stuns, but cannot dodge, totally changing how he is played compared to the rest of the cast.

On top of that, there is a system of perks, called ""runes"" here, that you can use to further boost or specialize your setup, though you must first unlock ""runic power"" to be able to use them. 5 Runic Power points are obtained from the skill tree, while the other 5 are tied to achievements, for 10 total. Among other things, you can increase your dash distance or chance to multi-cast (i.e., have a skill fire more once per activiation) or add up to 5 skills from a given type your character would not normally have show up in their upgrade pool.

SS stands out in a genre that quickly exploded in popularity after the success of Vampire Survivors. I've played a number of these games at this point, including the mobile game Magic Survival that inspired them, and I would put this one on par with my other favorites, namely Army of Ruin and Star Survivor.

While the first 10-25 hours of this game is fun; once you progress far enough you realize the danger of the enemies is primarily area effect damage. The game clearly shows these areas in red circles and your main survival tactic is avoiding these red circles.

The problem however; the bosses spawn these so fast and in such an extreme amount that the only viable build on the highest levels is indirect damage builds. The bosses don't move fast, creating a dead zone around is. So usually you want animals, critters, minions, pets or other such effects work for you. Those builds are fun; and actually extremely powerfull to grind at the hardest difficulties.

But there it ends; any short-range build is simply not viable at the harder difficulties. I tried maxing damage output to kill bosses as fast as possible, but those builds are just too vulnerable and the area-damage spam of bosses and the many enemies become impossible to avoid once 5 bosses spawn at once. You must always run and avoid the killzone.

The viability difference between the various builds is just too large; making it feel pointless to try and experiment with other builds. A couple of spells work; the majority doesn't at the highest difficulties.",1704571963,1704571963,False,8,1,0.573028802871704102,0,True,False,True

nice graphics and music
masses to unlock but locked behind a slow grind

Cons: 
mind numbing game-play and far too easy - as long as you keep moving and avoid the red zone you will not be hit

acquiring skills is confusing and could be a lot clearer

Overall:
A fairly pointless game and the likes of Vampire Survivors are MUCH better - save your money.  If the devs were trying to copy that game I think that they missed what was good and compelling about it.

At first I was a little put off by the difference in graphics, after all that pixel graphics formula is just what the doctor ordered in VS.

Now I like both for what they are, this game's graphics work great [i]here[/i], and I hugely enjoy the pixel graphics in VS when I'm spending time [i]there[/i].

There is a learning curve, I wouldn't say very steep, but if you don't come to it after playing a bunch of other VS games, you may be somewhat confused. Even I was a bit unclear on how to progress at times. Hopefully the dev team adds in a mini tutorial for some of the basics. Right now, it is an EA title, and I'm expecting a lot more to come.

I didn't expect to be mentioning the dev team here, but it's definitely an added bonus to see the team and see how enthusiastic they are about making this game.

The game has some build diversity, but because of poor optimization you do have to turn the settings down to minimum, so visually, it looks like you are playing the same build. 

There are also some balancing issues. There are alot of status effects, but many are undertuned.

Also, this is saying alot, but it has visual clutter worse than path of exile. You can't see a thing unless you turn down visibility to bare minimum, which takes away the enjoyment of the game.

Lastly, the game offscreens you alot. This is the thing that takes me out of the game completely.

Likes - How i could just get the action i wanted from the get-go and also receive game changing power-ups.  How there is a Hero tree that allows you to strengthen your hero for the next fight so you don't always feel like you are starting from square 1, allowing you to achieve higher feats as well. How there are so many heroes to play and so many playstyles even in this games early stage. How you could ADJUST the effects on your screen with a slider in the settings or keys on your keyboard to increase or decrease the visibility of it (I think that's a huge quality of life option which should exist in every game). How every hero has a build behind them, in-game power-ups alone are not enough to make you unstoppable, it requires some theorycrafting (Weapons, runes, character tree) to make yourself almost Godly, so every character can be overpowered in their own way. NOT PAY TO WIN. 

Dislikes - How you cannot see what materials you need to gather prior to unlocking a new weapon to craft (I know it's a game intention but i kinda don't like that the more i play the game xD).  Not too many maps but i know more will be coming soon. There are only 2 gamemodes on top of starting a fresh fight, but of course, as was mentioned in a video a developer made, there will be more gamemodes to come. Game doesn't reward with anything other than currency and materials, i honestly would love it if items dropped, even if they were rare.  Character visual customisation would need more attention, because there is only a default skin and an armoured skin for every character, not talking about the weapons cuz that's the only thing that we have for decent customisation.

Mention -  I don't know if the game is supposed to be solo only, but i just feel the need to have some sort of playerbase presence like leaderboards or maybe co-op gameplay of hard stages or something, but i guess it's fine the way it is.

Conclusion: Absolutely recommend this to y'all magic freaks out there, because it's got LOADS of visuals and cool eye candy. Power-ups that give you a slight dopamine rush everytime you see them. It's still in its' early stage but still has a lot of gameplay mechanics to pick from that just keeps dragging you in for more and more rounds, in other words, addicting. Despite all of what i said in my Dislikes, it's totally playable and they nailed the genre, probably the best of its' kind out there.

Soulstone Survivors is geniunely one of the better vampire survivor esque titles, it has decent artstyle, crafting system sounds cool on paper as does the skill tree. However, the execution of some things is geniunely bad.
- There's always a point where game becomes unplayable due to amount of particles and effects on the screen, this grinds the fps to a halt even on lowest settings possible (my specs before someone calls out Potato PC: i5-12400, RTX 3060, 32 GB of ram)
- The skill trees lack any meaningful variety. They are boring and uninspired, and don't justify the repetitive grind behind them.
- There should be more character skills for to correlate the weapons. The pyromancer's character skill is worse instantly the moment you pick staff 3 or especially 4.
- Higher difficulties boil down to running around in circles, kiting enemies and very later on praying you don't get stuck on something you couldn't see due to shit on a screen (which you can't exactly turn off, you can turn off only your effects). Also the enemies instead of getting harder patterns or something along those lines, only become damage sponges. Any ways of melting through them get nerfed every so often.
- Polish translation is awful. The grammar is off quite often and the way some things are phrased, despite being grammatically correct, give away that they were machine translated.",1680213773,1704246684,False,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,True

With experience of Vampire Survivors, 20 Minutes till dawn, Hades and Death must die, here goes my review for this game:

TL;DR: Visually beautiful game, which doesn't offer a great challenge.

PROS:
- Visually beautiful, colorful 3D game
- Large skill tree
- Many different characters
- Large variety of powers and upgrades
- Weapon crafting system (not far enough in the game yet to give deeper analysis of it, but it does exist)
- Different game modes and difficulty modifiers (once again, 2 and half hours in, not very far in this game)

CONS:
- Rather than having challenge like the games I stated above, this game might feel grindy for those with experience of Vampire survivors/20MTD/Death Must Die. While it isn't just a walk through simulator, because of the skill tree, every run is easier than the one before it. I'm not saying it's grindy in the most frustrating way, but it doesn't have same challenge as previously stated games, not with my experience at least

Easy to Learn

Very straightforward game design

Like the rest of the genre, it can get a little grindy, but that's a genre default. I like grindy games, so this is for me. 

This has been a good addition to my library. It DOES run well on switch, but the computer mouse helps with aiming more-so on PC than the joystick on the switch. Which, by the time you've built AoE x250% matters very little, as the entire screen becomes a disco ball.

I particularly like the twin stick implementation into the bullet hell formula, it feels so natural!

Cons:
- If you're one of those people that likes to unlock everything, be warned that it's super grindy. 
- The current gameplay style is super repetitive: It's basically a dodging simulator.
- There are tons of different viable builds, but they are so similar in play style that it feels like there are really only two or three different builds.

Pros:
- The biggest pro about this game is the developers. They are very communicative and transparent with the player base, and they actively address issues and make changes that the players want. This is always a mega-win in my book, which is why I continually come back to the game. I will 100% support developers like this.
- Speaking of the devs being super transparent with the player base, they mentioned that they also don't like that the game is a ""dodging simulator"" right now, and they plan to make huge changes to the gameplay to fix that. Once that update comes along, I'll update my review.
- Tons of skills to play around with.
- All 14 classes are viable, with none of them overpowering the others.

Eventually enemy bosses aoe nuke so much that you can't do anything else than to run large circles around them. This however can ""trap"" the bosses to the center of the map, which depending on the level may have walls for them. 

You can't shoot through the cublcle walls, but the bosses sure can. So, that's ""nice"".

This also means most thrash mobs are going to get stuck in the same walled box, which in turn means that all the damage you manage to sneak in there, will kill vast majority of the mobs there, so that's also where all the exp drops. And you can't collect that exp due the AOE spam, which would kill player character basically instantly.

The game is fun and varied, but devolves HARD into single gameplay method, which is the running laps around bosses and hoping to not get caught in their AOE spam.

Seems like summon spamming for the player helps quite a bit, but that means all other classes than necromancer (or similar) are fairly useless, but you need to level them up anyway to get bonuses...

I want to give this a recommendation, but can't. Not with the ""end game"" it currently has.

I heard it called ""red circle simulator"" (for the damage regions of upcoming attacks that enemies broadcast) and it really is. Run around and avoid the red circles. Enemies produce them constantly in prodigious amounts, and often they are quite large. Sometimes they are only semi circles or ""paths"" to add variety. But mostly circles. They define where and how you move, which can makes the game quite dull and repetitious, and will necessitate you to get some speed increase power-ups so you can run out of the circles in time.

Also the default magnetic region for xp crystals seems too small, and there is very poor feedback when you take damage (little in terms of video and audio cues). There isn't even a death sound really. The game just suddenly stops with a ""you died"" summary screen.

The characters are fun (if not as diverse as they look), the action is good, the power-ups are frequent, and the explosions are everywhere.

Compared to competitor games, the big difference here is that you are most at risk from ranged rather than melee attacks. The more and bigger the opponents, the more and bigger the red circles and arrows on the ground. Get out of the red circle before it fills up while shooting down the enemies. This is often ""The Floor is Lava Survivors."" The other major gameplay difference is that you can choose to replace weapons along the way, carrying over power-ups to the next weapon. Maybe you didn't like one of your early options and your favorite comes later -- just replace an earlier one.

Once you start having a late game, you will need to turn down the explosion graphics, or else you will not be able to see the red circles. Settings - Graphics - Special Effects Visibility. Turn it down to make the explosions transparent. Set it to 0 to make them invisible, which I how I have it set all the time now. When your powers can cover half the screen and multi-cast, that becomes a slider for how playable you want the game to be.

I cannot say the balance or design are perfect, but I have been having more fun here than with most of the competitors. And of course, anything I said above could change in a later patch, since this is Early Access. For example, I cannot recommend trying for 100% completion right now because that includes grinding to unlock everything on every character; as I type this, I have 2/14 of those and you can see my playtime. I like this game a lot, and that still feels like a lot of grinding to me.

What is nice:
- quick 10..20 minute runs
- dynamic builds every run slightly different
- tons of upgrades

What is not so nice:
Enemies spawn at a near constant rate, and since you are doing not enough normal DPS to clean them up you are relying on some form of AoE DPS, for which you must make your enemies cluster. 
So you spend the last 90% of your run walking backwards so that enemies follow you in a cluster, so that you can hit them with your AoE spells. And since you need to collect the coins the fallen enemies drop, you need to circle back to the coins.

So all runs are essentially completely the same, walk backwards in circles, while avoiding the ""red areas"" (where the bosses soon will drop an attack).
There is no strategy. You just walk backwards while not step on red.

Last there are tons of upgrades, but the leveling seems a little slow and it quickly feels very grindy.

On higher difficulties/curse levels, mobs are far too bullet-spongey, making the modes feel cheap.

On one map long-range magic pillars spawn to attack you far before your damage output is even able to dent them. 

Grinding out the skill tree helps, but it's too resource-intensive, requiring many full runs that have already lost their luster. You'll need to take down the same bosses dozens of times on several different stages to make any progress, just to artificially bump up the difficulty/curse level, just to unlock yet another character, just to go back to the skill tree to do it all over again, padding the gameplay loop out to the point where it stops being fun.

This is definitely a game worth it's price for any Rougelite/Swarm Survivor fan.

It's not much of a ""story"" experience, but the depth of the class system, progression and such is pretty incredible, and unless you are REALLY pushing the most difficult content (max Curse+Overlord endless loop 4+ or so) pretty much every thing CAN be played, and exploiting the most powerful builds and set-ups to start pushing OL9+ in an hour long run is pretty fun and interesting as well, or speedrunning the first loop, which takes a completely different mindset in choosing skills and power-ups!

Perhaps the best part in my experience though is how communicative and interested in community feedback the team at Game Smithing has been since the pre-release beta, it always feels like there is another patch just a few months around the corner that addresses an issue in a really impressively nuanced way or opens up at least another week worth of experimentation and theory-crafting, whether it be a new character, new skills, or a change in the Rune system. There are so many levers going into how you play each Swarm Survivor style run, and even that might be getting updates planned (no promises, but there was tentative mention of dungeons or challenge mode runs and the like being discussed in the most recent dev talk on their youtube, which even just being able to hear from Allan about what they want to do is pretty cool for a small indie studio like this, even if it needs to get scrapped, there's definitely an interest in some pretty interesting and exciting experiments in the genre in the works!)

Games is typcal Vampire Survivors clone with some cool features, especially the weapons feel nice. You can also argue that it requires a lot of grind and is not that smart / ironic as Vampire Survivors but that's all personal preference.

What is a huge problem of the game is that most weapons having strong visual effects and after 10 to 20 mins in a game you cannot see anything besides the weapons effects which makes it impossible to dodge attacks and leads to the end of the run sooner or later.

Things have become more streamlined and easier to read over time. It's much easier to see what spells are available in each character pool and which ones are locked behind achievements. Old reviews might complain about visibility of screen when there's effect and enemies, but you can toggle opacity on spells all the way up to making them invisible so you can still see enemies. More recent updates reward players for moving around the map to collect bonuses for each class, which I think is pretty neat since it used to be pretty common to just camp corners in this game. Spells and weapons are all pretty fun to grind for, and achievement grinding will get you plenty of hours on its own. There are occasionally things to come back for in terms of updates, although a minor frustration might be coming back between versions might force you to respec when a system is overhauled. However the save system seems to be good at remembering your resource counts and achievement history!

The biggest downfall for this game for me is that once you get near endgame, you have probably experienced the best builds already and there is not much to incentivize trying out lesser builds other than a few funny secret spells. However, considering the general price of this game is about $9.99 as of this review, I think it will take a long time before you hit that feeling, and you get your money's worth. Each character has pretty unique feeling from each other, despite most of them sharing similar spell pools. The early levels of the game let you kinda bumble about choosing all kinds of spells, while also letting you experiment with what modifiers or spell types you like. The overall feeling of this game is a bit of a Diablo-lite with the grinding system of Monster Hunter in a way. You can definitely min-max a specific targeted build and really demolish the game, and the runes and charater mastery systems let you spec both gameplay and character skills. You need to go back to certain maps, and beat certain tiers of bosses to get better weapons which unlock newer spells. These objectives naturally lead to getting achievements, which also unlocks more spells. Then you want to keep trying new spells and new weapons for more spells and high curse levels for more achievements, etc. This gameplay loop has kept me pretty satisfied, and the seasonal events are nice little map challenges. While many will argue there is more depth to the map mechanics of VS and other survivor games, I kinda like secretive but not too complex objectives for the seasonal events.

[list]
[*] Good variety of builds, 
[*] endless mode, 
[*] boss rush, 
[*] accessibility options (custom difficulty selector, transparency for skills, input lock on level up to prevent accidental choices, etc.), 
[*] relatively good looking (you'll mostly forget that it has a blocky look during a run),
[*] now with unlockable skins (no mtx),
[*] hidden levels!
[/list] 

And most importantly satisfaction. You can become OP pretty quick which is a lot of fun. The game is still in early access and there are a couple placeholders ingame but tbh the game is worth the price it's asking for already.

Red circle dodge simulator memes are real though.

[strike]I'm giving this a thumbs down only for visibility reasons, and quite frankly because the controller <> UI issues are really bad.[/strike] [b]Fixed in AotA, this is now an easy recommend and the best roguelike I've played in 2023.[/b]

If you don't care about the following stuff, go for it, I [strike]100%[/strike] completed the game (minus new content in latest patch). This is by far the best Survivors game as of now and the developers are actively fixing bugs.

Needed fixes:

[list]
[*] [strike]Controller support while in a run is fine, especially with hotfix v0.11.038 but there's still stuff that isn't accessible via controller (UI elements) or is really annoying to select. Examples: Everything labeled with a (?) question mark is basically only accessible with a mouse (like all stats). Choosing stages, character skills, character skill tree etc. are a real PITA with controller. It's also impossible to see the description of already picked up skills and power-ups unless you get a dupe or something to replace them with. Worse for character specific stuff like bars and their respective effects / buffs. Make more use of the D-Pad and streamline the usage of bumpers and triggers.[/strike] [b]All of these points have been fixed in AotA[/b]
[*] Still a couple of invisible damage instances, even after v0.11.038.
[*] [strike]With major soulstone conversion active, finishing a level with just a couple soulstones on the floor (like 10) causes heavy frame drops. You can die during those stutters to random damage. IMHO after finishing a level any active damage instance should be cleared immediately.[/strike] [b]Fixed in AotA, no more frame drops[/b]
[/list]

Suggestions:

[list]
[*] More hidden levels / events please! Honestly the most fun I had was trying to figure out the events. They were a welcome distraction from the otherwise monotone achievement grind.
[*] Ingame wiki and overhaul of stats explanation and other UI elements. The tooltips aren't really helpful.
[*] Characters other than the Death Knight +- Sentinel don't feel any different to each other, especially after you unlock their skills for others. Most character specific skill trees / special skills are just pick x up to get buffs y or damage z while damage z is mostly irrelevant and the buffs y don't last long. Picking x up can be really difficult in late game, more so when red circle dodging becomes important. The worst part are any of the ""stand still"" or ""stand in this area"" requirements. Not gonna happen.
[*] Given that every character model also (probably) supports every animation, a Challenge mode with randomized stats would be great -- you know, an actual roguelite mode in a roguelite game. Currently there's no reason to even experiment with new skills once you find out what works for you and you can basically brute force your one default loadout. This is fine for accessibility reasons but the game should actively encourage the usage of different builds AND characters IMHO. Otherwise scrap characters and let the player customize his own character.

The Soulstones are only used for the skill tree, which you will max out within the first few hours. I have millions of the basic soulstones and 1000+ of each of the others. The characters are basically all the same, within a couple rounds the power-ups you choose will more than make up for the starting stat differences. The only real difference is the abilities that are available to them, but even that can be overcome through the use of runes, though there isn't much point, just switch to the character that has the abilities you want. And speaking of abilities, there's only a few that are any good (Light Beam), most of them are useless beyond the first round or two.

The game is in early access, maybe they'll fix these issues, but it would require almost a complete redesign.

Edit: For what it's worth, I believe they have fixed these specific issues, except now they've taken it to the other extreme and you need endless soulstones for a complicated progression system that honestly I haven't bothered trying to learn.

It's very fun, you can dump a lot of hours into it. It's the best graphics that I've seen of this style of rogue-lite-horde killer, and despite the early access it has a lot of polish, and I think it is very worth playing.

Please do not get confused by the length of the complaints below on this reply, my positive recommendation stands, it does so much right that I honestly don't have a lot to say about what it does right -- but I do have some complaints and suggestions, and they are as follows.

 [i]Keep in mind that this is from the perspective of someone who has completed every map with max (48) curse, and many of these complaints won't be felt until you're 50+ hours in[/i]:

1. The game needs an actual Endgame. Endless mode sounds neat, but once you've unlocked everything, and figured out good combos, the run inevitably devolves into circling bosses trying not to get 1-shot as you chip away at billions / trillions of HP.

You will feel really powerful ramping up through Bossmode Endless 3-4, it might take you as short as 4-5 minutes to progress through Endless 5, and then it quickly outpaces your damage, and by Endless 7 you are suddenly spending 20+ minutes to get through it while trying to dodge getting 1-shot regardless of how much block/armor you've picked up.

To be clear, you can absolutely still progress past this point, but when you get to this level you will be fighting your own boredom, rather than the bosses. Eventually you will give up because you simply cannot be bothered to spend a half hour+ to whittle away a level when the bosses all have more than 500 trillion hp, and there are 65 of them. I've never bothered to complete Endless 8 -- not because I couldn't do it, but because after a point it ... just stops being entertaining.

This makes for bad streaming, and bad speed running, and those are often the lifeblood of a rogue-lite game like this. Even if the end is just time, seeing how far you can get in 30 minutes or 45 is better/more fun than endlessly circling bosses for an hour+, and it would let the Devs be more free with the damage multipliers they add to the game, and ultimately let you become more powerful.

2. The game needs more viable recovery skills. An endless push simply requires Arcane Shield, or Exorcism. They are the only two skills in the game that provide you with Damage Absorption effects or Healing, respectively. You simply cannot expect to get far in Endless mode in this game without them, and they are restricted to two classes (Arcane Weaver / Paladin), which means you need to spend valuable Runes that unlock these abilities on other characters, or play only these two characters.

3. The game needs a way to, with 0 cost, disable the seasonal skills. As more seasonal events happen, and more seasonal skills get added, you are better off not doing the achievements, because they will pollute the skill pool. Because of the secret achievements, there are now 6 seasonal skills that can appear in all of my runs, and I *never want them*.

I'll say it again, more plainly: Doing the secret achievements makes you less likely to see the skills you actually want.

Also, personally, they ruin the fantasy of the classes that you choose. I do not ever want my Paladin to summon Santa's Elves, yet the option is presented to me in every run, [i]in place of a different skill that I might want[/i], and I can't go back and undo having done the achievement.

4. Bosses are endlessly recycled, and it makes every map / run feel the same. How many times are you going to fight Keythaiz the Prophetess during an Endless boss-mode run? It could literally be 20-30 times over the course of an hour, depending how far you get in Endless. [i]By the end of a run you might have 3+ of the [b]same boss[/b] on the screen at the same time[/i]. The game needs less, but more significant, bosses.

5. The way the game ramps up difficulty is a bit odd. The same enemies, and bosses just move and attack faster and do more damage. The defense skills can't keep up with the speed at which you progress through endless mode, so you're better off not taking them. By endless 7 if you get caught on a tree and stand still for more than what feels like 0.5 seconds, the bosses will catch up to you and 1-shot you, regardless of whatever defense skills you have. The only thing that can save you is Arcane Shield. This causes some whiplash from just 10 minutes prior when you were rocketing through Endless 5. Let me feel powerful/untouchable for a bit longer, eh?

[strike]6. The runes that add skills to your pool need to allow you to select the skills. Right now they ""add 6 random skills of the given type, that you otherwise would not have access to"". If I take the Arcane skills rune because I want Arcane Shield and Arcane Assault on some class that is not the Arcane Weaver, then when the run starts I spend all of my rerolls, and then restart, and repeat this until I see both the skills I want. Doing that is trivial, but it is a needless annoyance. The rune should pop up a window that allows me to [b]select[/b] 6 of that-type of skill, that I otherwise wouldn't have, and put them into my pool.[/strike] -- THEY DID THIS! YAY!

7. The maps are cycled through, so it doesn't matter what map you choose -- if you do an endless run you are forced to play on all of them, which makes choosing the map pointless. This has not mattered in the past because the maps are basically identical / reskins, but as the maps get more distinct (the last update revamped the enemies on Whispering Grove), the game should keep you on the map that you chose as you progress through endless mode. Perhaps add additional things like per-map uber-bosses to be added every X levels, and otherwise give the maps some personality.

---

[h1][b]Personagens[/b][/h1]
Existe uma boa variedade de personagens, e provavelmente ainda vão lançar mais. Atualmente são 14, cada um com uma arma única com habilidades diferentes, é fácil encontar um personagem que condiz com seu estilo de jogo.

[h1][b]Ferreiro[/b][/h1]
No ferreiro, é possível aprimorar a arma do seu personagem até 3 vezes (tem um espaço para o 4 upgrade, porém ainda não foi lançado), utilizando materiais que você consegue farmar durante as runs. O problema é que se torna um processo demorado se você desejar fazer isso para todos os personagens, pois o grind pra alcançar esse feito vai ser pesado.

[h1][b]Habilidades[/b][/h1]
Para mim, esse é o ponto forte do jogo, existem muitas habilidades, possibilitando uma boa variedade de criação de builds: Utilizando magia, melee, build com foco em debuff, long range, summon, etc...
Vale lembrar que alguns personagens não conseguem utilizar algumas habilidades. [spoiler]Porém, é possível resolver isso com uma runa que você desbloqueia facilmente.[/spoiler]

[h1][b]Maldições[/b][/h1]
Você consegue liberar níveis de maldição no mesmo mapa para liberar novos materiais e aumentar a porcentagem de experiência, entre outros recursos que você pode adquirir. Obviamente a dificuldade aumenta, mas é bem irritante jogar nas últimas maldições porque o mapa fica lotado de círculos vermelhos (marcação de ataque dos inimigos) poluindo DEMAIS. Já basta a poluição das próprias habilidades.

[h1][b]Árvore de talentos[/b][/h1]
Na medida que você upa teus personagens, você consegue desbloquear melhorias gerais e individuais. O ponto forte aqui é que cada personagem tem uma habilidade única, uma espécie de ""ascensão"", que libera uma mecânica nova diferente para cada personagem. [spoiler]Por exemplo, o necromante passa a encontrar partes de um golem na run, e quando todas as partes são encontradas, o golem é invocado para lutar ao seu lado.[/spoiler]

[h1][b]Senhores do Vazio[/b][/h1]
Senhores do Vazio, ou Lords of the Void, são bosses que você encontra durante a run. É necessário matar uma certa quantia para terminar a run, sendo úteis também para adquirir materiais especiais para comprar novos personanges, upar suas armas ou investir na árvore de talentos. E são os maiores responsáveis por poluir seu jogo com círculos vermelhos!

[h1][b]Poluição visual[/b][/h1]
Eu geralmente não coloco um ponto negativo como destaque na análise, mas isso aqui atrapalha muito a gameplay (pelo menos ao meu ver). Isso acontece pelo fato de que alguns inimigos, quando atacam, exibem uma marcação em vermelho no chão com a área de ataque do inimigo. Funciona bem nas primeiras maldições, mas depois fica horrível; você não sabe para que posição andar, pois muita coisa acontece na sua tela ao mesmo tempo. Não sei como poderia ser resolvido esse ponto, mas com certeza é algo bem negativo.",1702778276,1702778276,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

This is worse than 6 of the 5$ survivor games I tried so far.

[h1]Gameplay(5/10)[/h1]
In a word: bland.
[list]
[*] You run in circles and collect crystals. That is all you do.
[*] Your inputs only matter for evading attacks (until you can't see them due to your own attacks)
[*] All class/skill combinations result in identical gameplay. So far only difference I've seen is needing to aim with some skills (and I use ""aim"" loosely here).
[*] All upgrades (temporary and permanent) are boring linear damage/defense/mobility boosts. Skills and gameplay doesn't change with upgrades.
[/list]

[b]Upgrades[/b]
I strongly suggest everyone considering this game looks at [url=https://soulstone-survivors.fandom.com/wiki/Attributes] Wiki ""Attributes"" page[/url] and tries to find at least 1 exciting thing, because these are all the upgrades you can get in game (temporary or permanent).

[b]Skills[/b]
So there's like a hundred skills in game, and maybe like 20 status effects, half of which are damage over time effects. Why am I bringing this up? They all feel the same.

Ignoring different elemental version of skills (which is more than half of the arsenal) the skills that aren't different in any meaningful ways. Great, one skill shoots a bolt, one thrusts a sword and one blasts an AoE around you. 

Damage difference is negligible, range eventually becomes irrelevant as even tiniest attacks hit the entire screen with enough range buffs. 

An example done right would be having a sword that is average damage, speed and range and offering a sniper rifle that has a narrow line for AoE, but hits hard and far.  Rogue genesia does it right, as despite so many weapons being just projectiles they do feel different because gameplay highlights the small differences in punch-through, reach and such.

[b]Terrible visibility[/b]
This game telegraphs most dangerous attacks and you're meant to dodge them. Problem is eventually I blast so many massive overlapping visual effects I can't see the ground (and telegraphs). So far all of my deaths (in decent runs) ended with me dying to an attack I couldn't see due to my own attacks.

[h1]Music[/h1]
I enjoyed the music initially, but after it looped for the 20th time It started to get annoying. Also it seems to have vocals

This didn't influence my opinion of the game, but if any future devs are reading this, the longer the music is playing the less noticeable you want it to be. Music should only grab your attention if you want it to make an impact during a short section of the game OR if you're prepared to have a large variety of tracks.

[h1]Why it's worse than competitors[/h1]
I'll compare it to 20 Minutes Until Dawn(20MUD) and Rogue Genesia (RG), because they are good in different ways, while sharing some of the flaws.
Below are things both of these games have and Soulstone survivor doesn't
[list]
[*][b]Feeling of growth[/b]. The biggest things those 2 games nail is feeling of progression. You go from needing 3-5 hits to kill a basic enemy, to then killing multiple with 2 hits to finally 1 hit killing hordes of elites elites before you even see them. Also both in both of those games progression is not limited to stats. 
[*][b]Tension[/b]. As much as I dislike contact damage it makes those games tick. If you're too slow, or don't have enough damage to clear a path - you lose. This creates stakes. In this game I often start out with terrible movement speed and just casually walk around enemies, because only bosses are a threat.
[*][b]Playstyle variety[/b]. The whole point of classes and weapons is offering different playstyles. For example: 20MUD sniper rifle (slow powerful piercing shot) and a pistol (average at everything) feel very different despite both firing 1 similar projectile at a time. Furthermore, those games have you build for different weapons differently.
[*][b]Engagement[/b] is a result of previous points. 20MUD and RG have you actively engage in combat (at least early-min run) AND building your character. Soulstone survivors offers 14 classes and probably 100 skills, all of which have you you run in circles and offers no nuance in builds.

Good take on the ""survivors"" genre.

This one has a massive skill tree, weapon forging, runes to equip, match history, and a load of both active and passive skills. There´s an incredible amount of possibilities for your build.

This game has a dash ability. You actually need to move, dodge and pay attention for the entire match! Even choosing abilities when you level up is active: you have to choose between three alternatives.

This game is pretty fun. There is a lot to unlock. Lots of things to try out. It is very over the top with the power scaling. And I think it's sadly now an iconic part of the game the devs are going to have to work with moving forward. There are a wide range of difficulties as the scaling comes from curses and there are like 30 or so to chose from and you can have them all active too. No curses is very chilled and casual where as max curses is more for people who (like my self) enjoy making game breaking builds and dancing out of dmg zones. 

The fact that you can go from slowly tickling bosses to death to instantly destroying them is a very fun dynamic to experience and leaves you in awe at the madness you have created. 

You can even bind the visual intensity of player attacks to some hot keys so you can tone up and down how much you can see your abilities. At very late game you might find your self even turning off the visuals for your abilities completely as you know that as long as it is on the screen you are hitting it and you need to have a clear view of the ground to avoid deadly attacks. 

The art style is fun. It is like somewhere between World of Warcraft and Runescape. You have explosive goblins. Kobolds with candles on their heads. A Deathknight.. but the low poly vibes of runescape. 

The music is the best thing about this game. Very nice psy trance beats but not too heavy on the kick so it doesn't get too much in the way of the other game sounds.

Very interested in seeing where this game leads. I think they could squeeze in a little bit more end game as after reaching level 170 on a character there is nothing left to unlock for it yet you can still level up. 

I would like to imagine there is still one more tier of stuff planned out for basically 200-250 as so far character level tiers seem to match difficulty level tiers in colours and 200-250 would be gold like the highest curse difficulty.",1701810616,1701811054,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

- Need bigger variety of bosses, at some points you'll have multiple of the same on the map which is annoying.

-The metaprogession actual progress is reversed, meaning its very hard to progress it in the begining and SUPER EASY to finish it. like you can get a chat from 1 to 100+ in single run and its not every too challenging to do that, once familiar enough.
-At a certain point having the proper global metaprogression and runes unlocked is more impactful, then then character you're playing, meaning you can go full necro on a paladin and be just as sucessful, since anything in Overlord/Endless 4+ oneshots you anyway, its give or take the same experience

This weekend I decided I was in the state of mind where playing Pretty Vampire Survivors felt like a good way to fill a few hours, and somewhere around 10-15 hours in I had unlocked enough stuff to actually be playing a pretty neat abstract twin-stick shooter with lots of little monsters on top of it, when I feel like turning the visual effects down enough to see them instead of a lurid carpet of shifting color fields with numbers popping up on top of it. I'm a longtime fan of Jeff Minter's work so ""playing a game while you can't see more than about 10% of the visual cues"" is my idea of a good time, and I really appreciate that there is a visual effects intensity slider in the settings for when I'm not up to a lengthy session of that. Then I started unlocking stuff on one of the character-specific skill trees that you have to unlock the entire base skill tree to get to and it's actually started giving me some real variety in how the different character play.

But before I could get to that, I had to grind for most of a day. And fiddle with the controller configuration so that the dash button auto-repeats, and assign the right touchpad of my Steam Deck to ""mouse"", which the default layout does not do for some reason - super annoying in a game that has a zillion little info boxes to mouse over as you work out your build!

Pros:
- a lot of builds
- a lot of heroes.
- a lot of stuff to grind.
- psytrance musik.
- good graphic.
- fast gameplay.
- interactive gameplay ( depends on what u play )
- good diffuculty ( dodge or die )
- also runs great on steam deck.

Must have for Survivor fans.

Cons:
- could have way more maps 
- could have way more different trashmobs and bosses

I've gotten to end game quite alot but that doesn't stop me from queueing up the next run to see how far I can get with a ridiculous build either it works out as planned or you struggle and play endgame or work around it fixing the cracks in your brilliant build :)

The heart of the game is great and was possibly one of - if not the outright best survivors game of the bunch.  Here's what's wrong with it currently and why I'll spend exponential less time playing Soulstone Survivors vs. any other survivors game:

[h3]Rock, Paper, Rock? [/h3]
The core game is so good but at the same time, you'll feel like you're chasing your tail. Once you get over the initial hump of starting out new, the rounds go for too long.  Feels like they won't end...until the bosses spam AOE all over the ground.  Basically, the end result is that you'll feel like you aren't accomplishing anything, since there's no way to counter it.  

[h3]Too Much Hamster Wheel[/h3]
Then there's the progression.  For completionists this game has grind on top grind.  There's so much to unlock...too much.  The problem manifests itself when you consider the process of unlocking everything with the aforementioned boss AOE spamming.  That's when you start feeling the insignificance of it all.  You can melt bosses and mobs easily, but there's no way to deal with boss AOE spamming all over the ground and the impact it has on picking up soulstones.   

I love these types of games, but idk if I'll ever even touch this one again.  I feel like I've already experienced everything there is to experience, but haven't unlocked anywhere close to everything there is here.  However, you can tell pretty early on that nothing you unlock is going to change the game in any significant way.  It's sounds weird saying this, but it's like they put way too much content into this game.  It's a complete waste.

[h3]Aesthetically Soulless[/h3]
And then there's the art style, which is completely played out and overused at this point.  But for some mind boggling reason, the devs thought it was good idea to use it again in their new game.   It embodies the feeling of cut and paste and simply lacks originality so much so, that I just can't stand looking at it anymore.   That's just me....I'm sure there are plenty of people who won't mind it as much.  If I never play this game again, this won't be why - but someone has to say something.

For one, you usually have to spam the dodge button. It's not an occasional ""Oh sh*t"" button, it's a constant and continuous use. Because...

90% of the screen is covered in high damage AoE effects from the bosses, which means you have to keep out of their range, which means you don't damage them, which means you don't complete the stage, so you have to dive into the AoEs, spam dodge, hope for the best, take a ton of damage anyway, then likely die/lose a life in the process. It makes completing stages on higher difficulties (which is downright required for progression) very, very difficult because of the oppressive AoE spam.

It's soooooooo close to being where it could be, but the AoEs/dodge spam makes playing the game tedious and unfun for me. I wish the devs cared enough to reduce the spam but they seem to believe it's for the best of the game.

I've unlocked the last character, Death Knight, and OMG I'm on a horse!  I haven't really tried to min/max my toons or searched online guides for the most OP builds, just trying out stuff and exploring the various skill combos.  So far this is what I know:

1. I love and will always pick the Chaos Golem, cuz ""it's dangerous to go alone!""  Doesn't matter if I'm supposed to be a tank (barb, paladin) or a glass cannon, or even if I already have pets (houndmaster and necro).  I love love love my golems.  They are such good distraction for the bosses and I can run around and concentrate of killing from afar.

2. The necro makes me happy.  It reminds me of Diablo and I love having a massive group of pets doing all my dirty work while I collect stuff and avoid the red zones.


Initial impression:
I was introduced to the Survivor genre with Vampire Survivors, loved that game and hooked me for a while, then I put it away and played something else.  Got Soulstone Survivors on sale and it rekindled the joy.  The music is very hypnotic and a perfect match for being in the flow state and zone out a bit.  I love the skill tree and runes and different characters and experimenting with the various combinations of active skills and modifiers.  So far so good and I'm trying to max out the Barb and use that to farm components to build better weapons for all the other toons.

It's already becoming my favorite survivors-like games.  Obviously, it's similar to Vampire Survivors (VS), but really only premise; kill hordes or enemies, level-up (create build), survive.  One major difference is the twin-stick-like aiming.  Don't get turned off by this as you don't need to be as accurate as a shmup since most attacks end up being AOEs.  SS also deviates with bosses intermingled in each level (5 by my count; which spawn after defeating a number of enemies), these bosses drop giant XP which also sucks in all the maps shards (XP) - which is like VS magnet.  Each class has some unique skills, though you can use your favorites on any build if you want.  Unlike VS, you can dash as well.  The maps really don't differ much beyond aesthetics.  I think adding level specific mobs, hazards or terrain (snow, ice, sand, etc.) might be interesting.   One of the reasons I like SS is you feel like you can actually beat a map.  Some of these survivor-like games just make it impossible to beat, which can feel frustrating.  It's nice that you can add modifiers if YOU want.  

There are a few cons.  One being that since you can pretty much make every class play the same, I'm not sure how deep and varying builds can actually be.  Classes differ by HP, damage, speed, and obviously their class specific basic attack.  You can pump up the starting stats in the skill tree; which is also pretty basic and will apply to all characters.  Another con is some things are explained very well or consistent.  Sometimes completing a map will gather all the XP to level up, but then you go through the portal to end the run.  While, in some maps, you can continue to another level.  After a while, some of the level ups seem a little underpowered for your level as well.  **you can add some rerolls via the skill tree, but they are pretty expensive and I'm not sure how much they actually might help.  So far there doesn't seem to be a large variety of bosses, but I'm only 4 maps in, so maybe there's more...

SS might need to have separate skill trees for each character to add to the longevity.  *edit- I just saw there this does exist!  Still, there's a lot to like and the unlocks and achievements are keeping me engaged so far.

Iv'e tried games like Lazarus project, Halls of torment etc. Those games have something missing. This game adds a couple of extra features such as the skills and runes. I noticed people criticizing the games mechanic of ""avoiding the red circles"" to be fair many of the enemies throw projectiles and you have a dash button (funny how NO ONE even bothered mentioning this. Makes dodging the red circles effortless. It isnt that hard and also just like any VS rougelike game, attacks are all automatic. I think some of the people that jump on these sorts of games dont understand the premise of these games. Vampire survivors you have enemies throwing projectiles too but youre simply avoiding purple circles and these pop up last minute without their being a dash button. Reading the negative comments for this game almost made me scared thinking it be a complete type of game but no. Anyways if you like Vampire survivors this is one I recommend. I dont know if this is a negative or a positive but the game at times feels like a mobile game without infinite energy. It kinda always makes me wanna go back to this game and do at least 2-3 rounds because the upgrading does get a little addicting imo.",1700967131,1700967131,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Quite a good time early game to build-craft and unlock new characters/upgrades. The game starts to suffer once you get to higher curse levels, as most builds cant keep up with the sheer enemy density/boss hp pool. The runs end up feeling samey and the novelty runs out.

 Essentially, as of the time of writing this, the gameplay loop turns into: Use runes to force into a strong poison/summon build, kite bosses and ads by spamming dodge to keep out of the constant red circles until you win. Choosing to continue the run using an alternate portal doesn't extend the replay ability for me. All it does is plop you in a new area with minor changes. No new strategy or new hazards are introduced, except the bosses have more health, do more damage, and attack faster. This just ends up being a race until you get one shot by a non telegraphed attack.

So i've played the game ever since it was available and started out a lilbit above positive, it was all good and fun and the more you play the more unfun it becomes. Not because it's repetitive, its because its unbalanced as FUCK the higher levels you go, and I get it, obviously more progression made in the game = more difficult, as it should, Atleast.. until that difficulty is beyond what can even comprehend, seriously, you can't stand still for .1 SECONDS without getting fucking one shot, even moving constantly isn't that reliable because of the 12000 attacks coming at you in all shapes, forms, sizes, and speeds.. if you don't wanna play on the higher difficulties (Which you're forced to to unlock new classes and there respective weapons) then I guess that fine if you want 5-10 hours of gameplay and never touch it again, around 3-4th tier levels is where it gets frusterating, I'm on tier 6's (out of 7) and you can imagine thats not better. The game just has severe balance issues. It wants you to enjoy your character and there build but guess what, Wanna go heal Paladin? welcome to tier 6 where 95% of all healing is reduced.. great cool. Wanna make use of your class? Many of the classes need to stand still or in an small area for your special to work.. guess what you stand still, and you're fucking dead. You cannot play the game the way it wants you to without being punished for it. It has probably one of the most fun and synergetic ability systems in any of these survivor like games.. but it just dissapoints soo much in the end by being nearly unplayable. I don't speak as a casual gamer, I play games 12-18 hours a day. This is not fair or balanced. so heed my words when I say everything I have.

It's not as smart as some games (like VS), and instead relies on grinding various stats that all end up feeling kind of the same. There's not much strategy since all roads lead to the same place - and this is common in this genre, especially in the less well-designed games. The other major problem is the graphics - the spell effects are nice but they're TOO MUCH. Everything on the screen makes a huge explosion, or a huge shockwave, or draws huge weapon trails, etc. Pretty quickly it's impossible to see what's going on and the game just becomes red circle dodging. Why does my minion skeleton mage's basic attack create a giant purple shockwave every 2 seconds across the screen? Not everything needs to be a massive display. Now multiply that by 15 minions, yourself, and the enemy mobs and the game becomes very hard to play. And while the art is nice, I don't need it assaulting my eyeballs like that. The music is great and full of energy - perfect for a game like this. There are also lots of unlocks to grind your way through if you like that sort of thing. I didn't notice too many secrets, but there are a few.

To be fair, I started playing a year after it became available on steam so I got to enjoy all the changes already. But I looked into how the game was in the past and especially coming from other survivor games like Vampire Survivors, Holocure, Halls of Torment, etc. this game is refreshing in both content and quality of life. There are so many different builds you can test out across 14 characters (as of today), so many different skills, and runes. Not only that, my favorite feature has to be the opacity filter when the screen gets too clonky w/ all the abilities towards endgame. Makes pushing for harder areas more fun and plausible. 

For a lot of alpha/EA games I have played in the past, the devs either just do their own thing or they stop working on it after several months. This game is quite the opposite in listening to the community as well as consistently fixing existing issues or adding new content.
 
This game is good if you like survivor games and also fun for people who want to kill mobs of monsters with lots of different build variations.

This game offers awesome depth in it's characters, weapons and abilities.

I have owned it through a fair number of patches so far and can safely say the developer changes are awesome and every patch leaves the game feeling more polished. 

One fair complaint from lots of people is that as the game progresses you need to turn down the visuals and have a lot of dodging in your life.  Honestly, I don't find it reduced visuals diminishes the game play enough to effect enjoyment and....well these types of games are always about dodging shit that kills you - it's part of the fun!

Another game-breaking problem at high-level playing is that the animations of many spells will obstruct your vision of enemy's AoEs. Which, as you might guess, can be fatal at high levels.

That's pretty much it. There are other, similar indie game titles out there that actually feel rewarding for grinding through the maps. Save your money for those games.

[h3]visibility[/h3]
- even with turned down skill effects, there are often times where you don't see anything (take the preview videos and imagine 20x as much skill effects, enemies, and stuff)
- way too much red circles for dodging
- lasting enemy effects last too long (bombs, puddles, ..)

[h3]balancing[/h3]
- healing items appear randomly and heal like 20ish life. in comparison you have like 150 default, and getting damaged between 30 and 100+ damage
- the grind for farming materials for better weapons is too extreme

[h3]other annoying stuff[/h3]
- performance can be bad if there are too much monster and skills at one place
- on the higher levels the gameplay loop is basically running in circles, dodging stuff and wait till the skills made enough dmg.
- at certain parts too intense, when you have to fight bosses for like 30+min without break
- at the end of the run you can decide if you want to leave, continue, or do harder boss challenges. sadly this is behind a RNG wall. meaning you can have a good build and fun but the game will not give you the option to have more fun.",1700369292,1700370347,False,1,0,0.481566786766052246,0,True,False,True

It's a VS-alike, if you've played one you've played most to a degree, but they've carved out a nice little space in the genre for themselves. 

What differentiates this one: 

* _lots_ of different weapons and damage types and effects
* iso rather than 2d
* weird indirect hitbox for damage

The last point is hard to get in a sentence - coming into contact with mobs doesn't damage you until they actually attack - and the areas where attacks are about to land are highlighted; you get hit if you stay in the zone too long. 

This makes sense with an iso perspective, as it's hard to be pixel perfect in avoiding things otherwise, but it does feel a bit luck vs skill, using your skill to _lower the odds_ of getting hit rather than actually avoiding attacks directly. It's unfair to say this but... combined with the low-poly style, it makes it feel slightly mobile-game. The gameplay is plenty fun, but... ehh, there's a slight flavour there. 

The other complaint I have isn't a *bad* thing, it's just missed potential. There's a million and thirty different tags on attack and damage type: swing, burst, missile, nature, magic, holy, arcane etc etc - and there are perks that apply only to certain categories, incentivising you to focus your build around them, which is neat. 

It's just that there's very little complexity and no downside to any of the interactions between weapons and perks. What would really put this game into a category of its own would be deeper interactions, with both synergies _and_ dysergies. Put in some tradeoffs, force the player to make some tough choices. Add a perk that buffs X but nerfs Y, make combining some categories less effective, make ferinstance slowed monsters hit harder or something, so you're actually shaping your build rather than just throwing everything in the bucket as it comes. 

I haven't unlocked many runes yet, so perhaps they fill some of this gap - but it seems like a gimme to bake some of this into the basic mechanics.",1700304369,1700304369,True,7,0,0.626600921154022217,0,True,False,True

1. Visibility - yeah, the latest update did jack sh#t! Nothing changed, enemy attacks still grow increasingly hard to see over the course of a run. Yes, there is an option to turn down effects, but that completely kills the game. Why the attackmarkers do not get changed into complementary colours when covered by the characters skills, is beyond comprehension.

2. Received damage - Oh yeah this one is a big fun killer and infuriating at times. Additionally to enemy attacks being hidden behind way to intense skill effects, there is also no indication of an attacks threat level beside the size of the circle on the ground, which may or may not be visible. So in higher difficulties one can get struck for 150+ damage out of nowhere (recognisable that is) while franticly trying to evade incoming attacks.

3. Healing - There are a few ways to heal, but the healing power is a bad joke when compared to the damage one can receive.

4. Area of denial - Damaging puddles of negative effects are lasting way to long. Sometimes it is simply not possible to get close to the bosses to fight them or get their loot. Also some elite enemies summon vortecies which do an unholy ammount of damage on the character, this wouldn't be a big problem if their ammount would be reasonable.

5. Defensive abilities - Armor and damage reduction upgrades in the game are almost useless and most of the time you are better off choosing a damage, area, frequency or multi-cast upgrade.

Gefällt mir sehr, man merkt die dauerhaften Skill Verbesserungen in den Runden, man wird stetig besser, Soundtrack find ich ok, viele Zahlen auf dem Bildschirm, viel Gewusel an Gegnern und Bossen! Hohes Sucht Potenzial! Dann gibt es mehrere Klassen, Runen und Edelsteine zum craften. Ich habe mich am Anfang etwas erschlagen gefühlt aber mittlerweile geht es. 

Ich finde es sehr gut, dass man die Attacken der Gegner mit Feldern/Farben sieht im Game. Damit man rechtzeitig ausweichen kann, auch wenn das gegen Ende einer Runde unübersichtlich werden kann, da soviel los ist. 

Mein persönliches Highlight ist das nach dem man einen Boss besiegt und man seinen Kristall einsammelt, alle XP Kristalle auf der Map mit eingesammelt werden. Der Soundtrack auf den Maps ist teilweise richtig gut, Dark Electro / Trance / Techno Beats mit leichten Vocals ziehen einen in die Loot Spirale.

Außerdem kann man sich jede Map mit Modifikatoren schwerer machen (gibt auch mehr Loot).

There's a ton of content, with many different playstyles and maps to unlock.

The only problem is the lack of challenge. After around 11 hours, I beat the highest curse level and can't really see a reason to play anymore.
I guess I could max out every character and every map, but I don't really see a reason to do so, as the game will only be getting easier and easier with each one.

It would be nice if they added more curses and let players customise the curses they want to play with - for example, instead of the meteors spamming everywhere, you could choose to have enemies that are 10% tougher etc.

My second issue, is the game really isn't challenging. The game is prioritizes a very droney grind towards the endgame which is kinda pointless because the end game is a bunch of projectiles and sword strikes covering the red circle that's going to one shot you.

Very polished and looks super promising. But with all curses active game becomes frustratingly annoying with entire floor in red circles to the point I am fighting urge just to slap ALT+F4. It is just constant dance around ground effects with bosses basically unreachable and during that dance even more spawn.

Also grind looks crazy to me. Maybe just first impression but yeah... Lots of crystals and other stuff needs to be picked to unlock everything. Other stages of the passive tree locked behind full unlock of all passives does not make it any better.

Good game probably, just needs some oiling to ride it smooth.

----
Seems like passive tree from each character is connected to the main node and some of the passives works for all characters as it is one single tree branching out to characters. That is more grind but already interesting.
---
After few more character grinds. The higher tier areas I play, the less I enjoy the runs. It is just non stop red circles everywhere. Constant running around and dodging as bosses are unreachable. Usually happens a lot with slightly less lucky skill options. My favourite was when for 20+ level-ups not a single movement speed option showed up. With specific meta builds or full unlock of the tree probably that is not an issue. But I doubt it. In other words - challenging by enforcing annoyances and friction.

Game is addictive for sure.

Pros:
1. You can get epic level ups and rare level ups from the get-go.
2. You can specifically boost your area/attack speed/damage. Neat!
3. Matching Spells can feel rewarding with legendary upgrades.

Cons:
1. Super grind!!! Everything in this entire game is a grind! (everything needs materials which you get a tiny amount PER RUN!)
2. This game explains absolutely *NOTHING*. When you finish a run, there are 3 doors. they don't explain wtf they do.
3. When you start this game, expect to have to spam the first stage until you buy powers, because you're going to have a bad time if you try to play the second stage without them.

The game is progressively easier as you progress through the passive tree, the upgrades are interesting and each character plays differently.

It took time but the new features are starting to make this game very fun to play. I can now recommend this game!

Old review:
Too many game design mistakes.
They want to make the game challenging like a bullet hell but you can't control your character when you get hit and you're forced to keep moving because there's a ghost following you that will one shot you if you stand still.
They want the player to dodge but the zoom/field of view is too small and you can dash into a rock or tree and die.
There are minerals that you can grind when playing on some maps, but for some reason the uncommon minerals are harder to grind than the legendary ones.
Characters have different unlockable skills, but you don't know which one unless you look up the wiki.
Half the runes are boring and useless because they don't add anything to the game, just change the RNG when picking skills

I can't recommend the game today. The game doesn't have soul. It's a bunch of features mixed together quickly trying to replicate the success of Vampire Survivors. The optimization is really bad too, you will have to play with all skills effect off to get more than 20fps, even on a good pc",1669726312,1699827706,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Despite being in early access, the experience so far has been almost completely bug free and surprisingly not too heavy on the hardware. Audio is more than decent, music depends on taste - the OST is not intrusive and it keeps a good pace. There are quite a few builds to try out and combine thanks to the recently reworked rune system. The existing 14 characters feel distinct, and I believe at this point another 8 characters have yet to be revealed - there is simply a LOT of content. Challenges are at a medium level for achievement hunters, and won't exclude casual players. The overall flow of the game is good too, even with difficulty modifiers (called Curse intensity) cranked to their maximum.  The community has more than a few players willing to help out newbies or bounce ideas for theoretical builds. The development is communicated quite openly with players - an important plus.

This all being said, there are drawbacks and limitations that need to be disclosed. The current balancing is kept at a reasonable Loop 3/Curse V level. Going beyond this is possible, but the difficulty scaling for enemies is a matter of escalating numbers - this is a major gripe I tend to have with game design in general. It is entirely possible to create a build that can win Loop 7 or even 8+ where enemies have their basic HP multiplied by hundreds of thousands, their attack speed makes a mockery of human reflexes, and the damage from common goblins can wipe your life out many times over. But even if you put together an ungodly tank with a 75% chance of ignoring attacks outright, a 95% damage reduction for attacks that do connect, and healing up to your full life per second, sooner or later you are completely outscaled by numbers alone; when you win another full Loop it feels like a chore.

Replay value is also a hit-or-miss. If you're into the arena survival genre it's already expected. If you are unsure and only getting into this type of game it can get quite monotone and be more of a slog than an exploration of what the game is and does. Quite a few attack type pools [Slam,Chaos,Fire etc.] are shared between characters, which can also contribute to the feeling of having done everything before. The seasonal events are a permanent part of the game, and even when completed you can still do them at any point. Again, for some this may be a welcome side challenge or a reminder of milestones that were crossed before.

Terrain. This is one of the worst enemies in the entire game. Getting stuck on a tree or piece of wall can be a death sentence for an otherwise promising run. It's not the end of the world, but the frustration terrain-related failures bring is real. It can put people off from getting into another run.

While obviously flawed, Soulstone Survivors is a good game. On the whole, I would happily recommend it at a discount for anyone curious, and at full price for enthusiasts.",1699799635,1699799635,True,1,0,0.522058844566345215,0,True,False,True

Overall 6/7 bucks is a fair price for the game and worth picking it up if you're a fan of the genre and have exhausted the content in Vampire Survivors, Halls of Torment and Holocure.

One notable innovation is the ability (and necessity) to dodge red circles and squares. This makes movement more engaging and they did a good job making it feel responsive and fluid.

The more interesting twist though is the fact that runs are not a set length of time. Instead, you are required to kill a set number of monsters. Kill them quicker and progress faster. This makes build optimization have meaning. Plus the ability to opt-in to effectively boss rush mode at the end of a successful run is really great.

The place where it falls short though is on thematic and general character. Everything is 3D including visual effects so they're more costly to make but the content isn't as memorable as the assets of say Vampire Survivors or Halls of Torment or Holocure. The characters you play feel like generic assets. The abilities you get are mostly standard lightning/shadow/fireball/etc. I'd love for them to find a way to inject some life and style into the game.

Another disappointment is the level of challenge. The base levels are all pretty easy. It's possible to clear your first run without knowing much about the game mechanics at all and just picking offensive powerups. At the upper end challenge modes and boss rush it can get difficult but I'd love to see a smoother curve to mastery and learning. The balance between defensive/offensive power seems so off I feel as though the game would simply be better if all the defensive talents were removed.

Still despite the shortcomings it's still a well made game I'd recommend fans of the genre pick up. I'm sure the developers will only continue to improve it throughout early access as well and they seem like great folk so support em.

The classes were bland, the abilities were similar to stuff in other games, and there wasn't really anything to make it stand out.

That said, it has been supported for over a year now. Hoo boy have things changed.

Sure, the crafting is still as limited as it ever was (which is fine), but the skill tree got expanded [i]dramatically[/i] and now includes things like unique passives for each class that give them significantly altered gameplay, a whole slew of abilities, unlockable runes that let you customise your character each run, and enough difficulty to scratch whatever itch you happen to have at any given time. 

The Developer is currently working on some aspects of the game that are still a little wonky, but honestly given their progress I think it's now certainly worth buying. It's a satisfying 'Vampire Survivors-like"" with a bunch of content and combos you can employ. 

At this point I think the only things I'm really longing for is more uniqueness among the classes. I'm still invariably using (mostly) the same abilities for each class so I want to see them all have a couple of passive abilities that really entrench differing gameplay, even if it's only minor overall changes. I crave asymmetry.

I was quickly doing a diablo barb whirlwind spin larger than my screen every 0.1 seconds and it feels like nothing. Nothing in this game feels like anything, it's not distinct like it is in the other survivorslikes or whatever you call these.

Ultimately I died because I got bored and lost focus. Other than that it seemed like I could go on forever. And you probably can, with the progression because the skill tree is fucking massive and there are tons on characters. But the two I tried didn't feel super different, and I doubt the rest of them do either judging how porridgey the enemy and level design is. Looking at the videos the characters have differences, BUT, they make no significant difference so why bother with the grind?

I think I'll come back and try it with different characters, but I have my doubts. It just fundamentally doesn't feel interesting. Brotato can do more with an area that's about a quarter of the size, and there's no overbearing +hp +dmg +this and +that etc. progression.

- It's really smooth
- Really fun at start
- A lot of character customization, I felt like I am playing Path of Exile
- Characters are unique, every class has an unique play style which I enjoyed a lot
What I disliked
- When you evolved a lot in the game, it's not fun any longer
- At some point when AOE gets super big, you can't see anything anymore, but you have an option for that, to decrease the transparency, however it looks very bad without that transparency.
Conclusion:
I recommend it, it's good, it's fun for several days but once you do plenty of upgrades, the game stops being fun.

Now it is a strong pretender for the best in genre. Developers are very active and constantly add something fun to the game, being more content or UI improvements. Some additional maps and a few more bosses would be great to have, but the game is still in Early Access and considering how much good changes already happened - it is quite possible to get improvements there too.
What is there, anyway? 
* Good amount of characters, with each having their own ascension skill, impactful enough to make a difference. Each character also has whole big passive skill tree with several unlocks that will work for everyone. 
* Enemies on different maps actually become different not just in skin, but also in abilities. They have different patterns of attack and different toughness. And some more were just added a few days ago.
* Thanks to recent changes in how runes work build varieties are over the top now. It was good before, and it just become even better. Technically speaking you could make sameish build for pretty much every character now, but it will perform worse than build catered for specific character strengths.
* Most abilities and elemental statuses get their own quirks now. In the past the game suffer a bit from feeling that various elements and their abilities have a feeling of being simply recolored. Not anymore.
* The soundtrack is still amazing and get another track or two just recently. I admit that with amount of grind it does start to feel too limited. 

But beware: the grind is real in this game. If you want to complete all characters skill trees - you are looking at hundreds of hours of gameplay. Not that you NEED to do that, you can finish max curse on any map with only a fraction of passive skills unlocked for any character. And having more maps and bosses could make grind a bit less repetitive. Still, grind is fun because you are not simply spending hours of play to get yet another +5% of damage for that specific character. Each character has 3 new runes in their skill tree that you can use on any other character to get even bigger builds variety. And some passive skills also applies to everyone, not just character you unlock them for. That makes grind rewards actually exciting.

But the long grind is the long grind. If that is not for you - maybe look for another game there. And that is alright.",1682891926,1699532946,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

They adressed the 2 worst characters for endgame, changing their mechanics a bit so they don't have to stand still so much while damage rain on them.

Devs are working hard to fix everything, but there's still a shadow of fear due to the new game being kinda ""soulstone survivors 2""

People are being rude with my old review, but even the devs KNOW and TALKED about how solving the visibility problem is a nightmare on lategame for now without changing major parts of the game.

The ""git gud"" comments are funny, as from all the thousands of combinations of runes, characters and skills, only about 4 are actually viable on max difficulty (which is needed to farm materials) due to problems previously mentioned here.

Devs are doing great :D 
----------------------------------------
I LOVE this game, but please read my full review to understand why I don't recommend it until they fix a single point.
------------------------------
The game has an amazing progression system and synergy between skills and level ups.
You can customize SO MUCH with runes, mixing skills from other characters and leveling them up to add permanent bonus stats to the other chars.

The only HORRIBLE downside is how the difficulty scale works:
You have to set the ""curses"" by yourself, kinda like Hades, they increase the exp and currency you get, so they are needed to be activated on higher levels. The problem is that there is a point where you can't even stand still for half a sec while all the screen is red with damage indicators.
I've seen bullethells more merciful than that.
To add salt to injury there are a LOT of chars with specific mechanics that need to stand still for one or two seconds to get their buffs, making them USELESS ON HARDER CURSES.

Please devs, Hitting harder>>>>hitting the whole screen. We already have to deal with the stupid curse minion that has a insta death if you let it reach you and bosses that deal OHKO.

This stupid ""whole screen covered with enemies and damage zones"" only pushes the cheesy summon builds where you can leave some coccoons/turrets and just go to the other corner of the map while they melt the bosses, as some summons are untargetables by enemies.",1698103775,1699335546,True,7,1,0.55790787935256958,7,True,False,True

The gameplay is fun, the different characters and builds are fun to experiment with, and the progression is satisfying and rewarding. The 12 minute rounds with options to extend are a fantastic way create runs you can end periodically but extend if you're in a groove.

I've been playing for a few months and the devs have put out multiple, substantial updates, including an anniversary patch today that overhauled the rune system (for the better) and addressed one of my biggest complaints by upgrading the UI to make the value of different upgrades clearer. I was originally a little concerned to see they have another game coming soon while this one is still in early access, but it's clear that this game is a priority.

If there's a complaint, it's that the difficulty scaling can be a little rough. You set the difficulty by adding different curses at different tiers. Having all the curses from a tier unlocks new rewards (primarily crafting material or extra upgrade currency) and you can choose different curses a la carte. Unfortunately managing your curses can be frustrating (I would recommend allowing different curse 'profiles') and the highest difficulties can sometimes feel punishing more than challenging with the amount of the screen covered in attacks. In my opinion these aren't deal breakers and I plan to edit this review when (I'm confident) the devs continue to rework systems.

It hasn't taken me that long to be working on max level curses with all characters unlocked, but at this point in the game I'm starting to see limitations, many of which are being addressed by the developers in future updates so I remain optimistic.

The two main issues for me are:
- Most of the characters feel the same at high level, despite each having individual core mechanics to unlock. This is mainly because of the amount of AOEs the game throws at you, especially when you're up against 5+ bosses at once. You end up just running and dashing around the map non-stop hoping that your build will work. You don't even see the bosses much, because if you get remotely close to do some more direct damage, their other AOE abilities come into play. I played five different characters last night and the gameplay loop was exactly the same.
- Some of the character designs rely on collecting items, being close to something or even standing in a particular spot for a few seconds to gain buffs. For some of them, this conflicts directly with the ridiculous quantity of AOEs, making the characters feel useless. 

The other minor complaint at this stage is the small number of levels - only 5 right now. Aside from that, the UI with a controller could use some work, particularly the runes page as it's hard to navigate. I also hope that they can come up with some more achievements, because without being a completionist I've got 75% of them already. There are some balancing issues and the amount of base currency you earn even at the highest difficulty is a bit low, but I'm sure these are among the many things that will improve by formal release.",1699102293,1699102293,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

-I've wanted a single player game that gave me an MMO-ish type grind, which I feel this game kinda has.
-Fast rounds, ideal for when i want to just play for a few minutes. Now that I've progressed you can also continue longer (so long as you survive). 
-Another solid entry in the 'Survivors' genre of games
-Solid/fun characters to unlock/upgrade etc. 

Two settings you might want to adjust, will be
1. Turn down the effects of your abilities so you can see the red circles from enemy attacks.

Progression is amazing.  You have a skill tree, blacksmith weapons and an extended tree past the skill tree plus runes.  

There is enough to customize and build that you feel progression kicking in every single round.  

Characters are unique in their own ways, they have minor stat differences but huge ability differences.  Each character can also be played several ways based on the weapon and runes you pick.  Making build diversity quite extensive.  

There are 5 levels to choose from and in those 5 levels there are multiple difficutly scaling options.  Making the game progressively harder if you so choose.  There is even an endless mode or a boss hunting mode at the end of each map, this makes gameplay extend as far as you would like.  

The music isn't half bad either.  

Cons
I feel like my abilities override enemy abilities which means that you can't dodge anything or even see anything.  This makes the game frustrating, relying less on skill and more on bad design. 

I feel there isn't enough level diversity.  Small arena's without much going on.  There aren't any meaningful things to do.

I feel that characters need to be a bit different than they are when it comes to base stats.  They feel boring and uninspired. 

The game would benefit from more equipment pieces to build even more diversity.  Add armor or trinkets.  It would help with freedom of choice and building options.  

Lack of multiplayer isnt my favorite choice developers make when they create these games.  This game would be twice as fun with multiplayer.  Your characters are small enough to comfortably be able to fit more players on the map.  

Overall the game is a solid 8/10.  It could be a lot better in some areas but as a whole it definitely stands apart from others.

The things that really let this game stand out: NO CONTACT DAMAGE!!! I cannot tell you how much I appreciate the fact that damage is clearly coming from an attack animation, not just from base to base contact.
Variety! Something like 20 or so classes, each with 6-8 unique weapon skills on top of the hundreds of universally accessible skills. On top of that, they are finishing up super meta progressions that feel like a prestige class for each and every class, that will introduce a whole new mechanic to the class.

The maps look great and all feel different with a nice variety of enemies, the characters are all pretty unique with their own weapons/abilities and the runes are a fun perk system that gives you a lot of options to tweak runs or useful stuff like improved loot drops. There are almost 150 skills with both a lot of unique ones and different variations allowing for all sorts of builds.

One thing that is unique is you can replace skills mid run, and while the characters have different skills you can also use the runes to enable either individual skill types or all of them if you like it random. Upgrades during runs effect either individual skills or different types so being able to swap skills out depending on the upgrades you get keeps things interesting.

It has a pretty good balance between being a tad grindy and having a lot to unlock and improve, if they made it much easier you'd run out of new things too fast and it also forces you to plan out what you focus on. More specific dificulty options could be nice but it gets plenty hard at the highest settings.

Soulstone Survivors keeps to that Survivor-like trait of getting a lot of bang for your buck. For a cheap game, there's a lot of content here to keep you entertained and coming back for a quick game.

The caveat with this is the end-game, which is where I feel it does a good job of drawing you in, but then flounders. As you progress in the game, you add modifiers to levels to make them harder, but give more rewards. The problem is that as you go up these levels, the amount of reward you get for the difficulty of the level sharply drops. At Curse level 5 or higher, the screen is often filled with red damage areas that in some cases can instantly kill you, and by 'filled' I mean 'filled'. If you don't spam the dash button you're almost certainly dead.

It's here where the initial fun of making builds falls apart as there only viable builds narrow dramatically, and the gear you create from the extra crafting materials doesn't offer much of an advantage, but an alternate style of play which might not even be viable for higher Curse levels.

Essentially, there comes a point where progression hits a brick wall. Whereas other Survivor-likes try to keep that progression arc curved, that's not the case here. Furthermore, as far as I can tell a level can effectively last for an infinite amount of time, which is a divergence from the usual formula that I feel should be adopted. One of the great aspects of your typical Survivor-like is that the game ends at a set point, so you always know that when you press play, win or lose you're done in 20 minutes. I would even suggest that the developers strongly consider this, because there's no worse feeling than spending 49 minutes grinding a Curse level only to get OHKO'd from an attack you couldn't see in the midst of all the others.

TL;DR Great Survivor-like with a strong start to the end-game but rapidly hits a brick wall.",1697992999,1697992999,True,21,1,0.733830511569976807,0,True,False,True

After 4 hours I was hating the game for its bewildering array of skills but I went on, played another 4 survivors games and came back to it.  I am glad I did.  I just think I need to potter about a bit in it some more before attempting to unlock the last character - unlocking the second-last nearly broke me.

The basic game is quite entertaining and much what you would expect from a Survivors game, for all its massive skill tree and rune selection.  Then you discover debuffs, ""curses"" which raise the bar significantly.

For comparison, I have played Nordic Ashes, Yet Another Zombie Survivors, Battle Grid and God of Weapons.  Each was a stroll compared to this, fun though they were.  Not one of them has threatened to reduce me to physical and mental breakdown the way Soulstone Survivors is doing.

Why in gods name does it spawn 3 bosses with huge health bars at the same time who all just group together to do massive AOE attacks and THEN if you kill too many of the smaller enemies before the bosses die, it spawns.. even more bosses to fight resulting in 4-5 bosses at once and a new boss spawning as soon as one dies.

I got 30 hours of fun for $5, you can't tell me that doesn't deserve a thumbs up. With that said... there are some issues, as shown in the following review, written by some other person:

""Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. This is a maybe for sure. There's a ton of fun to be had here - the abilities are fairly varied and flashy and a lot of the builds can feel different, the rune system + weapon system (plus the new character-based skill trees) are a good way to change it up in a lot of ways.

The problems you run in to are twofold: To get the highest tier materials, you HAVE to turn all the curses on to max. This turns the game into one where realistically only a few ways to build work and even then you have standouts where doing anything else is hurting you. The reason it gets so restrictive is the absolutely unending spam of red circles (projectiles, slam attacks, AoE attacks, whatever) coming at you - they happen when you kill enemies, they happen AGGRESSIVELY every minute or so when a bombardment tower spawns (that you then have to dash straight towards and kill to get any breathing room), and the bosses screen-covering attacks which mean you want to be hitting as many things as possible at all times, ideally when they're not even on screen.

You pretty much have to turn the visual transparency to max which takes out a lot of the ""feel"" of going fire over poison, for example, to be able to see. Also all you do is move and dodge red circles, there's really no more to it than that on max curse, no playing around with things, etc. That would be fine if it were an optional difficulty but it isn't if you want to craft weapons (which you do, they unlock more content!). Turning off the curses for the towers and the after-enemy-death meteors especially helps de-escalate the red circles a ton, but those are mandatory too.

The problem on top of this is the clearly poorly balanced material farming rates. You have to have curse maxed out to even see the high tier ones, but also the lowest 1-2 tier materials are what you need the most of by a landslide. Spending 10-15 minutes per run farming to get 1/6 of the material needed to craft 1 weapon for 1 character is nonsense, and that's WITH the high level rune to increase material rate by 50%. So you're rerunning the same 1 map 6-7 times in a row with the same runes, same curse, same build, because anything else might slow you down, and you get to unlock 1 of dozens of weapons (more of which are coming). I know I've highlighted this (and some others have posted about it as well) to the devs for months and it's one of the things they just have not acknowledged - apparently they must think it's fun this way, but I don't.

Keep in mind, this is when I had 100% unlocks going into a new patch, with abundant materials leftover from playing each of the new weapons, and I still fell short of literally every new weapon released. I have almost 60 hours in from the initial release and It'd take me probably another 10 of dedicated grinding, no actual variety, to unlock the rest of the weapons in the game as of this post.

The REQUIRED highest tier of difficulties need to be reworked to be more interesting and interactive, and the material rates (or costs) need to be overhauled badly. Those two changes would make me put this in the ""recommend"" but right now it actually feels like a bullet heaven that doesn't respect your time, it almost feels GaaS-like in the grind requirements, and frankly? F that. This genre is great because in 10-30 minutes you can have a whole fun experiment and then do it again, Soulstone Survivors asks ""what if you didn't actually get to do that?"" and the answer is, it gets boring fast.""",1697829059,1697829059,True,0,0,0.441176474094390869,0,True,False,True

Fun, because it got smooth gameplay, a lot of variety, meaningful choices of abilties, tons of powerups. Fun meta-progression, lots of characters. There is a ton of customizability available with different skills and weapons for each character and additional runes to make every run even more unique and try out things.

With all these positives, the bad part becomes even more frustrating: The balance is kinda off. Lower difficulties might be challenging at first, but become a walk in the park quickly, once you understand how things work and which spells are good and synergize. So the natural thing to do is play at higher difficulties, for even more rewards and special rewards. And thats where things... fall off and every run starts feeling the same - no matter how you build your character. You have all the stuff available, but no matter what build you choose, which character you play.. You end up with the same gameplay: Dodging red circles and AoE attacks for as long as it takes for the bosses or yourself to die. You have to turn the effects nearly 100% transparent to be able to see every red circle. So no matter which build, everything looks and plays the same. You end up going for the same 3 builds that just work every time and have no incentive to change it up. And at the same time, going back to lower difficulties feels totally unrewarding, because no matter which build, it gets super easy and no challenge. And you miss out on the better rewards.
You basically want to change things up and try different builds, because there is so much possible variety. But there is no reason to do so, as everything just is the same, except that enemies die at different speeds.

You get to have a ton of fun until you get to that point, though. So the game gets a thumbs up from me. 
Also a tip: Don't look up builds online. Find the OP-Stuff and combos yourself, as thats the biggest factor of fun in this game. After you found them, the boring part sets in, as described above.",1697646043,1697646043,True,130,2,0.9207763671875,1,True,False,True

The introduction of the dash mechanic makes the game play a lot more intense, so rather than just moving around and aim/auto shoot you will also need to time your dashes to avoid getting hit. It's almost like a shooter. 

While the game has 5 maps which you play over and over again, the character customization possibility is HUGE. At 70+ hours, while I have unlocked all of the characters and got all of them to level 70+ it will still take me a while to unlock all of the skills for all of the characters. So big plus if you like character development, but this will also likely to annoy folks who dislike to grind because you will be doing ALOT of grinding. Fortunately much of the grinding was quite enjoyable at least for me. The game may appear to be difficult at first, but once you get a hang of it (after 5-10 hours) it becomes a blast as your your characters start to build up. While some of the abilities are more powerful than others, all characters have the potential to be overpowered provided that you have a good build strategy. Speaking of build strategies, in addition to abilities which randomly appears as you level up there is also the use of runes which allows you further customize your build.

Rating: ★★☆☆☆

Soulstone Survivors had the potential to be an engaging and enjoyable gaming experience, but it's severely hindered by a game-breaking bug that threatens to overshadow any positive aspects.

The concept of the game is intriguing, where you collect soulstones and embark on a journey through beautifully designed maps. However, this excitement is short-lived due to a critical bug that results in the complete loss of map progress and all hard-earned soulstones. This bug is not just an occasional inconvenience; it is a persistent issue that has left players frustrated and disheartened.

Imagine investing hours into meticulously exploring and conquering various maps, only to find all your progress wiped clean in an instant. It's a demoralizing experience that ruins the sense of achievement and progression that a game like Soulstone Survivors should offer.

The lack of responsiveness from the developers in addressing this issue only exacerbates the problem. Players have reported the bug, and while there may have been some promises of a fix, it appears that the problem remains unresolved. This lack of attention to a game-breaking bug is inexcusable and demonstrates a lack of commitment to the player community.

In addition to the critical bug, the game also suffers from some minor issues, such as occasional glitches and subpar graphics. While these may be forgivable in isolation, when combined with the game-ruining bug, they contribute to an overall negative gaming experience.

In summary, Soulstone Survivors could have been an engaging and captivating game, but the persistent bug that causes the loss of map progress and soulstones makes it difficult to recommend. Until this issue is addressed and resolved by the developers, it's best to steer clear of this game to avoid a frustrating and disappointing gaming experience.",1696176060,1697201842,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Lategame is basically endlessly dodging red circles and only a few skills actually doing enough damage to even kill the bosses ( which are the only way to actually win. ) 

Many, many, many classes can't even use their unique trait because they require standing stationary at a point or remaining in an area for a prolonged time, which is almost always guaranteed to cost you a life.

Skill damage, usefulness and even usability vary wildly, most melee classes become God Run or No Run in the late game. Death Knight in particular is absolutely abysmal on high difficulties, as you entirely depend on constantly dashing through the residual ground effects, which the Death Knight is unable to do. ( Not to mention his base weapon is absolutely awful. ) 

Furthermore, Many classes have weapons that won't even reliably clear entry level waves and you depend on essentially kiting until you tickle down enough mobs to level and get any other skill. Really disappointing to craft a new weapon and immediately feel like you've lost a ton of damage.

Skill trees become a generic game of skipping all of the ""flavor"" of a class to get generic stat boosts.

By the time you really begin to get deeper into the game, you find yourself being really frustrated by it. A real shame.

Soulstone Survivor is I believe the best game in this genre today on the market when it comes to graphical design, music, character progression, options and customization. I still have to give it a thumbs down, because where it lacks the most is also the most important aspect. The gameplay itself. 

I currently play on Curse level VI across multiple maps trying to unlock the hardest difficulty Curse level VII and I have also crafted my Epic weapon. The gameplay until here was very fun and I enjoyed it a lot. But unfortunately at this point, lategame is a total mess. The game could also be called, Dash, The game ! Because that's all you do, press space to dash nonstop in order to avoid damage. It is not fun. It is also impossible to play lategame without any piercing or high aoe skills , because there are so many monsters that there is no chance to even hit the bosses from distance. Having 6 bosses at once with 30 million hp each. Sure, I can cheese them with dashing in, deploying ballistas, dash away , rinse and repeat until they die  but again its not fun.

Also playing the Pyromancer and going pure Fire skills is unplayable and not because it could not be viable, but If you have the whole screen and ground burning from your fire skills, you will have absolutely no way to tell that you are standing in an enemy danger zone. Only your hp disappears out of the blue and you are asking what happened, as you didn't seen anything. Red on Red is a no go, this needs to be fixed otherwise Fire skills are useless.

This is a very cool and promising game until you reach the endgame. And there is also big potential. I had a lot of fun with it for the time being, but I don't think I am going to spend more time with this game until the issues I have with this game are addressed.

You pick a base character and build that out with all sorts of different spells that are available.

They also got many runes available in which you can customize your characters spells / abilities ( make them stronger or faster ) and have a start advance depending on what build you wanna go for

There are many abilities you can unlock through just playing the game, in which is great.

They keep adding more and more stuff and the game it's getting expanded each time.

I do hope they will add some sort of disconnection feature in it in which the progress is saved since some times i get a disconnection and then lose progress sadly.

and i would love to see a online multiplayer ( co-op) mode into the game in which you can play with a friend or a total of 4 friends max and getting more and more difficult waves and bosses as you progress on together.

-Great graphics
-Tight gameplay
-Varied graphically
-Deep customization
-Many classes to choose from
-Fun skills and cool synergies
-Weapon crafting is motivating and unlocks skills for the character no matter which weapon they use

The biggest issue the game has is the complete over whelming amount of noise on the screen once you progress through difficulty tiers. The game gets to the point where there is so many damage aoe's on the screen you actually stop understanding what's happening and default to just running around in circles hoping you're avoiding getting hurt. Seriously going through a stage at late game is actually a draining and irritating experience. 

Another problem the game has is some of the skills you have access to blind the screen and take up screen real-estate by hiding the damage aoe markers meant to warn you and if you level them a certain way it can cover the entire screen. Some of the level up mechanics that would be very cool and fun actually hurt you in more ways than they help you making a certain number of skills actually completely useless and not worth having at all, which is a real shame. 

All in all, I can't recommend the game in its current state. There's too much that is just annoying, frustrating or just simply not fun to deal with. It's a fun design but it's a shame it misses the mark by slapping more enemies, more damage projectiles to just overwhelm you into submission.

Active movement and necessity for dodging makes gameplay challenging. Scalable difficulties means risk vs reward works well. High difficulties are actually tough, though certain classes are simply a bit more powerful than others due to the nature of their class specials. Huge passive tree constantly provides new rewards and incentives and makes each character just that bit more powerful after every run. 

Some of the complaints about visibility are deserved. You must reduce effects visibility to about 1/3rd to have a playable game on higher difficulties, otherwise you can't see the red 'floor is lava' effects. Higher difficulties also become dodging simulators, especially when bosses are active, but I actually like it as it adds another layer of complexity beyond just 'what build is best'. 

Overall - I highly recommend this game. It's one of the smoothest, nicest looking, well playing styles of this particular genre out there.

I then proceeded to put 30 hours into in in maybe a week. So clearly I like it. The abilities are fun, the different characters are cool, and there's a lot of different ways to play if you don't want to play the right way (All doom all the time bby!)

In fact the only complaint I have is the unnecessary clutter with the add ons.

AS AN UPDATE: Since my original Review they have done a big content update which cleaned up a chunk of the clutter and made certain things more clear. TO simplify, passives of the same tier now properly show the stacked numbers! Foe example, if I have Passive ability Lethality (which adds 5% chance to crit), when I mouse over the passive it will now say that i have a 15% increased chance to crit when i have three stacks! 
This was a huge complaint of mine previously, so very nice to see that fixed. It also helps clarify what stacks and what does NOT, for example on Debuff applying passives, the CHANCE to apply the debuff does NOT stack, but the impact of the debuff does.

HOWEVER, they still do not combine the higher tier versions of passives into one card, so green Lethality and regular lethality are tracked separately despite being the same damn thing. but tbh that's my only real complaint at the moment!

I am 36.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

I wanted a screen with exact numbers, and it'd be even better if they added that, what they added is that you can see how much of health is eaten by fire/poison/doom and it will color the health bars, esp. useful on bosses.

it is such a difference.

and the way you can make overall effects more or less transparent on a slider. not ideal, but a big help for flashing and vision blocking spells

there's a lot of details that seem better. 

overall, this is a full positive review now

------------------------------
follows is the orig. review unedited
------------------------------
tentatively positive, but if they don't fix the most important issues I have I'll change it to  thumbs down.
the game is quite good, has a lot of really good ideas, but since the things that I can't stand have been here since last year, I don't see them changing it

what I like:

I like colors. a lot of games these days go for extremely muted colors and boring visuals. this game does not.
while I am not a big fan of the art style particularly, I do not hate it. it's pretty ok. a slightly less mobile-game way of designing the models but with the same colors, spell and so on design would be great.
basically, I like the look - mostly

music is certainly different. I muted it after a while. but I like that it's something else, some style I haven't heard in games yet. not for me, but I appreciate that they aren't copying 8bit or some other style
and I really mean that: I'd much rather have innovative music than a worse version of what genres are usually used. maybe at some point I'll grow to like it, maybe not. but at least they're doing something

I like the leveling system, a lot. this is where the game shines.
I like the many many unlocks, 
you get minions as well.

the screen at the end of the round is a good start -- but it lacks a lot of info. and the dps numbers are hidden during the round which sucks.

you can continue with new rounds when you finish without dying. very cool.
-----------------------------------

what I dislike:

no joke, I never die basically unless I get stuck in the terrain. and I get stuck constantly. this sucks. 

it really bothers me that it is completely unclear how and when rare resources spawn. 
I go through the map, and nothing's there. I fight for a while, go a bit farther away, and suddenly there are several rare. but I can't run around like in most survivor games because it seems XP despawns after a while. So I am torn between hugging a spot and looking for rares. it sucks.

you can't see stats for so many things, or only when it does not matter.

how much damage did all the poison do I added? how much the doom? and so on...
game will never tell you. so it feels completely meaningless and demoralizing.
the system they use is GREAT! I love it actually. but you *never* see the damage bonuses and it feels like useless.
the whole point of these games is stats and improvement.

the weapons you can unlock have stats you can't see. who on earth thought it is a good idea to *hide the stats* of things you could potentially unlock? it makes it completely not interesting.
even worse: you can't tell if what you see at each character is the weapon, or the character bonus.
so you can never tell *if the weapon you see is even an improvement*. 
show me a COMPARISON between one weapon and another. so stupidly designed.

the damage circles are not visible through your spells, your minions and enemy mob models. once you're far enough, all you can do is avoid anything and circle the combat area from far away, or you just die from hidden damage circles.
such unbelievably stupid design. 
damage circles need ALWAYS be visible, or forget playing at a certain point.
--
you *can* make effects transparent, on a slider. but that does not solve the issue really. I like how the game looks. check out RPG games or other games how they make things that transparent on the fly so you always see the most important things. do that. 
general transparency is not a solution


they do not show differences when you level up.
e.g. you choose ""adds poison to 30% of your hits - does 100 damage"" - but that is not true. you already chose it 3 times, so the skill should say ""adds poison to 30% of your hits - does 300->400 damage"" showing that you increased from 300 to 400
the game feels like it is designed to hide the EFFECTS of the upgrades you got. they show the upgrades, but you have no idea what reacts with what and what adds what after a while. because the game does not show you in an easy manner

worse: since there is interactions like ""if a hit poisons, it also dazes"" (similar) - but you can't see it on poison skills.

here is what the game SHOULD do, to ENCOURAGE and SHOW you the upgrades you have running, so you can see what you achieved:

in a neutral color:  ""adds poison to 30% of your hits - does [in red->] 300-> [in green->] 400 damage. ""
under that: ""trait/upgrade interaction: [in green] poison procs [in yellow] daze""
then show the DPS all 4 poison upgrades do in a window I can see DURING gameplay AND at the end of the match.
right now the game hides it everywhere

suddenly you can easily build your proc based build and see it work.



if they don't change that, I'll change it to thumbs down. 

""Halls of Torment"" is a vastly superior game where it counts, even though it looks much worse. especially because it keeps the Vampire survivors way how you receive damage.

the spacebar dodge is only more fun on paper. it just creates this incentive to make you *have to dodge all the time* - making the game into a dodge simulator, not a vampire-survivor-like game

this game is way too hectic and not chill at all. *but* this can be solved if they make sure the damage circles are <VISIBLE> always though models and skills/spells.

and they really need to fix that you can just get stuck on geometry, or have the game make it look like you can dash through, and then you can't

and devs: please, let me filter for achievements I *have* unlocked, not just the opposite.
and show those from the same day on the top always.
then let me sort for *when* I unlocked.

It's very well-polished both visually and in gameplay mechanics. There are huge number of playable characters with their own lines of weapon progression, and a large number of enemy types as well.

The visuals are stylized, low-poly graphically (think Minecraft but with better fidelity). Some people will dislike this style intuitively, but I think it looks great (the color palette is really well managed, for one thing). It also means the game will generally run well, even if you don't have a top-of-the line GPU.

Mechanically, the game is very tightly designed. Movement is responsive, which is crucial, because you will spend a lot of time running and dodging enemy attacks. The core of the combat is based on selecting skills as you level up during each run. The attacks trigger automatically, so you can just focus on positioning (at higher difficulties this is more than enough challenge) and you can also aim certain skills. Making smart selections for your active and passive skills, and especially trying to achieve synergies between them, is important. Essentially, the skill system is a deck-building mini game.

As a rogulelike, once you finish a run, your character will return to lvl 1 the next time you play: you will have new randomly-generated options for skills. However, there is also a pretty robust progression and unlock system for characters between runs: you can unlock new weapons as well as a separate set of permanent skills on the skill tree. You unlock both mostly by spending materials you earn from doing runs, with rarer materials coming from harder runs (there is a ""curse"" system you can use to up the difficulty as you progress.) Importantly, as far as I have seen, there are *NO* microtransactions of any kind: you can only ""buy"" things with materials earned in-game. This is obviously a very welcome design.

The music is also really great. Techno/dance-inspired, but with some other elements woven in. It definitely matches the frenetic pace of the gameplay.

The game isn't perfect, of course:  I wish there were more levels, and I wish the levels they had felt more different (they are all the same size and dimensions, and there are only a few real environmental elements to interact with mechanically). I think they should also have more bosses (""Lords"") as you will quickly get used to seeing the same ones over and over. There are also a few very minor quality-of-life things (controller support is good but is a bit lacking in menus. This won't affect combat or movement, though.)

These negatives though are *far* outweighed by the positives. If you like this genre of game, it is definitely worth your time.",1695916529,1695916529,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

**update 09/24/2023**

After getting a few good hours into this game i'm finding myself getting burnt out on it. There seems to be a point that you will arrive at where if you don't go with ""meta"" builds, you're not going to live to get to the last of the run. There will get to be sooo many ads that you can't even breathe. Red circles EVERYWHERE constantly to where you'll soon find yourself getting annoyed and frustrated. The game could use some balancing for the abilities as well as the characters. There are a good chunk of the abilities in the game that are pretty much useless at the higher tiers of the game and there's only a small pool of the characters that can handle the higher level difficulties. The game is fun, up until you get to curse level 3. Then it turns into a grindy sweat fest. Lots of scenarios where it seemed like certain surfaces had a layer of gorilla glue and caused you to be stuck in place for a second. This may seem minor, but just wait until you're being tailed by a graphics card destroying crowd of mobs or several of the boss lords at once. It sucks to be at the tail end of a run and get killed and lose all your rewards.

From character variety to skill variety. Soulstone Survivors will keep you engaged for hours as you unlock its secrets.
The flow of each ""run"" is its biggest strength, along with is daunting difficulty scale if you decide to delve deeper. all though some builds are completely shadowed by others, they are still satisfying to get firing on all cylinders. 
The game itself is the final boss, can you crash it? you definitely have the tools to try.
If you are familiar with this type of game, level up, pick a choice from skills or passives, and enjoy them, you cannot go wrong purchasing this game.

All though I do recommend this game, it does have a small issue with identity.
where it tries to be complex, it becomes a bit tedious.

[spoiler][h2] Things I would want changed in the game [/h2]
[b] GET. RID. OF. THE. CRAFTING. SYSTEM! [/b]
I see where they wanted to go with their crafting system, its great in theory.
For this game though? it just doesn't work, it isn't fun, its a chore to get you new unlock. I already work towards unlocking the weapon, and now I have to get resources to unlock it? nope, not fun.

[h3]Introduce more feats of skill to unlock new content.[/h3]
  don't get hit for X amount of time. this could also encourage using block.
  survive X amount of time with increasing health, armour or movement speed ect.
  complete a run using only common and uncommon upgrades.
The options are limitless, this can obviously replace the crafting system. Rather then having the weapon unlock at a certain level it could unlock after achieving a feat of skill

[h3]Change some of the character special ability[/h3] to fit the games archetype more. this game requires movement, a lot of movement. so playing a class that needs to stop, or focus of their ability, feels, hmmm bad.
the two best characters to explain this are The Spellblade and The Sentinal. Their abilties require to much attention, and in end game content just arn't viable, and quiet frustrating.[/spoiler]

[h2]In conclusion.[/h2]
This game has potential to be top tier, the dev team has produced a great product that deserves the play time. just play it.

There's a ton of fun to be had here - the abilities are fairly varied and flashy and a lot of the builds can feel different, the rune system + weapon system (plus the new character-based skill trees) are a good way to change it up in a lot of ways.

The problems you run in to are twofold: To get the highest tier materials, you HAVE to turn all the curses on to max. This turns the game into one where realistically only a few ways to build work and even then you have standouts where doing anything else is hurting you. The reason it gets so restrictive is the absolutely unending spam of red circles (projectiles, slam attacks, AoE attacks, whatever) coming at you - they happen when you kill enemies, they happen AGGRESSIVELY every minute or so when a bombardment tower spawns (that you then have to dash straight towards and kill to get any breathing room), and the bosses screen-covering attacks which mean you want to be hitting as many things as possible at all times, ideally when they're not even on screen.

You pretty much have to turn the visual transparency to max which takes out a lot of the ""feel"" of going fire over poison, for example, to be able to see. Also all you do is move and dodge red circles, there's really no more to it than that on max curse, no playing around with things, etc. That would be fine if it were an optional difficulty but it isn't if you want to craft weapons (which you do, they unlock more content!). Turning off the curses for the towers and the after-enemy-death meteors especially helps de-escalate the red circles a ton, but those are mandatory too.

The problem on top of this is the clearly poorly balanced material farming rates. You have to have curse maxed out to even see the high tier ones, but also the lowest 1-2 tier materials are what you need the most of by a landslide. Spending 10-15 minutes per run farming to get 1/6 of the material needed to craft 1 weapon for 1 character is nonsense, and that's WITH the high level rune to increase material rate by 50%. So you're rerunning the same 1 map 6-7 times in a row with the same runes, same curse, same build, because anything else might slow you down, and you get to unlock 1 of dozens of weapons (more of which are coming). I know I've highlighted this (and some others have posted about it as well) to the devs for months and it's one of the things they just have not acknowledged - apparently they must think it's fun this way, but I don't.

Keep in mind, this is when I had 100% unlocks going into a new patch, with abundant materials leftover from playing each of the new weapons, and I still fell short of literally every new weapon released. I have almost 60 hours in from the initial release and It'd take me probably another 10 of dedicated grinding, no actual variety, to unlock the rest of the weapons in the game as of this post. 

The REQUIRED highest tier of difficulties need to be reworked to be more interesting and interactive, and the material rates (or costs) need to be overhauled badly. Those two changes would make me put this in the ""recommend"" but right now it actually feels like a bullet heaven that doesn't respect your time, it almost feels GaaS-like in the grind requirements, and frankly? F that. This genre is great because in 10-30 minutes you can have a whole fun experiment and then do it again, Soulstone Survivors asks ""what if you didn't actually get to do that?"" and the answer is, it gets boring fast.",1695349466,1695349466,False,79,1,0.842961609363555908,0,True,False,True

A huge skill tree and loads of achievements keep the game interesting and a (basic) crafting option unlocks new weapons with new skills for each class.

Craftable weapons? - yeah, different icons, but same stuff, out of some 80 weapons, there are only 4-5 actually different ones.

I have to give the developers kudos for such an interesting game. When I first started playing the game it seemed to be just another shoot-em-up. However, the more that I play it I find myself pleasantly surprised at the depths and challenges available. There are some strategies that can help the character, but none of them are guaranteed to work the same on the next go-around.

Thankfully, this game is quite suited for any number multiple plays and I find this an excellent feature. Just a fabulous job by the developers. I hope the sequel is just as enjoyable.

-Enemy health gets into millions,billions, trillions, and etc.

I don't want to say Vampire Survivor like because there is so much more going on in this than Vampire Survivor. I don't really care for the unlocking of different characters though. Some of them unlock from achievements, I guess, and others you unlock from gems? I'm not 100% on how they all get unlocked, but one way or the other would be a lot better than having to do both. 

I will say getting the achievements feels rewarding. I just did an infinite run with the Paladin and got a BUNCH of achievements when I finished and it felt good. So this game will give you that dopamine hit you are looking for. I will say, if you have epilepsy, or suffer from seizures, this game is probably NOT for you lol. On the infinite style runs the weapons get wild in how they activate. I couldn't even keep track of what was going on lol. I had so many things flying out of me, into me, onto them, most of them just laid on the ground lol.

The amount of customisation has been surprisingly good, and the variety of skills, characters and mechanics implemented, along with the runes, additional weapons, and curses has given me plenty of replayability. The action is fast paced, but not overly punishing (although it can get a bit annoying at higher curse levels), and the levels are targeted at a 10-15 minute completion time (typically), which makes it easy to pick up, play, and then move on when you haven't got a huge amount of time to spend.

The additional content being added has been a delightful surprise and very enjoyable, and while the experience isn't 100% bug free, I think that in  my ~80 hours /played, I've maybe run into a couple bugs that were in any way noticeable? If there were more, I'm drawing a blank on them.

My one biggest complaint with the game is that of visual overload due to spell animations, which you can address using a slider under graphics settings to make special effects more transparent. The biggest problem there, I find, is that with high multicast and AoE levels, you basically have to make spell effects entirely transparent if you want to be able to see what's going on. Ideally, I would love to see a dynamic transparency option added (making effects more transparent according to how many there are) because I feel like having all of my spells being invisible to me for the sake of playability really makes them feel less impactful (but I do appreciate having the control to do so-- definitely not sorry that it's an option).",1694362205,1694362205,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It reaches a point where there's too much stuff going on screen and you can't tell what's what anymore (I've already played around with the settings to reduce effects). I have died several times to exploding goblins (that I couldn't see) that push me into a boss' aoe attack, and since attack and movement speeds of enemies keep increasing it reaches a point where you just can't do anything about it. The grind for minor soulstones (main currency) is real too, my characters are leveling far faster than the currency I get after completing a round. This wouldn't be a big deal if there were a lot of stages to play on but there's only a handful, making things rather repetitive. The skill tree is also pretty boring, it consists of stuff like ""increase critical damage by x%"" or ""increase cast frequency by x%"". The lack of rune loadouts is rather confusing, runes can be a pretty powerful mechanic and each character has access to different weapons with different pros and cons so it would make sense some runes go better with certain weapons than others.

Game definitely needs some more polish, I'll keep playing a bit since I can't refund it anymore but I do think it's best to wait for a few more months as of writing this review to buy it.

EDIT (after frostborn wrath release)

They've somewhat improved visuals by allowing folks to tweak certain things, all of my other complaints are still valid though. I tried out the new update but after a match I got bored. I feel like there are other similar games that do this genre better. Still don't recommend this game.

The first of this genre to do it in full. I truly can't believe it, and am incredibly excited for this. They've shattered the meta of these survivor games. Truly, this gem is now fully cut and ready for sale. And the team is only planning to polish it even further. Good on them for doing that for this fantastic game!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I really want to recommend this game because it's an absolute gem. The reason I can't, is because there is no way to know how many skills are in this game. I want to know what skill belongs to what types before I go on a run so I can theory craft and create builds or try new things out that I haven't before. Only way to do that? Either take about 500 screenshots of every single skill and flip through that insanely large album of photos or memorize every single skill and typing. This information is all in the game already because it's there on the skill select screen. 

Is it really so hard to let us see what skills exist and what categories they belong to? That's literally all this game needs to set itself apart because no games in this genre do it, which is INSANE.",1693674414,1694241589,True,0,0,0.458333343267440796,0,True,False,True

- Please Add Spells catalogue/Pokedex with option to filter by types and search by name. Probably No.1 QoL change for me. - ADDED ON ALPHA, THANK YOU!
- Beastiary would be cool, to see stats/abilities/weaknesses of enemies, as we discover them.
- Characters need more weapons. Most resources are being completely unused at the moment. Maybe some sort of upgrading system here? Seems too basic in current form, could go many directions. - ADDED
- Runes system. It seems to be the ""end-game"" features, as is locked behind a bit of a grind. However, it feels not impactful. There's literally few cool runes, where vast majority is boring copy-paste with barely any impact on the game. Honestly, re-design the whole runes system. But if you have to keep it in the similar format, please make runes more interesting. Maybe make each take 1 slot, where you have max 3-5 slots. Balance the runes out, get rid of boring ones. Add some potential synergies for builds into runes. Something like that.
- Skill Tree. Uh oh... I'm a huge Ability/Skill/Talent Tree enjoyer, but not the one in this game. It does not give any flexibility, it's literally ""grind, unlock and forget"". Make real trees, with points limit, so you cant have everything. Also, make some checkpoints within each tree, so mixing could be an option. Overall, the tree in its current form is rather a grind-it-out bar, than a Skill Tree. Feels unnecessary, a bit confusing too. CORRECTED NICELY
- Achievements, so the real progressing in this game. Spells/runes slots and characters unlocking via the Achievement system is ok. 

Summarizing, the gameplay, modes, curses and difficulty is on point. Game is fluid, responsive, addictive, it's good. Progression and personalisation systems however, seems a bit out of place. I feel like there's no room for theorycrafting, outside of abilities combo (which is pretty much random ingame). Gamers love theorycrafting.With impactful Runes, flexible Talent Tree, more weapons and customisation, game would be insanely good. (Spells catalogue is top priority tho).

Much from my feedback list has already been added/corrected. I can't say a bad word about the game nor the dev/s.

However, not the case with this game, really wish i came across this one sooner, by FAR the best one. So much content with different ways of building characters, combining skills, runes, traits, maps, chaos modifiers, etc.

unfortunately the gameplay devolves into a mess once you get to higher curse levels.

your area/range becomes so huge that your spells take up the entire screen. and performance slows to a crawl unless you turn the spell effects way down (or off). you're pumping out billions of damage but you can't really tell what's happening. the result is that every class starts to feel the same, and the game turns into 'dodge the red circle simulator'

My only quip so far is that your power-ups do not display the total chance of applying a certain de-buff (if i have 3 common, 1 uncommon, and 3 rare upgrades that all give a certain percent chance to apply a de-buff, they stay separate instead of merging into one icon that gives the total chance of de-buff). having power-ups do this would greatly decrease the amount of screen taken up by upgrades late game.",1693446650,1693446650,True,9,0,0.613974809646606445,0,True,False,True

You find out (but just at the end of your run - oh great design choice there) that one ability deals -way- more damage than others. One example is golem. Is the reason your particular build? NO (there is no particular build in this game) - golem will simply always do a lot of damage. Will also keep many mobs and bosses busy - so is a no brainer - you pick golem u are in for the long run.

Very easily (and I mean very easily) you will find yourself just running around with pumped stats (huge aoes, extreme fast spamming, applying poison, fire, frail, frost, doom, and many many other effects which do not really matter). Can you say it feels good? Can you say you feel that choosing frost over poison made a difference? Not really - you haven't really contributed to this steroid build, except maybe you avoided choosing bad when leveling up (where often, not always but too often, have a choice between really strong buffs with minor ones)

And then you might die in just one boss hit :)) And what I mean by that is I was choosing repeat at the end of the level and did that 3 times. I was on my 4th repeat. My barbarian had his first attack bigger than my screen and was spinning faster than ice skaters are doing air pirouettes. Fast as a Formula 1 car. Spells were huge, I was bombarding mobs way better than russians bombed Mariopol, if you know what I mean. A boss hit and I was dead - :))

Design is far from being thorough, where careful choice matter. Another cheap design choice is the 'invitation' to grind hours long  to upgrade your characters and stats (no joke here, it seems it will take literally take a huge amount of hours to upgrade your characters). Characters which always end up playing the same - a frantic move around and do nothing else except maybe trying to see between your spells you cast 20 times per second.

Go Vampire Survivors or Halls of Torment if you like this stuff. Way better

Long Version - First things first, I gotta say that the soundtrack really slaps in this game, particularly on the whispering grove. It's got a very unique sound to it and I am here for it. 

The game is pretty simple, you auto attack while mainly focusing on movement control and sometimes directional attacks, but there is an option to auto-aim at the nearest enemy to allow you to just focus on movement which is a pretty nice accessibility feature, although I still prefer manual aim myself.

The different skills from the different schools are very interesting and the fact you can use runes and the level up system and different weapon choices allow for a wide variety and mish mash of playstyles with all the different heroes! You want to be a necromancer houndmaster? Go right ahead! You wanna be a wizard barbarian? Ponder your Orb and Master the arcane you wonderful savage, you! Want to be a mage that beats people with your stick? Well.. do I have news for you! There are all sorts of wonderful builds you can make work, and its up to you to find the playstyle that suits you.

There is quite a bit of content and well worth the $10 investment and the game is still in early access stages. I can't wait to see more!

The only complaint I really had was the screen would get cluttered with visual effects from all the abilities constantly going off and making it where I couldn't see the markers on the ground to dodge, but unlike some other games this one has a handy dandy setting that lets you shift the transparency of abilities to make it easier to see the ground markers. You can even practically make the abilities invisible if you so choose, but I've found a happy medium at around 70-75% of the slider where I still see the spectacular visuals, but can also see the ground markers.

What sort of kills it for me it's the lack of class coherence. 
Why am i a Pyromancer who's best build is lightning.. a frostbolt spamming archer, a golem summoning assassin (funny enough this one is absolutely necessary if you want to play the assassin at all).
Why have classes at all if you are not forced or at least incentivised towards class specific themes. How does a bit more damage, crit and area of effect designate me as a ""pyromancer"".

Bringing the classes more in line with their theme would in my opinion both reduce RNG/ skill pool bloat, And visual strain on the eyes (by at least having mostly the same colors on the screen.

Everyone being a ""rainbow"" is not my thing.

Tons of new skills to unlock as well as passive stats to unlock for about 8 characters at the moment, with all characters to receive them eventually through updates. I would say at this point the price is fair due to these additions which allow much more progression to work towards.

Overall the game is fun - maybe a bit over priced at the moment. There is lots of characters and achievements, and the runes are OK but I feel the meta progression overall is a bit lacking.

You'll have almost all the meta skills maxed in ~10-15 hours and from there it's just down to achievement grinding to unlock the remaining runes and characters/weapons.
The unlocks are great but the power increase seems to stop too soon since you can max out the skill levels fairly quickly. Adding more meta skills to work towards would be very welcomed, especially since there's a lot of grinding character ranks to unlock the remaining things, which feels too repetitive knowing you're as powerful as you're going to get from then on apart from some good RNG skill rolls during a match.

Yes it's early access and more will be added, I just think $5-$6 is a fairer price for where the game is currently at. It's still fun though and I enjoy it overall so I will recommend it.",1668273526,1692702695,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,True

The scaling of your own power can go crazy high to the point where your abilities have full uptime and span across your entire screen, almost every run on max chaos will devolve into this, but I view that as a major upside, it actually feels like you are getting stronger and evolving as a run goes on, and obviously to combat this the enemies have to scale just as hard. Keeping in mind, the game only becomes a bullet hell on the hardest of difficulties, so if people dont like that, they should probably not play on the hardest difficulty. Speaking of which I have even seen people say that you can only play a select number of builds as on the higher difficulty its not possible to use other stuff, but that is a flat out lie lol. To get every characters weapons and levels in the hundreds Ive played every different ability and build possible MULTIPLE times, and never once did I feel like I had to play anything specific on the maximum difficulty.

In conclusion, I eagerly await future updates and think not only the scaling feels rewarding and fair for both player and enemies, but also really enjoy not feeling like I ever have to play one specific build and had plenty of content to unlock before I ever ran out of stuff to do.",1692585417,1692585417,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

After about ten hours you will hit a wall. Smithing requirements are insane for weapons after the first couple, and the gameplay loop becomes seriously stale once you reach higher curse levels.

It is hard to get a truly good run off of the ground due to the excessive amount of abilities that are in the game. I love abilities as much as the next guy but when the same card comes in 5 different types of rarity (common, uncommon, rare, epic, legendary) for each individual type of upgrade it could possibly have (attack speed, damage, range, multicast) then those upgrade types only benefit certain types of cards which could be anywhere from just one card to any cards that have the frontal tag or the shadow tag etc.... it makes getting a truly good run off the ground incredibly difficult.You have to pray for good RNG and there is nothing you can do about it. I unlocked all of the banishes and the rerolls but its just not enough. I still enjoy the game as it is fun even with the frustration that I am feeling but I wouldn't currently tell one of my friends to buy it so I can't say I recommend it.

Updated on 8/19/2023

While many of my former complaints still stand I can now say that the latest update has changed my opinion on this game.

It is very grindy, and gets old (at least to me, YMMV) long before reaching the end of the content, but I feel I got my entertainment buck out of it. The early stages and unlocks are pretty fun, a twist in this game is that, even though you have plenty of auto-aim and AoE weapons to choose from, you can also manually aim directional weapons making it a twin-stick shooter hybrid. 
You also have the ability to dodge for a couple i-frames which seems like a fun addition. More advanced enemies have telegraphed attacks indicated by danger markers, and you need to use your dodges to escape these danger zones quickly. Also the game is well-optimized, so slow-down/frame drops are less common in this game than many others like it, despite being 3D instead of sprite-based. So that's all good. 

There are class skills to unlock which make each character more powerful and more distinctive in playstyle. As you start to level up your classes, you will need materials you can only obtain by turning up the ""curse"" level (difficulty modifiers).
Past a certain point, the difficulty became less of a challenge and more of a tedium, sessions stretches from the cozy ~10 minutes of the earlier game into half hour slogs. The ground becomes basically lava from all the area attacks and without the right builds, you can barely even approach the bosses to land hits. 

Some other complaints might be the menu system is kinda messy and hard to navigate, the music while not terrible is almost hypnotically repetitive and boring which is not a good fit, some of the class abilities are basically worthless at higher levels. Despite all the enemies on screen, the game feels slow-paced.

At this point it's a game I'll pick up every day or two still to kill some time, but the novelty has worn off. That should be expected of most any game though, I'd say 50+ hours of cheap, mindless entertainment is more than reasonable for the price. If you really like this type of game though, there's a lot more content than that, probably at least twice as much so far, with more updates coming, at the time of this review.",1692414321,1692414321,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The devs pride themselves on how many abilities there are in the game, but the vast majority of them aren't playable at higher difficulties. 

What's more, difficulty is scaled by just increasing the number of attacks that are being thrown at you, so lategame consists of spamming the dodge button as much as you can and increasing your range to try to damage enemies that you can't actually afford to approach. 

This rules out about half the characters from being competitive. The actual endgame meta strat for a lot of characters is to use a rune that gives them abilities of other characters to make them playable.

Editing this later to say that the devs are releasing another, different game while this one is still in early access. HIGHLY recommend that you avoid, it's obvious they have no intention of fixing this game's issues. You'll get a few hours out of it and then realize it's a shallow cash grab that they've moved on from.",1679978061,1692307903,False,3,0,0.531832575798034668,0,True,False,True

Comparatively, price tag is too high for an early access, hence unfinished mess of a game.

Death knight is by far the best character because he allows you to ditch the dodge mechanic.
I hate bumping into the environment trying to dodge, some designs are misleading with big invisible walls around them. Some runes ask you to stay still to build damage but many early curses plague you with constant AoEs bumping you around. 

At some point, all builds become alike since you'll just be applying a bazillion debuffs to stay relevant. Tanking / healing are not a viable options since you'll be almost one shot by most high level bosses. Characters and skills are not balanced at all, summons are busted because they taunt ennemies.

You have to turn off skill graphics to be able to dodge, which is also a big oversight.

I also noticed some bosses attacks match your speed to keep you dodging it so it's better not stack too much of it to keep it manageable.

Overall upgrade costs are too damn high.

This games has potential but needs a massive overhaul. 
Ditch the AoEs, ditch the dodge, put a cap on stats and have less skills to avoid lookalikes.

These games are all $10 or less, and I got them all on sale. (Brotato is on sale for $3.99 at the time of this review).

All of these games provided enough fun to justify their purchase, but the two that stuck out to me were SoulStone Survivors & Yet Another Zombie Survivors.  Both of these games were easier to jump right into and start having fun with.  SoulStone felt like the most polished of the bunch, while YAZS felt like the rawest of the bunch for now, but maybe the most fun and with the best future potential.

Hey, wait for the Steam Fall or Christmas sale, and you could probably pick up all five for $20 or less. (and maybe one or two more).

SSS takes the mechanics from Vampire Survivor and removes the weapon enhancements for a synergy system. Active and Passive Actions have or are associated with characteristic. AA come with different traits such as 'Bomb, Frontal, Magical', then you can associate a bunch of PA to those traits, specifically or through a character trait i.e Bomb, Frontal, Magical. 

The whole system becomes convoluted as you attempt to weave in Core stats, Attack, Speed, MultiCast, Cast Speed, Armor, Crit rate, Crit Multiplier....., into your build. Game play plateaus when you hit level 40 at which point you are just kiting things as you get caught on the poor level design.

There are 4 levels right now, each classically skinned to be desert, snow, forest and mines. None of these levels really stand out and the only real reason to chose a level is for when you need to farm materials to upgrade a character's weapon. There are something like 13 different classes, each one with their own unique set of abilities that get added to the core ability pool. For the most part they all play the same, they only real difference are the the starting buffs and debuffs.  Which become easily compensated through leveling. 

Games like these are more of a time waster than anything, but  SSS is fun for the first hour. Unfortunately that fun levels off quickly. If your not into currency grinding you probably want to pass on this game. If you are in to currency grinding and unlocking you may want to pass on this game as well. There is no reliable way to do an endless run. Most times you beat a level and are told to 'Return', but which they mean the main menu. 

My summary, The game starts off promising but offers no reliable way for the game to evolve with the player. Do to the game's experiencing capping out rather early I can only hope they address the game in a way they simplifies things while making the overall more intuitive and challenging, something that will make want to be invested in it. SSS in its current stage is a glorified Idle game; and becomes something to look at when you need to kill some time.

+ Every achievement in the game has been completed for me bar a few weapon unlocks within 70 hours of gameplay, that is more than acceptable considering its price of $13 CAD.

+ Rune unlocks were unique and fun to strive towards.

- Upon beating Curse VII on each map, game became very repetitive / redundant material farming spree, even with the 50% bonus material rune on each character
- Specific talent point trees for characters is fun, but an expanded generic talent tree would be more compelling and allow for more build specific investment
- Chaos Golem / Moose minions, pulling aggro from bosses makes the game a cake walk and I was frequently able to complete Curse VII runs on level 1 prestige characters while trying to unlock all achievements.

A run can end as soon as you want, since the goal is'nt time-based, it's kill-based.
The skilltree is really interesting, especially after unlocking further options.

And my absolute favourite part is, that each run ""tells a story"".
Dependend on which char you play, you get different active skills to choose from, and with runes and what not, you can create a very specific skillset.
And every single run I did so far was completely unique and got stuck in my head.

It ranged from running super fast while slashing enormous swords around to a char who applied with every skill a huge chunk of debuffs.
Or the bomb-flinging archer.
Or the pyromancer, who did a mix of fire and poison.

You can create so many ""roleplay chars"", which maybe don't deal the optimal amount of damage, but they are still good enough to carry you far and are extremely fun to play.
I can't stress enough hoch much I love the uniqueness of each char and run.

Another big plus is, that there is basically no contact damage.
Only one enemy, which is a suicide bomber, explodes on contant.
If you play well enough and have the dodging skill (your own, not in-game), you can get really far without getting harmed.

Big downside: The fun really begins after you had one or two god-runs, before that it is a slog. This can be improved greatly, and easily. The first few runs need to feel fun, not like ""okay i need 5 more like this to unlock the first thing"".

Other personal gripe, the first level in each run should come much faster. It takes almost a minute to reach level2-3, and even then, getting another ability is not guaranteed so it doesn't help the beginning feel good.

But besides those points, the game is great, and really has a lot of depth. I am just sad that it tends to act as a filter to most people given how boring the beginning is (of both runs, and savefile). In the (now flooded) market of vampire-survivors-like, the first runs are decisive as to wether or not people will stay, this has to be improved here.

Things I liked:
- You can aim your attacks (this is huge for me because it feels less like an idle game and more like you have actual control over your attacks.)
- A LOT of variety in builds (They are not all viable but it makes for some really interesting and fun build combos. Can access more abilities/skills as you level for each class to have access to.)
- A decent amount of characters to unlock (I think 14 at the moment and each has a different starting ability, 2-3 weapons each to unlock which change their starting ability, and have access to different pool of level up abilities that can be unlocked for the rest of your classes as you play.)
- A skill tree and runes (Skill tree affects ALL of your characters but the runes allow you to fine tune each class  and even allows them access to other classes level up ability pools.)

Things I did not like:
- Screen can get TOO busy (Some of your abilities are so big they hide enemy red circles and even enemies not killed by said abilities. There can be a LOT of your own abilities ALL going off at the same time and so it hides things in front and/or around your character.)
- Enemies spawning under and next to you (There is no player character zone that enemies cannot spawn into. I've had enemies spawn behind me and block me from moving. Would be a real QoL to have a player character zone that enemies can't spawn into.)
- Bosses with insanely long range attacks (The boss won't even be visible on your screen but you'll see their red attack box up to 2 screens away.)",1691158696,1691160538,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

it just doesn't scale you to match the enemies when the bosses have 7x their normal health and you get 5% more damage if your lucky hope it gets better cause its just not fun after a few hours...

Edit 
they've made it so there can only be up to five bosses at a time which is a massive improvement
however its still really irritating to get killed because the floor is a hazard due to you fighting 3 different poison bosses 
and i do still wish there were more skills to get because having nothing to do with your currency but wait til the next update is obnoxious 
overall its a lot better and I'm sure in a few updates ill be changing this review again to a more positive tone

Edit Edit 
I said i'd come back to change it to a more positive one and i have due to the new class uniqueness implementations its become substantially better to play the game on higher difficulties so long as you're leveled enough.",1670394105,1691157313,True,0,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,True

The game is currently in Early Access, however, it feels extremely solid. No major UI or graphical issues and it supports 21:9 out of the box. The game features a ""Class Ascension"" system which allows some of the classes in the game to have a ""pseudo"" subclass during normal gameplay. It features an extensive skill tree & perk system (runes), and much more. I have only made it to roughly the halfway point, however, the game features a lot of replay-ability and it seems that achievement hunting in this title will not be an absolute chore. 

In terms of gameplay it diverges in the way the main gameplay loop functions. Instead of it being time based (e.g: Vampire Survivors, Halls of Torment, etc) it goes based on kills. Once ""X"" amount of kills has been achieved a boss will be summoned. Progressing in this manner will eventually give the player the option to end the round, continue on infinitely with mobs scaling higher and higher, or enter overlord mode where the bosses get even stronger and more spawn at once. Overall a very solid and rewarding gameplay loop. In addition, the game also features a ""curse"" system. This allows the player the opportunity to earn unique crafting materials, additional exp, and more at the cost of increased difficulty. 

Moving on, the character identity and progression system is extremely well done. The ""general"" skill tree is easy enough to follow and fill out while offering the player generic upgrades such as: more damage, crit chance, health, etc. Where the game truly shines, however, is in the ""Class Ascension"" portion of the skill tree for select characters. This allows these characters to have a whole ability that occurs during regular gameplay and essentially ""unlocks"" a new subclass for them. The perks are well thought and you can feel your characters power grow between matches. Furthermore, the Rune system (which is this games perk system) is rather creative and can allow for some unique gameplay differences across matches. I thoroughly enjoy the fact the game rewards players for ranking up and unlocking the different characters and their weapons. This directly unlocks new abilities for all characters in matches & new runes to select. 

In terms of the playable characters each are unique in both their identity, weapon choices, and overall skills. You can further refine this with rune selections to make some off the wall builds. Each character has a nice selection of ""generic"" abilities and ""skill"" abilities. Some are reskins of others, however, this does not bother me too much. I also like that each character has different stat allocations. E.g: More health, less movement speed, etc. Overall, I really enjoy the variety and none of the classes so far have felt too ""samey"".

In terms of overall content you will be hard pressed to find a better deal for the amount you receive. I have been playing over 40+ hours and I am still making my way through the multiple levels of curses, character weapons, and so on. So far the game feels incredibly feature complete which is shocking in today's gaming environment. I briefly mentioned earlier, that achievement hunting in this game feels natural and doesn't involve the player completely going out of their way or bashing their head. 

Now moving on to things I dislike:

The music in my opinion is awful. I know this is purely subjective but it just feels extremely repetitive and out of place for a game like this. I found myself turning the music completely off and playing something more exciting and thrilling in its place. Would love to see more music options down the road. 

The gameplay is fantastic and graphically it looks incredible, however, the game requires a machine at times to run. In the later levels or with your graphics maxed out you will realize how CPU / GPU intensive this game is as it tries to load all the mobs, their effects, your effects, and so on. I found that at times I had to bump the visible spell setting slider down just to finish more intensive matches which is a shame. The spell effects are put of the fun of this genre and I hope the developers can figure out a system to allow multiple spell effects to exist without chunking FPS.

Due to the infinite scaling nature of the game you will eventually reach a point where the bosses or mobs will straight up one shot you. I do not have a problem with this normally, however, in the higher difficulties there is so much ground clutter / boss ability spam that the whole level is covered in red and you are constantly spamming the space bar just to survive. Hopefully the mob / boss ability spam will be toned down in the future and just made to hit harder as a compensation. This would not only improve the overall gameplay experience but allow the game to run smoother also. 

To conclude, I absolutely believe that Soulstone Survivors is worth the price they are asking for. The game seems to have active and knowledgeable developers who care for the game and want to see it get better (this much is apparent from the most recent update). The main gameplay loop is extremely fun and fluid with unique characters for whatever play style you are looking for.  The game features an indepth perk system and skill tree system adds even more replayability to the title. Where the game suffers in my opinion is the music being repetitive and out of place, the higher level curses / levels where the ground is littered in enemy abilities, and finally being CPU and GPU intensive during higher levels of gameplay. If the developers improve the last two issues -- I would have no hesitation giving this game a 9.5/10.

TL;DR: Worth the price, however, it is a solid 7.5/10 due to certain issues found in higher levels coupled with the fact it is so graphically demanding that it requires the user to make on the fly spell effect / graphic adjustments just to complete a level.",1691070841,1691070841,True,6,0,0.595959007740020752,0,True,False,True

The game is fairly fun. There are a lot of skills and the addition of character-specific passive trees is nice. The grind for new weapons is kind of awful. Many of them require loads of common resources that aren't as abundant as you'd like. Which means that it can take 5-10 runs on the same map just for a new weapon. Additionally, some of the characters have a custom ability that requires you to stand or move into specific areas. That would be great, but at higher curse levels, it's not viable. Gameplay is still built around high mobility, so anything that strips that from you turns into high risk, mediocre reward.

Don't get me wrong, the game is getting a lot better, but I'd give it a mixed review if possible. It's fun, but has some core issues.

Old: 
The game is very... okay. There are a lot of skills and characters that give you options for builds, but so many builds aren't exactly viable, especially at higher curse levels. The game is clearly built around high mobility, which is fine, but the biggest problem is that as you increase your curse level, enemies have massive AoE attacks that feel borderline impossible to dodge. As someone who has nearly every achievement, I can tell you that it's not impossible to do, but it stops being fun when you almost feel punished for doing the objective (e.g. Killing towers that launch attacks requires you to stay in a small area that will be bombarded enough that it will kill you. Do you choose to take damage, or ignore the tower knowing that more towers are on their way?).

The game has a lot of potential, but there's something about it that just isn't as fun as other competitors on the market.",1677604865,1690900805,True,0,0,0.555419504642486572,0,True,False,True

That said, the game has class balance issues(beyond even the advanced class system, which at this point in time benefits only half the available characters) that become very apparent in the late game. Some struggle to kill boss waves faster than the new ones appear and are heavily reliant on either summons or good RNG to do well, while others let you almost sleepwalk through the game even if you get bad rolls. While further class updates are likely to address this, at the moment this is the situation.

The last noteworthy thing to point out is that once you are late into a match and the whole screen is drowning in spells and enemies, the game has a tendency to bring your FPS to its knees. The commonly suggested solution of hiding damage numbers and health bars has, at least in my case, very minimal impact.

Cons - Visual clarity. Game quickly becomes very difficult to see anything as explosions and effects get much larger. Desperately needs an effects particle density slider. Balance. Balance is all over the place. Not necessarily a bad thing as it's kind of fun trying different builds.

Yeap, you guessed it correct. 
I'm talking about what every other person gave a thumbs down for; game simply forces you to play a dodge simulator... No matter how strong your build has become.

You can clear an entire screen? 
No problem; I throw you some red dots from offscreen enemies which you cannot see.

You can clear two screens? 
No problem; I've already sent you an undamageble reaper from the very start so move your lazy arse and work!

Also, shortly after some progress you **HAVE TO** turn of your animations and this is a big one because it takes all the satisfaction of your ZoomZoom build. I mean seriously, who thought people would enjoy that?

Edit: Game also has one of biggest design flaws I expect from the genre... *I'll punish you for getting stronger*. If you get movement speed to escape from red dots, they become increasingly harder to dodge, casting faster and punishes you for getting movement speed. You won't get the feeling of getting stronger and stomping around but you will feel the game tries really hard to keep you in check.",1690280715,1690301617,False,10,0,0.599776029586791992,0,True,False,True

good:
seems well optimized. interesting ""quests"" on maps. dash mechanic makes gameplay engaging.

bad:
becomes too repetitive way too quickly, attacks/skills and upgrades are boring and too similar. permanent upgrades make very little difference. hardly any reason to adjust playstyle so grinding for upgrades is even less fun. later into runs the visual effects of attacks/skills take up so much screenspace it becomes impossible to see enemies and threats. with that, runs are ended by being pushed into a boss attack by an exploding goblin which you cannot see because of all the effects. sound effects are lacking, some satisfying sfx when hitting enemies would make a big difference imo. this is subjective but I'm not a big fan of music.

there's potential here but personally I don't see the developers making this many large adjustments/improvements this far into development to give me reason to change this into a positive review.",1689985244,1690046757,False,2,0,0.474868953227996826,0,True,False,True

In its current state, at higher curse levels, it becomes a [i]'the floor is lava'[/i] game. It's essentially a dodging simulator. There are so many AoE markers going off from enemy attacks that you're constantly on the back foot running for your life. It was fun for a while, but now it's just monotonous.

It's the same with your own skills, which is made substantially worse with how the game scales. During a long run you'll get to a point where you've accumulated so much cast frequency/area(AoE) & multi cast chance modifiers that your spells will eventually cover your entire screen, essentially becoming a photosensitive epilepsy inducing headache. This brings me to my next point:

There's a setting in-game which allows you to lower the transparency of all skills. For me, this was lowered as far it would go as soon as I got to a point where the game became a seizure simulator, which wasn't long at all. Maybe an hour or two. I haven't turned it back up as higher curse levels pretty much require you to have this lowered as far as it will go if you want to see anything at all. 

I assume it's the same for most players. This means I, & I'm assuming a lot of other players, probably don't even know what the majority of skills look like? I know I don't. What's the point of going through the process of designing all of these cool looking skills if most players won't even be able to experience & appreciate them? Seems kind of pointless.

So, Game Smithing Limited. If you read this, tone down all the bullshit by about ~75%. It does not scale well in higher curse levels.

Most of my arguments are still valid and I still don't see a real point to go up un curses if not to farm/craft weapons that are almost always underwhelming, add passive skills (that are too long to farm and underwhelming too) or getting the unlocks or discovering new characters (that are all kinda the same with different skillset that you can use but not enough distinction between the way you play them imo).

However I must admit that the game is a huge blast in higher difficulties, incredibly hectic and fun. The amazing and on point soundtrack helps too. Though very very punishing when above 35 or something curses. And very demanding for the computer.
I also feel like there lacks a bit of balancing and I always tend to do pretty much the same builds and avoid a good third or more of the skills. Still feel like the build possibilities anddepth are too few and shallow but I concead it is not the easiest thing to do.

My main complaint is that the game is wayyy to farmy and there is nothing pushing me hard enough to play and farm (gets repetitive and I think once I'll have done all the maps in top difficulty I'll just stop and never farm for runes or passive skills or weapons, I just don't care).

Overall, it's still a lot of fun and I will get a good 30h out of this EA and surely at least 10 more out of the complete release. While I do have problems with the core mechanics of the game, if I cen enjoy it for a good 40/50h and then play it every so often, I'd say it was a good deal.
I do very much recommend it and recommend to quickly go and up the curses, the game will be more fun then. It's actually maybe the VS I had the most fun on. Not as polished as Brotato or even HoT but a lot of fun and more dynamic than any VS I've ever played when lots od curses.

Old review:
First off, it's definitely the most visually impressive VS like out there in my opinion. But it does require a much better configuration than most to run properly, especially when lots of mobs start to spawn and in endgame when everything is exploding everywhere. Little problem being that there does not seem to be a very wide gap in performance between low and high settings. So if you don't have a decent config forget it.

Now for the game itself. The simple fact that it can go so far in terms of build and make you feel like the god of death like no other VS makes it worth trying. The first few runs are super fun. Now, there are quite a few problems.

First off, the game might be too easy. My very first run was like 45 minutes long (I finished and looped once and died in loop 2 in overlord mode I believe). My second longer and my third too long (like 70/75 minutes and 5 or 6 loops (not in overlord) or something). And each loop only seems to scale the ennemies up in terms of damage/health. Does not add anything. So my third run and it's several loops was tideaous to say the least. There are ways to make the game more difficult (curses) but the bonus those give seems not that interesting and the difficulty is mostly just changes in stats (bonuses for ennemies and downgrades for you), not a lot of fun/creativity imo.

Then there is prestige/leveling and crafting system (very basic, to make better weapons for each character), and also a rune system. Those are the elements supposed to make you want to play more but honestly they're not enough. There is also the argument of the many characters, and while it's great there is such diversity they kind off feel the same, even tought they don't all have access to the same kind of skills, there are still always a few very similar characters. You probably won't have that feel of a dramatically different gameplay between the different classes like you could have on brotato.

The leveling system is also a bit strange. You can choose between three distinct traits that can have different levels of rarity (common, uncommon, rare, epic and legendary). But honestly, I feel like the rarest option is the best in 95% of the cases, making this good on paper concept pretty shallow. The trait and build system lacks depth and synergies imo tbh. But I'm pretty harsh because it does have quite a lot of diversity from what I've seen. But like the big number of characters and skills, I'm afraid they've gone for quantity over quality and game feel.

In conclusion, it's good and I'll probably play some more, especially when the full release is out, but I'm scared of the tideous aspect of the game. A shame because everything is quite good on surface level (graphics and art direction are great, musics are great too but far too few, base gameplay and build possibilities are amazing...).

Would still recommend to give it a try if you enjoy the genre and have the money. For the others, I would wait for full release and observe what the reviews say then (concerning the repetitive and shallow feel of the game)",1689206950,1689885967,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

- there is an option in the menue to reduce you skill effects visibility. so many games need this, pravo to the developer for having this QOL feature. also damage numbers etc. its a simple menue that has all you want / need. you dont need to save either, just pick and go on. 

- you have quick fun and long term motivation. more: characters, runes, skilltree abilities, weapons for cahracters and curse levels to progress and access. some are quick, some are grindy. all feel kinda worth. 

- a couple areas with some mini easter eggs (kill certain stuff in certain areas etc.)

- the upgrades you get in each run have nice sync and are thought through. for example crit over 100% has an additional chance to crit (aka 120% crit chance has 100 chance to crit and 20% chance to crit twice). ""chance to apply an effect"" (like burn, poison, slow, etc.) also stacks endlessly because the chance to apply it stays the same but the AMOUNT of stacks you apply increases. BTW dots (like poison) unlike in POE for example, CAN crit. 

- the graphics arent a pixel mess or depressing grey-style. love it. 

- bosses , elites and even trash mobs :D have some decent ability sets /targeted abilities that you can and NEED to dodge. its very fair but still requires skill and prevents you from standing still and wondering why you shouldnt afk anyway. there are heal and tank skills though if you wanna force that haha. havend achieved it yet but i think its possible. 
- that said: armor, block chance and multicast chance do have deminishing returns. look up some wiki table if you dont know what i mean. first 100(%) of it gives the most everything above still gives boni but the more you stack, the less you get. you will never reach 100% block or 100% quadriple cast but at the same time it isnt hard capped at 75% or smth like that as in other games. i like the system (not the first time i see it but there are worse options so i praise it). 

conclusion: you wont linger 500 hours in this but its quick fun and lets you come back a couple times if you like the game-type i assume. progressing all perma upgrades takes quite a while if you dont look up turials and stuffs and experiment yourself. (im 21 hours in and have almost all skilltree but i still lack about 95% of the runes / half the characters and ANY weapon upgrades of any characters but the fire guy i ""main"" atm. so there is still a lot of stuff to do. also curse levels im only at 4 out of whatever it was (in some maps only as well). 
also its dirt cheap, just buy if you like the genre (better than the other 5 i played so far. ""bio prototype"" might be better maybe or they are same tier i guess.)

Edit: i finished what i thought was the entire skilltree. little did i know :D there is SO MUCH MORE.

Edit 2: 50 hours in and i feel like its getting a bit boring by now / and or frustrating. why is that? (still a good game, just wanna state whats to improve if that was to avoid)

- if you want to progress you kind of have to stick to one character because playing the others would take very long till you get on the same power-level with their weapons being locked behind resource grind and level caps of the individual characters, runes locked behind achievements, skill tree (besides the core of it) locked behind level (and im talking about lvl 20+ to get at least one point of the prestige skill tree.) as well. this is a bit sad because i kinda wanna try some other characters for some of their individual skills or runes, but i also dont wanna grind them to the same level i have the main char right now and just playing them in low curse feels very disappointing as the rewards are about 200-300% less with rare materials NOT appearing at all. 

- the higher curses spawn more elite monsters AND more bosses. that means you get like 10 elites and 4 bosses simultaniously + some random towers that also spam abilities, resulting in your entire screen (starts on curse 4+ i would say, when the bosses spawn) being painted red with the targeted spells. if you dont have enough movement speed stacked and dashes (sometimes you dont get them as reward) it is literally impossible to dodge stuff (not just hard, im saying impossible). now there are multiple problems in this context:

1. bad run with no extreme upgrades (in either OS damage or getting golems before bosses or getting enough MS or dashes) may result in the run being not hard but impossible. its nice when it gets harder but no matter the RNG you should always be able to do it (if your skill is ""perfect""). upgrades should just make it easier.

2. the golems you can get (some other chars have skeletons for example, that works the same) feel MANDATORY as they take aggro from the mobs around them, letting you actually shoot between dodging, sometimes you can even chill near boss. they dont just cc a lot, they also most often have highest damage of all of my skills. needs balancing. not getting them before the bosses spawn on high curses feels like a ""RIP"" for the run because you either cant dodge now (to much aggro, to little MV / dashes) or cant get enough DPS on them (trashmobs block, you have to dodge so much you cant aim at the bosses, most abilities are either short ranged (even if they penetrate mobs) or have random targeting AND if you dodge to much, kill other enemies (Which you cant prevent) while you do so, the NEXT bosses spawn in as well so if you survived so far thats the furthest you will come with that :D. 

3. i think bosses getting higher cast frequency on higher curse level is not the way to go. its fine if they oneshot me now, or get some new attack patterns or the time window for dodging the abilities (faster cast) gets smaller, but having multiple bosses with insane high cast frequency doesent feel harder, it feels random. somtimes aoe skills dont get shown on the map because its uneven and only half gets colored. sometimes i chainsaw or msth that no longer gets shown on ground is still shot into your direction or is on its way back to the boss who casted it but you have no clue-indication it will. if these are single things in lower curse levels you can look out for them but with multiple bosses AND rares AND high cast freuqency AND towers shooting stuff at you AND ground effects like ice spikes and poison lingering on the ground AND little things blocking your pathing (like palm trees), it gets to clustered to still be related to ""skill"". (IMO)

4. the golems are in one way OP but in the other way also suck. if there are many bosses and they target your many golems, you have no way of knowing where the abilities go to. while you are no longer targeted you get hit by random stray projectiles that may come from any direction at any time and no longer show the red colored indication area beneath them. 

solutions: 
- more different cc abilities that also work on bosses (black hole that clumbs things together for example) 
- nerv golem dps
- fix some of the target indications on the ground that get bugged by terrain level (aoe circles mostly)
- dont increase cast freuency with curse level or reduce the amount of rares/ bosses that spawn. make abilities less often but have more impact, so you have windows of attack and windows of dodge. 
- increase range of piercing projectiles so you can try to not get minions and other cc stuff but stack up on dps spells and dodge yourself, circling FAR around the bosses, piercing everything in your direction, eventually also downing the bosses. 
- give prestige points in general, not char specific. or make the grind feel a bit more woth it /fresher. example: dont let high curses drop low level resources. this gives incentive to grab an unleveld char and play low level to get these specific resources. or make character specific maps with specific mini-features (like different bosses, some ability-related event where you have to do smth specific), etc.

1. Visibility. When you're on overlord mode 3+ (4+ bosses) or with curse 4+ there will be shit tons of enemies and projectiles. You can reduce *your* effect visibility but not the enemies. That makes sense, since I need to see them to dodge them. Still, they make visibility issues. Then there's the big enemies and swarm of small enemies mixed in. It's hard to tell which and where to dodge.

2. Enemy attack warning clarity. 
2a. All enemy attack has the same warning style. Common enemy, elite enemy, bosses. Obviously, you'd want to prioritize dodging boss attacks, then elite, then common enemy. However amidst the chaos, the red warning marks are all you can see. Boss attacks are generally larger, but some elite enemies also have large attack aoe. Then there are boss attacks that throws lots of small projectiles. 
2b. The attack timing sign may be misleading. The attack timing sign does not tell when the attack will reach you. It tells when the enemy will begin the attack. Some attacks like beams will immediately reach the end of the range. Some attacks like spikes and discs travel slowly. Again, among the chaos, the red warning marks are all you can see.
2c. The attack timing sign is unclear when there are a lot of them. The warning stack on top of eachother. The timing is shown by the warning area being redder, usually from the center or the caster end. But when warning stacks on top of each other, it's really hard to tell. They're all just very red circles.

3. Obstacles are sticky. They seem to have very high friction coefficient. When you walk towards bottom left and hit a wall facing right, you'll move downwards very slowly even with high movement speed stat. But okay, that's a wall. But it doesn't happen to just walls. It happens to small obstacles and even enemies. When that happens among the chaos, you'll have to dash because otherwise the attacks you've been dodging my walking would finally hit you. This happens so often because visibility of obstacles are really low among the chaos.

4. FPS drop or stuttering. When it gets too chaotic I'm getting FPS drop or stutter every 15s or so. When that happens I'll have to pause or I'll definitely die. The pause is often late too so sometimes I'm already cornered or just about to take a hit. And I can't see the game state before resuming because pausing darkens the game screen. I wish there were a countdown before the game actually resumes. Sometimes FPS will still drop after resuming (after paused 5 secs or so). 

Old review:
Great. I really like how I can be the overpowered boss here. And I can proceed to next map while keeping my upgrades and be even more powerful. The flashy effects can make it hard to see enemy attacks, but I just found out that you can tune it down in the settings.",1689226703,1689716040,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Very different from a sea of clones in the genre. However, the execution comes down to some of the worst scaling mechanics I have seen in any game. 

Specifically, you can't see anything on the screen without turning off your own damage effects. This turns it into a Jedi mind tricks trainer where you wave your hands around and things die. Funny at first, but once that wears off it looks ridiculous. Even worse than this simple annoyance is the floor is lava simulator. Having ~15 red circles on the screen at all times is not difficulty. It removes the ability to identify priority attacks, enemy types, and to some degree strategy, as the game-play becomes spamming dodges while your Jedi dance moves hopefully thin the herd.

Tons of customization. Can use controller. Over 10 classes and each class has access to different spell categories making them play differently. Can use runes to share skills of certain categories with classes of your choosing. Overall super fun

Negatives: Animations clutter screen, making it super difficult to avoid damage.

Just to point out a few things that need work:
[b]1. This was the most annoying thing in the game. Either this is a bad game design, or it just hasn't been thought out.[/b]
[b]Problem[/b]: Getting stuck behind trees and walls (even seemingly invisible object edges) is why i died 95% of times. 
[b]Solution 1[/b]: if NOT standing right next to the object and using a dash in the direction of the object and dash projected end-point would be over the half of the objects middle point - dash would go though. But if not - dash would hit the object, as it is now. However, the 2nd dash would then go though the object, regardless of how long the dash is. 
[b]Solution 2[/b]: If calculating objects middle point and dashes length seems too complex, when not standing next to the said object and dashing, then at least make it so that dash goes though an object when standing right next to it. if i dash and hit an object, the next dash then goes through the object, regardless of how long the dash is. 

[b]2. Performance needs heavy calculation optimizations.[/b] I read that developers are aware of this, but still - when doing endless, the fps gets real low even on rtx 3090. 
Regardless, you will still die 95% times not because of this, but due to problem number 1 above.

[b]3. Arcane Weaver special skill-tree crystal mechanic is not a good game design[/b] in my opinion. 
[b]Problem[/b]: you have to stand still for a moment to pick up the crystals. Running over the crystals does not pick them up 99% of the times, so i gave up even trying to pick them up eventually. When playing on 48 curse intensity, it's not possible to stand still to pick them up.
[b]Solution[/b]: increase crystal pick up radius, so they can be easily picked up while RUNNING over them, without a need to stop and die senselessly.

[b]4. Need an option to see the outlines (without animation) for player skills, when they are triggered[/b] This would greatly improve visibility, when runs get longer and skill area % greatly increases. When turning off animation visibility to 0% due to visual clutter, it's real hard to tell, how far/wide character skills are, and also hard to guess when they will trigger. 
While on the topic of transparency - there is a bug, when skill transparency is set to 0% - also skill sounds are not played, so you can't tell when the skill would trigger. 

[b]5. Need an option to have red ground hazard elements to show above everything else.[/b] This would greatly improve visibility, when runs get longer.

[b]6. Need skill transparency settings section[/b] where players can set and save a skill transparency slider for every single skill. 

[b]7. Skills need multiple animations depending of how long the skill total area % is.[/b] 
[b]Problem[/b]: when getting further in the runs, skills get so stretched out, they look real bad and you can't see anything.
[b]Solution[/b]: when reaching certain skill area percentage, switch to next skill animation implementation. This means, that each skill needs multiple animations, depending on area%. This could also be used as a solution for not seeing anything when all skill area increases too much, by, for example, making it so that the animations for higher skill area levels are more transparent or by making them less stretched out.

[b]Game is good[/b], don't get me wrong.

Millions of hours of lifetime pulled down to hell. 
This essence of all time consuming addiction, that had been ever thought about at that time, was called Diablo. 
After beaten, and three reinkarnations in different shapes, it came to be, that there was a new war rising.  A war so flawless and fluid as pure Water dripping into a thirsty mouth. 
Leaving behind the slow downs, like walking to get to a Place of action, it took the essence of the essence to claim the throne of addictive efficiency. 
Never again should there be a moment to think about interrupting the consuming of lifetime. Where there has been small chances to get out of the whirlwind of addictive action, in a such short time of relaxing peace and boredom, now there is only addiction left. No compromise no useless time wastes. It keeps people playing and pleeding for more without forcing them only with rewards for boring tasks.

Only critiques are that the visibility of things like danger-areas are completely obscured by spell effects past level 100.

The skill tree is super deep, but WILL take a LOT of play to advance it. Unsure how varied it gets.

Soulstone Survivors is the epitome of an early access game. If you're not all about that beta-testing-the-game-for-free-and-half-the-features-missing, then [b]don't get this game.[/b]

Gameplay-wise, it's a very nice loop and you do hit that serotonin high as you mow down everyone in your way.

This game is big on its legacy element and your character does get a lot stronger the more you play it.

However,
[list]
  [*] Half the features are missing.
  [*] No in game encyclopedia of what does what or what skills you're allowed to have on your character or even what all the skills are. Leaves you guessing most of the time.
  [*] Suffering from too much visual clutter. There's lots of red circles to dodge, but all your skills are very beautifully animated and take away enemy visibility. So you turn down the visuals. Now the game looks super bland, but at least you won't die to something unexpected anymore.
  [*] Stats are unbalanced. There's no reason to take defensive stats because at higher levels, you're going to die in one shot anyway, and ironically, offense is the better defense.

Not much to this game so far, but here is a simple breakdown of what I think makes the base foundation of a great game:

- VERY EASILY ACCESSIBLE, but challenging to master. THIS IS GOOD! 

- CLASS VARIETY and differentiation is fantastic, though I do wish to see more class selection, OR class customization options in the future. 
(im currently messing around with hybrid builds, more on that later)

- REPLAY-ABILITY  is outstanding and the progression through ranks and scenarios is very rewarding. 
(this is one of the few games in my recent experience, that ive felt accomplishment in leveling up)

- SKILLS and ABILITIES are visually amazing, and the design choices behind what skills and powers in the game are well thought out! 

- OST is pretty damn good for a small studio, 

- SOUND EFFECTS are one of the weaker points of the game tbh. Its not the most dynamic when it comes to sound design, so after a while it becomes kind of hard to listen to, but nothing an update or patch cant fix. Also, i put on my own music when going for long sessions anyway, so not a huge deal. 

SO basically, this game is pretty damn cool, and thats not even mentioning the newly released update, which brought in SO many more features and progression system, its pretty cool! Im very happy with my purchase, which I believe was on a steam sale, but honestly I wouldve bought this game at full price, maybe even double, because of how much time ive spent playing already. Its really fun and you wont regret it! 

TO THE DEVS: 

Now this is just a wish list of sorts, just some ideas I thought of while playing that would make this game a classic. Nothing too hard to implement, just some REALLY nice additions IMO. 

1) WE NEED multiplayer! Now I know gamers arent known for having friends, but damn, this would be such a fun game to play with your closest discord mods, or roomates. If you were to implement a MP mode, I would suggest no more than 6 people. The maps get a little crowded even with one person.

Which brings me to my next WISH! 

2) MAP MODIFICATION // WORLD BUILDER TOOL would be f****** awesome and a wonderful complement to a MP mode. Something along the lines of simple ""sectioned drop-in"" map building mechanics would go crazy fr. 

3) We need a storyline / main quest line / story mode / more map selections for this game to have some real depth and replay-ability. This could be tied into, or overhauled / substituted for a map building tool, but we need more maps. 

4) I believe more character customization options, when it comes to character cosmetics, coloring, spell colors, weapon designs, etc etc, all the cosmetic customization in other games, would be a really welcomed addition here. (even if there is a STORE, idgaf, just something to add some user personality to our experience) 

LASTLY, 

5) Hybrid class mechanics need to be a thing. I think after the update to the rune system its pretty good. Everything for the most part feels balanced, however, I think if we could dial in more specificity on certain spells or abilities, or removal of certain abilities within a certain spell pool, etc etc the game would benefit greatly. Its cool for now, but I can see overtime it might get a little boring using the same setup over and over again. 



But these are my opinions, thank you for reading. Thank you to the devs for such an awesome experience, and I cant wait for the next update! PEACE! -

[h1]TLDR[/h1] 

I currently feel like Soulstone is the most complete package for the price point and the game is still making it's way through Early Access. The recently added ""Class Ascension"" mechanics (which currently less than half the cast has) gave a much needed jump into class identity and the vast amount of customization options available means that you can truly play the game the way you want to play. Infinite scaling makes this feel more like Risk of Rain sometimes, including the part where when you scale loops in higher tiered content you will eventually just get one-shot, but most content can be played very comfortably.

[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]

Typical Survivor-like gameplay. Only stipulation is that the run is ran by kills, not time. You kill normal enemies on the map and gain experience and at certain denominations a Lord (Boss) will spawn and defeating them will give you a Soulstone. Soulstones are both your meta progression and your ""Magnets"" in this game, so they vacuum all XP on the map.

Upon finishing the fifth Tier of Lords, the game ends immediately. If you completed the run fast enough, you can choose to loop your run into another random map infinitely in either Endless (enemies scale across the board) or Overlord (+1 Lord per Tier, less kills to spawn Lords, Lords scale more) modes and each has different meta progression benefits and feel different enough to merit each other.

A large majority of the normal mobs do not have projectile attacks and even all of the Lords' attacks have skill shot displays and timers. You have access to a Dash with a moderate amount of invulnerability frames, but at the higher tier of content eventually your whole screen is going to be full of asynchronous danger zones and so it gets considerably harder. Very few classes have access to healing, but there is an amount of randomly spawned Health Crystals on map; otherwise, it's HP on level and Health Regen for your recovery.

[h1]CHARACTER IDENTITY[/h1]

Every character is more or less a collection of various stats, with very few of them having meaningful differences there, besides classes with an extra dash or Death Knight not being able to Dash. They can also only select a handful of the game's 200+ Skills depending on their associated Element/Type tags. Paladin can only equip Electric, Holy, etc skills, but due to the secondary Types you end up with a large handful of generic skills.

I mention generic skills because each class DOES come with a handful of skills that only they are allowed to draft which you unlock as you advance that class in level. Now Paladin has another four skills that are only going to be offered to them. That's before considering that each class also has multiple ""weapons""  that each have a primary unique skill and various further stat bonuses.

Every character easily has multiple high end win conditions and it seems that the developers are also adding more ""build options"" weapons to each class. Probably by release every class is going to have a minion-build and/or scaling build IN KIT with the weapon system as well as using the rune and generic element skills systems.

The Ascension update adds skill trees to less than half the classes (unlocked after completing the initial global skill tree) and in those trees are MMO-style resources and mechanics specific to each character. Most of these are honestly just do a thing and gain temporary huge amounts of stats, but the interaction is still pretty unique, even if some mechanics are clearly more equal than others. Namely, mechanics that force you to stay in an area for an extended period of time don't work well with high-level content.

[h1]BUILD/RUN IDENTITY[/h1]

While I really don't subscribe to the idea of running Roguelikes or the like with the idea of ""builds"" in mind, Soulstone is set up to where you can almost reliably play the build that you want.

The game boasts a ""Rune"" system, where you can choose up to five different perks (the capacity of which is dependent on meta progression) that can range from guaranteeing your first offered skill is a specific class, adding skills your character normally doesn't have access to into the skill pool (including unique skills from other classes), scaling options, min-maxing stats, etc. etc.

Every level, you alternate between drafting skills and choosing a stat enhancements. Whenever you are offered a Skill and your Skillbar is full, you can elect to replace one; this will lose all Skill-specific levels invested into that skill, but the new skill might fight your build better.

Unfortunately, whenever you have this much player agency run identity usually suffers, but I suppose when rounds only last like ten to twelve minutes, that's okay. I still feel like it's the only place where Soulstone Survivors is lacking. I personally wish that the Elemental Synergies weren't solely in the skills and boiled down to ""you have three Electric Skills, so sometimes you get offered Electrical Area of Effect"".

[h1]CONTENT[/h1]

I think the only game that has this amount of content (that I am aware of) in the genre is Army of Ruin, which I am playing through right now. Maybe Brotato? For costing 50~100% more than other Survivor-likes and having the low-poly graphics that most others don't, it's honestly a lot. 

Granted, some of that content in the Skills department is same-y. ""What if we had the cleave attack, but this time it was PURPLE!?!"" ""How about another laser, but this one is cold?"" but at least there are characters that are focused around 'purple' and cold, so at least it's filling a niche. Probably the most heinous example is Heartrending Strike (a Seasonal Event skill) and Ravaging Strike, where Heartrending is literally the exact same except it has a Seasonal Tag and does slightly less damage, but that's literally the only case so far.

[h1]WORDS OF WARNING[/h1]

Just figured I would also put a place for all the things that you might want to be aware of before purchasing the game.

More than most other Survivor-likes, the Low-Poly graphics plus infinite scaling of attack speed and area of effect can cause ""skill blindness"". There is a slider in Options to downscale all your skill effects so that you can see enemy attacks on the ground and avoid them; I highly recommend reducing it down to around ~30% almost immediately.

More than most other Survivor-likes, due to the infinite scaling of attack speed and area of effect, the game has a lot of CPU load to register all the hits, effects, and debuffs that you will be placing at any particular time. There is an option in the menus for ""ramping damage numbers"" or something like that helps a lot with your system ""chugging"", but won't solve the entire issue.

More than most other Survivor-likes, due to the infinite scaling of enemy attack speed and damage, you WILL eventually die. You should be fine for your first initial loop, but eventually enemy stats get so high that no matter how much armour or block you stack you will not reduce it all and there will be so many dangerzones on the ground that you cannot feasibly dodge them all.

The downside to this game comes in the later levels. I'm currently on Curse level 5 on all the current maps and its very chaotic at this level. There are so many enemies and visual effects on screen that it is hard to make out where you should and should not step. 

There's also so much visual stimulation going on in these levels that I have to pace my gaming out more. Instead of playing for hours on end, I'll play an hour or so and then need a break.

It's a really fun challenge.  it's nowhere near perfect, with lots of strange balancing issues, especially around skills that seem amazing on paper but are feeble in-game.  But it's just a matter of devs identifying it and tweaking their little ""spreadsheet"" that' underneath everything.

The other quirks are that they still haven't figured out a way to have all the effects on the screen and have the game be playable (too many effects block neccessary information).  Thankfully there's a slider to turn transparencies up (or make effects go completely invisable.

Hack´n´Slash survival, upgrade game. It´s a very good one of it´s kind but this comes to the price of a high grind level for the achievements. Mainly the ressources for the weapons need tons of time due to poor spawn chance.

Very good. Probably one of the best 3D ""Action Rogue-likes"" out there, let alone just plain good. Well worth the price and a great time-sink. Highly addictive and very colourful and exceedingly easy to understand and play.",1688895886,1688895886,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True
2066020,141658577,76561198000829983,0,7,1996,0,1692,1696433429,"Great light fun survivor-type game. Huge fan, my favorite out of the numerous survivor and survivor-like clones I've played. Tons of customization options, different weapons that actually change up the game play for the characters in meaningful ways, 14 characters to pick from. All that leads to a pretty decent depth and tons of replay-ability. This is the PERFECT game if you just wanna pick up and have some quick fun, do a run or two, etc. (just be careful, because the ""one more run. Okay, just one more. okay okay one more"" feeling is real. The gameplay is super fun and there's always new things you want to try next time) I've been using it as an""in between"" game for when I finish a massive plot-heavy game and don't want to jump straight in to Mass Effect: Legendary Edition after beating Elden Ring (as an example). I've also found myself playing this as my primary game for weeks straight because the loop is so satisfying. Great casual game, with enough depth and difficulty options that you can dive in to this head first if you want.

Other things I like: 
- A subset of the skills can be aimed if you want (you can have them all auto aimed if you prefer). Some of the survivor-likes I've played have all skills fully auto aimed with no control other than character direction. I really don't like this and appreciate being able to have a bit of agency (clear a path vs cover retreat).
- Graphics are some of the best out there. Vampire Survivor and Halls of Torment are fun, but there's something to be said for a game with full iso-3d graphics. Gameplay is the most important factor, which is why I've spent so much of my review on that, but the graphics are worth noting.

Take it or leave it:
- All the weapons/characters/runes that you could want for your favorite characters are unlockable within the first 20-30 hours (if not much sooner). This assumes you play all classes up to level 20 (about 10 hours total), and then pick and stick with your favorites for the rest. However, some people in the community want to unlock everything: every skill, every rune, every weapon. This can result in pretty major grind for materials (obviously). I don't think this is an issue personally because I don't have a huge drive to unlock every single weapon/rune. There are 3-4 characters/classes that I like the most, and I have those fully unlocked and didn't need to do any extra grind for materials. I have absolutely zero desire to keep unlocking some of the other characters (looking at you, Sentinel, Paladin, and Pyromancer) and don't have any plans for crafting their stuff. If you're the type of person who likes to fully complete everything and needs every single weapon and rune unlocked: The developers are aware of this, and said they have some changes planned in the future to address the end game grind. So hopefully everyone can be happy!

Early Access Stuff:
The game's still early access, but I'm not taking points off for that. Everything here is fun and playable. No major bugs or issues that I've seen in my hours of gameplay. But they're still developing the advanced skill trees for about half of the newer characters (Necromancer/Chaos Walker can't specialize like some of the others, YET), still adding extra weapons for newer classes, etc. The developers communicate all of that very well, and the game as it is today is worth the price imo.",1688884678,1688884678,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

They complain that they're only a 2 man team, but they're splitting their attention between two separate game developments. Updates are already bringing as many bugs as they are features. Most runs end in instant death from invisible attacks or stuff clipping through walls, or even just outright being lied to by the AOE warning markers.

I said it to the developer, and I'll say it here.

I'm sorry I supported this, and I'm sorry they think it's something to be proud of to screw your customers over and deliver a lackluster product while promising to fix it, while you're ALREADY jumping ship to another project.

It's a totally brainless game up until a point where you add enough curse modifiers that the ground is filled with so much red circles of ""shit that is about to hit"" that you can't possibly stand still for a moment. The game has no clock like Vampire Survivors, so it only pressures you in the sense that if you summon a boss and dont kill it fast enough, you will start progressing towards summoning the next boss before it dies, which can snowball into a loss if you don't have enough DPS.

The bad decision of including a dash move for the player character also stands out, making it trivial to kite every single enemy and making the game full of enemy AoE telegraphs that try to run you out of your dash cooldown. The only way enemies can threaten you is by literally filling the screen with so much crap that you can't possibly get out of the way fast enough, but it doesn't happen in the gradual ""zombie horde"" manner of other Vampire Survivors clones and thus feels more like the worst aspects of Diablo or hell, an MMO raid encounter. Dashing into terrain by accident is a bigger threat than any of the enemies.

There are 50000 abilities to pick from that are all meaningless variations on the same thing and eventually they stack so many modifiers that they turn into the same screen-covering bullshit that you actually have a VFX slider in the game you can turn down so you can actually see the fucking gameplay. So even though there is a lot of choice, it doesn't matter because the mechanics of each attack eventually converge into the same screen-covering spam so the base design of how the attack works is surprisingly unimportant.

It's a shame because the game is confidently designed and has a lot of content but the core gameplay ends up being unfulfilling, even plain old Vampire Survivors makes me feel more like I'm ""in"" the game. It will milk some dopamine out of your shrivelled brain but eventually you will come out feeling empty inside.

Played under 3 hours and wasn't impressed by anything.

Game's top priority is character progression. General character skill trees, individual skill trees and some weapons. For latter you have to grind a lot. Changes stats +/- and give new skills.
Most important thing at start is to get a second dash.

There is very small variety of enemies, bosses and maps. Each map has different upgrade resources. 
Visually Elites and Bosses may be different but all are doing the same. Worst here are bosses. Basically all patterns: a lot of red circles aoe, one big red circle, frontal cleave/half circle, directional frontal charged attack that can be either cast or channel. There's 6 or 7 (?) bosses in base game (heard events had more) and 5 of them you must finish to complete the map. I mean none of them have their own biome or something unique. Just a cannon fodder.

Skills and level progressing are disappointing to my humble taste. Often, choosing higher rarity upgrade on level up is the way to go. You can choose to upgrade dmg for one particular skill or general damage but in lower quantity for example.
Didn't enjoy skills at all. At start I wanted to try and play around some control build but it's meaningless. Just go all damage build, because hp and defensive upgrades seemed worthless very fast. I've tried (what do they call it..)..uhm..Overlord mode ?...the red portal. Everything was fine until second pair of bosses spawned and I died instantly without anything under my feet. That's okay, nothing to be upset about, it's just dumb.
So yeah, just look at good Dmg:Cldwn skills, pick and upgrade them. Purple, yellow general dmg, multistrike upgrades are no brainer.
Also, you can't modify skill's effect in any way, except it's stats. At least I couldn't yet.
First 2-5 minutes, while you still see smth on your screen, you still distinguish skills animations. After that ""boom, splash, kaboom"".

Game doesn't feel rewarding. You just pick those skills, have access to the best upgrades on the first run and then just slap slap slap. Let's see: that skill kills shit, oh and that one too, and this one ! Abilities doesn't look interesting, all you can think is ""oh, okay"", when you see it. Because of this it's hard to care about characters or their skills. Okay, one of several heroes that I unlocked had a dog. Wow O_o. Okay that's cute, but it was late and maybe because of that I had no idea what can it do. 

There's some Curse system which I didn't try and idk how to access it. IIUC it's the main time sink. If devs just increase enemy amount (4 bosses very fun, har har har) and stats and decreasing players stats/exp gain - it's most dumb and cliche concept in video games. If bosses also have new moves and maybe maps have some mechanic - it's already something.

On top of everything mentioned above, only one thing can further worsen boring and repetitive experience. And it's narcotic and repetitive music. Omg...the first map's theme. Just shoot me in the head. Same monotonous beat and repeating one or two words over and over again. Arghh....and also that word I couldn't recognize sounded like ""pirozhki"" :D Had a couple laughs, but yeah..awful and annoying music.

IF in future, I will revisit this and my experience will be different, I'll change my review. For now this is how I feel.

Although I am to refund this right now, I plainly recognize that Soulstone Survivors makes the genre a lot more accessible to people who would like to play VS but want a more balanced (?) game overall.

+ Dash
+ Simple yet very polished and well designed UI
+ Dash has low cd
+ Even though a lot of things are going on at the same time you can turn what you like off and even customize abilites opacity
+ You can dash through enemies
+ EVERY enemy has an attack animation so there's no retro touch damage bullsh1t (the only letdown on retro games for me), a HUGE improvement
+ Dash iframes
+ Boss mechanics are basically a sum of a variety of WoW and Runescape bosses
+ Quite good starting variety of skills and combos
+ Graphics can be simple but are visually comfortable whilst in the middle of chaos and warfare
+ Dash graphics are also nice

- You are forced to swap skills every damn time, at least at the beginning
- Cast and run can be quite boring after a little while for those who prefer a VS approach on ingame progression as your character is either abominably overpowered or easily overwhelmed by bulky hordes
- Reminds me of Adventure Quest 3D and League of Legends
- While bosses are indeed very cool, some skill hitboxes are off, which makes them sometimes land a hit without being capable of doing so (e.g channeling a skill forward and yet hitting through their back)

The game has a variety of characters, skills, and items to choose from, which gives you a lot of freedom to experiment and find a build that works for you. The challenge is also well-balanced, with enough difficulty to keep you engaged but not so much that it becomes frustrating.

One of the things I really like about Soulstone Survivors is the sense of progression. As you play, you'll earn Soulstones, which can be used to unlock new characters, skills, and items. This gives you a sense of accomplishment as you make progress, and it also helps to keep the game fresh.

Another thing I like about Soulstone Survivors is the challenge. The game can be quite difficult, but it's also very rewarding when you finally beat a tough boss or reach a new high score. This makes the game very addictive, and it's always fun to try to improve your skills and get better at the game.

The visual effects in Soulstone Survivors are also very impressive. The game is full of bright colors and flashy animations, which really helps to bring the action to life. The sound design is also top-notch, with a great soundtrack that really sets the mood.

Overall, I highly recommend Soulstone Survivors to fans of action roguelites. The game is a lot of fun to play, and it has a lot of depth and replayability. If you're looking for a challenging and rewarding game, then Soulstone Survivors is definitely worth checking out.

Here are some of the things I like about Soulstone Survivors:

The variety of characters, skills, and items.
The sense of progression.
The challenge.
The addictive gameplay.
The visual effects.
The sound design.

Here are some of the things that could be improved:

The game could use a bit more polish in some areas.
The difficulty can be a bit uneven at times.
The weapons you craft can be underwhelming. 

Overall, I think Soulstone Survivors is a great game, and I highly recommend it to fans of action roguelites. I'm excited to see how the game develops in the future, and I'm sure it will only get better with time.

Here are some tips for playing Soulstone Survivors:

Experiment with different characters and builds to find one that suits your playstyle.
Don't be afraid to die. Death is a part of the game, and it's often the best way to learn and improve.
Pay attention to the environment and use it to your advantage.
Don't be afraid to use your skills and items. They're there to help you, so use them!

[h1][b]The game in a nutshell[/b][/h1]

Soulstone Survivors is an action-roguelike arena shooter and stands, as the name suggests, in the tradition of the Vampire Survivors phenomenon. Kill hordes of increasingly stronger and more numerous enemies, level up your character, learn spells, powers, AoE effects, find synergies to maximize damage and defeat the baddies. Finally upgrade permanent bonuses after each run - rinse and repeat...


[h1][b]+/-[/b][/h1]

+ great art style and sound
+ motivating game loop and progression system
+ 14 characters
+ as typical for the genre you collect currancy with each run to permanetly unlock perks - Soulstone Survivors adds different variants of the primary weapon for each character - more build variety, high replayability- and experimentation value
+ a big plus for me is, that you don´t need a meta build to succeed. Although there are the ""better"" and stronger synergies, I managed to finish runs with experimental builds I never thought I´d win at first
+ instant dopamine release
+ worth even at full price

+/- playing with default settings is comparable to a movie that only consists of CGI. I think I´ve never played anything that close to overinformation or an epileptic shock. Depending on your build you might end up with a mix of a Michael Bay movie and Timothy Leary´s psychedelic adventures. What sounds funny might really be a thing if you are seriously susceptible to epileptic shocks! The good news is, you can change that in your settings and I highly recommend doing so, because above a certain level and strength of your powers and AoE effects (as beautiful and flashy as they are), you can barely see anything on the screen. In addition, there are obstacles in every arena that you can get stuck on and you don´t find them anymore in this madness

- at harder difficulties you probably always end up running in circles around several bosses, dashing ninja style and hoping for the best that they die earlier than you because of neverending additional enemy spawns. 


[h1][b]Conclusion[/b][/h1]

Soulstone Survivors is a worthy descendant of Vampire Survivors and leads the genre in the right direction. The progression system is motivating and the game is simply fun to play.

This game has huge potential. It has an addictive game play loop that will keep you entertained if you are interested in this genre of game. It kind of reminds me of POE without gear. You are weak the first few rounds and then later you are clearing screens of mobs.

Pros:
Progression in game and skill tree
potential with crafting system
addictive gameplay

Cons:
Build diversity 
boss skills/frequency

""build diversity"" is a bit of an illusion. You cant just go in and choose skills and hope to complete the hardest difficulty. Some skills are miles ahead of others and some classes just dominate the rest. Melee builds are usually punished the hardest with how the bosses work.  This could always be fixed with balancing so its not that big of a deal.

Now here is the biggest issue. Bosses. When you are melee and there are 7 bosses on the screen throwing out AOE that is the size of the screen and also shoot out ""fire/lightning beams"" that seem to be constant, it just becomes a chore. It isnt fun. The boss AOE's need to be reduced drastically and the cast frequency of the beams that move faster than you can dash need to be tuned.

The gameplay ideas are promising (like dashing, enemy move predictions, and boss fights), but the game smothers them with excessive restrictions such as currency, crafting, and skill trees. Perhaps some players enjoy endlessly grinding one level for in-game currency to craft an upgrade they unlocked by defeating a boss, but that's not my cup of tea. When I beat a boss, I want to be able to obtain the upgrade in the next round.

Additionally, the pace of level progression is quite slow within each run, and the upgrades offered are relatively minor. This lack of substantial progression can make the early game less engaging, especially without the introduction of new characters or weapons.

Finally, and this is very important, the UI needs to be traversable with just the keyboard. It becomes quite bothersome to have to switch to the mouse every time I need to select cards during level-ups. Please ensure that all UI elements can be easily accessed and operated using keyboard inputs alone.

This is a game that has a lot that it wants you to do (character unlocks, weapon crafting, skill trees, difficulty level unlocks, runes, etc), but not a lot of ways for you to do it. You'll be fighting the same 5 or so bosses over and over again while fighting waves of enemies that all feel basically the same to each other even if they have different designs based on what map your on. The maps all also feel very samey, probably because the enemies don't feel different enough from map to map and the bosses are the same regardless of what map you select. The skill selection system is interesting, but feels self-defeating. 99% of the time, it's correct to just take the rarest skill being offered, so it never really feels like you are making a choice. Also, because combat is so reliant on dashing, the skill that gives you an extra dash is by far the best in the game, and should be picked every time you see it, which feels a little boring.

All of that being said, there is a lot of good here too. All of the characters feel varied enough from each other, and you can get some really insane builds going if you pick enough synergies with your active skills. It never quite hits the insanity point that Vampire Survivors does, though. You'll never be able to just fully afk this game, and that's probably a good thing. I really like the art style, even if the visual noise can become overwhelming at times, and the soundtrack is pretty solid.

This is a game you'll probably be done with way before the game runs out of things it wants you to do, but I'm hoping the developers take a break from adding things to grind for to add more variety to the grind itself.

If you're not into a reading marathon, i'll spare you the trouble and give you my thoughts about Soulstone Survivors in this short version: yes, this is a pretty solid game, definitely enjoyable, with a feel of adrenaline, progression, you'll struggle until you get your builds right, lot of options and skill variety, it does honor to the genre. I 9000% recommand it. Bullet hell games are awesome if you're into them, this one is awesome.

Now the long one:

A bit of context: 
My first ever 'bullet hell' game was Realm of the Mad God and I was not into that kind of game at the time. I did not understand the concept and wasn't interested, and RoMG is kinda different from all the others. While most bullet hell are all about 'choosing a character -> fight -> get stronger -> keep going until you die', it feels like RoMG is a HnS with permanent HC mode and coop mode but without the campaign. I launched the game, made a character, got into a game with 3 high level guys, hit lvl 50 in 5 mins, died from a wandering projectile, lost my character... and pretty much left it at that. I can't say it's bad, but that just stopped me right there.

Then much later on in my discovery list I got one of those and decided to give it another chance. I think I shouldn't have (I ended up spending HOURS and DAYS in there). So I was offered to play Fray fight? I liked this game, it was hard enough but also I could understand the mechanics of it, it had that full screen aspect typical of the genre, but some stuff in there was also disappointing. So I looked for more of those and I found tons of free to play crap clones of vampire survivors, which is, if not the most, one of the most popular bullet hell games around. Then I found Soulstone Survivor! And off we go spending hours and days on it.

About bullet hell games:
Bullet hell games are games where you play a character (usually a class as any RPG / HnS...), you find yourself on a map, you slay waves of monsters starting with a bunch and growing up filling the screen, using a variety of skills that may or may not synergize with each other but also growing to filling the screen. If you die, you have to start all over.

Well not exactly all over because some of those games have features such as talent trees and some sort of upgrade systems so it gets easier at the start and so you can go further. Some of those features can be unlocked through 'quests' or 'achievements'. So you really have that feeling of growing stronger to a point you're an almighty godly being. 

What I like about Soulstone Survivor:
*While the maps are not infinite (like in Vampire Survivors) they're not tiny either (like in Fray Fight)
*The game has its unique design, most games really all look like Vampire Survivors)
*Also has its unique skills, (unlike all other Vampire Survivors crap clones)
*Not only the skills are unique but they have a huge variety even within the same class
* The 'curse' systems: give yourself a harder time by checking some options and have to think a bit more about choices and strategy for better reward
*The talent tree (classic HnS feature)
*You can spend A LOT of time to try and reach endgame (if it even has an end, not there yet)
*I understood that there were events in the game. On a map I found a chained heart and when I broke the chains a Cupid like monster popped and attacked me, also spawning pylons with a heart on its top (valentine event I guess)

What I don't like about Soulstone Survivor:
*Obviously the whole game isn't realesed yet, for instance all classes don't have their own talent tree yet
*The thing that bothers me the most is that there is so much going on on screen you have to make the particle effect transparents so you can see the monsters aoe so you don't get hit and die... yeah
*There might be more but I enjoyed the game so much it's very possible I missed some of negative points about it",1688491456,1688498979,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,True

You know those red swirlies you have to dodge, right? Well, they are literally everywhere. It feels like everyone is casting spells that require you to dodge them - bosses, elite mobs, pillars, you name it. The entire map becomes a chaotic mess of red swirlies. On top of that, there are knockbacks from boss spells, constantly trying to throw you across the map. It's just not fun.

The number of swirlies needs to be reduced. Perhaps consider removing the pillar curse or reworking it somehow. Additionally, losing control of your character is one of the most frustrating things in any video game. It would be great if the developers could make it less annoying.

Lastly, I believe this game would greatly benefit from having Life per Hit and Life per Second stats.

Pros:
- Art style.
- Visual effects.*
- Skill variety.**
- Characters do feel distinct.

Cons:
- Although there are a significant number of skills, in reality, there are about 1/3rd of the total volume, but with different flavours. This allows build flexibility across various negative effects (weakness, bleed, haemorrhage, poison, rot, exposed, slow, doom, etc) and different elements (holy, fire, frost, poison etc) but bloats the skill selection somewhat.
- Visual effects are nice but overpowering. You will often need to turn them down or off otherwise you cannot see incoming damage markers and will die as a result.
- The game ends up at harder difficulties being a repeat of ""aim towards spawning enemies while dashing in a circle avoiding ground indicators until you die or the bosses do"" and with visual effects turned down enough it becomes very repetitive. 

Overall its a very solid entry in the genre, one of my favourites, but before you reach the kill 500,000 enemies achievement it should already have gotten to the stage of grinding materials just to unlock all the weapons and skill trees but the skills and gameplay loop by that point is likely to have already become too familiar and monotonous.

Summoner characters can be strong however due to abilities auto casting, increasing cast speed results in you constantly re-summoning your summons, preventing them from meaningfully staying on enemies to attack as they spawn at you. This means the later in a run you go with summons, the more you'll find yourself having melee summons run to mobs only to reach them and get re-summoned at you, not dealing damage.

Dodging damage is just a case of dashing out of the marker indicating when and where damage zones will be, but the further you go this just increases the frequency of these markers meaning you just need to keep dashing in circles. There's no meaningful tanking mechanics and although those skills exist it is only to lower the damage you take when inevitably you dash into damage or get stuck on terrain. As your run scales, enemies will also as you get through cycles, which increases their cast speed. With a strong build eventually your death will be due to an instant cast oneshot and unavoidable, so an infinite run is not possible.

A lot of the above may sound negative but these are my observations after 42 hours playing the game, For the price its been fun overall and I'm glad i purchased it. A lot of the above is also a hallmark of the genre, and this does give good variety when compared to the genre average.",1688263654,1688263654,True,19,2,0.681739091873168945,0,True,False,True

When I tried this game, it's like it's on a whole other level.  There's options for all the big issues you normally run into in this genre.  Option to turn off advanced graphics if the effects are taking up the whole screen (happens late in a build) so you can avoid hazards.  There's an option to disable auto-level up so you can hit Q and level when you choose so your level up doesn't pop up when you're in a sea of red.  Auto-aim option with an over ride key you can set (default right mouse) to temporarily manually aim.  There's an option to change the crosshair size and color so you can see it easier.  Option to auto-pause if the game loses focus.  Those are the good QoL things that I like.

Soundtrack is great, graphics are too.  There's skill trees with advanced skill trees I've yet to unlock.  There's character unlocks.  Blacksmith to change weaps that have different base skills on them and change character stats like move speed, armor, dash, etc.  There's a rune system to further build your toons (you'll need to set runes for each of your toons, its not a global setting.

The Ascension tree has caused me to play some characters I don't normally like to get the upgrades for all characters from their trees, and in the end I ended up finding out I like those characters once I got a different weapon for them. Looking at Barbarian. Resources drop in low quantities, so you will be grinding to get new toys to play with, but it isn't that bad when you get on a good streak on high difficulties and go for 10 maps. There are also runes to help with this grind. Performance is downright awful though. The game uses low poly assets and I can barely squeak out 60fps when I have 5 or more minutes on a map with medium settings and a 3080 and a 5900x.

Old thoughts
It is good in some ways but around tier VI and higher with curses the enemies are so over buffed and so many it becomes tedious, not fun. It is one thing to make a game that is hard, but tedious does not equal a good game in my opinion. Many games are a lot better than this one. If you get it heavily discounted then it is not too bad but I would not recommend buying this one.

The skills are fun, the bosses are fun, the scaling difficulty is mostly quite good. 

I will note my complaints/concerns, even though this is still a 9/10 game for me.  Not gamebreaking but hopefully issues to fix:
1) The tank-type NPS (paladin) don't seem to be quite tanky enough particularly for modes that have 3, 5, 8 bosses up at a time, but in some ways not even tanky enough for a lot of normal mobs unless I'm missing something. They should get more scaling from armor/block/dmg reduction rather than just a base increase, since the base quickly gets outscaled. Ironically pet/golem builds allow for less reliance on speed.
2) Another boss or two wouldn't hurt, albeit despite the lack of boss types (4-5?) the game's real boss challenge comes from the various combinations of many you'll run into on higher challenge modes.
3) I'll add it if I remember which one, but there's a blue skill in one of the mage builds that, when amped up with area/frequency/multi-cast becomes almost literally blinding.  More prominently, a few other builds block out damaging ground effects and terrain features and with certain buildouts I end up dying because my own spells make seeing what I should be avoiding impossible to see.  While the graphics are truly fantastic, I hope the devs work on either transparency or filtering in things you need to avoid over your own damage effects.

Those few issues aside, I think this is a fantastic game already (10/10) for anyone who can stand a bit of circular kiting in their gaming life and I look forward to seeing what the devs do with this as it proceeds.",1687463215,1687463215,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Soulstone Survivors is flat-out ADDICTIVE
When you beat 4 bosses at a time, get so many power-ups, not a SINGLE enemy can touch you, or kill a boss in less than a second (before it fully spawns in, even), it makes you feel like an absolute god. 

The simple control-scheme is great, too. As someone with a neurological condition, I struggle to use my keyboard properly anymore. I don't often possess the speed or accuracy to do a fair few of the games i used to be able to play. But with Soulstone Survivors, you're only required to press the space bar at the right time (along with moving the mouse). 
I'm able to get the sense of being a GOOD gamer again, slaying the map with my insane magic combos. 
It's [i]w o n d e r f u l[/i]

A few other reasons to buy Soulstone Survivors:

- killer soundtrack (great percussion, awesome bass, epic violin)

- absolutely AMAZINGLY OP magic combinations. Seriously, I think I've managed to stack around 10-12 debuffs on my enemies at a time (it's hard to count in the heat of the moment)

- ENDLESS combinations of skills. I genuinely think this game has the most variety of skill combos in ANY game of this genre so far (think Vampire Survivors, 20 Minutes Until Dawn, Magic Survival, etc). This game takes those and buffs them up with ALL the steroids, lol 

- TONS of classes to play with, all with unique skill trees

- Early Access, so it's only going to get better from here. From what I can tell, updates are often and the devs are active... Even if the devs fell off the face of the Earth today, there's still hundreds of hours of different class/spell combos in here. 

- Steal of a price! for $12, you're getting an insane amount of content. Seriously, nab it while you can! I'd say this game is easily worth double that, lol

[h1]""Vampire Survivors is that you?""[/h1]
After the huge success of shoot'em up roguelike games, more companies are trying their hand at creating the perfect competition. In this case, we get better graphics, a class system and a forge, significantly changing even basic character skills. All this makes the possibility of combinations almost limitless, and different types of gameplay such as endless mode or overlord mode or the presence of curses only add depth. The game is surprisingly difficult, especially for a new player, who, quickly advancing to higher levels of curses, may bump into a wall. Nevertheless, the initially challenging difficulty level and the multitude of things to do make it money well spent. 

Unfortunately, it was not without downsides. I see the most serious one as repetitiveness. The maps, despite the different graphics, have the same bosses, the next levels of the curse, instead of making it more difficult to fight the existing ones, simply spawn several of them at once. Despite having a class system you are able to choose the same skills on several of them, making the once chosen build used to go through the game with all classes. In addition, despite having gameplay modes, they only boil down to changing the number of bosses and their HP. All available achievements are done on the basis of killing a certain number of bosses/monsters or hitting a certain level, which ultimately gets boring. 

Nonetheless, it should be noted that the game is constantly evolving, as evidenced by the recent huge update to the class system, and with future updates it could reach a whole new level. I look forward to it.

[h1]Tips:[/h1]
- Don't hate the class after the first encounter, because one good build can change your whole attitude (I myself hated Death Knight, but after discovering one build I ended up with the highest level on this character).
- Use the overlord cycle to farm raw materials. It shortens the gaps between bosses = more resources.
- The summoned creatures are OP. You can take a necromancer, all the skils for summoning and make Curse 7 without any problem.
- Turn off the visibility of your skils in the menu. This will ease the burden on your computer and allow you to dodge opponents better.",1687198811,1687198811,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Decent casual arcade rouge-like. This game does not try too hard to be something its not. It's a good ""its been a long day at work, I just want to relax"" kind of title. I would give this more of a neutral-positive if I could.

Its a pretty standard gameplay loop where you pick a character and some starting buffs and then get dropped in with wave after wave of baddies. There are lot of characters and initial buffs to pick from. The game is fast-paced and character builds quickly become chaotic in a fun/crazy way. You collect resources along the way through a run to unlock permanent, character-agnostic buffs in a modest tech-tree. Visuals and audio are overall pretty good I felt. 

That being said, the gameplay loop is arguably a bit bland. The game overall has an overarching feeling of being very easy. While in a run you gain levels which in turn allow for a choice of powerups. The powerups are always positive powerups, without forcing you to make any hard choices for your character and the health of the run. There is no mechanic to weaken one of your abilities while strengthening another, for example, they are all positive outcomes. 

As a side note: the scaling in this game quickly becomes asymmetric and it does not seem possible to extend a run through 4-5+ rounds of bosses regardless of how overpowered your character gets in the first few rounds - the scaling quickly becomes asymmetric past a couple rounds in.

This one is still in early access so it would be nice to see some balance changes to add a little more of a challenge and maybe some more features in the near future. That being said, its a decent casual game for reasonable price right now.

This hit that itch perfectly, and more. Really excited to see future updates!

Great Vampire Survivors-like game that hits the difficulty curve just right. Ran wonderfully, no crashes, just a bit of hiccuping when it had a lot of effects on screen. Levels are tight and small, but still enough room to dodge around, and if played well enough, allow for an Endless mode (loop through levels until you die) or Overload (slowly building boss rush!). Runes to collect and unlock that allow you to tweak your builds before you even get into a match. There's even a few holiday secrets to hunt down, available even outside of the season, that unlock more skills, which was a great surprise!

As of writing, a few classes have advanced skill trees and specializations, and I'm really interested to see more when future updates arrive. Weapon crafting that tweaks passive stats to start and unlock more skills, though not everyone has their epic yet. And one currency that doesn't seem to do anything just yet... Not that you're at a lack of materials to collect and money to earn, of course!

I think my only complaint is in the UI, as I found the layout of some areas a bit rough, like the extended skill tree or the character page. And even then, that complaint is very minor.

А если серьёзно, то в патче на момент написания отзыва критовые саммоны выносят боссов на высоких значениях проклятий по щелчку пальцев. А если ещё руны на дамаг добавить к этому - вах!

Вышеописанное так же является примером главной проблемы игры на текущий момент - отсутствие вообще хоть какого-то понятия баланса в эффективности навыков. Даже в данном конкретном случае среди саммонов есть явный фаворит, оставляющий позади остальные возможные варианты.

Так же абсолютно мимо кассы всё, что заставляет игрока останавливаться для подбора. В стартовых условиях это ещё как-то работает, но чем выше уровень проклятия - тем меньше времени на передышку в маневрировании между парой сотней красных кругов на земле, иллюстрирующих области поражения врагов. Так что, да - это одна из игры, где остановка почти всегда равна смерти.

Ещё у меня персонально есть проблема с коллизией объектов на карте - персонаж постоянно цепляется за угол коряги или стены, хотя визуально там ещё есть место для прохода. В условиях абзаца выше это может легко отправить в таверну, т.к. с дамагом на высоких курсах враги вообще не шутят.

А, ну и да - сразу выкрутите в настройках видимость эффектов в минимум, иначе потом на экране ничего не будет видно, и можно там же сразу включить автоприцел на ближайшего врага, как в Vampire Survivors. Автоприцел - фу? Не льстите себе: выцеливать конкретного врага вручную в той мешанине и одновременно уворачиваться от сотни атак - это надо иметь очень хорошую реакцию. К тому же большая часть эффективности всё равно сводится к разгону АоЕ в половину экрана и выше.

Так а почему отзыв-то положительный с такими тезисами? Да как бы...

Now the BAD:
The grind here to progress your characters is stupid, like for real is too slow I guess is just a cheap way from developers to keep you playing for long BUT it is ridiculous the amount of minor soulstones dropped in late game is so low and your characters levels up so slow you will barely see any progress in their skill tree, so get ready to make hundreds of runs with a single char to reach max level. The special abilities of some characters is very weird and not organic to the gameplay since you need to stand still in a specific point to charge your ability while being bombarded from everywhere, is a bad design. Also there are too many power ups while playing especially the passive abilities and you are only offered 3 at the time so your options are pretty limited some times and you are forced to choose something useless. The enemies will overpower you out of nowhere most of the times not because your build is bad but because the enemies scale faster than you when playing infinite mode.

Overall this game has great potential but feels more like a job than a game when farming levels in the skill tree.
3 options when leveling up are not enough, 4 would be better also considering here passives have rarities.
Rarity chance should increase with your levels while playing so we don't get a normal passive at level 100
Add more banish and rerolls.
Allow to banish skills before the run, the same way Vampire Survivors allows this.
And finally improve how the abilities charge for some characters, just let them charge with kills and let it be, standing still in a point is not fun.",1686716053,1686955821,False,2,1,0.456869691610336304,0,True,False,True

[i]Soulstone Survivor[/i]

Good fast-paced action roguelite game where you fight your way through hordes of enemies to collect Soulstones and level up a huge skill tree that makes you stronger each run. There is a lot of replay value thanks to the variety of characters and weapons to choose from.

The game is visually stunning, with colorful graphics and a great soundtrack. The controls are tight and responsive, and the gameplay is incredibly addictive. 

If you are a fan of games in this genres, then you should definitely give this one a try. It is a great game that is sure to keep you entertained for hours on end.

Otherwise, he gives too little, while it takes away the speed is not very much want to sacrifice in the long races. Yes, if you take all the speed you see, then leviathan is not so bad, but instead of stupidly pumping one stats to another, it's much better to take the one you need, and not sacrifice it at all.

unlike most other bullet hell/auto battlers you actualy don't battle auto (yes, attacking is automated), but instead you are quite involved and active. you are constantly dodging, moving, targeting or making split decicions about what to do: collect exp to level, collect mats for the extensive skill and crafting system, grind mobs, kill bosses or use the countless character/class specific advanced mechanics. 
while the core appearance reminds one of autobattlers ala Halls of Torment or Vampire Survivors, it's honestly way more involved (in all the right ways).

the presentation ain't CP2077, but it's definitly not an ugly game, it has quite a Torchlight vibe (the good ones) and the brilliant OST does the rest of bringing this game to live. it's just pleasant to watch and listen to.

all this would already be ""good"", but their whole approach to meta-progression is probably the best in the genre currently.
different run-locations offer different materials (again coming in different rarities), which are all needed for weapon crafting (permanent choices/improvements to individual classes, that sometimes change their core-gameplay quite a lot), or unlocking boni via a pretty decently sized skill-tree (offering both class specific upgrades and boni for all classes).
so there's a skill-system, there's a crafting system, but there's also a ""rune system"". 
via unlocks you can net a pool of rune-slots, which in turn can be used to equip specific runes (unlocked by various means, like the skill-tree, or specific dungeon challenges). these runs again are a pretty massive progression and customization system allowing even another layer of permanent build crafting.
and still it doesn't end there; during individual runs you earn prestige-exp for the class you are currently playing, which nets you skill-points for the skill tree, aswell as opening up level requirements for weapon-crafting, but also lets you improve each class (currently there about half? implemented) with unique class-mechnics; like unlocking the ability to find food for your dogs on kill with the Hound/Hunter-class, which opens up a whole new layer of inrun choice (imagine something like a warrior-rage mechanics in a mmo).

most of the popular auto-battlers/action roguelike offer pretty solid core-gameplay mechanics, but you will be hard pressed to find a game coming even close to the brilliant perma-progression systems Soulstone Survivors offers.",1686758543,1686758543,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The good:
The unlocks seem consistent. Currently every run feels like a progress toward something new or a boost to my character. The music is good. The graphics are cartoony, in a good way. In the late game, you get that god-like feeling if you've built your character well. At 19 bours in, there's still a lot of things that keep me hopping back on to do a run. For $10? That's a damn steal.

The bad:
Currently there's only 5 bosses (?). Maybe there's more, but I've only encountered 5 after my 20-ish hours of play. Hopefully there'll be more in the future. Secondly, once you get further and further into a run, the thing that will likely kill you will be your own skills. Some of the abilities' animations are TOO much that you literally cannot see any telegraphs on the floor causing you to get hit needlessly. Yes I want to see my character get stronger and the abilities looking cooler, but making a giant pillar of earth cover my whole screen ain't it. Maybe allow an option to make the abilities of choice invisible, or allow the enemies' abilities and your character visible through yours.

Update: So I stand corrected. There is a way to reduce the visibility of the abilities. However, by do that, it removes the visual of ALL of your abilities which then makes the game look bland.

Great OST, decent meta-progression options, gigantic selection of skills once you unlock most of them, somewhat spotty difficulty scaling.

In long: Soulstone survivors was something I kept my eye on pretty much ever since it had a steam page and while still in relative state of infancy it already offers a rather impressive slate of characters, skills, options and various ways to tailor the horde slaying to your taste while sprinkling that experience with just a tiny bit of the good ol' ARPG style. So how do we slay the literal thousands of mobs and what are our respective tools of various levels of violence?

First layer is your character choice, every character has several skill tags which define what pools the level system will pull from once you level during a wave, these tags are further defined by a weapon, all characters have 3 weapons, some have 4. Important thing to note, these weapons are not distinct upgrades from one and another, mostly sidegrades and they are your founding blocks for a build you plan to go for. I.e. Want to go set the world on fire? We pick a pyromancer with a fire oriented staff. Want to become a literal lightning tornado, pick a berserker and give him his electric axes. 

Second layer is your skill tree, in other words, the meta-progression, simple stuff, inner ring is shared among all characters, outer ring is character specific improvements along with specific class abilities, which is a rather genius way of preventing all of the characters from becoming just a blob of ""skins"" by making them have unique abilities and specific preferences and biases.

Now we are set and ready to go, we pick a map and go horde slaying, right? Wrong. Well, almost wrong. Currently there are 5 maps and each map (after you beat it once) has a curse rating, which as the name suggest is a way for you to gain more goodies from every wave at the cost of the game becoming harder. I'm pleased to tell you these are not distinctly just making mobs tougher, there are things like making elite opponents more numerous and spawn more often, have suicidal goblins that run into you and cause massive knockback, potentially pinballing you straight into a group of mobs, straight up more bosses, curse towers that shoot at you from wherever they spawn on the map because f*** you and your HP, meteors that fall from the sky in your general area when you kill ANY ENEMY AT ALL! You get the point, you can make the game pretty damn hard if you choose to.

Once we are through that, we go into a map and from there it's your familiar bullet heaven experience, start at level one, enemies drop exp for you to pick up and level in that run, kill roughly 3000 enemies and 5 bosses and win. 10-15 minutes a run, simple, easy to pick up and fairly nice to play in short bursts... or you can choose to go endless and fight till you drop dead, good news here is, once you finish the first wave, the run is considered won and even if you later on die in endless there are no penalties on the amount of meta goodies you've acquired during it. So if you feel like pushing yourself, the game is happy to reward your effort.

So on the whole it's a pretty damn good game, the arstyle is simple but colorful and gets the job done, the music is bumping, the numbers are big, the skills are nice and diverse, the potential of crazy builds is basically unlimited if you want to push into endless. Even right now, I'd say the game is well worth the price and often ends up in sale.

Little gripes/Wishes for future content:
Early on basically anything is viable as long as you know what you are doing, in higher difficulties, viability of a lot of builds basically falls off a cliff and only a very focused set ups have a fighting chance to get anywhere.
Some skills are not created equal and some status effects are drastically worse than others. Summoning builds can push drastically further than most others.
I hope for there to be some sort of prestige/paragon system for characters that would reward you for playing them with improved stats, say every level of prestige above 100 you have on any character will grant them 1% improved in a stat randomly chosen from a pool of all stats in the game(Think golden eggs from Vampire survivors, small but permanent upgrades). That way you would have a reason to focus on a character you enjoy even after you max out their skill tree.

If you are into Vampire Survivors/20 Minutes till Dawn, you'll enjoy this one. Or if you are into roguelikes in general.

(Writing this as of 6th June 2023)

Knowing this is in Alpha, I only have 3 issues with this game.

1: Collision
For the love of God, please fix this or do something with it.
Getting stuck/glued into the walls gets me killed 90% of the time, this also applies to getting stuck into enemies as well, this also completely stops your dashing as well if you are so much as one pixel colliding with something...

2: Enemies bunching up/concentrating in one spot.
I have noticed this problem where the enemies tend to bunch up in one spot, especially the bosses like to do this. 
This only gets worse if you have Chaos Golems as your active skill.
All the enemies/bosses bunches up into one spot and as soon as your approach them, they all start casting their spells, causing you to be unable or barely able to approach the enemies to get some damage in. Borderline causing a softlock.
(The game isn't softlocked but you get what I mean, unless you wanna get clapped, by all means...)


3: Certain enemies causes WAY too much lag.
In later stages, or when you go deeper into the void, certain enemies when casting spells starts lagging the game badly. 
I have seen dips in the FPS hitting in the teens, and causes heavy input lag, so not only am I fighting massive hordes of enemies, I am also fighting against input lag.
I know this isn't my PC skill issuing (Ryzen 7 3800X and GTX 1080ti) since this issue is very similar to Risk of Rain 2 when you loop the game enough.

Really enjoyable, I have a lot of small issues with the game, but I believe it's because the rest of the game is so enjoyable that annoyances stick out more.

For my list of small issues:
1) Build diversity is great at low curse levels, but certain builds start to REALLY stand out above others at higher curse levels (summons and ice vortex especially at the time of this review) but that can and has been previously balanced.
2) Weapons take too long to gather the materials to craft, similar issue with the extended skill trees but much less of an issue there.
3) Overlord mode (red portals) has weird scaling on it, boss attacks start to cast faster, so at high overlord levels the game is literally just about spamming dodge and hoping you don't get hit by all the one shots that bosses are spraying out.
4) By default, the game is absolutely blinding once you get a build off the ground. Your spells will block out your entire screen. There is a slider in the graphic section that helps this, however spells scale very differently so a helpful spell to see might be nearly invisible while other spells that still block a massive portion of your screen still show even with the slider turned way down.

A lot of reviews mention ""grinding"", but honestly in all situations that I can imagine, you would have all resources needed waaay before even unlocking all the characters (which is also very cheap);

Contains a few bugs tough, including major ones. (Ex: Hitboxes having a LOT of phantom range, not being able to craft certain items even with the materials, etc...);

The gameplay is very fast, but doesn't encourage spammy controls, keeping calm and pressing just one button at the right time is all you need.


[b]Overall, needs more updates (which I know they are coming cause of the huge amount of different resources that you don't even have a use at this point), but SOLID and FUN experience.[/b]

Update: They added multiple new weapons that require about 2 hours of non-stop grind to unlock per character, way too much imo.

Update 2: More weapons were added, 2 hours of grind on the hardest difficulty offered won't get you a quarter of one weapon, chill out devs.",1672965835,1686369247,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

1.  Characters now actually feels unique and not carbon copy of one another in different skin.  Many different skills and combinations are possible and viable for majority of the content.

2.  Dodge actually feels like dodge, unlike in olden days when you can dodge and still get hit in mid animation, now you can dodge at last second to negate big boss damage.    Instead of having to stack armor to take hits, you can build an evasion tank.

3.  Each map has their own unique encounters.  maps are no longer just background difference and feels and plays differently.    

Overall the game has addressed majority of my gripes and complaints.

Good music, Solid Gameplay, Minimal Bugs, sound effects aren't super annoying (and can be toggled off/on).DPS numbers can be toggled on or off, as well as set to show different numbers from source damage type (magic, DoT, physical, etc). 

Abilities are varied enough to make each build feel different, but not so much that you can't see synergies in the abilities.

[strike]However, the game doesn't really feel like a roguelike/lite. No much in the way of progression in between runs. No big stat boosts, no semi-permanent modification or upgrade to the abilities. There's just not enough to spend the base Soulstones on, to be honest. There's very little in the way of upgrading and permanency after each run, even if you prestige 30+ times in one run.Skill Tree nodes rapidly require the Void Lord Crystals past 2 or so levels, and that seems to be the only place to spend the Soulstones. I've just started and I have an excess of some 500k+ Soul Stones after getting almost everything on the Skill Tree upgraded. I have one thing left to get to max level, and that requires Void Lord Crystals, not Soul Stones. I'm hoping once I max those, that the skill tree will ""reset"" or ""upgrade"" to a second level with those added to base stats, but not expecting that.I'd ask for more levels / increased stats / more expansive stats (ie, ailment chance, xp multiplier, etc) in the Skill Tree. [/strike] No Longer application to the current version of the game. All of this has been greatly expanded in the latest patch (Path of Ascension).

All in all, it's a fun game, but it can use some work, which is expected in Early Access. I'm definitely going to be playing this more in the future, especially if the roadmap is accurate on the number of things they have planned to release (345 skills, 21 characters, 105 weapons, etc). As is? Recommended. Hopefully that won't change in the future.

EDIT: [strike]One thing I would heavily recommend is that Summon skills not go off if they're at max capacity and nothing needs to be summoned. Summon skills + Cast frequency for buff or other damage skills often results in summoning minions before they can even get to an enemy and attack more than once or twice. It's annoying.[/strike] -- A Patch removed this concern. Summons are now healed if the spell is cast with them alive and fully summoned.

EDIT 2: I have discovered that the Status Effects make me want to flip a table. Not enough to change the recommended status of the game, but enough to make me frustrated. Weakness, for instance, increases damage taken by enemies by a %. It varies wildly. Some skills apply it for 24%. Some apply it for 3%. Which one is applied first? Do they stack or override each other? I'll sometimes have hundreds of stacks of a status effect on an enemy, but I have no idea which one's are doing what amount of damage. Burn deals different damage per 8 seconds for almost every skill. How do I know if it's doing the 800 damage from the highest skill or the 100 from the lowest for 5 seconds? Do all the different DoTs from Burn deal damage at the same time? Do they go in order?",1675789312,1686350109,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

[b]Pros:[/b]
-Characters feel unique and balanced.
-Absurd amount of skills means an absurd amount of flavor to your builds on top of a big build variety.
-Enemies have a LOT of different attacks.
-Game can still be difficult even after maxing out a character.
-The Rune system adds a whole bunch of different sidegrades for added replayability.
-There's almost always something to perma upgrade before the next run, Ascensions, Runes, Weapons, the main Skill tree, there's a whole lot of upgrades and sidegrades to grind for.

[b]Cons:[/b]
-Unlike Vampire Survirvors, this game is just mindless gameplay. There's not a hint of a story or a meaningful boss fight. No gimmicky secret levels or special encounters. They could at least make a different, way more powerful boss for the VI difficulty, but instead you get to fight 4 bosses at the same time.
-The linear weapon upgrade system makes me feel like I have less choices than I actually have. It's perfectly viable to make an Arcane build for the last Spellblade weapon (the only Epic one so far), but it gives you a Fire skill and it's visually made of fire.
-I might be wrong about this, but it feels like summons are a bit broken. The main difficulty of the game comes from having to dodge all of the crazy telegraphed attacks, but just one Chaos Golem skill is enough to disperse the attacks so much that most attacks don't ever come near me.

It also stops the player from playing. While you're flying through the air, you're not doing what you want to do. Removing agency from the player constantly is just not a good game design choice. 

The game does look nice, but all of the effects are enormous. The only options for making the playing field more visible is to increase the transparency of every effect. This might reduce the number of seizures you're going to have, but it does not actually improve the information you're receiving. 

There is no indicator of any effect applied to the player. You have no idea what DOTs are on you or how long they will last. 

Varying the attacks (fewer knock-ups, for one) and improving communication (smaller visual effects, icons indicating current DOTs and the time remaining, etc), and generally providing more specific details would flip this to a thumbs up.

As to the last item, player attacks and effects have very little actual information. Two immediate improvements would be 1) hovering over an ability would show an outline of the attack pattern on the screen and 2) actual numbers, such as the 'area' of an ability showing '1' for the base area and then larger numbers as the area increases, would make it possible to understand what the percentage increases would be working with.

The start feels super easy and getting my first clear took me 2 tries, so I was wandering if there is any way to keep me entertained. The game introduces a system of curses which makes the game harder by spawning more enemies, making your heals less effective, etc. which makes next runs more challenging.

Pros:
- Decent replayability with big variety of spells and curses
- Big character pool (characters need to be unlocked through achievements, although most of them are easy)
- Every character has 3/4 weapons to choose from making spell building even more variable (must be crafted and characters need some lvls to unlock them for crafting)
- Skill tree is a really nice way to feel like you are progressing even though you have basically cleared the entire game
- I really like the graphics. They are simple but nice

Cons:
- Extremely low drops of materials (even with the rune I get ~250 base mats per run and you need up to 1,2k to craft a single weapon), so getting more weapons is tedious and doesn't feel good
- Extreme amounts of AoE DoTs. Only bosses, ""invaders"" and few monsters have these. The monster ones are fairly weak and disappear after a little while. From the invaders, the only bad one is Death Knight and bosses with DoTs are all bad. I am not against the idea of reducing the space where I can move. But at full curse it is basically impossible to walk around, because the DoTs stay on the ground for like a minute or so and they can put them down like 3 - 4 times a minute. [spoiler] At full curse intensity you get to fight 4 bosses and if you get unlucky you can get 3 with DoTs making your life a hell (especially if you play a DoT build) [/spoiler]
- Terrain... I am playing on a keyboard thus I can only move in 8 directions. If you just slightly dash into the wall, you get stuck. I hope this gets updated, it's very minor thing, but if it happens to you, you will most likely die or lose a lot of HP. Just make me slide along the wall or something. Stopping a dash because it goes slightly into the wall is just stupid.
- On full curse intensity, it is almost impossible to dodge some boss AoE attacks without the upgraded dash (rune).
- I also feel like the hitboxes drawn in the game aren't always showing the real hitboxes. I sometimes stand inside the Aelfraed's spinning attack and it does not damage me and sometimes I am pretty far away from it and it starts hitting me (I assume it is because the hitboxes are drawn above your character, but it's still not very user friendly), Tiaggro's laser doesn't have nearly as much range as is shown, Gammuth throws his rocks like 4/3 the distance shown, Keythaiz's laser is wider than it looks (initial indicator of hitboxes is correct, but if you get near it later, it is wider than it looks)
- Inconsistency in attacks, Aelfraed's shield bash is basically Tiaggro's saw attack but comes out [b]way[/b] faster, which wouldn't be a problem, but the tracking on those attack is just too insane.
- Hunters mount ability needs rework, it is by far the worst one and getting to mount the panther is never worth it, making the ability unusable.

Although I listed a lot of cons, they are mostly just problems at high curse intensity runs (41 - 48, anything below feels very nice most of the time). Earlier runs feel super balanced and basically anthing works there. I feel like the game needs a little polishing and will be a really nice way to spend 15 - 60 hours of your time.",1686257000,1686273406,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Needs a little work in the early part of the level 7 curses as bad power options can ruin it very quickly if you've stuck in a particular bunch of runes and are ten left with bad choices from the available options. 

Great value for money and a bright future.

Soulstone Survivors has a solid base for the devs to expand on and refine. A fair number of characters with plenty of meta-progression to unlock, decent performance, acceptable graphics, some levels, some enemies. I'm primarily not recommending it because every run seems to reach the point where you smear the entire screen with constant, massive, colorful attacks that hide enemies (and their attacks). The main skills I was enjoying, Chaos, cause random debuffs— fun, in a way, but the debuff icons on every enemy started taking up several times the screen space that their 3D models and attacks did.

Suggestions to the devs:
More types of level-up bonuses, to dilute the pool instead of every run covering the entire screen in low-cooldown, huge AoE visual effects. Ex: change block to have a %chance of a flat damage reduction per hit taken; reuse current complete damage avoidance mechanic as ""dodge""; partial homing/""lock-on"" mechanic for projectile-based attacks
More enemy variety (basic goons look like recolors)
Higher base difficulty/better enemy attacks. (I haven't unlocked many Curses yet, but it felt too easy to get through multiple stages without being hit a single time) Goblin bombers felt like the only non-boss enemy to really warrant attention. Giving enemies a little more speed could help for both speeding up the early game and making it more difficult.
More gradual scaling for boss attacks vs player defenses? Seems like the only time the game gets difficult is when bosses are nearly one-shotting the player, because they have the hardest attacks to avoid.
More methods of player interaction-- stage mechanics (ex: traps that affect both enemies and the player), consumable items, manually-triggered long-cooldown skills, maybe different dodge-replacing movement skills",1685923133,1686015017,False,4,2,0.536376595497131348,0,True,False,True

-) Loads of different characters

-) There is no way to enter Overlord or endless modes in a stage you have completed previously ... go back to the start and play for 30 min if you really want to get to the next juicy lvl of the mode

I wish there was a neutral rating for reviews.  I found the game to be fun during the early stages as you unlock skills, weapons and characters.  But once I got to the higher curse levels the difficulty gets artificially increased with the addition of towers that can snipe you from the other side of the map.  At that point it feels more like a rhythm game, timing your dodges to balance avoiding attacks while making sure one is always charged.  If you get caught by an attack you can get flung across the map, which either sets off a chain reaction of you getting hit or interrupts your dodge rhythm.  The decision to add in multiple bosses at once is great as they have a variety of attacks which can make things challenging in a fun way.

Some Notes/complaints however:
1. Summons are way too OP just having one summon skill can carry you through the hardest curse setting.
2. Some abilities scale with area badly. They start to obscure too much of the screen. it becomes impossible to dodge incoming damage because I cant see anything. 
3. I think their needs to be more interesting mechanics to the curses. I liked the reaper that follows you. More stuff liked that rather than simply throwing more enemies and buffs endlessly. I like the idea of forced positioning. For instance a deadly mist rolls in and you have to find a safe spot to defend for a certain period. Stuff like that. 
4. Another thing about summons. I feel like summons should either take aggro really well or not take aggro and do a lot of damage. With the current state of the game. They do both monstrously well. My character feels weak because they do sooo much damage and also enemies start ignoring me for them.

But just my like a couple of days ago a new update dropped and now I have a massive skill tree to fill out that feels awesome. 

This game is like Vampire Survivors in many ways, but I think each game has it's own strengths. This game has better boss fights, a dodge ability for all characters and a better power fantasy where you will barely be able to see anything happening on the screen but it will still somehow feel pretty cool. Also the music in this game is an absolute bop.

However what Vampire Survivors does better is making each option feel strategic. Because Vampire Survivors core gameplay has limitations in the number of items you can carry, the game ends up having a little more strategy to it. It's not just about what you do pick, it's about what you refuse to pick. Banishing options also delays your power spike to remove some unwanted clutter from the long list of potential upgrades. Some things won't synergize with your build at all, and if you choose something that has less synergy, then you may forever be locked out of the best combination of items. This push and pull is a nice level of strategy. In Soulstone survivors you just endlessly power up. There are no bad options that won't synergize with your build. All upgrades are applicable and no matter what the screen will always be a blurry mess of nonsense that you will struggle to navigate through. For better or worse. 

I have had plenty of fun with this game so far, and plan on spending plenty of time experimenting with the horde of upgrades available in the game. Seems really grindy, but in a good way. 7.5/10",1685884074,1685884074,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

[olist]
  [*] The Paladin has this light power up you can get. You need to ""catch"" the light when it fills up within a small area... and it's stupid. Why? Because the light area is random, and you basically won't stop moving on higher difficulty. Which means you'd rarely if ever be able to catch the light because the moment you stop is the moment you die. Which dev thought of this, and how did this got through playtesting is beyond me. It's a great power up... when you don't need them, because that's the time you can actually catch the light without being overwhelmed. In other words, the power up is a death trap!
  [*] Hunter and panther... just why? So you need to stay with range of the panther which runs randomly around once you try to link with it. The random run itself is a death trap because it can run into bosses or hit areas. But this is not the worst - the worst is that you don't know where the panther is! There's no indicator of where the panther is in the stage, so you are just running around blindly hoping to link to the panther. Sure, an icon kinda shows different sprites if you are near the panther... but you're not going to be looking for the icon change when you are running for your life. Like seriously, who designed this mechanic and why did they think randomly finding your panther is a good idea?
[/olist]  
Another thing that puzzles me is the devs does a live strea mof their runs. But they basically said ""banish all defense upgrades"" even on their own streams... if the defense upgrades are so bad, then why do you have them in the game? Make defense viable, or take them out! 
The devs works hard and push out new contents... except I think they somehow keep working on adding more shiny toys then caring to fix the gameplay. All the complaints I have below is still valid, especially with the boss spamming, fast tracking, and the need to focus fire. The game is hilariously out of balanced at higher difficulty, which the game wants you to get to because everything requires grinding... 
This is the last straw for me. I'll not be playing anymore of this game. And neither should you. Please put your time and money elsewhere, this is not worth it. It might look cool and fun in the beginning, but trust me, the more you play, the worse it gets.

Edit2: Apr 19, 2023 - yup, all the problems I listed still exist. Major update my ass.

Edit: updated Feb 24th 2023. 

[hr][/hr]

This game is frustrating.   
It's frustrating because it has good potential, but the balancing is off at the higher difficulty, by A LOT.  
This is STILL the case since I last updated this review, kinda tells you how the devs work.  
To be fair, there has been improvements, but overall I believe a closer look at WHAT and WHY something needs a rework would be better.

Let me explain:  

[olist]
1. Questionable balancing. Did the devs even play test this? At Curse level 30+, the difficulty is getting close to stupid, which exposes the many weaknesses of the game. For starter, the bosses tracks us way too much AND their hit area is too big, AND they hit too hard. Also, seriously, once we kill the boss/mob, any lingering effect from them on the field should be gone. I'm looking at their dead bodies but their ice crystal is preventing me from going near their crystal to pick it up... just why? And not to mention since the enemas get more health, they take longer to kill. So it's not uncommon to face 4+ bosses at the same time. The problem is... THE ENTIRE FLOOR IS MARKED WITH RED! And this highlights two design issues:  

[list]
  [*]  Stacking status effects requires focus firing, but the game refuses to let us to do at higher difficulty. Since the effects (poison, doom, etc) have a timer, like 6 secs, you'd want to stack as many of the same effect onto the same target as possible. Not too hard when you only need to pay attention to one target... things get silly when you are being chased by 6 bosses and you have to keep moving and dashing since the floor is covered with all kinda of dmg zones and effects. If you can just have the time to focus on one boss, maybe 10-20 sec you can burst it down. But because you have to keep running around and thus resetting the timers, it takes like 10 times longer instead.  

  [*] Bosses can synergize with each other and makes approaching even more difficulty than just facing the copies of the boss. When bosses come in pairs, they are still manageable but you already start to see the problem: you dashed through a boss attack to get a hit window., only to find the other boss is starting new attack, so you are force to get away. This gets a lot more frequent with 3+ bosses on the screen, to the point you are just running in circles and hope that you can find one window to get in without dying. THROWING MORE THINGS ON SCREENS IS THE BAD KIND OF DIFFICULTY. I hate to use the words artificial difficulty but this is it. The bosses are already faster than us and tracks us faster than we can run/turn unless we have like +80% in movement, but if we pump movement then our dmg output would be worse. Either make the red hit zones on the ground smaller, or reduce their dmg on player, or reduce attack frequency, do *something* to balance the game at higher level, please.
[/list]


  [*] [strike]The base soulstone currency is still useless.[/strike]

  [*] We need more runeslots, seriously. 6 runeslots limits the build we can make, and some runes is so good that they shouldn't be  a rune but rather part of the upgrade. Like getting the 2nd weapon for free - sure it takes only one slot, but why not just have it as a unlockable upgrade? Same with the dash upgrade - our dash feel incomplete without it, and makes sense with it, so this means that the dash upgrade should just be our normal dash. Don't nerf a power so you can turn it into an upgrade. That's bad design for a PvE game. Becaue the game is designed with dashing in mind, why not make dashing good by default.

  [*] The combat itself is annoying. Firstly, too many things to stop us from moving. It's nice that unlike other VS clones, we don't immediately take dmg when we run into enemies. But we do get stuck and need to use a dash. Random trees on the map, trash mobs, some those damn suicide bombers,   

  [*] Those towers are way too tanky at higher difficulty. It's almost not worth the time to kill them, but we should because they add more attacks on screen (yay!). Like seriously, what is this? If I want to play League and push towers I'll go play that. I'm playing this because I don't want to play League.

  [*] Powers/Skill balancing. Some skills are just too weak you wonder what's the point. Many of the starting skills of the weapon is too weak that it's better to replace them if you can. Which brings me to another point...  

  [*] Let us see what skills are accessible for each weapon! And similarly, we should see which additional runes we'd get when we equip the X mastery runes, like fire mastery. It says we get 6 fire skills to choose from - which 6? Just show us, why hide it?  

  [*] Why the 6 skill slots limit? Who decided that all VS clones should just have 6 powers? No, screw this, give us more power slots because the game balance is trash anyway.
[/olist]

TLDR: Game is not bad, kinda fun at lower difficulties. But once you get pass a certain level then things break down and exposes a lot of design issues with the core mechanics. I believe they could be fixed, but it's up to the devs. As for you who are interested in the game, just know that what others said is true - the more you play, the less enjoyable it gets.",1668983102,1685880896,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

I usually don't write reviews but I feel like this game deserves one. 

I'm very easily bored with games and more often than not quit new ones in the first 2-5 hours. This game is so addicting! The level design, creature design and character design is superb! No to mention the soundtrack is really nice as well, keeps you in the zone when you're running for your life from like 100+ enemies who are out to get your whiskers.

Pros:
-Addicting
-Fun
-Fast Paced
-Great Music
-Replay-ability
-Class System (NEW) 
-Multiple Weapons (New weapons in recent update)
-No paywall or pay to win at all (No actual dlc shop :) )

Cons:
-Character balance (Some characters are FAR SUPERIOR to others (For example I was stoked to see a spartan and planned to happily main it but it's one of the less efficient classes in the game and is basically useless at higher difficulties)
-You'll lose track of time (5 hours felt like 1)
-Limited class advancement (A work in progress!)
-No multiplayer (would be fun but the game is fine without it)
-No in game store (Could be a pro as well but some skins and weapon skins to support the creators would be dope)
-Grinding for mats can be annoying since some only drop at the highest difficulties (It's really fine though, git gud nubs)
-Terrain Collision (Literally more dangerous than any boss xD)
-Just too much effects: For example if you run a chaos build, you will literally see NOTHING but your own skills, making harder to dodge. Would be nice to be able to see (You can do this by changing the opacity of your skills in the settings but even still :x)

-I can't remember if there is multiplayer/co-op yet. That's a NEED!
-Can I recommend a gunslinger class (revolver based)?
-For archer class, could there be a buff for damage boost while standing still? 
-For archer class, could there be a damage boost skill for hitting targets from a long way away?
-Again, I can't remember exact mechanics as they are currently available; could there be an option to keybind the attacks and disable auto-cast?
-When you level up, could hovering over a skill show the changes to the current level? (Example: Fragile buff shows 10% chance for 3% increase... Could you hover over that choice and have it show you the proposed change, ie going from 6% to 9%? It's hard to track with scrolling over all the icons when you hit 'ESC'. Alternatively, could hitting 'ESC' maximize those icons on the screen and show the text so we don't have to hover over them/remember the icon?

-Could there be some statistic changes made visible?

Also a few skill categories are massively overpowered, while others are simply not viable for anything but the basic difficulties due to lacking in damage and/or survivability. Also there are only five bosses in the game as of now and quite a limited assortment of enemies you will cycle through quite fast. After that its just more of the same. More enemies, more bosses simultaneously, oftentimes you will face multiple copies of the same boss. Combined with the fact, that you will unlock most of the game defining stuff quite easily its not good for long time motivation.

Played a few dozen hours of the demo and I recommend this game 100%. It has a lot of content and more importantly, a pretty good progression system both in your characters and the game modes. I also love to see how some of the abilities and passives are inspired in stuff from other games like WoW and PoE which are my favourite.

My only complain is that the game gets a bit laggy on steam deck when the runs are on the second half, it is not unplayable but fps tanks to 20-30 sometimes in low settings, usually hovers around 40 fps and maintain 60fps for the early stages of the run, fsr doesnt fix the issue so it seems like it is a cpu bottleneck.

As there are quite a lot of resources to farm, there is some grinding involved but it doesnt look like it will get boring. Finding synergies between the active or passive skills is fun. All the characters I played felt somewhat different in their playstyle (probably because you get offered different skills on level up).

An improvement I would like to see is to compare the DPS of your skills while still living. I find it hard to decide which skills to switch and when. Especially when you already level them up quite a bit. Having to level a skill from level 1, makes me take quite a DPS hit.

Late game is pretty much instakill if you get hit so you have to turn them down to even be able to see anything and then it looks bad with not even being able to see your skills doing anything. The aoes also don't always render so deaths feel cheap. I've also had late runs where everything just dies offscreen and it's like every 30+ seconds I have to move to avoid an aoe.  

There is quite a bit of missing in game information, the rune system is really annoying in that it shows how to unlock the rune but not what it does, during runs you can't see what damage the different skills are doing so you don't know what to prioritize, and there are a lot of interactions that aren't detailed like what skills do summons get, when buffs get to longer than cast time can you get multiple copies. 

They also put out another game into early access which seems like almost the same game which just seems super scummy.

I have quite alot of those wave survivals or ""vampire clones"" so i wasnt expecting too much, but damn this is on a completely different level.

You can have active skills like any other game of this type, you cant level them up by upgarding them themselves, but by increasing their passive skills, there is NO upper limit on how high those passives go or how many you can have, so you end up with area modifiers of over 400% making you basically see nothing, especially if you pair it with multicast, its a bit bothersome but also super fun and epic. 

The game has an endless loop i guess, once you finish a stage you can go right to the next one with all upgrades, additionally the mobs will increase in difficulty aswell with each ""cycle"" i only played 2 hours so far, but it was a blast!

It's similar to other survior games, but thats about it, the game plays rather differently. If there was anything i could complain about its the variety of mobs and bosses, but that shouldnt be too hard to fix. Also, performance drops pretty hard when you achieve a certain level of attack rate/multicast/area modifiers, so i had to set it to low to not drop below 40fps. My pc can handle it easily, the game just seems to hit its limits.

I played quite a few different styles:
-- Archer (?the one that has +1 dash) with Doom stacking and Shadow+Poison area type active skills that were doing damage for ~50% of the map.
-- Paladin with Holy light front and stacking of DoT skills + runes (unique rune to pick the same active skill multiple times). 
-- Chaos Clown (sry, I am bad with remembering names) using 6 active chaos totems. 

When you start playing a game, even an office laptop easily handles graphics with 60FPS on high/ultra graphics. Well, it's only for the early game.

I am a bit disappointed that I could not reach a limit of the character build strategies, as the limit of my hardware power was reached way earlier :) When I started dealing tons of damage, like tens billions per second, and stacking thousands of debuffs in a second, I had an experience of playing with 2-5 FPS. I even downgraded FULL HD resolution to the minimum possible (800x600), picked very low graphics, and disabled visibility of my effects. It, unfortunately, did not help. Hence, my office laptop (HP 15-sqXXXXX, AMD Ryzen 5 4500U, 16GB RAM) could not handle the game.

The sickness of how far you can go with your builds is amazing. I tried only a few, and I enjoyed them a lot. However, I cannot continue playing the game due to limited hardware that cannot handle meta builds.",1685661413,1685661447,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Knockback makes no sense, it turns the game into a bouncycastle and bumps you either across the map or into all the enemies. The game without curses is too easy and with all curses the enemies are so poweredful, that you barely get to do anything.

If those things were changed, then yes, it would be a great game, but right now they are introducing new monsters to each map (which is cool and unique) making the game harder. They are also adding new weapon rareties (which is awesome), some of which are worse than the supposely more common ones (mainly because DOT damage and debuffs are make it or break it in this game, NEEDS TWEAKS).

If you want any chance, cheese the game with debuffs, because they are brokenly overpowered, compared to anything else in the game, which hits like wet nuddles.

Just for notes, I have played the game for over 100 hours and have all achievements.

So far, it's the best of the lot, easily outclassing Vampire Survivors, 20 Minutes to Dawn, etc. There is more moment-to-moment decision-making by the player than in VS, since some skills fire in the direction your mouse is facing, and you need to pay close attention to damage zones and telegraphed monster attacks to say alive, especially since there is minimal healing, meaning that every hit brings you closer to the end of the run.

The visuals are great for the most part, again outclassing other games in this subgenre. They remind me of Diablo 2/3 in many ways. My only real complaint is that by the late game, the visual field gets quite cluttered, but that was probably inevitable in a game like this. That said, there are some powers that completely overwhelm the screen once you have several area of effect upgrades, like the shockwave spell. Instead of creating a row of stalagmites along the ground, it raises what looks like an entire mountain range, temporarily blocking your view of the entire screen.

Why, then, the negative review? The answer is that even with some additional player input and more creative monster design, the VS subgenre remains cursed by shallow gameplay, and Soulstone Survivors does not manage to innovate out of that problem. The core gameplay loop still revolves around shallow character positioning decisions and a bit of mouse-look, and not much more. Additionally, there is an excessive amount of content gating, which is clearly intended to force the player into extended grinding sessions to pad out gameplay time.

Looking at how much basic grinding was required to achieve even minimal progress, I realized I just didn't care enough about the core gameplay loop to go through the motions in yet another VS clone, no matter how polished. So if you're tired of the VS subgenre, this game probably won't get you interested again.

This game plays itself as you walk in a circle for the entire gameplay loop, and there is close to zero input on the battlefield other than movement and the dodge button. Essentially all attacks happen themselves with zero or almost zero input on their effective function. 

The upgrade system is a farce/grind. Like in basically all games these days, upgrade prices increase insanely per point essentially giving you no choice at all about a build. You are pigeonholed into equally leveling everything up or you're just wasting money. Why is this so common in games now? Skill/talent trees used to mean something and require thought. And they also gave you a chance to express yourself by planning your character with thought and commitment. People just need a grind to become addicted I think, which sells well. **Edit to clarify: my comments about skill/talent trees is regarding permanent upgrades. Upgrades during each run are different and while they provide some choice, basically any choice feels the same as the rest - get skill, enemies explode.

Call me weird but it's troubling that this mindless gameplay is becoming so popular, when in reality the concept of this type of game has so much potential. But they are all almost entirely mindless and seem to thrive off people wanting to see bad guys exploding regardless of how braindead the actual play is. Every single one of these games has too many enemies and explosions for there to be any intricate deeper strategy to the combat. No enemy could actually do something interesting because the whole battle field is just diarrhea splatter and meaningful mechanics wouldn't fit well at the same time.

I hope someone figures this genre out, because it could really be something. But if this is what passes as an incredible job I don't see why anyone would try.",1685473065,1685481334,False,16,4,0.524220049381256104,0,True,False,True

Having an impact on the outcome of the game feels a lot better.

I would recommend the game however it is still not perfect. For example you are supposed to craft new weapons with materials you find which is a neat idea, however the ressources needed aren't very balanced. One weapon for example needs 1.2k of the common ressource while you need 30 of the rare ressource. You get about 200 of the common ressource per mission while you get the uncommon ressource way more. I end up having to farm the common ressources constantly while having a lot of the rare ressources.

* I wish I could try those ""runes"", but Ii looks like too deep into the grind for the unlocks. (opportunity for special events / scenario?)

* Too much statistic can kill the magic / immersion.

+ Lots of variety of skills.
+ Promising for being EA.

Meh:
* Many possible builds. Though only a strict few are viable on higher curse levels.

Cons:
- On higher curse levels you end up circling around your enemies as there's not many other viable strats.
- Too much aoe (everything is an aoe).
- On higher curse levels all enemies end up being bullet sponges.
- Resource gathering for items can take several days or weeks depending on how much time you have on your hands.

TLDR:
Looks promising for being in early access but could do with some balance changes towards higher curse levels.

Also: 
The video they're streaming at the very top of the store page is not representative of higher curse levels, if you'd like to get an idea of what higher curse is like I've linked a short video below.

I love it up until about Curse Level 5 (I think it's called? The level where there's more Lords, more spires spamming AOE, etc.) as it's just an unending stream of red circles to dodge, and not enemies. It's barely even fun and spend more time dodging than fighting. It isn't like this until about Level 5 (V)

I had some of the most fun of this genre up until then and now I have barely any desire to play.

That said, this game is absolutely worth getting and will be a blast even at this stage for most people. I however just don't have fun playing ""DODGE THE RED AOE CIRCLES"" ad nauseam.

Stacks of soulstones just add up all over the map where you just ran away and you have to try and run them around so you can circle around and swoop up all the stuff left behind. My favorites are the arcane weaver the necromancer and the beastlord guy.  I also like the paladin because he has this rare spell that heals you when you attack.

In short - graphics, soundtrack, unbelievable amount of variety and replayability. And lastly - clusterfuck. And that might I add is IN ALPHA.

Long version:

If you are like me, scrolling through games, trying to pick something with an oomph only to fail badly every day - you are in the right place. This game provides hours of fun. Gunfire Reborn was the last game that entertained me this much, and you have to agree, that game is God-tier.

Do you like a challenge? I do, Do you learn fast and can dodge everything like you were born for bullet hell games? Add some curses (difficulty changers) and you'll be lucky to find a spot for dodging. You finish a run under 10 minutes? Lucky you, Now go ahead, challenge yourself and finish 5 runs in a row, with each run getting harder and harder.

Do you hate being limited by skill level caps and just wish you could upgrade your skills until your NASA PC bursts into flames? Here you go. Increase your skills into such lengths, that they'll cover up half of your screen and you'll get an epileptic seizure, even if you never had epilepsy.

Do you love a good banger? This damn soundtrack makes you steal those studio speakers from your job you always wanted, just so you can MacGyver them to your 20 year old amplifier and head-bop while you kill bosses (in-game bosses, don't kill your actual bosses or you won't be able to play this game in prison).

Have you ever wondered what it would be like, to stack 200 stacks of poison in a game on an enemy just to be cucked by more limitations? No worries here mate, there's so many enemy debuffs in this game that stack forever and ever, that they'll go off your screen if you try hard enough.

Do I recommend this game? Yes. Will I finish it soon? I'll let you know in 200 hours of playtime.",1684010083,1684010083,True,78,12,0.819223403930664063,2,True,False,True

TL;DWT: The Core gameplay is actually fun, and its interesting that they added characters with unique skillsets, but the problem comes with a lackluster skillset, both active and passive, Over-scaled enemies and nigh impossible challenges to make any significant ""progress"" which is just unlocking runes and characters at this point. The blacksmith only offers 1 weapon for 6 out of 14 characters and getting extra runic points to get interesting rune combos is tedious. Theres No ""late/end-game content AT ALL, so you'll just be spending all of your hours trying to get sub 12 or sub 10:00 OR trying to pass Curse 3-4. Also, at Curse 5, theres an INVINCIBLE ghost that will ONE SHOT you if you hang around him too long. that's on top of 4 Lords per Boss Wave, 5 Elite Groups, 1 Pillar of Despair per minute, and so much boosted health, range, and damage that the Elites and Lords are guaranteed to air juggle you to full death. Resurrection Points barely make the difference and your only option is to DODGE. DODGE. DODGE. DODGE. DODGE. until you either die or get lucky enough to stack DoT effects AND get Expose Weakness. I gotta say, the only thing this game does better than Vampire Survivors is that it's more animated. That's it.

My critique of the game would mostly be focused on the Skill Tree, its so small and insignificant, there are barely any choices to be made and you max it out fairly quickly anyway. Would prefer an unlimited skill tree where you can spend some extra materials to get 0.1% dmg increase or something. You kinda run out of things to do with your materials pretty quickly. And when I actually needed materials for crafting, it was always the lowest quality materials I was missing. Materials overall needs to be looked out and balanced. 

I don't know how much I'll keep playing now that I've finished it 100%, but either way it's very much worth 10€ for those 80hrs.",1683197962,1683197962,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It's quite an entertaining game. Since it's not that expensive either, I can recommend it, it's fun, I will definitely continue to play it. However, farming is a bit boring for me in the long run and the game loses its appeal relatively quickly. I've tried many different vampire survivor like games and in my opinion there are much more ""exciting"" ones. But overall it's a cool game with unique mechanics and graphics. If you like the game principle, you will definitely have fun with the game, so I can recommend the game, but you should be aware that especially in the late game the grind for upgrades to progress is relatively high and takes a long time, which is a bit boring.",1683150968,1683150968,True,2,0,0.523121356964111328,0,True,False,True

Lots of characters and skills to unlock and the speed at which you can unlock things is very fast, at least at first. It looks like it will take a long time to unlock all the runes. The gameplay itself is very smooth, and it's severely fun toward the end of the run, when you're pumping out so much magic that the whole screen is nuclear. (Turning off your spell graphics is not only possible, but becomes necessary, as there are more and more hazards that you need to dodge, and you can't see anything when the screen is filled with your huge, constant spells.) But no matter how powerful you can get, you're never overpowered. Harder enemies are always sent in. The runs themselves are kinda bite-sized, which I love. You can complete a whole run in 10 minutes, and head back to the title screen with tons of progress. Perfect as a palate cleanser if you're also playing games that have a bigger time investment. Also really nice if you have a bit of time to kill on a lunch break. I imagine this game would be rad on the Steam deck. As far as the negatives, I could use a little more variety in the bosses and the stages. It looks like there are only 5 of each. Be prepared to fight the same boss multiple times per run. I could be wrong, but that's what it looks like so far. And although it looks like there are a lot of classes, they're not really all that different. They each get stat modifiers that only matter in the early part of a run, before you start buffing the hell out of everything. Their starting ability is always different, but they all use 6 out of the bank of 12(??) types of damage in the game.

EDIT: I still wish there was more variety in stages and bosses. But after playing awhile longer and unlocking the later classes, there's more variety there than I thought. The main difference between classes, other than stats, is your starting ability (or abilities, each weapon has up to 2), which is unique to that class and that weapon. I still play this game even after getting every achievement and unlocking everything. Developers, please give me more reasons to grind this masterpiece.

EDIT 2: I'm not sure why I'm about to ask this, since it would lengthen my play time even more, but here goes. Could we do something about getting hung up on trees? 75% of my runs end not because I get overrun by the infinite army, but because I get hung up on tree geometry. In a game where you have similar destructible objects like crate piles and stalagmites, you're telling me I can't chop down a little tree? And said trees will almost always lead to my demise? I don't believe you. This game is about fighting a huge army that never ends, and yet that army is powerless to stop me unless the pine tree holds me down. The pine tree, which doesn't attack at all and does zero damage, and smells nice to boot. Come to think of it, maybe you could just let us zoom out a bit. After 3 rounds of boss rush, not being able to see more of the stage (and the deadly pine trees) is really what kills us. And please, take what I'm saying with a grain of salt. This is a great game and it almost never annoys me, and after mowing down a few thousand enemies over 45 minutes, I'm kindof hoping to get stuck on a pine tree and die, so I can stop playing. It just hurts my brain, not being able to chop those sons of birches.",1679817675,1683112057,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

[i] Obligatory intro [/i] ""I am a Vampire survivors fan"". Played and beat it on PC and Mobile, so another game that apeared about same time with the same surname piqued interest but I decided to buy it only recently and I would say that the game is good, for the first 15-20 hours. After you unlock most of the content i.e. characters, runes, talents and weapons, you shall notice that the game is not that diverse as you want it to. The lvl up perks are closely tied to numerous passives like aoe, dmg, frequency etc of all attacks and you just buff your character with stats over and over again which at some point become tedious. It is not like other games of the same genre are different but for some reason VA feels different and fresh.

Cons: 
- The main currency, which is minor soulstones becomes obsolete after you buy all of the skill tree. You will be swamped with millions of them shortly with no place to spend them
- The character specific runes are sad and pointless
- All of the characters have almost similiar stats and you will find yourself using between 3-4 builds after some time.
- OSTs are there just because
- Last char is difficult to use when you play on higher curse levels and which is excatly when you shall unlock him
- Some weapons are useless and have no place in any of the build

Pros:
- Little to no lags on average PC
- Sexy visuals
- The game becomes quite difficult at some point and you will be pressed to actually think about your build
- Great time killer

As mentioned before it become a bit more challenging to play at this moment, which is the main reason I am still invested in playing and beating the game. It also mostly matter of actual skill rather than grind which feels nice.

The gameplay loop sucks, the bosses 1 shot you and have too much HP and all the classes suck except the necromancer. You'll end up running circles around the arena slowly chipping away at the bosses for 30 minutes every run regardless of how much damage you stack or what abilities you pick. Every run will feel the same regardless of skill or knowledge.

Below is my previous review at 13.6 hours.

Fun game, it's like diablo 3 where vampire survivors is diablo 2.
The graphics are nice, the skills and abilities have an identity, each character has some cool stuff going on, the sound track is an absolute banger but each stage only has the single song so it gets pretty repetitive.

Some gripes I have:
-You can't see shit, because of the game perspective being angled instead of straight top down it makes it impossible to see anything when abilities have an infinite/tall y-axis visual, there's just too many things on screen for you to be able to dodge anything, there's some skills that just completely cover your vision such as Smite (AoE ability that casts down beams of light) that block your vision entirely.
When you can see what's going on it looks amazing but the second you pick an ability that destroys your ability to see and in turn dodge attacks it breaks the experience.

-It feels super grindy but lacks the variety to make grinding fun, you've got several characters which admittedly do spice things up and each character you can level up by playing them but it'll be on the same 5 stages, the stages do have unique enemies per stage but they all play the same (enemy puts red under your feet, you move out of the circle), the bosses are static regardless of what stage you pick and they all feel relatively similar where it's just a big dude that casts a giant AOE at you

-The passive skill tree (the one you can level up for like +1% stats) is pretty tiny and fast to max out, leaving you with nothing to spend your money on apart from unlocking characters, so grinding for money/exp becomes relatively pointless and you're left with grinding character levels which seem to only unlock runes (weird passives) or alternate weapons.

-The end game boils down to a system similar to the system in Hades, but instead of ""Heat"" you have ""Curse"" and instead of gradually increasing your ""Heat"" you have to max out to unlock the next tier of ""Curse"" and then max that out to reach the next tier which begs the question why have the ""Heat"" system if it's just difficulty tiers? It's like Diablo 3's Torment all over again but instead of just being a global difficulty you have to do every tier on each map separately, meaning you have to complete a run with curse tier 1, then tier 2, then tier 3 etc for EACH map.",1682637018,1682879893,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

► Vibrant graphics with no slowdown even when the screen is utter chaos.

► Gets repetitive quickly.
► Characters move too slow, must CONSTANTLY spam dash as the ground is perpetually red with incoming damage.
► All the many abilities start to feel the same. After a while, my choices do not feel like choices. Why pick one mess of flashing colors over another?
► Unlocked entire tree with millions of extra points. All feeling of growth and progression just falls off a cliff.
► [b]STILL[/b] [i]Way too many[/i] effects cluttering the screen. At a certain point, the ground is nothing but red (damage) places and I cannot see them. 

Going to the settings and disabling ""Tool-Tip popups on mouse-over"" is a MUST and should be checked as a default. It's maddening. Adding in the text banner that randomly pops up saying ""Defeat Enemies to Summon Lords!"" is incredibly obnoxious. I mean once is fine, but not only is there a permanent counter in the upper right that tells you this consonantly, it's the whole point of the game.
Maybe disable that ""helpful message"" from covering the already chaotic screen when the user disables tips?

I still can't believe the Devs left the  ""Defeat Enemies to Summon Lords!"" message in the game. Like... defeating enemies is the [b]only[/b] thing you [i]can[/i] do. Who is this message for? Why does it fill the screen so often? Decisions like this that haven't been fixed gives me little hope

It takes the classic 'Survivors' formula and elevates it to a level that is truly beyond what a normal human brain can understand and process. The attention to detail, the depth of gameplay, and the overall experience that this game provides is truly unparalleled.

From the moment you start playing, you'll be drawn into a world that is both beautiful and terrifying, filled with thousands of monsters coming to get you. The game's visuals are low poly but stunning, with richly detailed environments that are both awe-inspiring and haunting. The sound design is equally impressive, with a nice pumped up score and sound effects that will send chills down your spine while you mow down billions of monsters and bosses on screen.

After one hour, you will feel euphoria never before experienced in your mere existence, it's like TAKING a punch to your BRAIN, as one of my friends Veraxx said.

But it's not just the aesthetics of the game that make it so impressive. The gameplay itself is a masterpiece of design. It takes the classic 'Survivors' formula and expands upon it in ways that are truly remarkable. You'll find yourself facing challenges that you never thought possible, and you'll need to use every skill and tool at your disposal to overcome them.

The game's mechanics are incredibly deep and complex, yet they are also incredibly intuitive. You'll never feel overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information that you need to keep track of, yet you'll always be challenged to think creatively and strategically. The game's difficulty curve is perfect, gradually ramping up the challenges as you progress, without ever feeling unfair or frustrating. Having over 6 bosses on screen at one time in higher difficulty levels will feel intense and amazing!

Though it does not have the visual or audio appeal of Vampire Survivors, or the perfectly balanced challenging-but-fair difficulty of 20 Minutes, Soulstone Survivors carves out an excellent in between-niche that fills my personal craving for crazy effects, big numbers, and creative weapons.

While there are tons of upgrades and abilities to choose from, the devs made an intelligent decision to limit what specific categories could be pulled from for each character, though this can be altered with the currently basic but interesting Rune system. This allows them to craft abilities which retread already covered ground, with a slight twist, while reducing bloat and maintaining what makes each character unique. On top of the wide variety of abilities you can select in a run, each character currently has three weapons to craft and choose from before a run begins, shaking up their gameplay with adjusted stats, or creating a focal point to form themed builds around thanks to their two built-in unique abilities.

On the character front, some have been given more care than others. Pyromancer, Arcane Weaver, Elementalist, and Chaoswalker share the heaviest overlap of skill sets, and all four of them have Arcane available to them - currently what I believe to be the most powerful skill set, alongside Holy. This ends up routing their builds down similar paths, though this is to be expected, as the three ""pure magic"" classes of the game. But from what we've recently seen in the Death Knight, an incredibly unique character who cannot dodge, but rides around on his steed at high speed and cannot be knocked back, future characters will likely avoid this problem with more complex design. I would love to see this level of complexity reflect back onto the older characters with balance changes in the future. Perhaps Pyromancer could deal Fire damage faster than other characters, or enemies in contact with one another spread the effect.

On the enemy front, Soulstone Survivors has the most involved elites and bosses I've seen of any game in the genre. Elites each have two attacks (Other than the very basic large goblin elites, who deserve a little love.), and bosses have four. This FAR exceeds 20 Minutes one or two attack roster, and with the large variety of elites you can find on each stage, their appearance can shake up a situation immediately. I cannot entirely say the same for bosses, due to how few there are currently. Most of their attacks are actually quite homogeneous, and just create clutter on the screen. Beams are quite popular among Lords of the Void. I do still enjoy them, and each additional boss will only increase my enjoyment. Can't wait for that one with the anchor! Alongside all of this, the devs are crafting a unique set of enemies for each available stage. Currently only one has a set of exclusive enemies, but I'm excited to see what else they put out.

Music and audio can be a bit bland. I do enjoy the strange brand of electronic synth jungle the devs have gone with, and its relaxed tone pairs well with normal gameplay. Bosses share a single track, appropriately amped up for their appearance. I'm no musical expert, but I can say with confidence that I do not personally find these track memorable, outside of their suitability for their given context. (I do remember the ""ahh ehh ohh"" part from that one track, but I believe that's the fault of a certain ""jerm"" in my brain.)

Earlier I mentioned crafting, and it's by far the worst part of this otherwise great game. Materials are obtained in game by destroying ore nodes. At the lowest difficulty of each stage, only common metals and uncommon jewels are available to find, but a new ore spawns as you increase the difficulty, up to tier 6, when bosses drop their essence. Currently, you only need up to rare materials to craft every weapon. But... you'll need a lot. Far too much to get in a single run. In a game with such an intentionally designed short, sweet, and simple gameplay loop, farming materials becomes a boring chore that currently cannot be alleviated by the game's available content. Crafting weapons is the endgame (outside of speedrunning), and it goes on a fair bit longer than I enjoyed. Hopefully the material requirements are lowered in the future.

Other than my weapon crafting complaint, I think of Soulstone Survivors as an excellent and unique addition to the expanding Bullet Heaven genre, with entertaining, fresh ideas, and a clear roadmap which has me excited for everything this game will have to offer in the future. Not super excited for the weapon grind though.

While the game has some flaws, including a lack of variety in enemy types and repetitive gameplay, its strengths, including its deep customization options and challenging gameplay, make it a worthwhile play for fans of the genre.

Pros:

Deep customization options: Soulstone Survivors offers a wide range of customization options for your character, including weapons, armor, and abilities. This allows you to tailor your playstyle to your preferences and experiment with different builds.

Challenging gameplay: The game is challenging and requires strategy, quick thinking, and skill to survive. You'll need to manage your resources carefully and make tough decisions to stay alive in the harsh and unforgiving world.

Immersive world: The game's world is rich and detailed, immersing you in its dark and mysterious atmosphere. From the eerie ruins to the haunting forests, every detail has been carefully crafted to create a sense of dread and tension.

RPG elements: Soulstone Survivors features RPG elements, including character customization and skill trees. This allows you to develop your character and grow stronger over time.

Replayability: The game has a high level of replayability, with multiple endings and branching paths based on your choices. The game also features randomized events and encounters that keep each playthrough fresh and exciting.

Cons:

Lack of variety in enemy types: While the game features a variety of enemies to fight, they can start to feel repetitive over time. More enemy types or variations could have added more diversity to the game.

Repetitive gameplay: While the game has a lot of variety in its environments, the gameplay can become repetitive over time. The missions and objectives can feel similar, and the game's level design is not particularly varied.

Steep learning curve: Soulstone Survivors can be overwhelming for new players, with a steep learning curve and complex systems to master. This can be discouraging for some, but the game's depth and customization options make it worth the effort.

Technical issues: The game has been known to have occasional technical issues, including crashes and performance problems. While these issues are not constant, they can be frustrating when they do occur.

Limited character movement: The movement system in Soulstone Survivors is somewhat limited, with characters unable to jump or climb. This can make the game feel restrictive at times and can be frustrating when trying to navigate around obstacles.

Overall, Soulstone Survivors is an enjoyable and engaging game that successfully combines survival and RPG elements to create a unique and immersive experience. While the game has its flaws, including a lack of variety in enemy types and repetitive gameplay, its strengths, including its deep customization options and challenging gameplay, make it a worthwhile play for fans of the genre.

For as much as this game is compared to Vampire Survivors, I was hoping for much more. The overall gameplay loop isn't bad, but right now there are essentially no differences between the 5 current stages, the mobs, or the bosses. The only real difference at this point is the addition of ""curses"" which add increasingly difficulty to those mobs, bosses, & modifiers.

As I said earlier, the overall gameplay loop isn't bad. The unlockable characters and abilities are a decent start, but the game needs a significant amount more depth before really being enjoyable beyond a few hours. I rapidly found that I had all the major abilities and characters unlocked, and had little left to do rather than grind through the same stages over and over in order to unlock character weapons and runes, which aren't enough to carry the game in its present form.

Yes, it adds enough new gameplay twists to warrant it being a separate game. Yes, it is enjoyable and distinct enough to be a separate addition to any game library. Yes, it is worth the price tag and more.

----

'Vampire Survivors' genre of game where your skills are automatically used combined with the '20 Minutes Till Dawn'-style of aiming your abilities. Has a healthy amount of meta progression outside of a run similar to games like 'Heroes of Hammerwatch' that increase your character's effectiveness, strength, defense, ability usage, etc. during a run. Unlike other games with meta progression (a la 'Vampire Survivors'), it is not strictly necessary to have a successful run.

The game is much easier than other games within its genre/style and that is in thanks part due to the fact you can create a build fairly easily and are not pigeon-holed into a specific style of build or ability archetypes. You can make almost any build work and that's awesome for feeling powerful.

The game is $10 and has an amount of content that puts other more expensive AAA and Indie titles to shame in terms of characters, weapons, and archetypes. While the ""Runic Powers"" or ""Meta Game Progression"" is fairly basic and easy to understand, there are dozens of characters and each one has multiple weapons to choose from. There are several ways to play each character and several ways more to build within any singular skill. One downside to this is of course is the fact that it does seem to diminish the ""uniqueness"" of each character because they are versatile enough to be used in similar builds; however, each character still does have a slight feel of uniqueness enough to warrant being separate from one another. Just don't expect a drastic gameplay-shifting style between them.

Want to go crit? Go for it.
Want to go ability spam? Go for it.
Want to go Damage over Time? Go for it.

All three of those archetypes (not all encompassing) can nearly be used effectively on any skill you choose to build around. Hell, you can even choose to completely ignore or dump the starting weapon/character skill and replace it if you want.

Graphics are good for the game. Visual clarity gets a bit burdensome at times due to the art style, the sheer amount of damage you'll be doing, and the number of enemies on the screen. Thankfully, there are a few key graphics/de-clutter options you can enable in the settings to alleviate this problem. Overall, it's not an issue I've experienced so far. The graphics will not blow you away by any means but they serve their purpose.

Music is pretty good. Some songs are better than others but I have not yet muted the in-game music which is a usual sign of it be a pleasure to listen to. So far I have not heard anything that is ""annoying"" that would change this stance.

Overall: If you are looking for a rougelike game with action similar to '20 Minutes Till Dawn', 'Vampire Survivors', and meta progression of 'Heroes of Hammerwatch' this is without a doubt worthy of its $10 price tag.",1681291295,1681291295,True,22,2,0.719955265522003174,0,True,False,True

SS gives a different, more modern, vibe to the whole twin-stick, ARPG-Roguelite thing. I play as a Chaos sorcerer. Debuff City, here we come! Visually, SS won't strain a decent computer, but on Steam Deck it can lag a bit, especially with holy skills. This is early access, though, so optimization for Deck should happen. As with other EA games, you are supporting the devs, and while the level of customization that VS had isn't there yet, SS is challenging and provides a decent set of options as-is. There are clearly more things planned at release. 

Overall, grabbing this is definitely worth it. If you have had enough of Vampire Survivors (or just want something different) then this may be up your alley.

One of the things that I really enjoy about this game is the controller support - it's very responsive and intuitive, which makes it easy to dive right into the game without any frustration.

Another great feature of the game is the ability to turn down the spell effects. This makes it easier to see what's happening during intense battles, which adds to the overall experience of the game. The upgrade system is also a lot of fun - it's a satisfying grind that keeps you coming back for more.

One of the things that really sets Soulstone Survivors apart from other games is the variety of classes available. Each class feels unique and offers a different playstyle, so you can find the one that suits you best. The build variety is also fantastic, giving you lots of options to customize your character and tailor your strategy to your playstyle.

Overall, I highly recommend Soulstone Survivors to anyone looking for a fun and engaging action roguelike that offers lots of replayability. The fast-paced action, controller support, upgrade system, and variety of classes and builds make this game a must-play for fans of the genre.

-a lot of different characters and weapons even in the current state
-I saw some reviews saying that events are time locked, thats not true you can get all the achievements AND the newest one is the most fun for me and even the boss is pretty fun to play, I feel like secret harder bosses with mechanics is a nice way of progressig the difficulty of the game without making it feel unfair

First of all, the balance of this game is completely wack, even for early development. The variety of builds that actually are fun are extremely limited, with only a handful of strategies being able to access the endless content where you can go for personal bests. This is due to a time constraint where you have to win in under 12 minutes, which is virtually impossible on the highest difficulty (Curse VII), without a broken ass build. As a consequence, the meta strategies are 2easy 2cheesy and anything else is mega ultra hard mode.

Second, this game looks bad. And even if it did look good, nobody would know it because you have to completely nuke the graphics the higher you climb for visibility and so the game will run like it's supposed to. The enemy designs are mostly uniform but even the unique ones are very distasteful. This is in conjunction with the UI being so bloated with completely useless information that you cannot get rid of. A third of your screen will eventually just be health bars, objectives, and upgrades.

Lastly, this game is unrewarding. Without runes, which are achievement-based rewards that make your character stronger, you have basically no shot at beating any serious difficulty or infinite mode. This basically means the first 100 runs are an unlock-a-thon, which creates a completely unnecessary grind that once at the end, you're left with nothing to do. The general unlocks of the game feel weirdly paced and have almost no satisfaction once achieved. I've played almost all the way through the game, and only like a handful a characters and only go for a handful of abilities because the rest simply don't work or make the game trivial. Not to mention that after 54 hours, I can't even say I've been able to upgrade everything completely. That is an insane amount of grind that I simply can't bother to do anymore.

Overall, this game has many, many flaws. Most people who take it seriously are confined in a restrictive, dominant meta that makes the game severely neutered. Higher difficulties feel like a punishment when playing for completion, or personal achievement. What's the point of a survivor game that gets less rewarding the more you play it?

The combat loop is okay. It adds a directional control gimmick over something like Vampire Survivors. While this adds a bit of depth it also removes some of the 'chillness' of Vampire Survivors. 
Where the game really falls short is with the scaling, to the point where I am not confident that the developers understand how the mechanics interact. Choosing defensive upgrades is essentially never worth it as the enemy damage scales so much faster than your defense could even if you only chose defensive upgrades. Bosses always OHKO you even if you have close to 400 health. Comically, some of the 'Rare' upgrades will reduce the damage taken by 1 - 2. Ironically, the permanent upgrades for defense are some of the most expensive which really calls the developers judgement into question.
 This is further compounded by the health scaling of the enemies, which easily gets into the millions after a few rounds in endless. Because of this, all of the games really feel the same.",1680465485,1680465485,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Cons:
Spamming skill radius or size skills breaks the graphics ( there is an option to reduce the number of effects but somehow takes away the pleasure of seeing skills

Doesn't support mods would be a pro if it did and more sandbox options

There are however some FPS/optimization issues when all your skills recursively proc damage over time effects--to then recursively proc the skills you just cast, repeating the fun all over again... though I'd still stack the multicast stat over and over again, heh. 10/10, would definitely get killed by a frame lag death by a monster attack I physically couldn't see on curse 40+, many times more 😅

+ Good value for an Early Access ""Bullet Heaven"" title, starting off quite mild in difficulty but ramping up in the higher ""curse"" modes. Still actively being developed with new content added & existing content reworked just prior to this review.

+ The graphics are bright, colourful, clean and mostly quite readable; enemy attacks and spells are indicated by red circles, power ups are nice shiny ""soulstones"", with huge ones dropping from boss kills. Graphical Effects opacity can be lowered to avoid the dreaded flare outs where players would otherwise be unable to see anything.

+ There are numerous characters, weapons, runes and bits of seasonal content to unlock and explore. Certain combinations will prove extremely lucrative (while others, not so much).

+ The lack of hard caps on player passive stats (damage, crit chance, crit damage, cooldown reduction, move speed, etc) allows for some crazy possibilities in Overlord and Endless modes. It's fun to run wild with this and your favourite characters/skills/runes.

- Player death will usually occur because of knockback (from exploding barrel goblins spawning on the player) combined with giant boss Area of Effect attacks (global lasers, boomerang saw blades, overlaid expanding cone attacks) or several of the other one-hit-kill Elite attacks with less than a third of a second's warning from the red indicators.

- All the armor, life and damage reduction in the world cannot prevent one-hit-kills in higher curse modes - only player dodging and constant awareness.

- There are ways to exploit certain character, skill and rune combinations to crush the hardest difficulties very quickly and kill every boss long before they can appear on your screen; there's a lot of room for better balancing here.

This is an Early Access product still under active development with the potential for sweeping changes in the future. At present, it is a conditional recommendation for fans of the genre, with the aforementioned negative factors disclaimed.",1679945366,1679945366,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It is repetitive and grindy, as with any roguelike/vampire survivors-like, so if you don't like to sit there and play for 30+ minutes killing things just to get slightly stronger, then this won't be for you.

It's in Early Access but still has tons to do. You can unlock new and fun classes (14 of them so far) each with their own unique skills (3 per class) and 3 weapons per class each with their own unique stats and skills. As well as a skill tree and a rune system which changes how you can play certain classes or even amplify certain builds. Tons of achievements too if you're an achievement hunter then you'll be in heaven. On top of that achievements also unlock skills, runes and runic power (how many runes you can equip as each rune costs X amount of power to equip), they're not purely just for show, so you get a lot of bang for your buck here.

Not to mention the devs do events for holidays and make them permanent, so if you miss an event you can still and always will have the option to unlock special ""seasonal"" skills. There's a lot of love here and it really shows. 

If you like Vampire Survivors, or any of the other myriad of so called ""reverse bullet hell"" or ""bulletheaven"" games, then this game is absolutely 10,000% worth your time.

A lot of spells are under-tuned (melee and fire spells for sure) especially for higher difficulty levels and the bosses can utterly zone you out with the AOE spam, which is a severe issue if you are applying runes for 3+ bosses. Melee spells are often an auto-pass as you are relying on rng for area modifiers so you can hit them at the edge of the screen, but then they hit like wet noodles... There also seems to be RNG on the RNG. I have basically built the same characters on different runs and couldn't tell why one run I was melting every thing and the next I couldn't even kill an elite. Some characters are inherently melting machines, while others are a hard pass. This may not be the place to give feedback to the devs, but I can't give a thumbs up to a game that has a tendency to frustrate me consistently.

There are some things I would add or change about this game though 1. Make the character more unique from one another, most of them still kinda play the same and are to similar to eachother, my suggestion to fix this would just be to give or atleast push each character more in the direction of their ""playstyle"" cause i find it boring seeing the same lightning, ice, fire etc on most of the characters. Reworking this would ofcourse take time but it would be a huge benefit for replayabilty (i dont feel like weapons give enough uniqueness to characters, its more like a small change for the character youve already played enough to start to get bored) 2. This one feels kinda obvious but more levels cause seeing what you guys have done to the first one is really nice and why wouldnt you want more of something nice 3. More engaging bosses and unique bosses, like theyre good but they can be better, maybe they could force you to walk to an area or maybe they could pull you closer idk, id just like to see more variety 4. (some character ideas id like to see) chronomancer, necromancer, polymorpher and alchemist I think thats it for now, last things i will name off are just some things that i like 1. Doom status effect, its unique and works towards an interesting build 2. the style for the game, it fits the gameplay and still works well with the flashiness of the abilities 3. the design of the characters, they look cool and clearly have their own archetypes just sad that they dont represent themselves enough just yet 4. while i dislike seeing almost the same abilities on what feels like every character, i do like them, they are a nice ground set of abilities now the game just needs more special elements or archetypes (such as doom) 5. the maps, they all look different and i know you guys are working on making them even more unique from each other, a tip to make maps more unique could be map mechanics, like needing to keep warm in the snow map or needing to watch out for traps on the fifth level (dont know what to call it and i dont remember the name) 6. simple note but the most important, fun combat overall really great game and worth the price, make the character more unique and id even argue it could be worth more",1679791359,1679825058,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True

It's super fun and visually appealing, with good class variety which has already garnered multiple tens of hours of play from me, and more come! It has a wide variety of Achievements which make it intuitive to farm new skills, weapons, and runes in-game, and traditional but-well placed stat tree to improve your characters as you do. There's an easy-to-understand crafting system which tells exactly what you need and where to find it. And lastly, the soundtrack in this game freaking ROCKS. I had 3 of my friends pick up this game as well, we've all been having a blast and this is a nice edition to any collection, if you like mass monster slaying, customizing character builds, or just something you can play that's non-committal. However SSS isn't without it's flaws. The gameplay loop is exactly what you would expect from other games that share this genre. You'll have hordes of monsters chucked at you (which is great!), until they inevitably out scale you can you can't win anymore and at the highest difficulty of the game, you're just running from a literal non-stop barrage of telegraphed attacks that if you stop, you'll die immediately. They recently released a dev note saying they want to make each level feel unique and different, but the core gameplay mechanic is actually too fast for have meaningful individual interactions with specific monsters. These devs are probably working really hard on these monsters types and level/boss design according to their vision, but I'm just noting that part of that is lost due to the tempo of a game. It's like taking a road trip, but instead of appreciating the sights and enjoying local food, you just do 120 mph and stop at gas stations only because it's mandatory. Overall, this is a great product and and I look forward to the new changes they've discussed as they expanded their team a bit, as of the time of writing.

Last two updates I've only played two runs after the update because I went in and I saw they just added more spells to clog the pool or new weapons which require thousands of materials to grind, but they haven't done anything with their horrible balance, neither added much needed QoL features (like maybe standarize a bit the debuff effects, or have different profiles for curses, so I don't have to deselect and reselect every time I want to change 20 things in the curses, etc).At this state I'd only recommend the game if you're a casual who is not gonna try and challenge higher difficulties (don't get me wrong, I've beaten max curse in every map, it's just not fun to do so, and you also need X character with X spells or you're fucked, and I think that isn't something you want to happen).",1679758717,1679758717,False,3,0,0.528301894664764404,0,True,False,True

It's fun to have area of effect indicators from mobs so you can skillfully weave or dodge through them but it is in no way fun to have half your screen completely covered in overlapping red circles with zero chance at outplay and then being juggled to death.So if you like the the roguelite survival games you'll definitely enjoy the game for a while but I'm willing to bet you'll straight up hit a wall at higher tiers where it doesn't feel rewarding and the only chance of willing is whether you get the right abilities randomly offered which allow you to snowball faster than the stage can pressure you.",1679754310,1679754310,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It has lots to unlock and do and has some really unique skills that stand out. However it has its fair share of problems right now. while it has something like 100 skills the majority of them are simply cut and paste jobs like a bolt thats either, ice, fire, poison, arcane etc..  this makes things worse as you unlock them as it waters down the pool of good unique skills where it gets to the point of getting frustrated as you used all your re-rerolls and cannot get that 1 skill that links the others up and your builds fall apart. Because of this despite the millions of combinations of skills though all games kinda feel the same. There is no OP build or weak build despite the mechanics in the game. You only win if you move about enough and dont make mistakes. This is a twitch(not the streaming platform) movement game disguised as a rogue-lite.

However, saying that if you just want to sink tons of hours into a game and unlock stuff its great. It just lacks the variety you would think it does when you see the sheer amount of skills. This is early access though so I fully expect things to change and the game be even better over time. Therefore I am not too bothered about the lack of variety in skills. 

My main issue with this game is the random crashes. I would be in the middle of a 2 hour run and it just close. The crash dumps say its a unity error and nothing more. I along with many others have reported this to the dev who simply blame me and others. Saying graphics drivers are either out of date or corrupt or we have overclocked our systems. This is the ONLY game in my massive library that crashes consistantly with my setup, other unity games like Valheim I have played for 10+ hours with zero crashes. I have removed XMP off my RAM, re-installed my GPU drivers using DDU in safe mode and run as admin and still crashes. Its clearly an issue with the game and the devs are simply burying their head in the sand with this. I have near 30 hours in the game but most of that is redoing content i have already done. I have also played too long for a refund too now. 

So be aware while this game is fun at times the devs are not the best and I even sent them a crash dump for them to ignore and blame my pc instead.",1679437366,1679437366,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True

You can customize your build a lot more and it normally gets harder the longer you play.  Vampire Survivors basically waits for the 30 min mark every time you are fully upgraded.  I love the Dash ability to make the battle more engaging.  Love some of the mechanics of the skills.  

Melee skills are still very bad though.  Like you can't possibly Stab a boss back to get damage bonus when you have like 10 other Elites shooting at you!!  Assassin is horrible. 

 They just need to create more Skill and Backsmith for the real access because I've unlocked all characters and weapons and I have like hundreds of Stones that I don't want to do with.  I would like to customize each character more.  Give each character something that's worth upgrading for that costs VERY EXPENSIVE stones.  I love grinding a game like this.  

For example, the Hound Hunter with Dog can upgrade his 3 dogs through very expensive upgrade.  Maybe the dogs can go out and collect stones for him!  lol  Just a silly idea. 

I have played 11 hours on Friday and then 12 hours on Saturday.  I just bought it on March 16, 2023!  Keep doing the great job dev.

Give more Buffs/Debuffs like Melee strikes has a chance to Leech Life.  Or a Buff that makes the triggering radius of Mines much bigger so people can go for Mine specialization easier.

As is customary in recent months:
[list]
[*]All of your weapons auto-fire. Some (but not all) have auto aim.
[*]Defeated enemies will drop little gems which serve as your XP. They must be collected to gain the benefit.
[*]When you level up, RNG deals you multiple upgrades or additional weapons to choose between.
[*]In-game achievements are the mechanism to unlock new characters, skills, and upgrades.
[/list]
Unlike many other recent twinsticks, success is not specific to surviving a set duration. Instead, defeating a quota of regular enemies will cause a boss to spawn, and clearing 5 boss events unlocks the exit.

Each playable character has a different starting weapon. The numerous other weapons and skills all belong to a big shared pool, but certain types are weighted in likelihood depending on which character you're playing in a given run (mage characters seem to be dealt physical skills less often).

In addition to the expected stat upgrades (do more damage, move faster, raise your maxHP, etc), you will also be offered upgrades that are specific to a skill (eg ""fireball does more damage"") or specific to a [i]category[/i] of skills (eg ""all of your Poison skills cover a larger area"") as well as upgrades that give a chance to piggyback negative status conditions onto any enemy struck by your attacks. 

A lot of the recent twinsticks have been lowish-rez pixel sprite affairs with enough abstraction that you can have almost a bird's-eye view of the map but still see your character & the enemies from what is effectively a side-view. This doesn't really translate well in 3D presentations, so you end up with a 45ish-degree tilt camera, which [i]for the most part[/i] gets the job done. Unfortunately, adding any tall features to the map (trees, for example) will result in situations where scenery obstructs your view of part of the arena.

The up-side is that polygons allow for very clean scaling (many of these games allow you to gradually increase the actual size of your attacks, which ends up looking very chunky in games that use pixel sprites).

As of this writing there are 5 maps, all of which take roughly the same gameplay approach in that they are large squarish arenas with indestructible set dressing scattered around. Some maps have more clumsy scenery that will find you getting stuck and unable to avoid incoming attacks.
Each map also has multiple types of mineral resources which you can collect if you spot them while dodging swarms. Most of these resources currently go unused, but some of them are used to purchase alternate starting weapons for your characters. The minerals vary from map to map, giving you a meaningful reason to replay maps that aren't your favorite.

Players can replay stages with additional difficulty features which will improve rewards, and replaying an already-beaten difficulty will allow the player to continue on to a harder stage instead of ending the run. Extending a run can be dangerous, not just because the enemies will be stronger, but because highly-upgraded attack size & attack frequency can make it impossible to see anything that's happening on screen.

Write a review and expand upon it when I've gotten a couple more hours in.

So, we're starting with around 2 1/2 hours played. I am personally very familiar with this  ""genre"" of games - I've racked up easily more than a 100 hours in VS and others like it. And yet, I can only describe starting the game for the first time as bizarre. There's no tutorial, no tooltips, no nothing guiding you to what to do. The only thing that eventually makes you hit the ""Fight"" button (which starts your run), is the fact that you can't do anything else in all the other menus for lack of currency. Even in-game, the only thing you get is an annoying tool-tip that pops up every minute or so, telling you to ""slay monsters to summon the lord"", as if I can literally do anything else. This tool-tip doesn't help, and it's still there after you've already played for an hour, so what gives? 
I am not new to any of the concepts in Soulstone Survivors, yet it expects this in such a way I can only label as feeling ""unfriendly"". It's like going to a supermarket and having the cashier just silently stare at you. You know you're going to have to pay up whatever amount is on the register, that's how it always goes. But not being prompted to do so would still feel like that cashier is exceedingly unfriendly.

Weird metaphore aside, gameplay so far simply doesn't make me want to play more. The only upgrades you collect are literal stat-stick upgrades for your weapons (active skills, as they're called here), 10% more damage here, 10% more size there, some casting speed (cooldown reduction), multicast chance (% to cast multiple times) and that's it. You're just linearily collecting stat upgrades as you go, there's no power spikes, no changed animations (a % size doesn't count), nothing to give you a marker for player strength progress during a run. It makes me not know what to work towards and it bores me to no end. I do like however that you can swap actives as you wish - even though you lose upgrades when you do, so it's not particularly incentivised.

All in all, Soulstone Survivors has the right idea, but execution just isn't there for me (yet?). I'll continue to play a bit more and who knows, maybe there's mechanics I've missed or haven't unlocked yet that make everything click in place - I'll update this review as I go, but for now, I wouldn't recommend this to my friends to play with me.",1679220973,1679220973,False,0,0,0.472440958023071289,0,True,False,True

Previously you had 3 character, each with 2 weapons to choose between. Some powers to purchase that gave minor help to your characters.

Now:
- A larger roster of ca. 15 characters.
- Option of 2-3 weapons per character, obtained by crafting.
- Prestige levels to show progress.
- 5 unique maps, each with different enemies and resources.
- Curse intensity to challenge yourself.
- Option to Quit, go Endless or enter Boss Rush after finishing a stage.
- Proper end screen with statistics.
- TONS of runes to help boost your future runs.
- Achievements with in-game unlocks attached to them.

I recommend this game, with a caveat: I do not recommend this dev team.

Soulstone Survivors is great, everything you want in a Survivors genre game, you can pump hours into it (and I have) and still feel challenged.

But splitting up focus while the game is still in early access to make Rogue Soulstone is disgusting. That game is looking like 1:1 Soulstone Survivors with a different camera angle. It's double dipping, and I won't be supporting it. Finish the vision, and then move on. All I'm seeing here is a greedy dev team that screams ""your support isn't enough.""

Past that, the game shows what it truly is: a shallow, tedious and poorly designed grindfest for shiny rocks with a game loop less fun than a visit to the dentist.

Most skills suck and are copy-pasted all over the place with different colors, and unlocking new ones just worsens your chances of finding good stuff. All characters play and feel the same apart from a couple ones with unique failed gimmicks (e.g. a character who can't dodge and another one with pets who die within seconds).

There are no weapon synergies or fun modifiers, all you do is increase numerical values like damage, area of effect and cooldown reduction until numbers don't mean anything anymore. Having your screen filled with giant hammers is hilarious at first until you realise said giant hammers barely tickle the damage sponges that serve as enemies and bosses, thanks to their grossly inflated health pool.

And you better tone VFX down to the minimum if you want to get out of the bazillion red circles the game constantly throws at you while you spam dodges and hope you don't hit a tree in the process because it would slow you for half a second, which is more than enough time to get one shot.

The developers -I mean the people doing the code since game design is apparently covered by some random clueless people on Discord- have the audacity to ask for 10€ for this game (I guess adding a 3rd dimension is expensive), but you can buy at least two much better roguelites with that cash.

This game has a huge amount of meta progression, and while it's not uncommon for this genre to feature meta progression, it is so much that the game really is just about filling bars for hours and hours before all the systems are actually opened up.  Now, if that is a thing you want to do, then feel free to disregard my thoughts - this might be a game for you!

If you can get over the dozens of hours of nothing but grinding the meta progression mountain, this game has another problem:  The presentation gets in the way of play-ability.  Your own spell effects become so noisy that they cover the entire screen rendering the enemies, their spell effects, and their pre-vises invisible.  Now, this could be an interesting element to think about: ""How do I make choices such that the screen is still readable by limiting the visual noise of my spell effects"", but if that is indeed the intent, then I point to the sign at the top of this review:  The goals of the game suck.

Besides that, there really isn't enough depth here to make the game that interesting.  You can light the screen up with a bunch of stuff, but it's not really in service of interesting gameplay.

I haven't been this excited to play a video game in years.  I literally cannot wait to get home from work, get through the rigmarole of the evening, and get to PLAYING.

Some QoL asks, please:

- Allow XBox game controller full button mapping, including movement with D-Pad.  My thumb starts to hurt with the thumbstick after long seshes and would be nice to move with D-Pad.  Would also be nice to be able to remap the buttons to however we choose.  Just open it up!

-I'm a stats freak.  What are the baseline numbers?  E.g. what is the base chance to block, etc.  Upgrades are 48% of what, exactly?  5%?  10%?  Or does the 48% percent upgrade mean I now have a 48% chance to block?

- Would be cool to see the individual active skill bonuses e.g. Titan's Cleaver has a 20% area bonus.

Thanks!  Amazing game, well done, and PLEASE keep it up.  Can't wait for Rogue Soulstone!

 I think it has mostly to do with the skill system, like it feels like your choices have barely any impact at all, all the skills feel like they work in the same way, and in all rounds you get to a point where you are just mindlessly clicking on the same upgrades over and over again no matter what build you are going for. 
The upgrades are boring, seeing your skill increase in area and cast speed are the most changes you will see.
There is an insane amount of DoT and Status Effect type upgrades available to you regardless what build you are going for that it becomes redundant choosing between them, they will all eventually complement each other as well.
 I don't like that you have access to so many skills every time with no drawbacks and the fact that you are forced to pick skills until you fill up your hotbar, it just makes the game more monotonous. 

Another con are the enemies, everything is just AoE galore, in higher difficulties it just gets tedious, dodge one red circle and you fall on another red circle, maybe you manage to dodge that one too but it doesn't matter because there's no safe place to dodge to, bomber goblins spawn way too frequently and curse tower are tedious to deal with too, not to mention how difficult it is to see enemy attacks due to all the absurd effects (I don't mind if they make enemies deal more damage as long as they reduce the amount of AoE attacks and make them more visible), sure you can make your skills transparent but then your effects just look horrible.

1 - Set the music volume low. There are audio queues in the game that are not heard because the loud music and this will make your life easier.
2 - Reduce the visibility of effects as well. The visual effects can become VERY big and shiny and you need to see the area attacks of the enemies and your character. This will make the game playable (something the devs should put by default)

With those mandatory changes, the game becomes very enjoyable. Another game on the ""Vampire Survivors"" genre, but with nice visuals, progression and a fantasy theme with a lot of different characters. You need to take skills and try to match their types to empower them and be able to kill hordes of enemies with a lot of different attacks and patterns.

The only thing that is still missing, probably because it is an early access game and they are working on bigger topics, is that progression is too easy and everything is easily achievable with not so much runs. It looks like this is done on purpose so people can test changes, but it is something to warn if you want to play it as a full release.

I will come back and check out the game after it gets more updates, but the game play itself isn't particularly interesting either.

It still is a little bit imbalanced here and there and a few spells feel very similar, same for the Maps that are all pretty much the same shape and size. There is also no point for (Minor) Soulstones right now. You can max out everything in the Skilltree pretty quickly and then there is really nothing to spend your (Minor) Soulstones on. Also in high Curse Difficulties the AoE gets ridiculous,  it becomes a AoE Dodging Simulator, nothing else. Its just not fun at all.

Sound Track is in my opinion is perfect as the looped music doesn't drive atleast me nuts with the same tone over and over again, this one works well with the built up pressure of not dying.

Pro's: Great combat feel, the main game play loop is addicting, and the progression system keeps you coming back. There's a wide variety of characters, builds, and combinations of builds you can do that also inspire you to keep progressing. There's a shit load of things to unlock, every character has new weapons you can craft and each weapon comes with 2 new abilities. It's a pure dopamine hit when it's unlocked and even more fun to then just hop in and try it out. Additionally, the music is great, and the graphics have a look and feel that's distinguished and enjoyable to look at.

Con's: Later stages become repetitive, it's the same content with bigger numbers and a higher volume of mobs. Which is my biggest problem with these types of games. It would be cool to see them add a variety of other game play elements added to those higher difficulties that spice up the rinse repeat nature of this game. Also, it's early access, we only have 5 levels, and they look and feel great in most cases, but it would be cool to see them add more to these maps in time, or even develop procedural generation  with interchanging tile sets to keep things interesting.

Most builds are useless in higher tiers and if you get unlucky or don't have enough movement speed, the majority of the run will be spent spamming dodges and sneaking in bits of damage on bosses. A more appropriate challenge increase is an evolving AI, not just faster/stronger/healthier/higher quantity - these methods just add arbitrary time to the fights and force players into a more defensive role with no option of skillful aggression. If you can only get close enough to hit a boss once every 20 seconds or so because of the constant ability spam of enemies, the fun of the challenge starts to dwindle quickly.

Hitboxes also need to be adjusted, both on terrain and enemy attacks. Additionally, some attacks are missing warning indicators that result in runs being ended simply because the screen is too cluttered to notice an explosive mob or an attack that doesn't render a warning indicator after it has been used, such as the sawblade throw from one of the bosses.

At First i thought the game would be close to games like ""Risk of Rain"", meaning a lot of upgrades and alot of enemies to kill. All of that in a fast paced gameplay.

Sadly in this game it is just the enemies, no feeling of going in a stage of absolutely ridiculousness not even a feeling of power.

On the easier difficulties this game is boring and slow, you spend more time waiting then you can enjoy the game.
On the harder difficulties the obviously unbalanced game play comes forward, here it seems like the game either wants to be a ""PAY-TO-GAME"" or the developers just forgot to balance the game outright. 
Waht i want to say is, this game is not fun when you have to pray to every lord that the RNG is on your side, skill is almost not even anfactor if you succeed in this game or not. But sadly the game dev dont seem to see that and instead of buffing other mechanics of the game they rather nerf the only thing in the game witch worked.

The spells effects and are nice, the gameplay is responsive. The characters, mixed with the runes, weapons and different spells and affinities are good enough to keep you going for a couple of hours of fun.

I would say that the only downsides for me are:
1. Sometimes, you can easily loose your mouse in the chaos and that makes you mouse over your skills and the popups are huge with no way to reduce them to my knowledge. I know, you can change the size and color which helps a lot. If you go for an Arcane build (the spells are mainly blue), you can change the mouse color to red for example.

2. I would completely remove (or add the possibility to do so) the mouse over skills with the popup description during gameplay. Eventually, things happens too fast and it's too chaotic to have time to look at them. They are more annoying than helpful. You can easily hit escape to look at them or during level up, which is enough.

3. At one point, when you have lots of upgrades and lvl ups, your spells are soooo big and so many effects happens on screen with multicast that I couldn't see where I was going. I was getting stuck on small trees, unable to move because of my own abilities, which is frustrating because that made me lose really good runs. I was melting down bosses (like 5-6 spawning at the sametimes) but the downside was I would get one hit by their spells so I had to be really reactive, which I really like and is really fun. But dying because your screen is a cluster f*** and your spells are so huge that they overlap with the terrain and prevent you for properly navigating the obstacles... Nah...

It's a REALLY GOOD game. For about 20 hours.

At roughly 20 hours in, I started trying to unlock the last character.
To do this, you have to beat a certain level (the snow level) on tier 5
difficulty with every single difficulty modifier enabled. Everything before
tier 5 is fantastic. But here's why it falls apart in my opinion.

First of all, they have so much health that you end up kiting in a circle
for 30-40 minutes. I mean that literally. Backpedal in a circle for 30-40
minutes. And after all that time of kiting, you'll die from getting stuck
on a tree or rock while trying to dodge. You feel cheated every time.

Dodge is your only defense. But it's on a cool down. Which is fine.
But you get stuck on EVERYTHING. So then you burn all of your
dodges trying to get off of whatever you're stuck on. And it's game
over then. You're still stuck on whatever tree or rock with no dodge.

I get that you want to keep dodge from being OP but you can't make
my only defense so UNRELIABLE while also giving them so much health
and simultaneously filling the whole screen with 100 enemies and
100 meteors and 100 whatever the red things are all at the same time.

You'll zone out for a split second and instantly get bounced all
over the screen because backpedaling in a circle for 30+ minutes is
so mind numbing that you can't even hold your mouth closed anymore.
Let alone stay hyper focused non-stop for such a long time.

All of the boss health bars are in the millions. And that's only Tier 5!
I can't even imagine Tier 6 or Tier 7. I have no problem with a game
being difficult. But I went from REALLY loving this game and playing
it over every other game I have (Hogwarts ect) to sucking my teeth
and throwing my hands up in the air. It was like falling off a cliff. lol

I have failed to unlock this character for 6 straight hours.
That's enough to suck the fun out of just about anything.
*Git GuD sCruB*

P.S. The character needs an outline around them. They regularly
disappear completely when the **** hits the fan. An outline 
would surely fix this. And the crosshair is terrible too. 

But I still highly recommend this game. Because even if you buy
it and play it for 20 hours, then permanently remove it from your
library, it's a VERY fun 20 hours and well worth the asking price.
Who knows, maybe they'll fix it one day. It is early access after all.

44 HOUR UPDATE:

Okay I'm currently 44 hours into the game and beating T5 is much
easier now. It sort of WAS a case of ""GiT GuD"". It's probably
better described as get your character good. Find one character you
like and stick with them for a while to level them up. Then it seems
like they either get better skills or better RNG. Maybe both.

I don't get stuck on stuff as much because I've learned through trial
and error to stay away from everything. And don't stress getting the
last character unlocked like I did. He's fast because he rides a horse
but in turn he has no dodge. That's a terrible trade in my opinion. 

I've been playing this game to death and I have every new game out
there. I just like this game better than all of them. lol. It's very good.",1676606451,1677042633,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It genuinely ruins the game to try and continue going ""harder"" as it just comes to an cluttered arena as tons and tons of projectiles and beams cross around.

For reference, this is ""Curse Level 4 and 5"" and I believe it goes up to about 6 or 7. I genuinely do not see how it could become worse in difficulty. The skills you can unlock also do not actually help your progression. You do not get ""stronger"" in a long term sense, you can also gain boons that can accentuate your gameplay, but they will not alter your chance of getting farther in higher difficulties.

The game is so RNG dependent that if you aren't having a good run early in you are better off restarting. 

The game is so poorly optimized that randomly even high end PC's will start to chug, drop frames, freeze, and suddenly you'll be hit and dead. 

The game is so visually cluttered the devs had to include a slider to turn down effects. Problem is this includes any indication of where some of your abilities are leaving you little to no feed back depending on the ability. The slider seems to work on some abilities and not others as well.

Even with the effects slider turned to zero you still can't see what's going on because every enemy has abilities with red danger indicators on the ground that overlap with the enemies themselves it just becomes a giant cluster.

The devs are very nerf happy. Any skills that provide any form of fun effective gameplay get gutted quick. They seem to think a RNG dependent slaughter fest about is about skill, dedication, and practice. It's not. This isn't Hades Clone. It's Vampire Survivors clone. There is no skill in hoping you got the RNG needed to be able to survive. The dodge only works half the time. You still get punted across the map or into terrain and get pummeled to death because you're now stuck on a tree and the wonderful physics think you are airborne still so 1000 mobs dog pile you from full to dead in 5 seconds.

What really makes me distrust the devs is early on in development there were even more optimization issues and the game would chug hard as you progressed through endless mode. It was a lot of fun back then, but chugy. All it needed was optimization. Well the Dev team came in the steam forums, say optimization is impossible, so to combat slowdown they nerfed skills and abilities and buffed enemy scaling. Can't run into the performance issues if you can't get there!



There are cool ideas here and these types of games are more than capable of being awesome AND hard as nails, but that only works if they are fair. A death should feel like my fault. This game has everything it should to make me love it. I love pushing the hard modes in these games. I love testing what feels like unlimited power against ever increasing difficulty. But not here. Here I'm just pissed off when I'm usually happy when I turn off one of these games. Poor performance and poor choices by the devs hold this game back, but it has potential.

There is no real way to kill things, level, or ""best way"" to do something in the maps. I think if they did some minor changes may retouch the characters and things in looks by adding skins as well that you can earn, and maybe reduce the size of the cards when you level with the skills. i wouldn't say by much, but maybe reduce by 15%. My first play through I actually played like 3 hrs plus, would've played longer but sleep calls to every one. 

     The level maps are simple to navigate, as is moving around and not getting hit and or stuck. Character skills and powers are all well done and varies with each character you unlock. I think you can mix and match til you find what works for you. There's not really a wrong way to mix the skills but I would suggest that you kinda don;t spread yourself thin, but on a good note if there's a skill you pick up early and you either do not like or it doesn't mix well with your style of the character or yourself, then you can always switch it when you get another attack power.",1676781698,1676781698,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Harsh criticism ahead that I really hope they consider going forward:

The classes in this game have an identity crisis which really hurts my heart. Unfortunately, you can do basically the exact same builds and get the same spells regardless of which character you choose to play as, leaving the classes as basically a cosmetic decision rather than a gameplay decision. Unfortunately this is a product of the vampire survivors inspiration as you can do the same on VS as well, but for a developer to be sinking so much extra work into providing so many available skills in their road map, I truly hope they start to scrutinize and lock down the spell choices for each character going forward as this game could be on par with the likes of Risk of Rain and truly be a contender for the best of the best in Action Roguelikes if the characters were more defined.

As it stands, you can play as a Pyromancer, and run an all ice or arcane build, completely killing off the ""Fire Mage"" fantasy that selecting that character should bring with it. The same can be said with any class, but as an additional example that's a bit more out there, you get access to the lightning abilities with basically every character, and it makes no sense to me when picking the houndmaster that I could also chain lightning and thunderclap. This unfortunately really trivializes the point in progressing anything other than one character unless you simply wanted to unlock the runes that would give you access to 1-2 more spells from that class archetype.

The only other complaints I have in regards to the game are a lack of diversity in enemies/boss fights that it seems like they will expand on, but not enough, as their current goal is 10 bosses, which just won't breed enough diversity or long term replayability, especially with the identity crisis the classes have.

The current state of the game is:
I can pick any character, and unless I deliberately TRY to not select the same spells, I'll end up doing the same build and fighting the same 5 bosses on repeat, leading to quick burnout and boredom.

I will say that this game is by far the better of the two if you compare it with VS, but unfortunately, this is just that, VS with an aiming mechanic instead of being 8 bit and top down. They have the potential to make this a contender for Best Action Roguelike and I truly hope they take this game farther than their roadmap says they will as the roadmap makes it seem like they might fall just short of a masterpiece if they stop there.

Overall in it's current state, 7.75/10, if they fix the class identity issues and expand on the end game enemy variations to create more long term replayability, an easy 11/10.",1676675911,1676675969,True,1,0,0.519417464733123779,0,True,False,True

The dodges getting stopped by random obstacles. This is so insanely frustrating, getting ready to dodge only to go no where because of branch on a tree. The range of the base dodge is also so short it is almost required to take the rune, which feels bad.

The balance of the game is miserable, it starts okay but by the time you get to higher curses it almost requires getting the perfect run. With rng elements getting a ""good"" run and smart plays should get you through most things. But a little past half way and if you don't have all the right pieces you won't get anywhere. The difficult rate with curses out paces the very few and minor upgrades you get to make permanently. Getting enough levels to stay on the damage curve feels impossible, unless you are getting the perfect run.

The runes that are supposed to help are locked behind ridiculous achievement counts. Some of the kill counts are so high it feels like they are trying to artificially increase game hours played. At nearly 60 hours and I still am not half way to some of them. The rouge-like elements imply a certain amount of failing and re-running until you reach certain milestones. This game way surpasses that amount and doesn't feel like it has those milestones.

If 100+ hours of failing before making forward progress is fine with you then this game might be a good fit for you. For me at 60 hours stonewall with no progress possible other than prestige, which feels useless, I can't recommend the game.",1676668889,1676668889,False,13,0,0.576763391494750977,0,True,False,True

With that said, there are a number of flaws that lessen the overall experience a bit in my opinion. Constantly getting stuck on the terrain, obnoxious visual effects obscuring the screen, repetitive sound and audio, and rather poor event design just to name a few. Most of these, with the exception of sound and audio, are rather irksome considering Soulstone Survivors has a large focus on movement and positioning. I do want to give credit to the fact this is early access so things may be subject to change going forward.

What Soulstone Survivors does have going for it right now is a rather simplistic but competent upgrade/progression system, a decent-ish selection of characters and a plethora of abilities to mix and match from. All of which make the gameplay loop rather solid and interesting from run to run. I do hope to see it fleshed out more as development continues though. Controller support is phenomenal too, which is a big plus for this type of game in my book at least! On another side note, I did manage to 100% the current content in a bit under 50 hours so I believe there's a decent bang for your buck here as well.

Currently it's not quite near the level of Vampire Survivors in terms of fun, content, updates, or value but with some further TLC it could be just as good in the future.

However, now they have added a lovely quantity of content in the main game. And not just skills, characters, levels, difficulty scaling (curse), runes, weapons etc. Also Quality of Life additions such as rerolls, locks, banishes, and probably my favourite - the graphic scaling bar. 

That last one means I can enjoy the early game in all it's ridiculous glory and lovely carnage, and then in the late game I can tone it down so I can still see the danger circles whilst melting everything around me.

Main thing missing for me is a menu option to browse through all the skills - what tags they have, what they do, which characters have access to them etc. Folks have made spreadsheets, so it can be looked up but I think it'd be nice to have that in game. Oh and a rune for summon spells... rather than having to bloat selection with nature/shadow etc trying to get access to more.

Game play consists of moving around a map collecting xp, materials of different types used for permanent craftables, health.  Leveling up in a map (which happens frequently) allows the choice of active skills or passive effects, with lots of synergies to be explored.  Your attacks (some of which are aimed) happen automatically, with only a dash available for mostly defensive purposes.  Regular mobs are accompanied by elites and fairly frequent bosses, of which each map requires you to vanquish 3 to 5 (as far as I've seen in my 3+ hours of game play).

I'm not sure if anyone else has experienced this, but over the last year, I've found tons of new games like this: movement/collection, with the only strategy being an understanding of which items to pick up.  When I bought Soulstone Survivors, I didn't think it was one of this type of game; in the first few minutes of playing it, I disappointed to realize I was wrong.

HOWEVER...

The game is pretty awesome, and towers over the myriad of its peers (Vampire Survivors, Army of Ruin [which I like for various reasons], Brotato [which is also pretty good], and several others I cant think of at the moment).  It's fast and furious, and requires a more-than-casual understanding of how to create a build.

Vampire Survivors has become a puun that I love surprisingly, but no matter how messy things get, it's clear what's going on. But not in this game.  After a while, the spells and attacks get very mixed up.  Who is the enemy and who is the friend becomes incomprehensible. I think it would be helpful for the team to review the exaggerated effects they used at this stage. Also, the fact that there is no sound when picking up the gems on the ground is a shortcoming for me. In such games, it is a more satisfying feeling to get gems with clattering sounds. The interface is not suitable for steamdeck. The ui scale feature should come and the keyboard and mouse should not interfere with each other when in gamepad mode (sometimes it happens).

The positives: 
1. There classes all do feel unique and there are many abilities and skills that I would not have thought much of if not forced to use them with the associated classes. For those who say some characters and builds are worthless, I really think you aren't giving the others a chance. All characters have the same system of unlocking runes, and any character can have any runes equipped as long as you have enough slots. I do agree there is a clear strong build archetype, which I will detail later. 
2. There are tons of collectibles that all serve some function towards your progression. Sure at a certain point you no longer need the low tier minerals but as you get better at the game and unlock more difficulties you continue to find more valuable resources. The different maps also contain different kinds of resources so there is some times you may find yourself needing to grind, but not for long. 
3. I adore the chain effects. There are passives that will apply a negative debuff if you apply a certain debuff, and there are many kinds of them. Watching the ridiculous stacks of negative effects is honestly just fun to watch as you have abilities hitting so fast, multi-casting and massive area effects that apply 15 negative debuffs in half a second. This game does what good rougelikes need to do: let me feel powerful and break the game if I got the dice roll in my favor. 

The unfortunate negatives:
1. Visibility is a major concern at times. Your abilities and spells can sometimes clutter the screen, and that isn't even accounting for the higher difficulties where the enemies attack every actual possible square inch of your screen at times. There is however a setting to lower how much visual noise you can see, and while it does help in terms of performance on your framerate and being able to actively see, this game when ran to high endless loops become near impossible to actually see anything. Is it really that bad? Personally not anymore. In the beginning I was frustrated and now that I understand how I want to attempt my builds, I am mentally prepared for what I expect my screen to look like. 
2. Curses are this game's scaling difficulty. Curses 1-3 are walks in the park. They barely make a difference other than getting you comfortable with many elites fighting you. Curse 4 and above you start dealing with Curse Towers and multiple bosses spawning at once. Curse 4 and 5 are a bit challenging but manageable. Curse 6 and 7 are nightmares. At Curse 6 and 7 you can now collect Void Essence, which are essentially boss drops (and currently serve no function as of yet) but the enemies have such ridiculous spawn rates and attack rates that you WILL need a good build and lucky rolls to survive. If you do not get enough movement speed you will simply become overrun. 
3. Lightning/Holy is incredibly overpowered. It is 100% the best build from the lowest difficulties to the highest. You can manage on most builds, however should you beat a run you will generally see that Lightning/Holy runs are the fastest to completion because of their effect and how well they stack on enemies. Doom is simply not a viable build on Curse 6 and 7 because the HP the bosses have is too much to reliably deal with. 
4. The terrain will become your worst enemy. As stated above, the maps don't have anything different other than how they appear and what resources drop. All of the enemies you fight will always be the same (at least as of now). Some maps are okay, while others will have rocks and trees that somehow you seem to clip on and get stuck. It's agonizing when it happens.
5. Similar to the terrain concern, on higher difficulties you will be knocked back quite a bit. Should you be dashing or hit by certain attacks while also getting launched or knocked will have your character soar across the map. While initially funny it is a headache and half. You are not immune to damage while airborne and will constantly find yourself either throw clear across the other side of the map to safety or pushed into a crevice or terrain that you must wait to leave until you land as you cannot see your surroundings. As already stated, you also are not immune which means you can also simply be launched into pools of poison, fire or ice and just die because you are on the right space, just above it. This either needs to be removed or make you immune to damage while being launched, because you have next to no control of it happening to you. 
6. The Incarnation of Fire boss has a flamethrower attack and its hurtbox is simply too big. Either the visuals need to be adjusted or the hurtbox needs to be adjusted to be appropriate. Too many of my runs have lost because I took damage to a flamethrower that wasn't actually touching me on my screen and now I am stuck circling the drain on low HP. 

Though I have listed more negatives than positives in my review, that doesn't mean at all that I think this game is more bad than good. I adore this game and am starving for more content already. I love the rune system to build diversity as well as I am super excited to see what new weapons can be crafted with all the materials I am stockpiling. While I'm at it, I'm ready for the expanded Skill Tree as well. Also I really hope the Devs see this and add some kind of catalog of abilities/skills/spells and a way to sort by type. It's great to see upgrades such as ""All Slash moves 40% damage,"" but you really don't know every slash ability in the game and without looking at multiple different menus in separate tabs you really can't figure out all of your options ahead of time. 

Not every run needs to be endless and not every run needs to be success. I have played many rougelikes and learned this all too well long ago. This game does offer you a choice of how to continue your run when you finish a set loop. Blue portal will always end the run, which will be the only option if you take over 15 minutes to complete the loop. Purple portals will scale difficulty by one stage and have you complete another loop. This is essentially the endless mode where you push the game to its limits. The red portal is essentially Boss Rush. Your next loop will reduce the amount of enemies needed to summon the bosses as well as add one extra boss spawn per loop. The red portal will only spawn if your run is fast enough, at under 12 minutes. Which is fine because you need every character to beat a run that quickly to unlock a rune for each class. There is no need to continue to loop on the higher Curses. On Curse 3 I have red portal looped to the third loop (another unlock) and received enough experience to level up about 15-20 levels. On Curse 5/6/7 should you win, you will gain experience equivalent to 30+ levels easily. There is currently no reason to level up past 60 but when has that ever stopped anyone. 

This game has some excellent bones and groundwork laid out for it. For $10 you can absolutely spend it on worse games. This game is great to play. All of my friends that love horde battlers are into this game and we have been dumping a stupid amount of hours into this game because it is so much fun. I am 100% committed to this game and the Devs, as well as curious where the sister title Rogue Soulstone will be heading. I waited some time to pick up this game and now I can't stop thinking about it every time I sit at my computer. This game is worth every penny and if you're on the fence about it, I promise you, you will find at least one character that you enjoy playing. 

I also own a Steam Deck 512GB and the game runs flawlessly on it. I cannot put this game down: buy it now!

Despite my list of cons below, I do recommend the game and I think it's fun enough for a $10 price point, especially with the promise of more content to come.

Pros:
* The graphics clearly have a leg up on most Survivors-genre games.
* Attacks have clearly marked ground indicators showing where enemy attacks will land - vs many other Survivors-genre games where enemies just do damage when they touch you.

Cons:
* The variety of play LOOKS great at first: different characters with different available starting skills, a few dozen skills to choose from on each character, hundreds of skills in total, a bunch of different levels, and curses that add extra challenge.  But having played at least a few runs as each character, a lot of skills are not meaningfully different from each other, and the skills you have rarely make a difference in what options you choose as you level up.  There are skills that scale with unusual stats (like armor, health, and run speed), but not enough to make a full build out of it.  Few of the passive level-up options actually change how you play.  The curses just ""tune up"" difficulty by adding more elite monsters, more bosses, more damage, etc - no unique challenges.  Finally, there is no difference of play in the levels - only in the resources you get from them.  Altogether, EVERY RUN FEELS THE SAME.
* At higher tiers of play, the amount of particle effects on the screen are your biggest enemy, as you will no longer be able to see the ground indicators for enemy attacks.

Gameplay is all about kiting the enemies and dodging their attacks, which can sound repetitive, but each hero and build has a different way to do it.

Plenty of classes with just enough unique values like base stats, signature weapons, and tag selections to offer up some distinct playstyles.

Plenty of content to push your luck against the increasing difficulty of curses in five different maps. Along with plenty of unlockables to reward you for pushing those limits.

A wide variety of weapons and weapon families to synergize and scale.

Seven bosses that each provide a measure of unique threat to the player. You'll become quite familiar with them over the course of the game, but once you have to start taking on two or more, they'll always provide some measure of challenge.

A relic system that allows you to further customize your characters in unique ways for your next run.

Combat with an emphasis on dodgeable attacks - that can get extremely hectic toward lategame, but still manages to stay mostly legible. I can't say that for every game that's tried this.

Well, it does, but this one actually plays a little bit better. Where Vampire Survivors is a tribute to the 8-bit Castlevania titles, this one doesn't feel like a tribute to anything. Yes, there are various characters to unlock, yes there several abilities, skills, & weapons, but what sets this one apart are the attacks, runic powers that you can unlock, & the crafting of newer weapons. At the time of writing this review, I've got almost 35 hours in & still haven't completely unlocked everything. If you keep going in endless mode & continue collecting gems, your character will eventually get stupidly powerful. One of the characters I had, used a spin attack. After applying several expansion power-ups, attack speed power-ups, & multi-casting power-ups, my character's spin attack was so big that it took up the entire screen & completely destroyed enemies like crazy.

One of its drawbacks is the game only seems to offer 5 stages. However, I'm sure that with extra DLC or maybe future updates, they can add to this to give it some extra depth, that's just a minor gripe. Its still fun & I keep coming back to it over & over again.

On a scale of 1 to 5 I give it a 4.5. Its definitely worth a buy, especially if your're into bullet hell or rogue-like games. It also plays perfectly on the Steam Deck.",1675746155,1675746212,True,3,0,0.525354981422424316,0,True,False,True

Pros:
- I like this low-poly 3d style a lot more than purely 2d
- Unlocking stuff is fun
- Overall the playing process is very satisfying

Cons:
- Skills and balance. Some skills are just weak and I couldn't find any way to make them work (for example rot-based). I would welcome more variety in builds, e.g. increase damage of certain skills against certain effects (cold dmg vs frozen, only physical vs weak, etc)
- performance is not ideal, especially for some builds. I noticed the sooner you kill, the better. So, sturdy or dot based builds do not really play well
- overloaded with mechanics. I could assume that some people might enjoy it, but I would welcome either an option to reduce the number of mobs but increase their power, or prevent most of the mobs doing AoE damage. Currently anywhere past first 3 minutes you are continuously in ""red=bad, run from red"" mode, having to run and dash ALL the time. This could be fun as a phase, but not the 95% of gameplay. I enjoyed assassin gameplay the most, which rewards ""being in the right place at the right time"" kind of gameplay.

Compared to Vampire Survivors, this game has much more appealing graphics and a really interesting take on meta-progression. There's a blacksmith that upgrades the weapons of every character using resources you find around the maps. You also unlock ""runes"" (of which there are dozens and dozens) which you can equip in all sorts of interesting combinations before a run.

There is a ton of customization you can do each round (and a lot of RNG). Each of the ""classes"" feel fairly unique as they are limited to what types of attacks they can pull on levelling up, and they all have 2 unique skills (some are good and some you want to trade or avoid using).

The first round felt super easy and I thought this game was going to be boring, but there is a cursed mode where you can increase the difficulty (exponentially harder with max curses) and there are also separate portals you can take once a map is cleared to continue with your build on increasing difficulty. 

There is a lot of things going on on the screen later into a round, I found it helped (my survival) substantially by turning down the effects in graphics settings.

Lots of Early Access games are just a step above bad demos, but this does not feel EA at all. I will get many more hours out of it, and knowing there are more content updates coming, I just feel spoiled. I can't wait to see what else they add.

Balance and abilities already feel really good. Thanks to randomized abilities every game is different, you are deciding and creating your build on the fly based on what you're presented with and that can lead to surprising choices and interesting synergies. I've already played some very exciting and wildly different builds -- from an incredible Arcane fireworks build, to a blinding, wrecking Fire Blast build (literally had to turn special effects down to 0 because the entire screen would flash and I was a tiny bit concerned about seizures), to a Shadow/Doom build where everything just face-melted, to a dash-and-backstab Assassin build that worked surprisingly well and destroyed lords in mere seconds. And I've only played two classes so far out of 16(?). Games can be quick (10-15 minutes) or there's two different endless modes to see how long you can survive. Currently nearly 200 Steam achievements, if you like to achievement hunt like I do.

Rarely I find myself thinking, ""I wish that worked a little different"" about small things; you get very detailed summary screens but I feel like there is some vagueness in game (like Prestige levels, what exactly do they do for my character?); but I have encountered nothing game-breaking or deal-breaking. If there is anything lacking, it's that what seems to be the main currency (the blue crystals) are stupid common and easy to build up, and there's not nearly enough to spend them on. I want more skill trees, more runes, more weapons and shop-type stuff. Give me some kind of gambling to blow through my wallet. But I'm sure there's stuff coming.

There are a number of characters all with their own themes, flavour, and play styles. Differences are largely due to modifiers and abilities, but they fit the given character and their differing abilities all give them a truly unique feel.

Not to mention that progression unlocks more abilities, and playing a character long enough can unlock the ability to offer their more unique abilities to other characters. There's a lot of depth!

It is not overly hard (there's one fiddly seasonal battle achievement but otherwise you shouldn't struggle once you get the hang of it), with a fairly simple permanent upgrade system that you will max quite early on. Beyond that, you'll pick a selection of runes for minor customization, but most variety comes from your selection of class/skills during each run. Each run is enjoyable with a nice progression, and can be difficulty scaled to match your current goals.

My only real complaint would be that after enough multi-cast and size upgrades applied to your skills the screen can be overwhelmed with particle effects to the point where you can't actually see where to dodge. You'll learn the patterns and largely be able to predict / buffer past with dash immunity, but I suspect they could have solved this with better layering to leave threats visible.

The game works well, I didn't encounter any bugs, and there is sufficient level of general polish for it to be decent release - so for EA that's really one of the positive examples.

There is quite a lot of classes and skills, several maps and several enemy and boss types.
In my opinion all of those things would benefit from having a little more unique character. That is something different than saying that there should be more variety - it could even stay as it is (but please don't) as long as each class, skill, enemy etc have more of a defined character in and of itself.

Is your favorite part tinkering with the different skills and trying out new builds?
Do you hate having to grind for gear for builds to work?

If so, this game is likely a solid buy for you: 
* Lots of different character classes which provide you unique starting stats and skill groups
* Progression unlocks runes and rune slots allowing you a great deal of versatility for your runs
* Very easy to adjust difficulty with the Curses feature, allowing you to 'get in, get ugly' or have a more relaxed run
* Skills are all cooldown autofire, so you're not constantly mashing keys
* Effect Transparency settings means you can actually see what is going on around you

Yeah, if you read through guides you'll find there are a lot of ways to cheese builds to crush the endgame. And if that is your thing, more power to you. But personally, I love trying out the different skills in different combinations. 

It's not a perfect. The autofire skills aren't everyone's cup of tea, and for some can make gameplay a bit boring. Telling you right now, the only button you need to hit is the Dash. Healing and defense stats are still a bit wonky as of this review, so most of the time you're ignoring them in favor of raw damage. And my personal peeve, a lot of time you can get snagged on a wall or some other element of the background. Nothing is more disappointing than dashing away only to get stuck on a minor outcropping of a wall and one shot. 

If the devs read this (yeah, I know there are better ways of contacting them, but I'm lazy):
* Have dash allow you to move through minor background elements, or at least ""slide"" along them. Being able to dash through a wall for safety would be great, or at least not dashing into that little corner of the element and getting stuck.
* Please move to percentage based healing. Increasing your max HP seems sort of defeating as it is very difficult to recover health to get to that max.
* Have Health upgrade include a minor percentage heal (Increase Max HP by X, then heal Y%), or include a ""increase other sources of healing by Z%."" I don't feel as if the game needs a lot more sources of healing, just some in-run way of boosting the amount you heal. 
* Please offer rare upgrades that combine Armor and Block chance buffs. Maybe I'm doing it wrong, but I've never found these upgrades to be priorities, and having a few rare ones that boost them both (much in the same way as ""improve all arcane skills"") would make them more palatable. 
* Thank you, I love this game",1674235169,1674235169,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

the music is awesome af, progression system so cool.
i love how far i can take my builds unlike other games that sort of have a limit/cap.
has meta progression, achievments in game that unlock extra charaxhters, runes etc (havent unlocked a rune yet but im close)
worth the asking price imo!
also frames hold steady for me
and has a cappable slider.
can add extra damage numbers if you wish or take away them entirely including health bars!

It was a bit disappointing to learn that none of the progress made during the demo period transferred over to the full game. Now looking back on the reddit comment that mentioned this should have been possible, it was noted that there was an exception for the Steam Deck, which is where I played both the demo and full game. Regardless, the early part of the game was very fun. Unlocking new characters with different playstyles and weapons is the core progress loop for many games and it hooks you immediately. The reason I would say maybe recommend is that the late game difficulties seem unfair. Rouge-lite/likes always need to balance RNG with player skill. In late game, relying on RNG in order to get the exact upgrades necessary to wittle down the multiple bosses health down is not exactly fun. The player movement speed feels like is slows as time goes on, but looking back it may just be that the distance between safe places to stand are further apart. Without at least one summon in a run to alleviate some of the boss aggro, late game bosses attacks will overlap, so you're constantly forced to dash, not allowing much time for attacks to go off near bosses. The frame rate plummets if you get too close to large clusters of enemies, and suddenly the health/armor buffs you've collected are wiped away in an instant. Having to deal with 6 bosses with over 1 million health each, and only being able to output a few thousand points of damage means I'm dashing around the map, aiming at bosses off the edge of the screen hoping to stack debuffs. It was fun in the beginning when the difficulty seems more balanced. As of now, I think this is a good addition to the bullet hell/heaven genre. Since it seems like there are plenty of updates planned, some tweaking to player movement, RNG, and damage output I can see myself feeling less frustrated when a run is lost. I will definitely pick up again in a few months to see if anything has changed.",1673541069,1673541069,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

This is a good game with potential to be a great game. The early game is simple enough and intriguing enough to make me want to know more. After a few runs, the mid-game shows tidy mechanics and a power curve that makes me feel like I am smashing monsters powerfully; I like that. The late game, currently, is a bit grindy and frankly not fair: The deep bosses and levels are fire fire everywhere and no safe place to stand, you can be killed in one or two hits with little opportunity to recover, and it takes quite long time to dance in the fire and beat down the bosses (plural); this is not fun in large doses.

Some things I would like to have added to the final game:
* There should be a systematic reward for leveling up a character. Right now there are 3 runes and one weapon as rewards, but there should be more incremental rewards per level.
* The power curves should be tweaked. The bosses have millions of HP and the player just a few hundred; giving thousands of hits to kill the boss and the boss can kill me in one or two hits is too lopsided. If I want that kind of experience I will go play Punch Out.
* The current levels are just arenas. Some level diversity which allowed me to work across a battlefield, up a mountain, through a valley, etc. as a means to find and slay the boss(es) would be neat.

This is a fun game because it is easy to jump into a run and feel OP without much grinding, unlike in Vampire Survivors. There is also a lot of meta-progression. There are more unique bullet heavens, though. It plays like your typical bullet heaven.

Overall, it is a great game, and you can get many hours of fun well playing.

Graphics and music are nice. The artstyle is somewhat simplistic but you won't be looking at small details anyway.

You pick your character, their passive runes, other passive bonuses, starting weapon (provide different skills and further stat changes), pick a map, pick curse intensity (additional difficulty for more rewards) and start. 

You will be harassed by an increasing number of incresingly difficult enemies and bosses until you win the round. Then you either end your run or continue further in one of two modes. This makes game harder and harder until you either quit or die. This is the loop, love it or hate it.

Every achievement unlocks new skills, runes, characters, weapons etc. making the game quite rewarding.

The amount of enemies and AoE and visual effects will make it increasingly difficult to survive and see anything. I am not joking - the insane amount of visual clutter is basically a selling point. It's a joke that gets old fast and you will seek to find a balance between seeing what is happening and seeing at least outlines of your attacks. So you will either turn off the pretty visual effects or turn them down. A LOT.

Harder difficulties honestly get so ludicrous they kind of stop being fun for me. Being one shot by a boss from outside the screen isn't fun. Everyone gets faster, tougher, and deadlier. Fast.

Potential problems. Might be actually good depending on your preferences.

- Game gets repetitive very fast. There is basically no lore, no story, nothing. It's a shame because even a little bit of characterisation would give this game more soul (heh).
- Best defense is a good offense. You want to hit hard rather than being able to take the punches most of the time. Being deadly lowers the time enemies are alive and can harm you. Being tanky does not.
- Mobility over defense. That 5 % damage reduction is a nice upgrade but later when bosses hit for 100+ damage you will take movement speed instead. 
- Single target over AoE. I like to have at least one AoE skill but success comes with the ability to take down high-priority targets fast.
- Ranged over melee. The ground can get mostly red with incoming attacks. And if enemies form a deathball you might not be able to even get close if you have insufficient range.
- Knockback. Many enemies do miniscule damage. But oh boy they will push you into something that does.
- Rubber. You get stuck on terrain pretty often. That leads to your death pretty often. Think about it. You have slain thousands only to be felled by a strategically placed palm tree.

One thing I have to praise that unlike many similar games where progression only unlocks new stuff and increases the randomness this one actually unlocks options for you to mitigate this. You can influence what skills you get or add skills otherwise inaccessible for that character. Incredible. Beautiful.  

Overall the game was fun and I will certainly come back with further updates.",1673352843,1673352873,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

A skill tree progression that provides goals and unlocks for you to strive for.

More than 150 Active Skills to add great variation to each run.

You can give monster gangrene ROFL ; the curses make the waves far more intense, walk around and enjoy being the best bullet hell you can make for any race, orc, goblins, snakes, medieval F's , giants, you'd even kill Ares, Hercules, Poseidon, Hades, etc but you'd lose to Zagreus :D 
Hectic side note: Keyboard < Controller

Experiments should be for the entire session. The spells and abilities are so good that once any upgrade is for the specific spell, it helps push waves back. The engine then also realizes you're kicking it in the shorter space of time that is usual, and tries equally hard to dominate you. The system is so good, I'd say it's 50-50 , and some builds you know from the start you WILL demolish everything. The luck and chance is equal as well, some games are EPIC< LEGENDARY all the time, some are casual, and then the legendaries that pop up hidden in the quick picks of 3, catches you off, and you casually still pick the wrong one. It's a great mental game as well. You neeed to be more present than VS< Less AFK< you can learn your patterns. 
The core ways are establishing your build, and optimizing the spells you start with, You should try to pick cleverly from the begining so you should never ever should you replace an upgraded spell/ability, if you have furthered it, because it can change your synergy negatively if you pick the wrong thing. However, some classes have class-specific spells, and abilities that can only mix into your request for them, by a Rune you have earned, from the starting menu// after many runs.
It's deeper, VS has gold for after-death upgrades. This game has 6 different currencies, in the form of crystals, which can be farmed level-specific to the ores you need.

The enemies are by the swarms. You need them, as much as they need you.

You get 6 major-spells,/ abilities, 
And then passives, which are the upgrades to the said abilities.
Best to get them organized by type- in the beginning, so that you can just keep strengthening the roots of your build.

The passive upgrades you get are plentiful, from the cast % tick, to Area of effect, Multicast %, Crit chance %, Crit extra %, 
You usually get choices of 3 , with some careful reading required to help you differentiate between two different upgrades for the same spell,
It's really incredible,

I want you to have fun! If you loved VS, you will enjoy getting wrecked by this.

You also get Dashes. 2 Max via the after-death upgrades, and then sometimes, you get the chance of getting an epic upgrade dash in-game. 

Levels, are chaotic. for best setting, just turn the spell visibility down by one notch, and game is clear. There's a LOT of screen noise.
I'm surprised they don't warn people with epilepsy, 

The performance of the game is still under construction, and usually after minute 8 you're knee-deep in many things so you are dashing for your life.

The playstyles can vary so much because with each of the different characters, come UNIQUE spells that only certain characters can access :) it's not like VS- where each char starts with something unique to them, but every other person can also get it, etc. There are 3 major spells per character-class, and the ugprades that support them are each wonderful.

Otherwise game is great.

Edit1: 

If You're going to give me 5 slots for Runes, and make Runes costs a different amount of points, make it so that I can fill all 5 slots with 5, 5 costing Runes points. Why would I use a bunch of low tier junk skills when I worked so hard to get high tier skills to only use 1? 

The highest tier Runes cost 4 points, meaning I can use one low tier one high tier. Why? The amount of replayability to use a ton of different Runes, low-mid-high tier would make this game much better. If I have 5 slots, and want to use 5 high tier Runes at 4 point cost, the max point availability should be 20. 

As well, if you're going to spam large area attack enemies, give us a passive heal. As there are no Actives or passives that give us life steal and the healing crystals do not spawn nearly often enough to be effective. Particularly since they're healing amount is capped. 

I really like this game, but there's some major flaws. I will continue to edit this as I play.

Edit 2: 

Hopefully the Devs won't delete this, this time.

Increase Rune cap to 20. Don't give me varying cost runes if I have to use an assortment of low-cost runes to fill slots with. It's not fun winning a run because I got lucky once out of 100 tries. Runes tie in to your build, why would you limit the creativity and effectiveness of a build? 

Tier5 Curse is unbearably boring. I can't see what I'm doing, I can't and not a single character with any combination of abilities can realistically survive a first round, because kiting doesn't work either since you kill trash mobs fast. 

The Banish/Reroll system is a 50/50. Banish works to keep junk you don't want for a particular build away, but the reroll most times just rerolls the same stuff I wanted to get rid of, back into my option pool. At the very least, show me other junk I don't want so I know it's worth clicking the button.

Characters have too many affinities that are entirely unrelated to them. Runes can help reduce this, And while using all of them, it works for the first 3 levels that you receive Active choices. Then it stops entirely. You would think that this is an okay solution, but now I'm wasting rune slots to ensure I get Active choices that actually synergies with the character I'm playing. Why would I want stuff that doesn't synergies with my character? I'd have played the character that does. 

More health options are mandatory. passive regen, Actives ( or passives ) that provider health regen or life steal effects on hit and/or kill. Almost every single enemy in the game spams AoE attacks, particularly bosses who cover the entire screen or half of it. You can reliably dodge every single red mark on the screen. And between things having more health and dealing more damage and showing up in high frequency, you have to give your players some kind of way to keep them selves alive besides ( Don't get hit ) 

The entire screen turns into a targeted area 2 minutes into a Curce V run, you're forever going to get it. Please make these changes are your game will function much.",1672622679,1672901902,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The difficulty scaling is very much forced on you, you get 5-6 options to make the game harder but the only way to unlock the next level is to beat the current one with all the difficulty options turned on, so you might as well combine them all into an on-off switch, and you are going to be having them always on.

There isn't much variety between skills, the game brags about having over 100 but really its just line aoe, cone aoe, circle aoe and then fire, poison, ice, physical, chaos. Then combinations of those. So pretty much every build feels exactly the same.
The neat thing is, there are some really cool tanky skills and stuff that heals you. The bad news is, because the difficulty scaling is forced on you and the mob HP and damage keeps scaling higher and higher, and bosses won't wait for you to kill the last boss before stacking on you, choosing any tanky abilities instead of 100% damage is going to cause you to lose constantly at higher difficulties.

The visual clutter and noise is way too much. Once you get far enough into a run, you will either die or your aoes are so large that you can no longer see the enemies or the crap on the ground that will hurt you if you touch it, causing you to die. I wish I could see the red ""Dont stand in this"" circles through the effects, and my character. Most of the time the game is just a giant flashing screen of insanity and you can't tell what is your effects or the enemy effects.",1672892094,1672892094,False,1,0,0.478429794311523438,0,True,False,True

So far it not does feel like a bullet heaven game but like an auto-hack and slash battler game and it's easy to see why: touching the ennemies does not damage you, when the ennemies see you in range they will strike and you will get hurt only if you are still in the damage area of the attack which gives you way too much time to make a side step and kill them. The fact that ennemies don't hurst you on contact, that they have a detection range and attack animation is really not the ideal to create an exciting Bullet Heaven game because it calshes with the large number of ennemies on the screen and I think that's the core of the issue. Maybe keep your gameplay mechanics and work on ennemies then? That might be the perfect answer to Soulstone Survivor defaults.

As Soulstone Survivor is still in beta I am not worried about a lack of content as it already shows a lot already in game and mor to come however the game needs revision on the gameplay mechanics and find something to make the game more exciting. My biggest concern is the lack off challenge, it is way too easy right from the start. Last but not least the game reminds me of Heroes of Ruin a lot by the way it looks but I still prefer the later even if it has a lot less content right now as it feel fresher and less generic, also look better, it just feels like more though is put into the gameplay than here.

6.5/10 way more expensive than the average Bullet Heaven game without offering anything that makes it way better han the other games. I'd recommend you to try Army of Ruins instead.",1669149571,1672855467,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Curse System is decent too and very much needed for a game like this. Basically get to adjust the difficulty to your liking and get better rewards for higher Curse levels. However. The games one big flaw is that it lacks Resources Sinks. Once you max out the skill tree and buy your weapons, you've got nothing left to spend the resources you've gathered. And they have you able to get high end rare materials that have no use yet if your Curse Level is high enough. So im sitting with 1 million of the Soulstones and some 25-30 of the Boss Soulstone resources. 

The game has a slider for spell FX to be more transparent so you can actually see whats going on when your character is shitting out AoE's nonstop.  
The Rune system is nice too. It lets you get a bit more freedom in your build or capitalize on your build, even some utility.

Dungeons are the only other gripe for now. They lack theme.

The game is pretty fun at first but slowly devolves into a screen spam fest that just makes it very difficult to see anything that is going on.

By that I mean, it has that ""We need them to invest quarters so kill them at certain points"" that pizza place arcade machines had. It is difficult to see, hard to avoid...and honestly not fun.

This game definitely has that arcade game feel to it. No mystery, no charm, no real purpose. Just a game for games sake that tries to capture the feel of games like Vampire Survivors. Vampire Survivors is one of the most simple games I have ever played...but damn that game just captures you with it's charm, easter eggs, and sheer over-the-topness that just makes it fun to play.

Simply put: If this interests you and you haven't tried Vampire Survivors, do that instead. Vampire Survivors has a hell of a soul to it and the developer wants you to have fun when you play it. Soulstone? It could care less about any of that it seems.

In my experience, after a certain period of grinding, you can almost do afk builds.

Love this game. It’s become my favorite game of this genre due to the skill tree, runes, and character selection. It serves two specific gaming roles for me when I want to play: 1). A quick game to reduce stress; 2). For a duration of fun hack and slash.

My hope at this point is there is an expansion to the skill tree. Doesn't take long to max it out.

Gorgeous graphics aside, the main elements that stick out are a surprisingly deep RPG skilltree, the addition of dodges which are essential with most big enemies attacks being area-based, and even some crafting. Lastly, the game puts no limits on the amount of perks and upgrades the player can have, making it so that eventually the entire screen can be covered up by attacks that were barely bigger than the playable character at first. But don't worry, the opacity of these attacks can be lowered.

This last feature contributes to the game's main shortcoming, and it's how the power creep makes the endgame a bit trivial. Eventually, the player can stunlock and freeze every enemy that spawns, though their healthbar becomes larger and larger, making them lengthy bullet sponges to take down while not really offering much of a challenge anymore. This makes the endless runs rather repetitive. But with already plenty of classes, many different weapons, tons of things to unlock and even cool timed events, Soulstone Survivors is easily one of the best bullet heaven titles out there, one I keep going back to from time to time.

The most obvious comparison is to Vampire Survivors, and while I think these two have a lot in common, I think they're also pretty different. I would classify this as a twin stick shooter, as you're doing a lot more active movement than VS and you have a target and need to aim some abilities. I play this with a PS5 controller and it plays very well, but navigating through menus inbetween games is cumbersome unless you use a mouse.

I really enjoy this game, I have about 80% of the current unlocks, so still a bit more to go, but I'm very much enjoying this game and can't wait for the next content patch.

The Pros:
Good graphics and charming art style
Good soundtrack
Tons of abilities
Lots of classes
Lots of ways to customize your run with runes
Really interesting combining different abilities each run to see what works and what doesn't.
Tooltips for abilities update, meaning if your skill does 100 damage and you take a 30% damage upgrade, you'll see it listed as 130 damage.

The Cons:
Game is still EA and I've had several crashes, including losing a 50 minute run, and there's no checkpoints so I wasted the entire run. Almost uninstalled right there, but glad I didn't.
Lots of different negative effects can be applied, but most of them become ineffective after wave 3.
Could use some more monster variety
Would like to see a couple more biomes
Tutorial would be good, to explain things like resources, etc.
Gamepad support in menus is cumbersome, though it's fine when playing the actual game.

What I'd like to see:
A automatic checkpoint or something at the end of each wave. It really sucks to have the game crash and lose 4 waves of progress. It would be really nice if all the resources you collected were saved at the end of each run, so if I crashed on wave 4, I'd at least have all the stuff from the last three waves.

More progression options. This is still EA and the framework for more stuff is there, but it's not in the game yet. I think this will come with time. These games live and die by how many progression paths there are.

More skills that consume DOTs and other negative effects. There are a couple but most DOT builds really fall off after wave two. Having ways to consume DOTs would open up more builds.

Interactions between negative effects. I would love to see combinations of negative effects create new ones. 

There needs to be more currency sinks. I think this is already on the roadmap.

I'd like to see the difficulty curve smoothed out a bit. Some curses are super harsh, others are almost helpful. I'm fine with the overall difficult so far (currently on T5 of curses, one more to go), but I think it's very drastic when difficulty jumps and think it could be smoothed out a bit.",1672533388,1672533388,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

A 3D Vampire Survivors that doesn't suck and isn't a quick cash grab like so many others. I enjoyed it as a ""Prologue"" and enjoy it as an EA release.

Unlock Progression is challenging, fun and expansive (Key word here is EXPANSIVE). 
Level up characters to unlock Unique Skills for them. (2-3 Per Character)
Craft new weapons that each unlock a new Skill.
Unlock Runes via achievements to help boost your runs.
Spend excess points in the Skill Tree to make life easier.

The skills and Runes really make the game fun. And seeing how you can level up endlessly, you can make some seriously broken builds.

Keep in mind that it's Early Access so not all Characters, Skills and Weapons are available. And obviously everything is subject to change.

If I had to say some key negatives, it would be how lackluster the Skill Tree really is. Sure, it's useful because it's better to have the bonuses than not but, it hardly feels like a tree. More like a Shrub. Even maxed out, it still doesn't feel like it does enough to really be game changing. 

Naturally performance is often fairly bad with all the 3D effects being used every 2 milliseconds. Even on the best of PC's, your Frames end up tanking.

Currently at the time of writing, there is only about 2 Weapons per character and 14 Characters to Unlock.

I'd like to see some unlockable Dashes or more Dash related skills for different build goals.

The gamer is very fun and beautiful at first and still believe the game as a lot of potential.

Pro:
- Graphically beautiful
- Movement fluid
- A lot of cool spell and a lot of variety
- Lot of different characters
- Various stages

Con:
- Runes system is a mess and could use some clean up and feel too challenging
- The upgrades feel weak
- The resource system is a mess in way that you get a lot quickly and they are pretty much useless
- Too many icons on the bottom left when you play to a point you can't see your cursor when you play in higher level of difficulty, could use some clean up
- Enemies and boss scale difficulty need some balance for the curse levels
- Not enough weapons for your characters

UPDATE: But just like crack, it loses its potency. 

I feel like they need to add some more depth to the game through additional mechanics and game modes. I also feel like the visual spam is actually detrimental to the gameplay they're trying to go for too but not sure how they could reduce it.

I still recommend the game but its shortlived at the moment and not something I could constantly replay.

UPDATE 2: Visual spam has been addressed with a VFX slider which pretty much solves that problem entirely; great work SS team! :)

The extra skills and weapons have been a nice addition including the option to fight Bumble as part of the winter event. 

That said, difficulty needs ramping up and more modes need adding. Skill tree needs to be massively expanded or changed -- it's too easy to max out and feels lacklustre. Blacksmithing could be cool but it also needs expanding -- I really like the idea of the material farming.

definitely needs:
Better build balance, many weapons are good for a little while and then just seem to peter out, as well as an extreme lack of healing ability

Better enemy scaling, the fist few levels of curses keep the game interesting and add difficulty but then it skyrockets and everything just becomes bullet sponges.

UI/UX changes, gets really annoying when the leveling up screen pops up and every other time you have to change the option from weapons to passives. As well, there should really be a removal of tool tips while the game is not in a screen, aiming the cursor anywhere on the bottom half of the screen becomes horrible because of the popups overlaying the battle.

There is still some optimization needed but that is always an ongoing thing with bullet hell style games, there is just so much going on towards mid - late game.

On the good side, it's a decent spin on the Vampire Survivors formula, it's like taking an ARPG skill set and tuning it for the genre. The spell effects are impressively flashy (though this also falls into the negatives later), and the game is fully 3d, if low poly, giving it a more standout look compared to others of the genre. It is also just as fun as some of the better VS-likes, due in part to the rather expansive list of skills and runes you can unlock to make a build. All in all a fun little time sink, initially, until you start getting into the later curse levels, at which point the games flaws can become glaringly apparent.

So in Soulstone Survivors, aside from your usual fodder enemies, you have elites and other minor units that have AoE attacks or debuffs to force you to move or take damage. I can understand this as a design decision, often times in Vampire Survivors and others, you can reach a point where you can effectively AFK a run because your damage output and AoE are so disgustingly high you can mostly stop paying attention, however, while initially this mechanic isn't terribly overbearing, as curse levels go up more elites spawn, and their AoE's cast faster and more frequently, followed by 2 or even 3 bosses spawning per wave, which means both more and massive AoE's to avoid. In curse 4 and 5, you practically have to never stop moving or you're dead, which is a strong point against the game as it fails to understand that there needs to be an ebb and flow to waves and fighting, whereas at Curse levels 4 and up, you're basically forced into overdrive by the game and never allowed a moments reprieve. This isn't even getting into the fact that enemy damage scales hard and their AoE's can effectively cover entire swaths of the map leaving you extremely limited space to avoid anything.

The increased difficulty also has no real gameplay merit outside of extra minor soulstones, prestige, or new types of resources from maps, again, also failing to understand what I would consider another core design point of the genre: with increased challenge also comes increased power, both you, and your enemies. there are no extra fodder spawns, or increased experience to go with the enhanced difficulty, which makes higher curse levels even harder and more restrictive as you are heavily dependent on good RNG to have even a slight hope of overpowering the enemies scaling before you die.

As it stands the best strategy for high curse levels is good AoE, movement speed, and damage stats. Armor, block and anything defensive related is all but useless because you can die very swiftly to stacked AoEs, so the only real strategy is to keep moving, which again, despite the rather wide list of abilities to choose from, you're forced to take a specific set of stats to survive, as opposed to others of the genre where a reasonably constructed build can see a run to completion.

I tentatively will give this game a thumbs up in hopes the later curse levels see a rebalance, but only because I somewhat expect a rebalance to happen somewhere in the future.",1672277700,1672277812,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I will give it ""You should try some of my friend love this game tho"" since I actually have fun and feel good with some stupid build but I only can play it for 1 - 2 hours max per day. but still feel good when I comeback time to time...

short review : I will give this game 7/10 since it's good but in term of grinding it's burn out really fast so it's still worth you money to try it yourself.

Overall... you will have fun roaming around, killing mob, blast everything and feel good... But you can't AFK to feel REALLY GOOD. because mob and boss is just annoying... not challenging. they will have a TON of HP and keep spaming AoE everywhere. and what you have to do is RUN and DODGE while AIMING for an eternity.

Grinding... well it's suck they have endless mode but you will feel BURN OUT really fast... most item in this game unlock by achievements but in long endless run is boring so I'm not really enjoy leveling, collecting achievements and stuffs in this game.

Build... well some build is stupidly fun like Beam + Status build but most of skill/weapon is just the same thing with different elemental type... So I don't feel much different each run since I will end-up try to dodge and spam attack to proc status with large AoE.

There are so many damn currencies but they don't feel underutilized because theres so much to unlock. I have a handful of hours in, about as much time as it took to unlock everything in base Vampire Survivors, and I have 40% of the characters, 40% of the skill tree, and basically none of the special weapons or runes unlocked. 

The gameplay is super varied and fun, while also giving their huge class selection (20?!) the ability to feel unique but also have distinct overlaps. Tons of classes can spec one or two fire skills, but you can't really miss what the Pyromancer is trying to do. Weapons and runes add unique modifiers to later runs, and a skill or two that can completely change how the early game is played.

Difficulty is more similar to Hades than Vampire Survivor, with a Pact of Punishment style upgrade system that ratchets up risk and reward and gives the enemies powers to match your vertiable roguelite fantasy you've crafted over your 20+ hours of play.

Replayability is definitely there if you're the type that enjoys trying different characters, and skill/spell combinations. If you're the type that isn't into that, beating harder modes of the same map and enemies or achievement hunting, you might be left without much to do after a couple hours.

Graphics are great. Not mind blowing or anything, but they look good. Small tip though increase the transparency of the effects so you can see the markers of danger you need to avoid. Also, I don't know if it's just me, but the mouse is easy to lose in the massive amounts of spells and effects, increase the size of the mouse pointer and try changing the color to a lime green. That seems like the only color that isn't washed out by some spell effect or another.

Audio is decent. Nothing that's going to make you wish you had the soundtrack but not terrible. Sound effects are about what you'd expect from this type of game.

There's no story here, just an arcade style rogue-lite type game.

At the time of posting, I have just cleared every achievement of the game from the original list, with only the seasonal event ones to go, and the way they incentivise you to do this is by attaching unlockable features behind each of those achievements. There is a plethora of various skills to meet numerous playstyles, as well as a solid roster of characters, all of whom now have two different weapon sets that, in turn, play differently. Abilities activate automatically, which was the initial appeal to me as a veteran of Battleships Pro from back in the day. The roguelike elements also effect the play distinctly, as the skill tree gives you permanent boosts across every playthrough, and the runes page allows you to bring unique ability combinations to the table, to such an extent that you can deeply personalize every run you play in the game.

At the very base, the game is fine. It's a mostly braindead hack-n-slash where the only real difficulty is making the right choices for upgrades when you level up. It's fun to see what's available, but after you have seen all the possible upgrades it becomes glaringly obvious it really just boils down to getting lucky with rewards.

That would be fine if that was it, but the rewards are tuned horribly.

There's a ridiculous over-emphasis on using abilities [i]often[/i], rather than hitting hard. Every end-game play looks exactly the same: you've chosen your skills and they are being spammed on your screen, beyond the point of even being able to tell what is actually doing damage. I've found myself replacing skills that did good damage and had good area-of-effect just because the sheer spam of the over-the-top skill effects made it that I couldn't see a damn thing.

A lot of the later difficulty of the game comes from just overtuning mobs and bringing out more of them. The enemies aren't diverse [i]at all[/i] and require essentially [i]no[/i] strategy to kill. Even the bosses aren't really an exception, but the game finds a way around that by simply dropping in 4 bosses at the same time so you can't approach any of them without dieing. It's also glaringly obvious that the melee bosses are super easy to deal with, where bosses that mostly idle in place while dropping tons of AoE are literal hell. If you get unlucky with the 4 bosses spawning, it just becomes a boring slogfest while you whittle the bosses down.

Overal I'd rate the game 4/10 right now. It really needs to address the following points:
[list]
 [*]Reduce skill spam and massively increase skill damage. Hitting less often but doing way more damage will help reduce the ridiculous skill spam;
[*]Visual clarity: the spam of abilities and screen clutter makes seeing if you're standing in a bad spot almost impossible, even when dodging that spot would be easy otherwise;
[*]Reduce wall stick (or smooth out dashes). So often I found myself trying to dash past obstacles, only to get stuck on the tiniest branch or corner. Either make sure the edged are clearly visible, or make it easier to dash past;

Soundtrack!
Animations are VERY smooth
You can dash dodge
Controller or mouse are both viable options
Tons of varied skills with synergies
Rune system to interchange skill and buff behaviors before each run
Active updates from the dev team
Seamless game mode selection
 
The bad, and early release:
The knock back mechanic removes user control (a lot) taking you out of ""playing""
Controller navigation in menus locks you out of achievement review, active skills while on a run and has frustrating navigation on rune selection due to 8-way rather than 4
The skill tree unlocks can be completed in about 5 hours game time leaving resource collection very empty
There are currently no level items, shrines, or relics of any kind leaving each run varied only by skill selection
There are no strengths or weaknesses to any mob .ie. no resistance to ice or weakness to fire
There is only one debuff for the player, move speed
The maps are one note aside from the placement of permanent large obstacles and types of breakables (on the list for the next update)
As with most of these games, you can stack things to melt your computer (i got down to about 2 frames a second), but it is a bit difficult to do.
Due to a recent gameplay change, damage dealing is not in sync with hp scaling of monsters as you progress but doesn't really become an issue until stage 5-7 depending on your build

Overall opinion:
Taking in active development, price tag and how much entertainment to be had before things fall off, if you like this type of game there's plenty to enjoy with more on the way.  If you go in with a specific gamestyle in mind you might be disappointed. The versatility of the game is only opened up after getting an unlock to pick the same skills twice.  This is the turning point.  Before this, you might feel a little handcuffed.  Overall I enjoyed this game, but I'll be taking a break until a big update.

1) Stages don't seem to matter.  All stages have the same enemies, the only difference is what upgrade materials you can get on the stage.  Same mobs, elites, and bosses.
2) Later on in a stage I frequently end up dying without really knowing why.  I'm guessing there are just AOEs that are so covered by enemies and my own abilities that I can't see them.  Beam attacks are also infinite range despite their box not showing that.
3) There seems to be serious balance issues with weapons.  Some are just so garbage, while others are absurdly great.  There are also not any cool weapon upgrades like in Vampire Survivors, there are just Bigger Number upgrades you can get.
4) There is never a point where you feel the godlike power you get later on in a VS run.

It took me about 70 hours to unlock everything and get every in game achievement including the holiday event.

The graphical style and skill design is reminiscent of WoW for better or worse (I happen to like this).

Strengths in comparison to VS: Better build diversity, far greater skill choices, each ""class"" feels much more unique to each other compared to VS.  More active gameplay involving aiming as well as dashing.  Skill tree and the rune system is more developed that VS's arcana.

Weaknesses in comparison to VS: Map diversity is non-existent.  There are no differences between maps other than the look and atmosphere.  Only 5 maps.  Few if any secrets.  There is a joy of discovery in VS that doesn't exist here.

Conclusion: For $10 and 70+ hours of entertainment, this is a no-brainer if you enjoy this genre.  All of my listed weaknesses are in the dev's roadmap to address as this is EA.  So buy it now, have fun, and look forward to the excellent support and additions in the future.  There is so much variety now, which will be more that doubled in the future (according to roadmap).",1671908637,1671908637,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Skill balance is terrible.
Bosses are ridiculously overtuned. 2-screen wide AoEs, 10x the player attack speed. Their attacks have no collusion with the terrain. Leaving the terrain to only annoy the flank out of players, without any strategic advantages.
Higher Curse levels are only playable, if you have unrealistic luck.
The defense stats are completely worthless as they require over 100 levels worth of investments.
Half the skills are useless, badly designed, underpowered, and incredibly slow with no AoE coverage. Making them a waste of space.

[h1] Pros [/h1]
1. The upgrades [i]feel[/i] really good to obtain. You level up like crazy at the higher curse levels and almost every single upgrade feels immediately impactful to your run (I'm looking at you [b]Powerful Strikes[/b]). Once you get a good feel for the game and run through Endless and Overlord modes, you are heaping upgrades on yourself and becoming a ridiculously strong monster on the battlefield. It definitely fulfills a power fantasy.

2. There are tons of achievements to work towards so you never have an ""empty"" run for dozens of hours. I was constantly getting new prestige levels and climbing the curse ladder to gain runic power and more abilities. Once you have it all you are left with a really fun playground to test different builds and rune combos

3. The devs are pushing out really cool updates. One of my cons was going to be that a lot of the characters didn't have alternate weapons and better abilities but that changed literally yesterday. They seem really active in getting quality updates in our hands when they are ready. 

[h1] Cons [/h1]
1. Once you get far enough in a run, there is [b]so much stuff[/b] going on onscreen. Once your area of effect is large enough, you can't see enemy hitboxes anymore (even at max visibility). This isn't always a huge problem since you will be moving a lot but it hurts a few characters in the late game.

2. Some of the characters don't seem viable just yet. Maybe I haven't tried the right builds but certain characters seem to click immediately while others struggle.

There are 14 playable characters at the time of writing this review. Every single one of them has access to unique abilities, and the ones that are available to you depend on the character you are playing. This means that every character ends up having their own unique ways of being played by default (although you can change that with passive power-ups). There's a lot of unique kinds of runs you can make, which is fantastic for replayability!

The meta progression feels pretty good - You get passive unlocks that apply to every character in the game, runes that are basically powerups you can mix and match on any character and change at any time, and every character now has a main and a secondary weapon. Each weapon comes with its own unique skill and stat bonuses, which impacts playstyle even further.

Balance feels very off in some cases - Things like chaos spells feel really weak compared to a build like bleed stacking barbarian. Once you get into infinite portal 5 or 6, the scaling tends to get out of hand and it's not really feasible to keep up. Enemies have tons of health, they will one shot you if you make a mistake, but you are leveling more and more slowly so you can't keep up with their stat increases. Some builds definitely perform much, much better than others later in the game.

There are also curses that you can apply to a level before starting it - These are basically modifiers that make your runs more difficult. Some of them are simply not fun, in my opinion - it feels like added difficulty for the sake of it, which I'm sure a lot of people do enjoy, but I feel particularly negative about having invincible enemies following me around, or that have cast times so quick you can't even react.

Another thing that is frustrating currently is collisions and the AoE indicators for enemies - It is very easy to dash into a tree or corner and get stuck there, like the momentum gets you glued to the hitbox and it's really hard to get back out. I really wish you'd just slide along it instead, because a misplaced dash can easily end your run once it's been going for a while.
Also, AoE indicators can be completely incorrect - Attacks regularly go further/are wider than the indicators show once you get further into runs. I'm not sure what the deal is here, but things get hectic really quickly on higher curse levels and it makes it really difficult to tell where you can and can't stand. Enemies also cast their abilities faster and faster as your run keeps going, and at some point there's basically no time to react at all on some of them. Doesn't feel very good when you get hit for your entire life pool an hour into a run because the boss decided to smack you instantly.

At the end of the day, it's a good game. It's got some minor issues that are definitely inconvenient, but I think it's still worth getting in its current state. There's room for improvement and I do hope that the developers rework some skills and make longer runs feel more fair, as it's a really fun gameplay loop and there is tons of replayability. At the time this review was written, 100%ing should take 40-50 hours - Pretty fun grind if you're into the genre.",1671800533,1671800650,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,True

This is already a good result for the requested amount of money. But besides this, the devs are actively updating the game, releasing +/- large expansions once a month.
In the last update before the New Year 2023, a lot of skills and new weapons were added for a number of heroes, new boss and boss arena, which expanded the replay value and made it possible to return to the destruction of crowds of opponents who were not lucky enough to be on the same field as our protagonist.
The game has a fairly wide range of skills available to choose from. most of it is not available initially and opens gradually, with the unlock of new heroes, achievements and the crafting of new weapons for heroes. Yes, in the game, achievements are not just a way to satisfy a sense of completion, but also a means of accessing new game content.
Unfortunately, there are also a number of disadvantages.
As I mentioned above, crafting is present in the game. Unfortunately, this system is currently rather poorly implemented, but the devs are gradually expanding the list of objects available for crafting, and in the future this system should become quite diverse.
Also in the game there is a elveling-up system for runes earned during battles. Unfortunately, at the moment this system is also extremely non-variable and tiny. So far, the developers have not made any attempts to expand it, but due to the active work on many game systems, I am sure that this system will become a much more interesting element of the game.

However, I can't recommend it simply because of what the game becomes when you get to the chaos modes. I know these details might seem minor on the surface but it does have a major impact on the games fun and is a fundamentally flawed design that really begins to stick out.

The core issue with the design philosophy seems to be the way they handle the dodge mechanic. The frequency you can dodge means they eventually have to spam a lot of AoEs to keep it challenging...and this is exactly what happened. The end result undermines any playstyles or build diversity by around chaos 3. 

It's a shame because the game itself could be great, but unless they rework the dodging and totally change the enemy design (and those really annoying towers) then I don't see any way to make all of the diverse build options they give you to really matter or be balanced in a fun way.",1671740015,1671740015,False,5,1,0.564001858234405518,0,True,False,True

It's a skeleton of a game right now. Abilities are not balanced very well.

Late game is just increased difficulty with more AoEs to avoid, and no real incentive to do it. 

Classes are definitely not all created equal, with only one class having natural access to self healing (arguably making it far superior to all other classes).

Level ups happen so frequently that it breaks the pace of the game. If you already have the active skills you want, theres no way to automatically ignore new active abilities and instead you must click ""replace with passive abilities"", further breaking the pacing of the game. 

Currency is 99% useless, after playing for 3 hours you will have gotten enough of every resource to buy all champions, weapons, and skill tree nodes. I have like millions of minor runestones and hundreds of major runestone, gems, and other resources just sitting around. 

Runes are very meh, and mostly just unlock the ability to get active skills on classes that normally would not have access to them. 

Bomb goblins are annoying, can instantly explode if they spawn next to you and send you hurtling across the map. It's almost a requirement to get a fast aoe to defend against them. This is like a ""build tax"" that is forced on you just to play the game. 

Developers just dropped an update, that didn't address any of the current problems that most players agree the game has, and instead just added 19 new active abilities (there are plenty of active abilities for the current game state), which some minor fixes to balancing.

My average time for beating zones is 14 minutes, more so 13.5 but still. It is a perfect length for me, I get to then try a new approach, maybe an all bomb area build, or a frontal cast attack build, it is just fun to mess around with.

This is already pretty frustrating when there are such massive discrepancies, but it's not just a matter of huge damage gaps, for example:

-Skill that don't multi-hit (or buff you) are awful because status buildup is all that matters
- Many skills are rendered functionally useless because they completely blanket the screen to the point where you cannot see enemies, targeting circles, and terrain at all
- The majority of aoe skils that the player is not directly aiming are of no use because you have to kite bosses at all times and that means they will not stand in the AOEs

This take on a 'Vampire Survivors' style game emphasizes build diversity and more minute control over your character.

It's high damage enemies don't always gel well with the laser light show that is the presentation, but it doesn't stop the game from being massively compelling.

In it's current early access state, the 'earliest' of its components are its out of combat progression layers which fall off pretty early and will leave you with no way to spend your currencies. If that's a big incentive for you, I'd say the game is currently in 'wishlist and see' territory rather than being an outright purchase.

The developer is extremely interactive on Discord and there is a solid community that shares insights into potential build ideas (both practical and theory-crafting). Additional modes (boss runs, endless mode, etc.) mix up the gameplay formula a bit, and ongoing new skills/weapons add more reasons to try another build. Fantastic value and great longevity so far.

Original Review: I enjoyed this during the Steam Next event and the early access release is even more polished and fun than before. Following on the hot trend of arena survival rogue-lites with numerous unlocks, upgrades, and more. What I love most about the game is it actually plays like a twin-stick shooter, so you can independently aim (for skills that allow aiming - some are radius, random, etc) while moving. 

I love the graphics style and after about 5 runs so far successfully completed two of them, which is done (as far as I can tell) by killing enough enemies for bosses to spawn and then defeating them.

There are numerous types of upgrades, between weapons, skill trees, and runs, but I'm still pretty early and have only unlocked a few that add the usual dmg %, cast speed %, and comparable, so I don't know how game-changing other upgrades are.

Different characters/classes seem to have a specific list of skills (aligning to certain tags) that thematically align with them but also keep it so not every skill is open to every class (again, as far as I can tell).

1. Make it so there are more viable unique builds. I have reverted to going for blood build and status affect over and over. I get every debuff ability and stack them on enemies as quick as I can. I feel like on all the heroes I play I am trying to move back to this build. Maybe add more builds ie: straight defense, HP regen, spike armor, combo of certain styles to be more potent, a way to increase rarity of level up rewards, etc.
2. Endless resource sink for empowerment. I have everything upgrade and all my resources are now just piling up...The only reason I am playing is to get through curse levels to unlock the remaining heroes. Every time I finish a run I look at my resource pile and think ""whats the point of collecting these?"".
3. Make each hero's unique abilities more pronounced. Just removing certain styles of moves or abilities isn't really defining that hero as powerful. There should be a more drastic difference between each hero, refer to point 1.
Bonus: Differing bosses, mobs, move sets/attacks, decrease range and overwhelming amounts of AOE on field at once. There are some times there is literally no where to run at all due to hundreds of enemy AOE circles on the ground. (usually not a huge issue only occasionally running into this)

Overall I think there is a solid backbone to this game with decent points, I just would like to see a solid endless feedback with more unique builds for each class that are fun to play.

Harder means the usual enemies have more HP, do more damage, but it also means more elites. Which basically means all the time. Same with suicide goblins that explode instantly when touching you.  The result ends up being a really jank mechanical and visual mess, where you might be trying to play a melee character, but find yourself unable to actually get within striking range of bosses because there's 8000000000 incoming area damage indicators on your location at all times, and about 300 enemies body blocking you from getting wihin range.  Or, if you are in range, you will be knocked away by one of the suicide goblins that you couldn't see, because of all the area damage indicators and other enemies on the screen at one time. 

This is in stark contrast to vampire survivors, where your main object is simply not get touched at all, with the infrequent ranged attacks.  This game pretty just amps up the ranged attacks, by way of area damage indicators, by whole orders of magnitude as the difficulty goes up. This leads the game to more towards ""annoying"" difficulty rather than ""challenging"".  

The skill tree is also pretty small, I've completely filled it out save for one item after like 8 hours of play.  Generally speaking, it does little to combat ""+300% boss health"" anyways.",1671430989,1671430989,False,5,1,0.5,2,True,False,True

This version offers a mechanic which allows you to choose which direction you would like to fire. Some weapons target randomly, others fire in a line, some shoot repeatedly, and some are AOE that stem from your characters position. 

This is a fun and slightly tweaked style that has given me lots of replays and none of them are ever the same. 

There is an option to turn on curses which modify the difficulty and also rewards you with items upon completion. There is an infinite mode and another mode that increases difficulty by adding more 2 or bosses at a time. Lots to do and lots to explore.

The performance issues are very bad and it's not because your pc is bad but because the code and settings are incompetent. Having opacity control instead of particle control is just a sick joke.

This game is in as much of early access as it is possible to be, complete lack of content - almost no items, nowhere to spend anything and just so many flaws and things that need change.

The way combat difficulty is increased is also dumb. My entire screen becomes red with enemy attack indicators at some point when playing on max curse. 

Even how the enemies function is flawed. Often you dodge attacks by dashing but because a large attack was released off-screen where you couldn't see it, you just dash into it and get hit.

Cheap Vampire Survivors knock-off. This game is like a demo but it costs more than vampire survivors.

I've put it down for the moment to wait on more content before burning myself out on it, but let me tell you, this is the first game in a while that addicted me as hard as it did for the first week I was playing it- literally every day at work I was itching, counting down the minutes until I could get home to play this more- no other game has given me that feeling in years. I would highly recommend.

Oh, also personal tip- if you find the higher difficulties frustrating, I found it more fun to just play at full t5 curses instead of full t7- still provides a degree of challenge without forcing you into a small selection of builds to clear the content.

Like other games in this genre, this one offers many classes and builds, some of which can take a while to master but feel very rewarding once you get there. The effects, environments and character designs are also satisfying and stand out amidst other titles of this genre which largely prefer 2D SNES-like visuals. My biggest gripe is how stupid the difficulty scaling is -- especially at the very final scale of difficulty. Scaling up the difficulty here basically means that you face innumerable random AoE projectiles every second, enemies become insurmountable bullet sponges, the number of bosses gets multiplied (which is annoying because it is clear that none of these were designed to go together and have a bunch of recycled moves between each other), enemy attacks go off before your brain can even process them with near perfect tracking, etc. Moreover, the obstacles mentioned above are made all the more challenging when the screen is being blasted by the myriad of visual effects that are produced by those same obstacles; this is particularly bad because these effects can mask walls or other enemy attacks which can cost you your run. These aspects of the game altogether narrow down the number of viable builds to what I believe is a fairly scant number, which is disappointing because I find the less optimal builds to be substantially funner to play. For example, one of the few viable builds I've found is capable of completing the final difficulty scale relies on saturating your roster of skills with summons which clip on negative effects and damage over time while you stand back and not actually play the game. So in sum, while I recommend this game as a promising alternative to Vampire Survivors, I will be frustrated if the difficulty scaling does not get improved in future patches and more viable build alternatives emerge.",1670736896,1671060283,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

I think the team has some good ideas on hand with offering certain skills with certain characters, offering a Rune Tree, Skill Tree, Blacksmith, and Achievement unlocks. I think Blacksmith could be fleshed out more than it is, it doesn't feel like changing your weapon, for some characters, really does anything meaningful, since skill you start with can just be replaced anyway. Skill trees look impactful but ends up feeling really basic and could be expanded a bit more. Runes seem like they offer changes to how you play a character, which is nice.

I'm interested to see what this game could be later, but the spam of red circles from enemies gets so excessive that sometimes I feel like I am getting targeted by enemies I can't even see off screen, and I have to snipe them with long range skills to make any progress, and it kills any real tension the game has because you aren't dodging enemies.

Generic stages, generic characters, generic powers, generic enemies - soulless and empty and overpriced.
Overall, the game is -fine- . . . . but it does what it does and that's it.
No razzle-dazzle to it what so ever.

It sets out to be a fairly uninspired Hoard Survivor and it achieve that but the aesthetic is nonexistent, the vibe is frustrating and cold, and the game is a grind fest. As someone who loves Survivors-likes, you expect a little grind, but the game isn't challenging or engaging enough to warrant that.
To top it all off, the game is a time sink.
The meta upgrades don't carry nearly enough impact to make a dent in the games time sink - i.e. you don't become strong enough to outstrip the games churn of waves of enemies and the rewards for each run aren't enough to merit doing the ""one more run"" addictive fun that solid Hoard Survivors have.

That BUT at the beginning is the reason I can't recommend this game to pretty much anyone outside of starving Hoard Survivor fanatics, ESPECIALLY at the price. The gall to sell it for its base price of $10 for what's on offer is kind of the most disappointing thing about it.",1670758120,1670758120,False,1,1,0.440165072679519653,0,True,False,True

TLDR: Good game if you want to feel overpowered and don't mind grinding, but have some problem with late game contents(Just like most of EAs).
On lower difficulty(curse level) this game is perfectly playable,but there are some problems as the curse level rises: 
First, health crystal always heal you for a fixed number no matter how many health you have, which makes stacking health very ineffective. 
Second, you only gets to dash twice even with the upgrade, when there is only once boss, two dashes can dodge most of there attacks with no problem, but- spoiler alter- when you am trying to unlock DK, there will be 3 bosses chasing you around, exploding goblins trying to push you all over the place, meteors falling every where. You need to dash 5 times in a row to even think about dodging those.
Also, having different rarities for upgrades kind of defeat the purpose of having 3 upgrade choices, I kind of hope everything is balanced into the same level.

Edit: Finally completed all stage in max difficulty, the bosses are actually not a big problem since there can't be more than 5 of them at once. But the corrupted paladin is easily the most annoying enemy in the game, especially his holy fire attack comes out so fast that is almost undodgeable(or literal unavoidable if you are playing DK) if you are too close and hits for 50+.

First off, this is a twin-stick shooter. So if you arent a fan of those, then dont buy his games. Almost every skill has to be directionally aimed with the right thumb-stick or mouse cursor.

Secondly, enemies CONSTANTLY hit you from off the screen wherre you cannot see them. You'll be doing fine then an elite snake and boss laser will be casted off the screen on oposite sides where you must eat one, and you'll die.

Weapons dont evolve, which means there's zero thought in your loadout, you just grab your 6 weaps and pray to RNG gods for epic buffs. Which makes the game pretty dull, imo.

Characters dont feel unique at all. They have minor stat difference, but none of them have unique character gimmicks and play exactly the same. One may have a little less HP and extra Crit Damage, but thats the extent. None of them get +2 missiles every 20 levels or anything actually game-changing.

Fun, replayability, highly tailored difficulty with allowing you to choose curse intensity, and the visuals are great. They've resolved a ton of performance concerns but still some tweaks need to be made.

Pros:

- Music
- Visuals (mind you, this is relative to others in the genre)
- Gameplay loop is fun
- The amount of runes and survivors to choose from means there are many MANY different playstyles
- In depth, or as shallow as you'd like
- Customizable difficulty (curse customization)
- Maps look nice and are (somewhat) diverse
- In-match graphic tweaks are instance, non-laggy, and convenient. I'm impressed honestly

Cons

- lack of weapons (this will be fixed as the game develops, devs are WONDERFUL, so this isn't a deal breaker)
- Difficulty ramp is ""enemies have more health, more damage"" which...limits a lot of playstyles. You WILL need high damage, you WILL need luck, you WILL need to get a specific rune for the higher curse intensities (+5% damage per negative effect) combined with getting the slow passive and the coveted Hypothermia passive in-match just to stay close to something feasible to beat a 40+ curse intensity round
- Skills are vast, but limited. What I mean is, a dot is a dot and rarely does that include an interesting passive. Other than slight damage value tweaks, dots are more setup for skills that enhance said dots, or vice versa (e.g. you must have a skill that applies a fire dot for there to be a chance that the effect takes place)

If the devs read this, I would LOVE to see difficulty in numbers, and not just damage, health, movement speed (especially the movement speed; forces on-hit slow stacking to be able to process what's going on at level 4+)

Overall, this game is wonderful, and has the potential to be a masterpiece, given the right development priorities. Once new weapons get implemented, I'll probably binge more of it. Just kidding, I'm going to do that anyway.

8.5/10; I'm 95% positive if you've made it this far, you'll enjoy the game :)

It's Vampire Survivor but there are more RPG elements (skills tree, runes and weapons that you can equip to enhance your) and character diversity.

Pro: 
Huge character diversity. Your death knight might not be the same as your friends 
Long list of skills and synergies. Each skills have tags (projectile, fire, ice etc) that have synergies with other skills and powers

Con:
The hitboxes are horrible in this game. Sometimes your get hit when you shouldn't. Obstacles in this game also have weird hitboxes that makes them more annoying to dodge that it should be.
Visuals clutter. You will end up making skills look 95% invisible once you progress further in the game. Also, red banners appears all the time taking up 1/5 of your screen announcing boss and objectives. 
Ping pong physics. There is a rag doll-ish physics in this game that sends your character flying across the map when you get hit. I don't think it adds anything and it's more of a nuisance.

The game trains a player to use minion stacking or beams, bolts and AOE spin to win tatics.  Movement buffs are almost needed so bad because the AI can target you very quickly and if you use the damage for speed reduction you will just get overwhelmed.

But it does well in differentiating itself from the original.
A smithing mechanic enables you to craft weapons for characters, the weapon you choose determines your starting Attack.
Runes allow to you to change the gameplay slightly and offer great challenges to unlock them.

- characters are distinctive at the start of games but can lose their uniqueness later in the same games as you can replace their unique starting abilities

- the system that indicates hostile abilities (red circles) needs an overhaul as they are virtually invisible against your own screen-covering abilities in late game

Visibility in survivors games is already a challenge because there's inevitably going to be a point, especially at high difficulties, where your screen and character are overwhelmed by enemies, often making character movement a really careful game of trying to balance extreme powers with avoiding a crowd of enemies who will suck your life instantly. 

Well, this game basically takes that problem and says ""hey, why don't we go even further with Area of Effect attacks for both the main character and enemies?"" At first, this mechanic feels pretty cool, especially if you've played other Survivor games because it seems like a way of adding more complexity to both enemy and player attacks, while still visually communicating this information on the map. But, as you start to get better and add ""curses"" onto runs, there becomes a point where you literally can't see anything because the entire ground is almost always covered in AoE stuff, projectiles are everywhere, various animations are happening simultaneously, and the game has a ton of collision points, so even if you try to dodge your way out of a clustertruck of visibility issues, there's a chance you'll get stuck on some tiny mob enemy or a piece of scenery. 

I like difficult games and I can respect certain visibility elements of bullet-hell style games, but there's a point where this isn't about skill or real difficulty, but rather about the way the designers chose to structure mechanics and information on screen. It generally feels like right when you're really ""getting good"" at the game, it hits a point where skill stops being a major focus and it really starts being about your patience of dealing with the most busy explosion effects, projectiles, and other visual distractions ON TOP of the already busy qualities of a Survivor game. Comedically, all of this nonsense actually makes it so that the game's mobs are much smaller than a typical Survivor game as well, despite actually messing up visibility even more.

At this moment in time, I still think games like Vampire Survivors and Rogue Genesia are much better implementations of these mechanics, especially with Rogue Genesia's level system. Yeah, I like the look and number of classes in this game, but I sure as hell don't enjoy playing it as much as other Survivors style games currently.",1670173947,1670173947,False,3,0,0.498886406421661377,0,True,False,True

Which I personally find a little dumb because why force people to play characters they might not want to play.

If this game would be like 20+ I wouldn't have bought it but for this price tag it's a really good game. I hope that they will add more stuff to do because as I said you will get bored fast.

I came to this game as someone who has completed Vampire Survivors 100% as of 1.0 and if you're looking for a game of this type and haven't played that yet, go play that instead.

As for Soulstone Survivors I was having fun with the first couple of difficulties but they were a little too easy and once you reach Curse VI, it just becomes completely dependent on RNG.

Here's the issues:

1. Leveling system

When you level up you get either a new skill or trait (correspond to weapons and items respectively in Vampire Survivors)

There's a wide variety of weapons but at higher levels ~80% of them are useless. When weapons are offered to you there's three to choose from and you have a limited number of rerolls per run and if you don't get the right weapons you'll get smoked pretty quickly. Arcane Power, Bladestorm, Chaos Missile, Might, and Bloodlust for example stand head and shoulders above so many other skills that unless you roll well, you might as well restart.

Traits follow the same model of being offered three choices per level

For traits they fall into a few categories: boosting one of your stats by a static number (health, block, armor), boosting a specific group or a single skill by a percentage additively, or giving your weapons a chance to proc a damage over time property. 

This means there's no unique progression for each weapon. Each weapon can have a increased cast speed, area, damage, or a chance to cast multiple times but this means that you have to hope to roll good choices otherwise your run is over because you didn't find the trait that gave you enough damage or multicast to continue.

2. Enemies

The basic flow of each stage is that you have to kill x number of enemies and then a boss shows up. Rinse and repeat until you've done this 5 times and then you can enter a portal to end the run or enter a different one to continue.

There's just a handful of bosses (6 or so I think) so you'll see the same ones over and over which wouldn't be a problem but some of them are very similar to the other ones. The ice guy and the poison guy are basically the same and so is the guardian and the fire guy. 

The bosses and most elites have the ability to CC you pretty hard so it's not uncommon to have your run ended by being bounced in the air by getting sideswiped by a random elite and then having every boss and elite aim their huge AoE right where you're going to land essentially one shotting you.

3. Difficulty

Once you've completed a stage on a certain difficulty you can challenge it on the next tier up to 7 tiers. 

With each tier the enemies get stronger, have more health, and your healing is reduced (there's practically no healing available already)

There's also additional factors like towers which start spawning all over the map which can shoot AoE blasts at you, an invincible ghost that chases you and can kill you instantly, and more bosses spawn whenever you reach the enemies killed threshold.

All fine in theory but in practice your run is so dependent on RNG that unless you get near optimal skills and traits you're dead by the time the second set of bosses spawns.

Their health pools become massive and their damage is so high that they can easily take off 60-80% of your health in one hit. So you're stuck kiting a deathball of 3 bosses. Unless you can melt them, it takes forever to kill them and before you can do that you've probably already triggered the next wave of bosses.

So now you have 5 bosses, 10 towers, a million elites, all with the potential to one shot you if you get bounced the wrong way. If you haven't gotten enough stacks of the movement speed trait, you can't even move out of the way of the constant red circles unless you're spamming dodge as soon as it becomes available.

Improvement points: at 48 curses around level 200, it becomes impossible to survive, just because at some point you have 10 bosses and 3 overlords hunting you and some skill shots are insanely big and fast, also, they do not have the red area since the skill comes from outside your screen and one hit will kill you, so, it would be awesome if we could actually see the skill shot coming OR having the red area even if the overlord is not at the screen

It is Early Access, so, I assume that in the future the materials will be used to create better weapons and/or upgrade them, not much use for the legendary mats at this point

Vampire Survivor's (VS) charm is that it's very silly. Its weapons are silly, its stages are silly, the meta progression stuff is silly; there are a bunch of secret characters and references because it doesn't take itself seriously in the slightest, and I can't overstate how much of a plus that is for it. Conversely, Soulstone Survivors (SS) takes itself way too seriously, which isn't [i]necessarily[/i] bad, but you need to know that it affects the way the game plays out in a number of ways.

Firstly, build design never gets stupid in the same way. All the weapons can be pushed to stupid limits in terms of damage, effect size and multicasting a bunch of times, but fun stuff like the zaniness of evolved weapons creating insane new particle effects and drastically increasing your power level don't exist here. [i]However[/i], build design does feel more meaningful in Soulstone Survivors. In VS (assuming late game meta progression) you can basically slap together whatever weapons you want, and, as long as you line yourself up for some evolutions, you'll be good pretty much whatever you do. SS wants you to take the build crafting more seriously. Even average builds can still struggle past the first endless loop, so you need to ensure you're putting together good synergy every time.

Fortunately, the build design stuff is where Soulstone Survivors is at its best. There're tonnes of weapon choices (actives), and you have the option to replace your current actives if they’re not working, or you find something with better synergy. Each character only has access to specific spheres of actives, which makes swapping characters provide different experiences as the active options change*. Furthermore, you can import skills from outside a character's skillset through the rune system, which gives you some unusual combos if you want. Lastly, the developers are looking to add a ton more skills to the game by full release, so the options are only going to get more varied. Putting together the best combination each run is a moreish experience, though not without faults.

* A criticism that all the actives are ultimately just variations on certain basic ideas might be reductive, but I wouldn’t disagree either.

Being able to replace your actives anytime is great, but after a certain point it's irritatingly difficult to figure out which of your actives are underperforming and need to go. You can't view any damage totals until after the run, and distinguishing which set of damage numbers go with which active is a complete nightmare once the screen starts filling with effects and everything's dying so fast. I'm starting to get a 'feel' for when something isn't good enough but risking changing something in a run that's otherwise going fine at the moment feels painful. It wouldn't really matter all that much, but if you plan to go deep on the endless runs then there isn't really room for underperforming elements in your build after a certain point.

Worth noting here that the challenge of build design drops off a cliff into the first or second loop because you probably have actives you're happy with (or can't tell are bad), and now you're just mashing boring damage upgrades to stay on top of the damage sponge levels. At this point you've basically seen everything your build will do and all that's left is finding out how long it can keep going. 

Also, it might be too early for me to really tell, but some actives just feel a lot worse than others, even when they're played in combinations that seem very synergistic. It's something you can only really learn by playing and then seeing the damage totals at the end, but, having seen it a few times, it's kinda frustrating that some stuff just isn't as good as it seems it should be. There will always be elements that're stronger or weaker because balancing things perfectly is a tall order, but I've seen some actives that strikingly underperform even in builds that seem really tailored to them.

There're several other areas that clearly need improvement too. There're five stages, but they're all functionally identical. The map obstacles vary slightly in look and shape, but the maps are always the same rectangular layout with the same enemies. The only mechanical difference between stages are the meta resources you can get from each, which really don't matter because you only need a small amount of each relative to how grindy the other meta progression goals are.

On that point, meta progression seems poorly paced. You start out picking up meta buffs, and you can get a few at the end of each run, which is nice. But you’ll soon find that a lot of the later levels are tied to boss gems that you only get in limited numbers during runs, but the weighting for a lot of the upgrades is towards the earliest boss gem. This seems nice because you know you’ll likely get some of these in a run, but [i]so many[/i] upgrades need this first boss gem type that you’ll find the later gem types piling up as you only need them for one or two upgrades each, but you’ll be massively bottlenecked by the first gem type the rest of the time.

Lastly, I mentioned earlier that characters’ active choices are dictated by their innate spheres, but, unfortunately, outside of that variance, they’re basically all the same. The character select screen tells you that they have different buffs to one another, but the meaningfulness of those distinctions will be lost after the first few minutes of  play. You get so many options to pick up basic stats buffs that starting with a character starting with an extra 10% crit chance is literally meaningless when you can easily make up that difference in a single level up. Even characters’ base actives, which are unique and could give them some identity, are often very weak compared to the actives you get from level ups, so they often end up being the first thing you overwrite, which I think removes a lot of uniqueness characters could have had if those actives were more central to their build design options.

All in all, the build stuff has merit. I wish there were options to make abilities go completely insane in a VS way, but I'm embracing the more sane approach that SS is taking, and I think it has a rich diversity of build options for people that like to tinker with build design to explore. Everything else is kind of a mess though. Maps are bland, enemies are bland, characters lack identity, the meta progression pacing is fine at first and then just hits a tedious grind wall because of resource bottlenecking. If you liked VS for its charm, quirk and laid back approach then I’d argue that this doesn’t even come close, but if you wanted more from VS from a gameplay perspective then SS delivers in spades.",1670013250,1670013250,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Now i have not unlocked EVERYTHING, but i got most charachters unlocked exept one, that damned 10 minute one still evades me. lol

Looking forward to more content, weapons and such, there are not an alt weapon for all charachters yet, as far as i know.
Perhaos something unlockes when i really have grinded out the levels on some of the classes/people.

Or it is unlocked by doing the harder map chalanges.

But what is there NOW is worth paying for, i am happy i have already got it, and will no doubt spend MANY hours on it still. 
And that is even before more content is added. :D

So i hope for more dudes/dudetts and weapons and buffs in the future, but i still love it already.

*Disclaimer* I did not review any material or news from the publisher or developer

What I enjoyed:
The music is next level, amps me up a lot.
Feels smooth to play and doesn't get any lag on my device.
 (I beat the requirements by a lot though)
General gameplay loop is a lot of fun... smack stuff around, boss event, loot, repeat
Seems pretty well balanced
Graphics are great and skills feel visceral
Interesting abilities and passives

What I dislike:
Character customization is a bit shallow but I'm hoping this is just a symptom of early access
No multiplayer and (I may be wrong) it seems there won't be multiplayer
System progressions have wildly different progression speeds
 - IE: I have almost every talent and will have the remaining few soon, but have unlocked less than a 5th of the runes
UI needs to provide more information, specifically what you will get for spending in game currencies.
 - IE: The blacksmith wont even let you look at what a weapon will get you until you have invested in the character that will use the weapon.
Build diversity is lacking.  So far all the best builds I have found get a bunch of skills with the same type / tags and get things that effect all your abilities.  I don't see any builds so far focusing a smaller subset of abilities or unique interactions
Support skills have wild discrepancies in balance, some being a must have while others aren't worth a slot even if there was multiplayer

The gameplay is fun, interactive but not a burden, builds are extremely diverse and every run is different thanks to the RNG nature of the upgrade system. For 10€ this game is a steal, the devs have done an amazing job at combining the Roguelike genre with an ARPG twist, something I had not seen before but that just feels right.

There are absolutely NO microtransactions / in-game purchases, this is 100% buy and play, which is refreshing in todays' market where games, even single player oriented ones, try and push in-app purchases down your throat at every turn.

Only negative point, the game can be extremely taxing on your setup, especially if you display all damage numbers, have your graphic settings set to high and use high intensity skills (be it in terms of visuals or in terms of DoT calculations). Hopefully the devs manage to optimize the game to make it run better, however by tweaking the settings you should be able to run it on mid-budget setups just fine.

Thanks a lot to the Soulstone Survivors team for making such a brilliant game, it might just be in early access at the moment but it's already a gem, and it can only get better from here on out !",1669787391,1669787391,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Soulstone Survivors offers both in excellent quality while also maintaining a form of balance. There are stuff that are vastly underpowered relative to others but it all comes down to how the build is made alongside it.

I like the ever increasing challenges and curses, as well as the variety of stages. However, they lack creativity in terms of the design. All the stages are big square spaces with bits of obstacles thrown here and there. The curses are either more enemies or some kind of handicap. I think stages need to be overhauled and reshaped such as a rectangular shaped map with narrow bridges connecting islands, or a vertically designed stage where there are mines, or even put traps where extra enemies will spawn, etc. There are also no upgrade pickups that incentive players to explore the map. Instead, you have ores and health crystals but they spawn randomly so you can literally move one screen away and come back to spawn them. Each of the maps also do not have their own ""identity"". Oh here's a square space with bones, this one is a desert with palm trees, and this one has ice in them. Maybe put a key building of some sort to give them a little personality instead of just bland, generic spaces.

The menus are very cluttered. When I play with my controller (and I always play survivors with controller), I can't even choose curse stages, so for the first 5 hours, I thought you can't roll back the curses. I accidentally found out when I was alt-tabbing between monitors by clicking on the numbers in stage selection. Also, moving from one rune selection to another with a controller is a big pain in the neck. I suggest the devs take a more streamlined approach to menu designs to enable better controller support.

This game is still one of the more exciting survivors I played and hopefully at full release, I will see more content and creativity put into this game. It has a lot of potential with the foundation it has now.

It's still in EA, so I'm not going to give any ratings.

P.S. Replace spell archetypes with icons instead of a long list of words. Make use of colors more between enemy types and please, make audio cues more audible for boss attacks.

Mush in some more wave-defense and deck-building type elements, and you've got yourself a monster-blasting good time. The characters have identity through their skills and particular stat boosts, but I wish they had more personality. 

I'm for a good time, not for a long time. If you like destroying monsters and figuring out how to manipulate damage systems, then this game is 100% worth the spend for the 40-60 hours of content I imagine you'll get out of it. There's not a ton of polish in the game, but it doesn't feel ""straight out of alpha"" and I experienced no major bugs in my play though. There's definitely a lot of complexity invested in character and skill diversity and mechanics interaction.  The game will feel the same on a run-over-run basis but the goals of your character and what skills they use will change dramatically, and that's where the replayability comes from. Although, I think we need some tuning for the other classes versus the Paladin guy, who's has a self-heal that almost no other classes have access too. One of his default abilities is also absurdly powerful.

If everything on the content road map is added, I'll definitely back for a few more rounds after I 100% the game in its current state. Feels pretty good on the Steam Deck too. My hours were split about 75% deck, 25% desktop.

Fun
casual
good way to spend few hours or massive amount of hours(I know I don't have that many hours spent on this just yet but I did have couple of good 5 hour marathons playing this. Just switched my brain off and put on some music and turned on the game)

Cons:
maps are the same just different textures on them
once you've unlocked all the skills there isn't any use for the soulstones that you collect from the bosses(still in EA so this might change once the full game is out)

SS is takes (for the most part) bits of Vampire Survivors, and adds some depth, like graphical fidelity, weapon crafting (as far as what it offers for now), both skill tree and runes to make both specific and varried builds.

For what SS offers now, is an abundance of entertainment (when you don't grind out for higher difficulty) with what it has to offer right now, which makes it have a high potential to be a great game in the future. Right now I'd say it's quite good, but can always be improved, considering the maps feel 'samey' alongside the enemy variety and overlords, in addition to the amount of skills that will be put in, I'd say SS has the potential to be a vast game with a lot of builds which could keep a lot of people hooked on its gameplay.

All in all, SS is already quite the decent game, even for a €9.99 priced game... it offers a lot of fun for what it offers, and I certainly do look forward for future updates.",1669636089,1669636089,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Area visibility is bad in this game, very bad especially in endgame. Now you could say this is a design feature to make you pick and choose abilities but I say that's lazy and unacceptable an answer. Layer AOE markers ABOVE user abilities at the very least, make it pretty later. Another problem that doesn't feel great to deal with is knockback/dashing. Getting caught on a tree with a hitbox of a football field and not being able to dash through it sucks.

I would prefer to have more trash and less bosses as they are just frustrating and less fun then the rest of the game. I know he needs optimizations to get that going better though.

The biggest issue and frustration with this game is there are only 3-4 builds that can do curse 7. It starts to limit the fun when you need to be paladin or beam build to do the highest level. Would prefer all specs be viable to increase replayability. This issue could cause me to take back my recommendation.

Another issue I dislike is bosses leaving permanent gunk on ground it's not a fun mechanic to be forced to take nickel and dime damage since only arcaneshield, exorcism,  and smite can prevent or recover damage. I think you need to be friendlier with health recovery and when you lose a life the next should be at full health. It's a stupid and lazy way to increase difficulty.

This game is the pretty version of Vampire Survivors.

But it ends there. The majestic chaos of VS and the godlike abilities are not present in this game. Instead, you on a playing field where enemy strikes are falling everywhere. One hits will kill you from across the board. A fun run can end in seconds from a one hit you never saw coming. 

RNG is rarely in your favor. Your build is never going to work how you want it. You cannot claim that one aspect of the build you direly need because it never presents itself. You cannot play with the build and get creative - if you try a silly set up with multiple packs of putrid hounds - you are sure to lose. Your build demands that you follow a rigid set up or you will melt absolutely nothing.

This game has none of the gleeful destruction of VS, you spend ALL of your time trying to disengage and run away from danger and praying your paltry dashes will get you to safety. It isn't a soulslike game of GET GUD it is a punishing roll of the dice and luck. You are nerfed and nothing is going to work in your favor.

EA means there will - hopefully - be balance and fun in the future. I am looking forward to seeing where it goes. I love the genre, but this lacks the fun at the moment.",1667850355,1669513375,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

pros: same game with new skills and characters

cons:
movement: i feel like i get stuck on alot of things i should'nt get stuck on.
visual clarity: your own skills are your biggest enemy. we do have a transparency slider, but just having blue and red circles is boring to watch.
the added rune system, which basically is a small talent tree, is just boring.
curse system reveals the bad/unplayable characters and skills.

Positives

The gameplay is miles more engaging. 
Weapons/active skills can always be swapped making build variety.  
The unlocks feel more earned.  
To ""beat"" a round, you can take anywhere from around 10/20 minutes so you don't have to time commit if you don't want to.  Even if you do, the game has 2 types of 'endless' modes that focus on difficulty rather than endurance.
Each character has more identity than just ""starts with X weapon & stats/modifier"".
You are encouraged to play with difficulty modifiers (more XP for characters = more XP for unlocks).

With added content (more characters, more weapons/skills, more maps, modes...) this will surely be a must buy.
However, there are still flaws which I expect to be addressed in the future
Enemies' attack indicator is still incorrect for some. I get hit way too often at the end of bosses' cone attack or outside the red ring despite the indicator not reaching me. 
Occasionally I get multihit by invisible attacks not shown on screen. Suspect is the flamethrower skill from the boss though I have no way to know (all these are from latest patch which claim them to be fixed already btw).
Dead knight as of right now is very hard to clear 48 curses. His special ability (stun immunity) is useless as they remove stun but don't give him new ability and he already has no dodge. The fixed holy void hunter spawn early is very likely 1 live gone at least since its holy fire skill is so hard to dodge with short cast time and huge AOE, not to mention all those red rings around you. 
With multiple poison and ice boss, your ability as dead knight to traverse terrain also get gimped quite a lot if the poison puddles/ice patch block narrow path (especially on the ice map).
So either you get really lucky in your level up (good skills/upgrade or around 250%+ ms early, all that with good runes) or you have to bring in extra survivability through holy/arcane? skills and that will cost you 2 precious rune slots.
