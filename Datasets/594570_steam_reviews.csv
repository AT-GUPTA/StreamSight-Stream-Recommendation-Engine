i really enjoyed it but then we got updates with terrible systems or caveat 
for a long time i played with no mods only.

i went from loving to play empire to hating the new elector system because of how punishing it was and how it limited your play style so i went to high elves liked that more fav faction

the ai cheating made the game very tedious where you would be overwhelmed a lot of time buy dark elves from across the map if you played empire steam rolling you out of blue with cheated income and armies

it wasnt till i found out about SFO grimhammer i really started to like this game again 
then i found other mods and other mods and it became my new skyrim 2.0 game haha

its so satisfying seeing your cavalry hiding among the tree lines, baiting your enemies in your kill zone, and seeing your cav units emerge and smashing the enemy. some good ole hammer and anvil. theres also all sorts of different playstyles depending on the faction you are playing.

Takes minutes to load every screen and every battle even with an SSD and the game runs like scheisse and randomly crashes anyways, after many hours of pain you'll get your campaign wins and just be like ""why did I waste so much time on this""

If we want publishers to stop doing bad things like this, we have to stop buying and/or downvoting games that have these practices.
Now it sadly became ""normal"" to say ""the video game is an industry"", while at its heart it is a labour of love.
Being rescpectful of the gamer doesnt impede the creation of good games and the realisation of profit.

As a long-time fan of both the Total War series and the Warhammer universe, this game surpasses expectations, delivering a captivating experience that keeps me hooked for hours on end.

The variety of factions and races is staggering, each with its own unique playstyle, units, and narrative. From the regal High Elves to the menacing Skaven, the attention to detail in both visuals and lore is commendable. Creative Assembly has truly brought the Warhammer world to life with meticulous craftsmanship.

The campaign map is a sprawling tapestry of diverse landscapes and settlements, offering a strategic depth that challenges even the most seasoned commanders. The introduction of the Vortex campaign adds a layer of urgency, driving the narrative forward and adding an extra dimension to the overall gameplay.

The battles, the heart and soul of any Total War game, are a spectacle to behold. The clash of colossal armies, magical spells, and legendary lords creates an exhilarating experience. The strategic depth of army composition, flanking maneuvers, and hero abilities ensures that every battle is a unique and engaging affair.

The addition of the Mortal Empires campaign, combining the maps of Warhammer I and II, creates an unprecedented playground for conquest. The sheer scale of this campaign is a testament to Creative Assembly's commitment to providing players with an epic and enduring experience.

While the game is a triumph, it is not without its minor flaws. The turn times in the later stages of the campaign can be a bit lengthy, and some factions may feel more challenging than others due to their starting positions and diplomatic situations. However, these are minor quibbles in the grand tapestry of Warhammer II's brilliance.

In conclusion, Total War: Warhammer II stands as a shining example of what can be achieved when two great franchises come together. It's a captivating blend of strategy, fantasy, and sheer epic scale. Whether you're a seasoned strategist or a newcomer to the series, this game is a must-play for anyone seeking an immersive and grandiose gaming experience.",1706888812,1706888812,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Creative Assembly has managed to concoct a devilishly addictive concoction that combines the strategic finesse of the Total War series with the over-the-top, lore-drenched madness of Warhammer. It's like watching a barbarian horde crash a high society ball - chaos and entertainment ensue in equal measure.
Let's start with the main dish: the base game. Total War: Warhammer II isn't just a strategy game; it's a masterclass in world-building and faction design. The campaign map alone is a sprawling, meticulously detailed canvas that's more engrossing than an old wizard's spellbook. Whether you're rallying the stalwart forces of the High Elves or reveling in the sneaky, underhanded tactics of the Skaven, there's an exhilarating variety that keeps you glued to your seat, strategizing like a deranged warlord.
But hold onto your axes, because the DLCs take this experience and crank it up to eleven. From the blood-soaked escapades of 'The Queen and The Crone' to the spine-chilling battles of 'The Curse of the Vampire Coast,' each expansion feels like a shot of adrenaline straight to the heart. Creative Assembly doesn't just throw in a couple of new units and call it a day; they craft entire narratives, woven seamlessly into the fabric of the base game, complete with legendary lords that could give Sauron a run for his money.
The devil's in the detail, they say, and boy, does Creative Assembly understand that. From the intricately designed units to the immersive storylines and quests, every aspect of the DLCs feels like a meticulously crafted love letter to Warhammer enthusiasts. It's the kind of attention to detail that makes you want to grab the nearest battle-axe and charge into the fray alongside your virtual armies.
Total War: Warhammer II isn't just a game; it's a vortex of addictive gameplay and immersive storytelling that pulls you in and refuses to let go. With its intricate strategy, diverse factions, and a barrage of DLC offerings that feel more like expansions than add-ons, it stands as a testament to Creative Assembly's dedication to delivering a truly unforgettable gaming experience. It's the kind of game that reminds you why you fell in love with gaming in the first place - a wild, exhilarating ride that leaves you craving for more, even as your eyes droop from lack of sleep. It's a triumph, a roaring success, and by Sigmar's beard, it's a must-have for any self-respecting strategy enthusiast.",1699095084,1706433525,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

On to the good things. I have played hundreds of hours of this game and still find it entertaining. Many of the different lords in this game have great gimmicks that make each one fun, with every game there are certain lords and troops that feel similar but for the most part unique in their own way. This game has a massive roster of lords and troops and at 300hrs of game-play in and still finding more. The combat itself is great for players of all skill levels and not super hard to pick up for first time players of the genre. While the overworld of the campaign is similar to Civilization the combat is RTS (But if your reading this you most likely already know this). If you are just getting into Total War Warhammer this is the best of the 3 in my opinion, 3 has some issues to work through but is still fun with the higher troop count and great graphics.

most computers (like 90%) will run this game fine and still look good.

Playing this should be outlawed. Another copy-paste total war with a bajillion of paid content. The gameplay is the same as in any other TW you're ever played. Nothing new here, except for maybe new visual effects/skins for the units. Very repetitive battles, extremely dumb AI that can't fight sieges at all. Out of all units why would they make ghosts climb the ladders instead of passing through the walls... Pseudo diversity of units, campaigns, and spells, with all of them being the same primitive copy-paste of one another. Most if not all of units have no variety of formations, unless we count the default front-facing box a formation. You'll have to download 50+ mods to at least make this game somewhat playable. This game is an excellent example of how this company sells its 'products' together with 38 DLC's, including ""blood and gore"". The only thing that keeps this game afloat is Workshop.

i find it hard to pay them any money or pay for anything at full price....
for example,  the winter sale 23 is on and i really want to play WHIII but I simply cannot pay for the game (even at 50% off), i have added it to my cart like 3 times... but when it comes to the purchase i am unable to hit the pay button... especially when i see that the other games have huge discounts (including their dlc)... 

im very happy with the game, but i still enjoy WHI WHII TW rome II and pretty much all of their releases since shogun II.... but god damn i will not shell out the asking price, when they treat their loyal customer base like this... and have the current marketing strategy that completely ignores your loyalty or the investments you've made in the past with them...

buy the older versions at 75% off including the DLC, play for hundreds of hours and wait for the games to hit the sales of 75% 

i mean sure it means i get to play with games that have been released two years after the masses... but you know what... most bugs have been dealt with, the games run smoothly, and i dont have to hate on CA anymore, because im no longer frustrated at them... these games at 75% are amazing value for money, and i play all of them regularly... including Napoleon!! 

after many years i have splurged on a computer that is (in my eyes) a beast, im about to go from playing on a laptop to a desktop, from everything at 20% graphics to full graphics.... my PC room is set up in the basement.... i am genuinely excited to increase my play time on these games... had to play earlier versions to avoid crashing my limited Pcs from the past.. but that is over now....

now its time to destroy everyone with xenophobic excitement and joy, destroying factions and races top my hearts content!

this is my two cents; thank you to all you players who pay full price and keep the franchise alive, I am unable to do so... the taste is just too bitter in my mouth, but god bless you out there... personally if you have limited cash, and love total war, buy on sale at 75% (did i say that already) Now im off to war, have a good one.",1704359360,1704359360,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The mix of 4x, RTS and RPG elements is fantastic, with first being less fleshed out and the following 2 being more prominent compared to other Total Wars, making it a slightly different experience which may not be for all TW fans. The sheer size of the map, faction, unit and area variety are mind-blowing. Different races and even sub-factions can have vastly different play styles and campaign experiences, which provides an insane amount of replayability.
Balance both in battles and on campaign map is decent, but it's only done to a degree where playing everyone is viable and not unfun. Some factions are clearly more powerful than others. Lords, heroes, units, armies, economy can become overpowered if you aim for that and know what you are doing. There are some silly good bonuses and exploits. This may sound bad at first, but I think it's exactly what makes TWWH2 so amazingly fun and not just a decent, impressive in scope game. You don't have to play like that if it's not up your alley, but all that room for different kinds of tinkering with your faction provides an extremely satisfying and unique experience.
CA may have made a lot of bad moves recently and deserved the backslash, but Warhammer 2 is finished and has been left in a very good state. I played countless RTS and 4x games from the last 20 or so years and this is undoubtedly my favourite.",1704117196,1704117196,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The unit variety and the different way each faction plays is great. I can't fault that part of the game. The problem is that gameplay is so prescribed. For every race you are told who your enemies are, when to attack them, which regions you should take and who you should not attack. Theres no strategy involved here in the campaigns. Its just endless turns of doing nothing but hitting the Next Turn button while you wait for buildings to finish and your faction's finances to grow.

 This game was fun as fuck to play, especially with community mods but I was never happy about paying for BLOOD and waiting years for bug fixes while they churned out more DLC.

 I ONLY recommend the Total War Warhammer series of games if you get it on sale. Even then maybe you should think of getting it even cheaper if your able.

Also still waiting to see if all the mortal empires dlc goes through. still waiting on some of the mortal empires dlc to work so be advised that dlc is still buggy. Ok so it seems all dlc is done but leaving the bad review because it should not be that hard to get the free dlc or take this long to get it all sorted. A new free dlc (gor rok) and still now idea how to get it, going through steam still puts you in the other launcher and the the store in that dosen't even show any of the free dlc so once more its just wait to see when it magically fixs itself. And its good now but it dosen't tell you its doing anything it just magically added to what you have with nothing to show you its downloading it.

Ok so anyone looking to get this game in the future know that there is as of this edit 7 peaces of free content locked behind having a total war access account the lord and hero Gotrex and Felix, the Arachnarok spider mount for goblin great shaman lords, 30th aniversery regiments of renown, the glade captain hero for wood elves, the dark elf legendary lord Rakarth, the great bray shaman lord for beastmen, and the ogre mercenaries.

This should be my final edit but they have stream lined the total war access account content to all you need to do is link your steam account and then you have all the free content, no more scrolling through the site to find and clam each one just link and you should be good to go still don't like how there's content locked behind having a total war access account but hey at least its free",1563659412,1702616265,False,1,1,0.426306068897247314,0,True,False,False

My only criticism is the price tag and incentive to own the previous game and all its dlc too, to get the best selection range for its combined campaign that throws both game's world maps into one epic one. Managing each faction gives you different mechanics to utilize and manage, changing up not only how you have to fight enemies but how you even plot and formulate your armies development plans. Newer elements like rites and plots, and with hero units influencing the map and armies on the move, its a lot to manage sometimes before you finally get down to fighting on a battle map but its all been fun to me. Probably not suggested for people who are not into turn based faction management, but if you liked Warhammer TW1 then this would be the next step.",1702214157,1702214157,True,11,0,0.63786768913269043,0,True,False,False

- The AI spam heroes in the map and send them to injured your heroes, break your walls, destroy your troops...
Past a cetain point, the AI heroes will be too high levels too even TRY to kill them, the game don't event allow you to try it.
In my instance, I found out in the late game about a faction with already too many high level heroes, I can't fight him at all, i'm soft lock against an enemy i never encountered earlier.

- The skaven faction can attack-ambush you, meaning they don't need to go to ambush and wait for you to fall in, they can litteraly attack you during their turn and ambush you. This is so stupid, because you have no way to defend against it !

- If you go to war with a faction, past a certain point you will never be able to get out of the war. There is no war attrition, meaning if you can't wipe out your oppenent, you will never be at peace with them again. The AI will never accept a peace treaty as long as it still have at least 2 remaining cities. I played a lot of strategy game, I have never seen this level of stupidity.

Asymmetry abounds, there are a slew of valid playstyles supported by different races and factions, and the map is giant and full of crevasses to explore. The downsides? A lot of DLC if you want to play some of the factions. Elves are imbalanced. Plenty of the Warhammer 1 races like Bretonnia are outright bad. You will struggle for a while to get the feel for the game and its demands on you. The addition of RPG gameplay via Lords is a nice step up; past Total War generals tended to be picking some stat increases, while Warhammer generals can be their own one-man army if you build them out well.

Overall, it's a hilariously wacky playground of war and destruction that's guaranteed to make you rage and keep playing. Fits in with the best games in the Total War lineage.",1701897788,1701897788,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This does have the benefits that it is lower price than most of the other entries in the Total War Warhammer Series.  However, it still has an absolute mountain of DLC, to top it off, every time I click on a tutorial, the game breaks.  I can only conclude these tutorials are linked to some networked resource...that doesn't exist.

In terms of gameplay, it is quite similar to Total War Warhammer I (and III, although apparently III has things like charge bonuses which make melee units far more compelling.)  If you wanna buy *THIS* game *now* in 2024 you'll have to ask yourself a few questions, do you like Lizardfolk, Elves, or Skaven?  Do you like Warhammer Fantasy?  Do you like Lustria (The jungle where the Lizardfolk generally live).  If the answer to these questions is Yes, then you should probably pick up this game, for the sole fact that should you decide to buy Warhammer III later, you'll have access to those races.  Though, there's a few catches, Ikkit Claw and Throt the Unclean, who are probably the ""best"" Skaven legendary lords, are both DLC, and they're not even in the same DLC.  Though, you do get some pretty good ""free"" DLC like Grombrindal, Thorric, Whurrzaag, Imrik, Gor-Rok (arguable that he's the strongest single Hero in the game, in this game too.)  And the big one, Mortal Empires.  Mortal Empires *is* free, which is good at least, you have access to essentially all of the game except for a couple of characters and some of the factions.  Those factions will still spawn into the game so you do get to interact with them and if you're really good at diplomacy you could get an army of them potentially or have them as allies more likely.

Honestly though, considering how old this game is and how *much* DLC there is, and the seemingly broken tutorials, I honestly can't say I recommend this game.",1701781158,1701781158,False,2,1,0.524483025074005127,0,True,False,False

In my eyes it is currently the better TWWH experience for multiple reasons. The game has fewer bugs, a more consistent design, a more stable modding ecosystem and it frequently goes on sale. You have nothing to lose by slowly building up your WH2 collection and then eventually moving to WH3 in 2 years once all the major concerns have been addressed (or it goes on sale). The DLCs and content will carry over so you don't have anything to lose.

The game on its own is great. Mortal empires provides nearly unlimited amount of funs, I'm probably a thousand hours in (this account plus another) and I consistently come back every few months to try another campaign. The game design is pretty tight and the powercreep is still relatively under control. Like with all TWWH games, definitely recommend picking up on sale.

SEGA does not allow its customers to buy this game, own it, and play it offline at their own leisure. Total War Warhammer II is, for all intents and purposes, an ""Always-Online"" service.[/h3]

That is because of DENUVO. Which is the Digital Rights Management (DRM) software that is bundled with this product.

DENUVO forces you to link the product that you purchased (which should rather be your own property, for you to do with as you please) to DENUVO's online servers. Then it forces the product that you purchased, and that you therefore should fully own, to ""call home"" regularly to that server. This, in perpetuity. Whenever DENUVO is not able to call home, you are not able to use nor access the product that you purchased anymore.

If you must go offline for any amount of time, you are not able to play a game you supposedly own (surprise. As it turns out, you were simply renting it to a landlord, as it were).

DENUVO serves no purpose to the customer. On the contrary, DENUVO weakens the customer's rights to own the products, any product, that they purchase. DENUVO effectively assumes control and ownership of any product it is associated with. That control and ownership should be the customer's.

SEGA is voluntarily selling its customers a defective product.

One which its customers cannot own, one which cannot be the property of SEGA's customers.

One which, once it has been legally purchased by the customer, nevertheless actually remains the property of SEGA and DENUVO.

I have come to like the fantasy aspect quite a bit. The series adds a lot of new concepts to the battles, such as playing with spell casters, flying units, and monster sized creatures. I'm a Total War player, not a Warhammer fan, though I do have some other Warhammer games by coincidence as an RTS player. As such, I have a little, but not much, knowledge of the story lines in the Warhammer universe.

Specifically with Warhammer II, I at least like some of the Total War tweaks to diplomacy. Your allies don't turn around and stab you in the back every chance they get. You're also not bombarded by requests from allies to join their wars 4 times between turns... every single turn. This game isn't heavy into diplomacy, but at least some of the AI decision making has moved away from the ridiculous attacks from puny trusted allies that leads to their destruction at your hands 5 turns later.

As with just about every Total War game I can think of, your enemies will take advantage of any situation to gang up on you with 2-3 of their armies against one of your own. While only one enemy army may be in range to attack on their own, they will bring in another army as reinforcements as long as they can get in range through forced march. This can make the game a bit of a slog, as the AI gets their usual Total War that allow them larger militaries than players could have with the same territorial area.

This is one of those easy to learn/lifetime to master titles. With a double digit number of mage types for the High Elves alone, it's tougher to keep track of what tools you have in your elven toolkit to tackle your opponents. The spells are all over the place, and the icons to at least tell you what type of spell is represented by icons on the screen take a lot of getting used to. 

The battles can be a little hectic, and you really have to watch what you are doing, unless you want multiple units heavily damaged by various types of spells with area attacks. Sometimes you just have to eat them anyways, as you can't always disengage from your fights and move out of spell range before the skies open and death comes from above.

That all being said I would only recommend the game if you get it on significant discount and are ok with spending more money unlocking each small additional lord that doesn't really add very much of value. You need to by the original Warhammer to unlock the Immortal Empires which is in my opinion pretty ridiculous. If you do end up buying the game you will be subject to bugs that make your game crash as CA didn't put time into making the game playable. Example in the Eltharion campaign one his big mechanics is that you can capture a lord and this is needed to use his unique abilities and this bug has made my game crash more than anything else but there are definitely others (His campaign isn't included without paying for it).  This is for sure the last CA developed game I will buy even if I really like the look of one of their new games.

I never finished it though because after a certain point in the game, it just feels too repetitious and the pace of progression feels too daunting. The real-time battles in the Total War franchise have the unique ability to satisfy that recurring itch for a movie-like, large scale, medieval combat experience unlike any other. Total War: Warhammer II merely adds a new set of updated skins, improved graphics, and a wide variety of heroes. The heroes in the Warhammer series are, at least for me, the main attraction of the game. They are definitely a lot of fun to control as they mow down horde after horde of armies, all the while growing ever stronger. 

There's also a notable number of really fun mods available for the game. The modding community for these warhammer games is really great, and they add a considerable amount of replay value. Even though I didn't finish the campaign, I would confidently give it a solid 88/100. And after 252 hours of time spent playing, I can happily say I've already received my money's worth.

The game runs fairly smoothly even on my lower end PC and I haven't come across any breaking bugs. I've always loved the idea of commanding large armies of fantasy units and this game definitely scratches that itch. 

Cons: I'm not a massive fan in lord abilities/powers in battles, I'm not saying it shouldn't exist but shouldn't be so strong. The price of all the packs/DLC, yes I know you don't need them. Don't get me started on buying the blood pack. Another nit pick and maybe I just haven't found it yet is the ability to trade regions/provinces in diplomacy. In Total War: Empire this is a thing. I had a grand plan of giving a couple provinces to my allies to secure my borders to the west only to come home from work and find out that I can't do that.

As a huge fan of the franchise in generall (combined over a 2000 h), i´m very disapointed by this game title. I became wearry of waiting for a true historical title so i decided to buy the game on sale shortly before pharo was launched. Admittetly, i didnt play every faction and every Lord and currently have ~80h on this Game. Appart from offering a Fantasy setting, there were no real inovations to any of the relevant systems (popualtion, recourses, Happiness, Generals, Army traditions etc). Sure there is magic, which i interpret as a widening of the Generals combat Abilitys. Character Traits which failed to meaningfully impact the game.  Settlement management felt extremly one dimensional and thus a chore. Campainmap at first glance was huge, but on my third playthrough was one dimensional as well. It lacks the chair-binding-effect of having to survive one more huge siege battle like in Shogun 2, Med 2 or even Rome 2. In short, a lot of visuals, no real Addition.

[b] Definetly not worth full price, and i cant stress how much the trend of deniying faction access behind a pay wall for DLC´s is in my humble oppinion a malpractice. [/b]  

I miss the good old days beating the Medievall 2 campain and unlocking additional factions just to beat the grandcampain again with them.
It feels creatively bankrupt since the first title had the same factions anyway (this is the only point i´m unsure of since i dont onw the first title) like a Saga title, not expanding the game in depth. Unit rosters are fairly small, no real mercenary system like in older titles, which leads to a underwhelming Game experience.

All in all, besides not beeing to much a fan of the fantasy genere in itselfe- i disslike this Game for the aforementioned reasons and the direction the Studio decided to take for the better part of a decade. I really hope this gets turned over, or i will quitt buying CA titles all together.

I would say, if you like this.
Pick up
-Warhammer 1 + Any relevant DLC
(Warhammer 1 and 2 actually unlocks content in Warhammer 2. You basically get a combined map of both games, and they play in Warhammer 2)
-Warhammer 2 DLC
Other total war games
-Shogun 2 total war (Not fantasy, instead its a REALLY good historical total war)
-Shogun 2 Fall of the Samurai (Most modern total war game there is.)
-Rome 1 Remastered
-Rome 2 total war
-Atilla total war (This may depend on the person. For me its really tough campaigns, and I enjoy that.)
-Napoleon total war
-Medieval 2 total war is another good one, but its starting to show its age.

Rome 1 total war is a bit rough on new systems, same with Shogun 1, Medieval 1, and to a lesser extent Empire total war. Empire is just a buggy mess but its a gem. A rough gem but still a good gem.

Anyways, I love Warhammer 2. I will always love this game.
I would avoid Warhammer 3 as it doesn't bring much to the table, especially with the recent behavior of the developers. (Banning people from the total war forums for ANY negative critique, and of course threatening to not support the games you bought from them if you don't buy their dlc. Only other thing I will say on this subject is this, remember Total War: Three Kingdoms. They dropped it without notice and the community was left stunned, not angry, just stunned and worried that their favorite developers (who were never perfect, but they made amazing games and they generally tried to be well liked) just dropped support on a recent game. We wondered if they were okay or if something bad had happend. That was in fact, some early signs that this team may have well lost their way. And that's a real shame.

All in all, I love these games and I wish the team members behind these gems are doing well. I hope they find their way back to the right path, fans and dev teams walking in line with each other.

Do note, the modding community is strong, the community is strong. The content creators that love this series are honest. Folks like Jon from Many a True Nerd, or LegendofTotalWar are great folks to watch for good and honest opinions. Both of them love the series, they just love the series differently. And that's just fine, I love them both and they are both correct in their views I think.

So that's my rant. This game is great and 90% of the total war games before it are amazing too.
The ones that are not are just getting unplayable due to age, or they were made unplayable by being abandoned. Troy, and Thrones of Britannia are both just okay total war games. As far as I know (Though I have not played it) Pharaoh is much in the same camp as the other two. They are okay.",1698724389,1698724389,True,21,0,0.664030611515045166,0,True,False,False

I spent countless hours messing around in battles, listening to heroic speeches (and cheating at the game because I was 11 and didn't quite get the campaign).

I was pumped beyond belief when I heard Rome II got announced and bought it immediately (in my Freshman year of college, boy how time flies) only to not be able to play it because of how broken it was on launch.  But it got fixed and countless more hours were spent and finally some campaigns beaten.

In that time I've also played Shogun 2, Empire, Medieval 2, 3k, Thrones, Warhammer I & 2 & 3 (Check my steam library, they're all there).  I even bought the Remastered version just because I love Total War.

One of the best total war games.
But I have several issues with overall game.
1st old races from TW:Warhammer 1 are kind of less interesting compared to new races. 
2nd there are very few battle/siege map variation. It gets very quickly boring when I fight same map for 10 times in a row.
3rd siege map design is very bad compared to older titles. There is only one wall and small section of city available for siege battle, and it is severely limits tactical choices during these battles.

""""""Fun game. I'd recommend getting game 1 & 2 to get the Mortal Empires campaign. It comes on sale quite often, and get dlcs for races that you find fun because there are a TON of them and it can get a bit pricey if you buy them all at once. CA releases free lords regularly, so if you just buy game 2 then you get 16 lords for free, and 31 (i think) lords if you own both games.
Siege battles can get to be very repetitive, and I hate defending as almost every race except the skaven, and sometimes the high elves. CA are going to be reworking sieges in game three so hopefully they will be made a bit more interesting.""""""

Here is the reason why my review is changing. CA shit the bed with the release of TW Warhammer 3. I was unhappy with the release so I refunded the game, and figured I'd re buy if the game eventually reached a state that I would be happy with. There were a few times where I considered buying it, but I held off. Now I probably won't buy anything from CA ever again. They announced a DLC called Shadows of Change for $25. it is not worth that much content wise, and when the community dared to push back on such an absurd price they made a post that essentially threatened us. Buy the DLC or we won't be able to support the game in the future. Which is what happened to TW Three Kingdoms. CA released several sub par DLCs that didn't sell as many as they wanted, so they showed that they will 100% pull the plug. A little bit after that backlash CA announced that they were canning Hyenas, some ugly as sin extraction hero shooter, and it is reportedly CA's most expensive project ever. That tells me that they knew that the game was going to be cancelled and that they're trying to squeeze as much money from TW Warhammer fans to make up for the terrible decisions that the higher ups made.

I will not support CA at all anymore. Unfortunately it will be the developers that will be punished, but I hope that they can find better companies to work for. This whole situation sucks.",1616206551,1698348576,False,0,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

It's too expansive, there's a million buttons, the brain feels mightily stretched out trying to manage units, understanding what each thing does for (how many people now)... I could barely get into playing Queek Headtaker, and even then, it seems that I continously take out the Fortress of Dawn elves with ease, and right at that moment the Quetgar, *every time*, catches me overextended and wipes me without a chance to get back to base, even though the in-game tutorial is spamming me with ""do this, My Lord- do that, my lord, shake hands with this bot to be safe my lord, don't mess with the dark elves my lord"" ...if anyone's seen Emporer Palpatine from Robot Chicken, the part where he's going down the escalator and continuously has to acknowlege each stormtrooper cynically until a freak-out happens from all the, ""my lord, my lord, my lord""... this is a simulator game to understand why Palpatine from that hilarious episode short was that grumpy and grouchy- it's way too much. I never beat this game, I remember one day two years ago I spent 12 hours straight trying to do the Vortex main campaign and just- UGH, I couldn't win by barely and it was honestly the most depressing thing imaginable, I don't know how Dungeons and Dragons gets away with it- *12 hour-games* just to lose the whole entire campaign, no reverting saves or re-doing, and if you play legendary mode, you can't save at all. The in-game fights feel bland for something that's supposed to be massive and grande and theatrical- it's so many units but you can barely see any units inter-personally finishing each other off: it just looks more like sprites slashing in the middle of the air until one side slowly loses one random sprite at a time. It takes forever to build up, and by then it's three hours later and your time to game is probably up. Who really wants to save and then return to it later? I don't. Re-load it, even with massive ram and a decent graphics card this game takes *forever* to load the campaign and then 1/2 as long to load manual fights, but it's still meh for waiting times. I feel I do more waiting to watch a videogame play itself with this videogame than i am actually playing the videogame. 

If you are *really* into Warhammer Lore, like reading the books, paints the figurines, visits the IRL stores for merch, big into the stories, and want the game for novelty and aesthetic? Yeah buy it, and go round and round and play it like, a million times, I'm sure there's someone who looks in the mirror, sees a Total War Warhammer II turbosweat, and want's that classic Netflix-Style, Stranger Things 1985-esque 12-hour-games of dungeons-and-dragons-with-their-homies-to-feel-the-glory-of-earned-victory type nostalgia. Of course hardcore fanatics will buy this game and really appreciate the obvious replayability and even-more-obvious bragging rights if this game is trending among your friends group and you win it. For those folks that only have 3-6 hours a day to play a variety pack of fun, speedy, quick game and think this is the next one they can buy and juggle their other favorites with, I'm afraid this game is screaming, ""you can't balance me and your other games, it's either ONLY me or none of me and you're other games"". 

In conclusion, don't buy this game if you're alone in the world and game-hunting. Buy it only if you're begged to do so by your favorite small group of best friends, or if you're a matchmaker and gamemaker, and want to beg your friends for months to buy this with you until they do, but don't purchase and play solo because you'll regret it, mostly because much like League of Legends, you'll watch a guide on how to play with your one favorite champion, lose so much that you question your venture into its' world and then won't touch it ever again after a final immemorable loss of the campaign. Warhammer Vermintide 2 is a more arcade-style experience that will still expose you to the brutality of simulated medieval fantasy war, push your system to its' limits, and will queue you in, munch you through a game and spit you out in 20 minutes. I honestly can't stand this 12-hour play-me-obsessively-so-1-neuron-feels-dopamine-out-of-the-99,999,999,999-other-neurons-that-feel-depressive-disorderly-dread-and-constant-worry-about-my-units-type, oh-no-i-made-one-error-in-two-seconds-now-its-gonna-cost-me-10-hours type games. Between you the reader and me the author, Company Of Heroes 2 is about as RTS as I can handle mentally until it's too big to feel like you'll ever master it in 10 years, too UI-heavy to feel like you'll ever understand the real weight of each button ever, and so dense that the illusion becomes transparent- a purchaseable RTS game that runs longer than an hour *on steam* needs to have homework done on it before a purchase is made because of the two-hour-maximum playtime refund policy. I used to enjoy buying videogames at the face and just seeing what they had to offer, but thanks to design styles like these, *only when it's end-game 10 hours later* do you realize ""you know something...I don't like this game"", but *hey, you can't refund because steam policy lul*.... if I could refund kindly, I would, because as I said, nothing against the diehard fans of this franchise. But, I can't, and considering how the game became more annoying than entertaining, with all the computer-part-buying it took to finally run this game just for the gameplay to finally just leave me with a pout and dissatisfaction, I would steer people away unless you're wealthy. If you're wealthy, disregard all and buy for novelty. But, if you're budgeting for your next new game and don't want to make a mistake, I'm sure you'll see just how much learning this game takes, unfairly too much imo, and then you'll shrug with ease and move on. It's too hard. So hard, Easy Mode can't be beaten? that's just *too* hard.

In hindsight, maybe if you speedrun your new games at first to test their consistency, you could see for certain if this game is your thing or not, but this isn't a speedrunnable game lest it loses its cinematic novelty and then after a speedrun of this game, you'll *really* say no and refund.

Either way, you find out that it's unhealthy to put your eggs in one basket, and sitting down to try and play this thing through and through *one time* is definitely that. If there's dissatisfaction this bad, if I wrote out this much, if I went to the nerd-like lengths to repulse the game and show distaste for it, it should strike you as ""do not purchase unless begged, gifted for free, or purchased on massive discount"".

But can we discuss the fact that WHEN EVERYTHING IS ON SALE you're paying $94.86 (At time of writing) across 2 games to get all the DLC? And do keep in mind that is prior to the $71.99 CAD for the base game and the $71.99 CAD for the original game. Which means that for me to get the actual full experience from TWW2, i would be spending $238.84 CAD. On a Single Game ( I will accede, a game and a half). Without any Collectors Items.  I just did a quick google search on things I could buy with 280$. Here are a few of the results;
1: a 55' 4k Smart TV from TCL
2: an MJS BUGS 2SE Drone
3 An eddie Bauer Parka.
4: concert tickets
5: a refurbished 500GB Xbox one. 

Any of the above things can be purchased for 280$ or less, and they were just the first things to show up in my searching. Frankly, I have an issue when I can buy a New TV for the price of a complete gaming experience with just one game. even if that TV is objectively cheap.

Even if we take the original and it's DLC out, before taxes we're looking at $54.30 CAD. again, the base game is $71.99. It seems a bit excessive to me to have created so much content (or cut so much out of the base game) that the DLC ON SALE is 2/3rds of the price of the game. Not to mention that when its not on sale, the DLC for TWW2 Alone totals in $89.43 CAD before taxes. LITERALLY MORE THAN THE BASE GAME ITSELF!!!!!

That being said, WARHAMMER takes total war to a whole new level because of access to mythical creatures and Heros that can take on entire regiments of units. This basically opens up the game to where you aren't just stuck with infantry, calvary, and missile units.

I have bought all of the DLC when they were on sale. They are not required to play the game and have fun, but it definitely adds to the game, maybe a little over priced.  They open up additional strategies, however the base game has some of the most powerful strategies already available. My guess as to most of the bad reviews recently is the fact that people feel left out because they don't have access to all of the DLC, and need to pay a lot of money.

Much more better than Warhammer One.

But you need a powerful CPU - at least Ryzen 3300x or intel 9400.

This is obviously a sequel.  There's a big campaign in this game that combines this games factions with the previous game's factions on one big map called Mortal Empires, but you have to own the first game AND this one.  You can buy this game by itself and play a smaller campaign called the Vortex campaign.  It's a bit different from regular total war campaigns and it's controversial among fans.  My recommendation would be to buy this one and the first game together so you can jump into Mortal Empires.  

This does mean that the best experience is $120 starting price plus.  Any DLC you buy from either Warhammer 1 or 2 is then unlocked in Mortal Empires as well.  This is quite expensive for the average person but the good news is these games are a bit older now.   On steam sales I've seen both the base games on sale for 50% or even 75% off.   That gets the combined games at or below $60 total.  Much more reasonable as a starting point.   And considering the number of hours of fun this game delivers you're going to get incredible value for money if you enjoy this game.   

That said, if you've already enjoyed total war games, or enjoy strategy games in general, I've very confident you'll love Warhammer 2.  It really is one of the best in the business.  Every faction plays completely differently on the campaign map and in the real time battles.   And the game is brimming with cool units to play with.   My personal favorites are the Empire with it's steam tanks, hellfire rocket batteries, and rifles.   And Bretonnia, a more primitive medieval faction that fields Grail Knights with their gleaming lances, Trebuchets, and Grail Reliques - the desecrated corpses of heroes being carried around by peasants to inspire other units.  Don't ask it just  works.  

Be aware as well that there is a lot of anger at the publisher CA about the third game Warhammer 3.  There have been a few people taking it out on CA in this games reviews as well about the publishers pricing strategies and greed.  While these are not invalid complains, as I mentioned these games go on sale regularly since they're older.   So you can jump in around Christmas or Summertime at a reasonable price and get stupidly high numbers of hours if you're into the game.   Warhammer 3's base game is leaner than this one was at launch so just take your time with this one instead.  Enjoy it and wait for Warhammer 3 to sort itself out.   

Have a lovely day if you made it this far, and enjoy yourself.",1695474020,1695474020,True,1,0,0.483221471309661865,0,True,False,False

The campaigns are fun, interesting and engaging from start to finish, the battles are rich with detail and strategy, and the campaign map and turn based aspect are done well. Warhammer II looks really good on high graphics setting, and the attention to detail on maps and models is amazing. The unit control, combat, missiles and spells feel really well done and flow nicely. All in all, a very well polished game that is easy to enjoy for both hardcore strategy enjoyers, or the casual. My critiques are the state of the turn based aspect and DLC's. For a game about Total War and epic battles. there is an awful lot of diplomacy, economy and city-building involved. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, and some people might enjoy the way it works, but I play the game for the strategy in battle, not on the map, and I feel like I spend most of my time debating what economy buildings I should construct, carefully considering diplomacy, trying to trade with foreign nations, deciding how I should research technologies, and more. Is it well designed system? Yes. Is it what I want out of a game about 'Total War'? Not really. Second, the DLCs. Warhammer II has 5 or 6 completely free playable factions and 18-ish playable lords, which is certainly enough to satisfy most casual players. The problem is, Warhammer is a big game with many aspects that go unexplored when you are a F2P player. There are whole new ways to play when using other Lords and factions, but each new bit of content must be payed for separately as a DLC. Such a DLC reliant system when it comes to new content means that, unless you are buying new DLCs, the game can get dry, fast. I am happy to spend money on DLCs if I really want the content, but it's an option few have after purchasing the base game. In my opinion, they need to either implement sales, or free to play weekends with the DLC's to give us more incentive to lock in a purchase, or lob some of the DLC's together into single, bigger packs of content.

Other than the turn-based tediousness and DLC craze, Warhammer II is in a really nice spot, and a great game definitely worth playing.",1693868588,1693868588,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-----------------------------------------

Classic Total War gameplay with Warhammer Fantasy factions and units, reworked and fleshed out amazingly well. If you're one of the people who liked your generals progressing in previous iterations of Total War this game takes that above and beyond to the point where it can almost be called an RPG game. I'm a guy who collected relics in MTW2 for my kings and made sure to pass them over to the heir before the King died. I really hope they take some RPG elements from this game with them for future TW games even historical ones. 

I used to dream about Warhammer in Total War when me and my friend played Shogun and Medieval Total War(1) as a kid. This is basically that dream come true, including everything CA learned from having decades of experience in the genre and the series. I'd honestly consider this a must buy for both Total War and Warhammer fans. Any strategy fan should get it too. The first game was also AMAZING and can be bought cheap on sale now. If you're short on cash grab that one. But I'd really just buy both of them to be able to play the merged campaign map Mortal Empires which is a MASSIVE map where you can play as any faction from the 2 games. I only play Mortal Empires now really.

It's honestly one of the best games out there and settles your itch for Grand Strategy, RTS and RPG at the same time with great execution in each regard. Perhaps it could be even more RP options hehe but thats a personal opinion.

But in doing so, I definitely want to make clear that this game can be quite difficult, even on standard difficulty settings. It took me a long time to understand the many nuances of the game enough to successfully complete a campaign. Before that, I sunk a lot of hours into playing campaigns that I ultimately lost.  More often than not, I play video games to unwind after a stressful day, so I'm not typically looking for a herculean challenge when booting a game up.

With all that said, once you do get the hang of things, the challenge becomes more entertaining, instead of the head banging against the keyboard thing it felt like during the first 40 or so hours of playtime. 

To understand some of my concerns with the game, I left my original review below.

ORIGINAL REVIEW OF TW: WARHAMMER II
Problem with this game is that I just don't find it very fun.  It has an annoying propensity to generate deathstacks,  which essentially eliminate hours of planning on your part.

I've played the game with three different races and it pretty much works out the same way every time. Plan strategy, build up an army, run short of resources and then get crushed by a deathstack. 

Just not a lot of fun. The point of a game is to provide a fun environment to solve challenges, not waste hours of your time on pointless challenges.

Update 7/20: I gave the game another shot, after loading Warhammer 1 and I found it's just not as much fun or balanced as the first game. If you like a fast-paced, chaotic-style strategy game, this could be for you. But the insane pace of advancement and death stacks just gets tiring after a point and it seems the point of the game eventually just becomes building a doomstack of your own so you can repeatedly auto resolve combat encounters in your favor against more numerous forces. Just not a ton of fun for me. Still a thumbs down.",1573280568,1693444136,True,0,0,0.47789311408996582,0,True,False,False

If you're buying this to play the Vortex campaign, or Mortal Empires, go ahead: it's a great experience.  If you're buying it as DLC for Total War: Warhammer 3, I recommend not buying it.  CA breaks chunks of their DLC every time they release new DLC, and then [i]do not[/i] fix it.

***************************

Yes, you have to buy Total War: Warhammer to have access to the Mortal Empires campaign.  No, I don't see that as a reason to downvote this game.  The game is, in and of itself, a great game.

In terms of mechanics, it builds very well upon the first title in the trilogy and goes even further in differentiating the races.  The Vortex campaign is a relative departure for the series in having a goal-focused campaign rather than an open-ended sandbox, but in reality, the Vortex campaign can also be treated as a campaign sandbox if you so choose.

The extra ""thank you"" from CA for buying both games (I & II) in the otherwise free Mortal Empires DLC is a glorious thing; the largest and most varied campaign that CA have ever created.  It has bugs and balance issues, and Norsca (from the first game) is taking a disappointingly long time in being integrated properly, but it's still a wonderful way to lose hours of your playtime.",1514986538,1691931749,False,1,0,0.517241418361663818,0,True,False,False

This 25 dollar DLC features 12 unit models, 3 lords from already existing sides and some basic mechanics that are absolutely not worth the price. As I said in my previous unfairly deleted post, I am a working adult in US, 25 dollars is not the issue, the amount of content we are getting for 25 dollars is. Imagine, base game that is 50 dollars has several sides, dozens of lords, 100 of unit models, so how is it that a bunch of unpopular legendary lords and few units cost HALF the price of base game?!

Even more realistically does this amount of effort amount to this price? If you can get a brand new AAA game for 70 dollars? Can anyone actually agree that this DLC with few months of effort is worth 25 dollars while CA isnt even finished fixing the bugs and issues the game already has? This is a blatant insult to the community and a corporate cash grab. 

If we allow this to happen once, this will set the new standard for DLC, instead of giving us what we would pay 25 dollars for, like Nagash, Ind, Nippon they will keep spawning these 25 dollar pathetic lord packs expecting us to consume. Dont forget that a game is a business, they want to do least amount of effort for most amount of profit, this is exactly that, least amount of effort DLC.  

I am not a troll, or CA hater, I have every DLC, my account is open take a look how many hours I invested into this franchise, I am what they should be targeting a super fan of the franchise. I am all for supporting CA and buying DLC that have worthy content, but if this is their new tactic, sell overpraised junk and silence anyone who speaks against it? Forget it. I got all I need and I rather give my money to the modders.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my child, as they are always out with their friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside them. I loaded into the game, made my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my child for help and they invited me to a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my child since my ploycule died. This game has ever since brought me and my child closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

I second everyone's opinion that Mortal Empires is best if you can pick up TW1 on sale (although Vortex is perfectly fine) - and will include that, for me, after a few playthings - I added the 'double upkeep cost'. Battles become far scrappier and desperate - 6 low-level units out-maneuvering eachother, for much of the mid-game. Without it, you will quickly have max-size armied with the best units, and only fight opponents with the same. Fun, but every battle become a grand escapade on equal footing. With 2x upkeep, there are far more 'hopeless hillside holdouts' that grant the greatest satisfaction.

Mostly, the game is great, and at 600 hours I still feel like a novice.

This game (and the other Total Warhammer titles) need an actual small-scale tutorial before starting a campaign. How it is now, you'll be forced to start a new campaign with zero knowledge and be breadcrumbed the little advice they decided to tell you. 

These 4X games are not generally easy to learn for new players. This is just another on that pile. I have tried learning this game about four separate times. Each time, I get gang-banged into failure by random armies popping out of the jungles by turn 15 or so. All on easy difficulty.

Everything from the original game has been improved upon and expanded with almost no negatives. My main two complaints about the first game were lack of map variety and Chaos invasion, and both have been resolved. Chaos now has difficulty settings or can be completely disabled. There's a completely new map with story objectives, and the Mortal Empires campaign roughly doubles the size of the previous game's map. While access to the Mortal Empire map (the main campaign) requires ownership of the original game, all games and their DLC go on sale regularly. The laundry list of DLC might seem intimidating too, but it carries over between games, including into the sequel to this.

My only complaints now are the difficulty of victory conditions and the new AI behavior. The first game's AI felt pretty aggressive, both to you and other factions equally, often wiping out a neighbor if they couldn't confederate them. Now it seems the AI is more aggressive towards humans than other AI, and AI is more apprehensive about razing another faction. I've had several games where a faction everyone hated would get down to one settlement multiple times and everyone would stop attacking them for some reason. AI also seems more aggressive towards factions ranked lower than them, and more passive against factions ranked higher than them. Certain factions tended to stay near the top of my games, with my allies refusing to attack them unless I dragged them into a war against them.

Victory conditions now are much more difficult to complete and make actually finishing a game quite an accomplishment. Most factions now have to capture (or be allied with factions who own) at least eight major cities on the map, in addition to their other victory conditions. This means you'll be painting the map and making some awkward alliances just to check off part of your win, never mind some of the more absurd condition lists like what Vampire Coast have to go through. If you have Chaos invasion enabled, you have to kill their three leaders too, and they don't spawn until turn 140-160. 

These feel like small complaints compared to all the excellent content in this game but they might be frustrating deal breakers for some people. Most of my feelings about the first game still stand so check out that review for a more in-depth take on the series. For an even more in-depth take, check out Mandalore's review on YouTube. It's 1 hour 20 minutes long, but the first hour is mostly about the first game's races. It's well edited, very entertaining, and covers way more than someone like me with under 1000 hours. I highly recommend this for anyone who enjoys strategy games, but beware the steep learning curve (again). New factions, new cities and settlements, new faction technologies and interactions... even with playing the first game, it feels like starting over again. This is a proper sequel, a massive improvement over the first game, and isn't just $60 DLC.",1684356665,1691246781,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game boasts an expansive campaign map that spans continents, offering an incredible variety of landscapes and factions to play as. Whether you're commanding the noble High Elves, sinister Dark Elves, savage Lizardmen, or the insidious Skaven, each faction feels uniquely distinct, and their playstyles offer a wealth of strategic options.  

The real-time battles in Total War: WARHAMMER II are nothing short of epic. Watching vast armies clash on the battlefield, with legendary creatures soaring overhead and spellcasters unleashing arcane powers, is an awe-inspiring spectacle. The tactical depth is unparalleled, and the addition of Warhammer's iconic units, monsters, and spells adds a thrilling layer of complexity to the battles.

playability is simply outstanding. The sheer variety of factions, coupled with different victory conditions and unique campaign mechanics, ensures that no two campaigns ever feel the same.

In conclusion, Total War: WARHAMMER II is a genre-defining masterpiece that seamlessly blends the strategic brilliance of Total War with the captivating fantasy universe of Warhammer.

The computer straight up cheats, they will have multiple armies that are impossible to pay for and they will create them far faster than is realistically possible. Aside from those when you put the game on anything above normal, they will increase stupid mechanics in all of your towns such as taxes or unhappy populace. To fix this download the mod that removes that penalty. One of the biggest issues I have with the game is the stupid archers that can run away while still shooting you. Just stupid plan and simple, not only can they fire while moving they are faster than your units. Probably the worst units in any game I have ever played. Who ever added those to the game needs to be fired for real, they are not fun and really ruin a lot of other wise fun battles and factions. Still its possible to beat them, but personally I just avoid them and enjoy the game. Another huge issue is the warlock dlc for the skaven. He is simple over powered and needs to be nerfed very badly. He himself is over powered, his units are over powered, and his special research is highly over powered. Still though the game is very fun one you finally manage to defeat the skaven and stupid archers that run and shoot. Sadly Warhammer 3 will not be as successful, because a vary large majority of the factions are locked and force you to own them in previous warhammer games in order to play them. Which means anyone not playing on steam will have to buy all those faction dlc in order to play them in warhammer 3, which is hundreds of dollars. Not just that, but even if you link your steam account to microsoft account and use game pass you still don't have access to the dlc you already own on steam. You instead have to rebuy them on microsoft store. Meaning warhammer 3 isnt being played or bought by millions of players. Sad really.",1690453869,1690453869,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

[h1] The Game[/h1]
The second installment in the Total War: Warhammer series. Turn-based strategy game where you can play one of many factions available with different mechanics, strategies and missions.

[h1] The Achievements[/h1]
The achievements are: difficult, grindy, require help from specific players and require several DLC. It is very difficult to estimate how fast you can complete all of the achievements as it is very skill based game with a hard learning curve and some RNG involved. Prepare to spend both money and hundreds of hours in this game.

[h1] Recommendation [/h1]
The game is very, very fun in the variety of content that it offers. The problem relies in needing both the first game for the best experience + several DLC for achievements for other factions. This is however one of the best strategy games I have ever played and I felt that it can provide many hours of enjoyment (and frustration) but be aware of the time and money required.

RNG is trash
The RNG is well known to be fully rigged, so the game explicitly lies to you by giving your probabilities of success/failure.  It is decided before the attempt, so if you see your low-level Hero for example, has too low a chance to attempt something, and opt to use your expert, they might still fail 1000 times out of a thousand because the AI determined that the next X attempt by your agent on Y target rolls a natural 1.  This means that the skill of your agents only matters on the margins, and having 'teams' of Heroes to operate together is largely pointless, because you WILL run up against certain fail scenarios no matter what you do.  But you need to invest in them or the AI will simply ruin the experience for you, see below.

I hate Heroes
I learned that you basically have to constantly invest in assassination from the beginning, because if you don't you lose because you can never catch up and the enemy can destroy your buildings, kill your units, and assassinate your characters with impunity.  This happens because the RNG is fake, for one, but for two there is no way to train up assassins well enough if you don't do it from the start, and sending five lower level assassins just gets them all killed.  At one point is was spending 25k gold a year remedying sabotage from an AI across the map from heroes that I couldn't assassinate.  I ended up abandoning the campaign because it was too annoying to keep playing.

Lighting Strike is bullshit
Lighting Strike is an ability that uses the games arbitrary limits to penalize you.  The AI can, 100% of the time, deny your reinforcements.  So if you have three full armies, and they have two, they can, three times in a row, without chance of failure, fight your armies, two against one, one at time.  Granted, the player can do this too, but I don't want to, because its ass.",1689033909,1689436126,False,0,1,0.473684221506118774,0,True,False,False

Ahoy ye landlubbers! Gather 'round and hear the tale of Total War Warhammer 2 as narrated by none other than Luthor Harkon himself!

Avast me hearties! If ye be yearnin' for a game where ye can be a dastardly pirate lord and command armies of undead beasties then this be the game for ye! Total War Warhammer 2 be a grand adventure on the high seas where ye can conquer lands and build an empire fit for a scallywag such as meself. Now me fellow scurvy dogs let me tell ye, the battles in this game be as fierce as a kraken's tentacles! The clash of steel, the roars of monsters and the blasts of cannons will shiver ye timbers! But fear not for ye can unleash all sorts of dark magic and monstrous creatures upon yer enemies. It be like havin' a whole crew of zombie pirates fightin' alongside ye!

But here be the best part mateys: ye can explore the treacherous seas and hidden lands of the Warhammer world. From the sweltering jungles of Lustria to the icy wastes of Naggaroth ye can sail, plunder and take control of the very oceans themselves! It be like being a shark with cannons for teeth! Now I won't lie to ye, there be a few minor flaws in this grand adventure. Sometimes the AI be a touch daft like a parrot with a peg leg but don't ye worry, ye can still have a jolly good time sinkin' enemy ships and sackin' cities!

Sup ye scurvy dogs! Almost forgot that my mind shattered into pieces within the game. Hope ye will learn the tale of my fragmented consciousness as ye plunder the enemy cities so you can deal with my schizophrenic problems. Ahoy again me fellow scoundrels! Luthor Harkon be back to sprinkle some extra vampire flavor into this jolly review!

Listen well ye mortals for in this game ye can assume the mantle of a blood-sucking vampire lord! Picture this! Commanding an army of undead minions clad in dark armor and fueled by an insatiable thirst for blood! Ye can raise the fallen warriors and turn them into your loyal servants, ready to feast upon the flesh of the living! It be like having an eternal crew of bloodthirsty buccaneers! Yer vampire captains and monstrous sea food creatures will strike fear into the hearts of men! It be a spectacle as thrilling as a moonlit dance with the dead!

In the end ye foolish mortals, WH 2 is a vampire pirate's dream come true! It be filled with swashbucklin' action, undead hordes and more loot than ye can shake a cutlass at. 

So hoist the anchor, set sail and remember mateys; dead men tell no tales, but they do leave hilarious Steam reviews!

if u compare quality of this game and shogun 2(2011) u see that in RTS part, shogun way more worked out.
in my country shogun 2 with all dlc cost 32$
warhammer 2 with all dlc, without warhammer 1 cost 80$
maybe it has TBS part good? cuz its has different races it feels good but when u realize that u have 2 way
1st u make doomstak and auto resolve(such interesting game)
2nd u go to RTS part and its poor animation
this 40$ go to effective manager who sale to u warhammer 3
its already cost 66$ with all dlc. 1 or 2 dlc and it will be over 80$ with the same poor RTS part.
i dont recommend buy this game cuz 
1st if u buying it u spent more on dlc and warhammer 1 and 3
2nd buying any product of CREATIVE ASSEMBLY u dont support developer, u will support the managers and degradation of game development.

It's taken me a while to write a review on this game because I was thinking to myself ""well anyone who likes strategy games MUST already know how good Total War Warhammer 2 is.""

but now I'm here, on a Thursday, and thought to myself ""Why don't I go to Steam and review all the games I really like"", you know, what normal people do. 

Total War Warhammer 2 is one of my favorite strategy games of all times. The sheer VARIETY of factions you can play is incredible, a feat on its own. The play style difference between two factions, even some within the same race, is one of the main selling points I use when roping my friends into spending way too much money on this game. (Sorry bois) You can play Orks, and your boy can play Goblins, and the issues you have to deal with and the problems you have to solve in your Empire are going to be VASTLY different. 

The way that they have seamlessly woven so much Warhammer Fantasy lore into the mechanics of the game is incredible. Magic items from books, characters from stories, it's all there. (Most of it anyway)

The MAP DUDE??? THE FUCKIN MAP??? It's so incredibly detailed and beautifully rendered. You can see every little mountain top. You can see dragons and griffons flying around mountain peaks. 

THE ONLY thing I dislike about the Total War: Warhammer series is the Immortal Empires campaign with multiplayer and how they sorta handled it. If I wanna have a decent experience with my friends, even in Warhammer 3, all of us pretty much have to have own all three games. You COULD still play if everyone just owned the same one, but really, the experience isn't complete and there's some restrictions. I would've liked to see some system where if the host owned all the games, the guest could choose from any faction or something? (idk man i'm not a game designer). Kinda like Stellaris does. 

ANYWAY.  I fucking love this game. If you love the Total Wars series, or are a fan of the Warhammer Fantasy lore, get this game. Thanks luv u bye",1688064865,1688064865,True,32,2,0.75509345531463623,0,True,False,False

Game is extremely limited compared to MTW2 and earlier, and not as good from an experience/modding POV.

It does have alot of mods, some of which are really good - but no where near the quality and variety of mods we had in MTW2.

Norsca/Chaos are not implemented very well, and for the other factions I played (everyone except lizards and Vampire Coast) the game is a chore and grind if you try to play anyway the designers did not intend.

For example; say you want to play a HE faction that is in Kraka Drak so you can be the frontline vs Chaos invasion - doesnt mesh well as Imrik is good in mountains but sucks in snow.

Say you want to create a Fimir kingdom out of Albion with the intent of fighting Chaos later; kinda rough because Chaos doesnt trigger until your Norsca faction (required for Fimir units) pledges to a Dark God.

Say you want to play as Chaos and just be a wandering horde intending to conquer the Darklands and face off against the TK? Really a grind because, even though you have no intention of invading the Empire or Dwarfs, the Empire and Dwarfs will always hate you.

Say you want to play as X faction but build tall and have fun sending agents out into the world to do your bidding? Not viable because you simply wont have enough agents as their cap is tied to buildings.

My point is that, unless you are playing the 'canon' way with a given faction you will quickly run into barriers. Now some mods help break down those barriers, but they cant overcome this final nail in the coffin;

If you want to lead the Armies of Chaos against the Free Peoples of Middle-Earth you flat out CANNOT do this. The map is, from what I have seen and experienced, quite static. This is a Warhammer Fantasy game and that is all it will ever be.

This is Why both WH1 and WH2 die out over time (so will WH3) whereas MTW2 still has life left in it. The possibilities are so much greater with MTW2 because you can create so many unique campaigns and mods - even with limited modding skill.

So, ultimately, WH2 is, like WH1, worth it if you get it on sale. Don't pay more than $30 - $40 altogether, including DLC. I would say same for WH3. Wait until it is on a massive sale after it has 'died down' a bit, and get a superior product that is as fleshed out as it ever will be.

WH1, btw, was a huge disappointment for me, but WH2 did include enough variety to get me to over 200 hours, which made it worth the $40 I spent on it. Just barely, but still counts.

Anywho, cheers and all that.",1687482674,1687482674,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I, Karl Franz am your newly elected Emperor of the Empire, I and our new ally The Advisor are telling you to prepare for what is to come. Our maps have been ""updated"" since the last meeting and showed MORE land in both the Old World and what we now call the New World. The threats to our worlds are:

>Archaon the Everchosen is coming and he will try to bring destruction and chaos into our world, with his massing armies. We must stop the Chaos horde like Sigmar did all those years before.

>Also a Millennia ago, a conclave of High Elf mages forged a vast, arcane vortex. Now the Great Vortex falters, and the world again stands at the brink of ruin. The very fate of the world will lie in the hands of the race in control of that vortex.

Humanity must unite under one banner and the other races must join our alliance. If they are not with us, they are against us! Our list has grown:
-We must raze the forests of Beast men and Wood Elves
-Unite with Bretonnia
-Clear the mountains of Goblins and Ogres
-Wipe out the WAAAAGH!
-Burn the Witches and Vampires
-Execute Traitors and Heretics
-Slay Demons and Monsters
-Bury Norsa in the snow
-Sink all Pirates
-Exterminate the Skaven
-Subjugate the High Elves
-Entomb the Pharaohs 
-Tame the Lizardman
-Hunt the Dark Elves
-Pacify the Dwarfs 

With these orders followed and with The Everchosen dead AND the Vortex portal in our control and calmed, the Old World and the New World will be cleansed and bring and a new age of peace.

There is a ridiculous dlc system which requires you to download free content that should already in the game without being manually added. Some of these dlcs requires an account different from Steam to get them. It is frustrating and getting the dlcs is made in the most dumb way I have seen in almost any game.

The Second problems relates to these dlcs and so after buying this game for like almost $80, you do not have the majority of the characters and factions to play and requires you to spend like $110 on dlcs, which is stupid since you should already have them or have it be free dlcs after paying a Triple A game's price.

My third problem is a mechanic that is very powerful and does not have a lot of counters for, that you can get after the early game. It makes it so campaign battles are not very large which is disappointing for me because I would like to have several lords with different army styles working together to create something chaotic and fun. The only way that you can do this is custom battles I believe unfortunately. This makes me have to create more consistently the same armies in order to be consistent with counters, which makes it slightly less fun.

This game is actually one of the better Turn Based games and kind of reminds me of Mount & Blade for the fighting aspects and how fun that is. I think it is a fun game but with the dlc overpay, I do not think it has the longevity to keep you playing unless you have money to spend.

HOWEVER, there is one major fly in the ointment. It is turned-base, but as the game progresses and more of the map is revealed, one can wait 5 minutes or more after clicking 'end turn'. It takes several minutes to start a battle and several minutes to end one. A suggestion to the developers is to create a patch that only shows movement for units within sight of one's own and not for all movement (like CIV does). I found myself doing chores in between turns like wash the dishes, take care of the cat box, etc. Or read many pages of a book. This tedium prevents me from playing the same game for longer.

It is very replayable. But the long turn change and pre/post battle waits and the DLC overload factor lowers my score. 7.5/10

Edit: This review concerns the Mortal Empire campaign game that requires Total War: Warhammer 1 (as I call it). I very much enjoyed warhammer 2 without it. It only had the story-based Great Vortex campaign. But now with this second option, the game is even better. It is simply a game of conquest with no complicating story behind it.

I know this is the norm for strategy games, but the AI is miserable and passive, both on the campaign map and in battle, and I often find myself losing battles and on the strategic map only because of friendly AI. My reinforcements spawned behind the enemy, or to their side? I spent 2000 gold on sending troops there? Well, you know what the friendly AI will do when the enemy makes a beeline with their massive army towards my 5 units? Stand there. Just stand there for 5 minutes, until all my units are dead. Then, the enemy makes their way over to them unimpeded and finishes them off. As for the campaign map, you'd think that after 2 decades of developing Total War games, CA would have figured out how to simply change a few numbers to the benefit of the player. It's great seeing 80% of the empire taken over or destroyed outright by turn 30.

A vampire lordess dressed in light clothes and armed with a sword took out hundreds of men on her own, while surrounded. I should mention, I had taken out every other unit in the opposing army. Alright, let's give her the benefit of the doubt and assume she has inhuman strength, or is bolstered by magic.Fine. But then how was she able to wrangle up almost a hundred men as captives? On her own? Those men wouldn't just run in different directions? What happened to the other hundreds of men that routed from the field? She killed ALL of them?  On top of capturing 87 men??? It would be alright if this was a demon, a dragon, or something else. But a woman, not even on horseback? Seriously?

You CANNOT TAKE REINFORCEMENTS INTO QUEST BATTLES?????? WHY? There is NOTHING preventing my second army from entering the field. What is this retardism? There isn't even an in-game explanation on why half of my forces are suddenly blocked from entering a battle.

There is no armor/equipment system for units like in Medieval 2, which is disappointing. but eh, whatever.

I have lost three siege battles because of the completely fucking obnoxious and nonsensical city square capture system. I would have won all of those battles, if I simply had more time. Instead, enemy units would make their way to the city center, sit their asses down, and for some reason the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of armored, armed men defending their homes, who are actively fighting and in good morale, just decide to lay down their weapons and let themselves be taken captive??? ""oh boo fucking hoo, the enemy had 15 tiny, poorly trained, and unarmored goblins standing still in an unimportant square of this massive fort/city. Guess we'll just give up and let ourselves be fucking slaughtered??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"" what the actual fuck?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? Could you imagine this happening in the real world? Oh, the enemy captured a city block? Let's send all our men to be taken prisoner by the enemy and give the entire city up. Before you say, ""bUt oTheR tW gAmEs hAd tHiS toO"", it actually mattered, because the units of the defending army would always flee towards the square, and attacking units would generally route out of the city. Here, broken, shattered, demolished, morally crushed units will magically push past your units and run straight into the heart of the city (where, logically, further defenses and choke points  would be waiting for them). It's just downright nonsense.

What fucking mongoloid said ""yep that makes sense, go ahead and add it to the game"" ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

On top of that, routed enemies will always flee INTO the city, not back out, or up to the walls, where their other units are fighting, which exacerbates this problem SO MUCH. Again, it also makes absolutely no sense.

On a similar note, integrating other provinces into my faction along with their armies often wrecks my economy, despite the fact that, supposedly, those provinces should have been able to pay for the upkeep of their own armies prior to me acquiring them, and the gold generated by those provinces.

Armies you are not at war with can just go around freely raiding your provinces and land, causing unrest, losing you money, and spreading corruption. There is no way to tell them to fuck off, and if you attack them, YOU WILL FACE DIPLOMATIC CONSEQUENCES?????????????????? This is some Civilization 5 levels of diplomacy bullshit. Who designed these systems? Did they not play the game? Did no one think, at any point during the game's development, that shit like this makes no sense? Like, come on. Some developer playtesting came across this exact situation many times and okayed it??

Just play Medieval 2. It's cheap and actually fucking works. I'll continue trying to get into this game, especially because its production quality is so high. But come on. There is so much game-breaking logic-defying garbage, that it feels like there was 0 actual playtesting involved. I'm not even going to comment on the greedy DLC pilfering policy. All of these little ""problems"" start to stack together, and it is a serious detriment to what would otherwise be a very fun game with amazing graphics. On its own, I would shrug my shoulders and say whatever to any of these issues. However, when I can form a list of them, and many of them can ruin your experience outright, it quickly deteriorates into a shitfest that makes me question if anyone ever playtested this game. It's incredible that these were non-issues in earlier TW games, but they're popping up now.

lol, and as i finish this review and turn back to a battle I was playing, two units of crossbowmen stop responding to any commands. I tell them to shoot at a unit, they turn around and run towards an enemy cavalry unit engaged in melee with swordsmen. I drag out the reposition icon. They keep running. I click back for them to move. They keep running. I use the halt command. They keep running. They were NOT running because of oncoming enemy infantry. They were standing perfectly still behind a friendly unit of infantry UNTIL i told them to attack a target. THEN, they freak out and decide to stop functioning outright. Nice.

Warhammer 2 is moreish, the food you can't help yourself returning to. The sheer diversity of the roster, the wealth of GW lore and the compelling gameplay loop is a bedevilling intoxicant that CA have brewed. If my mixed metaphors don't give it away, this is a strong recommend.

I come to the Warhammer instalments as a long-time player of historical Total War, who still avidly follows and plays the Europa Barbarorum 2 mod for Med 2. I also come to the titles as someone who was absolutely fascinated by the 5th and 6th edition-era Warhammer Fantasy tabletop as a kid and have never looked back. 

CA have managed to capture the feel, the sounds and the sights of the tabletop magnificently - CA's artists and designers, their sound technicians and their voice acting direction deserve the greatest of plaudits. It's a triumph, and every time I load up the game, I am transported back to leafing through the armybooks in the early '00s and hanging about the local GW on Saturdays.

As someone who plays a lot of historical and values authenticity as part of battles and campaign structure, I thoroughly enjoy WH2's single-entity units, magic and battle pace. It is an arcade of treats, more akin to certain HoM&M fantasy RPGs of old, and that's what one should keep in mind when coming from historical titles. It's faster, it's explosive and totally absurd. Strategy and tactics remain, but they are simply different ones. That's the direction these titles have taken, and I am fine with it.

As for how it translates from TT, it is more difficult to compare and is somewhat a subjective experience. I don't seek to replicate that experience like-for-like (particularly given the mixed rep of 8th edition), but in general, the vanilla game following all the updates since 2017 gets the general feel down. There are a vast selection of mods at this point, ranging from overhauls to smaller tweaks to get your desired sweet-spot. I'd recommend the Tabletop Caps mod to at least give armies (both yours and the AI's) some structure and balance.

On the confusing array of purchasing options and DLC - other buying guides will likely explain this better, but the only purchase I would make initially is to buy the base-game of both Warhammer 1 and Warhammer 2 when they go on sale (which is pretty regular). This is purely to unlock the Mortal Empires campaign in Warhammer 2 itself and grant access to the base-game factions of the original game, all of which received overhauls and roster updates in Warhammer 2. This content alone will provide you hours upon hours of gameplay. You can then make decisions about the factions you enjoy playing and whether you want to purchase the relevant smaller DLC packs that add new lords, factions and individual campaigns. Mandalore described it best; they are [i]à la carte[/i], and can be approached one at a time.

A further note - I closely follow Warhammer 3 and its developments even if I have not purchased it. With this in mind, I'd also recommend Warhammer 2 as currently the more complete experience, having had years of updates and a selection of mods to fine-tune your experience. I am waiting for Warhammer 3 to go through a number of patch cycles and content updates (as well as requiring a PC upgrade) before buying into that experience. There is more than enough well-rounded content between Warhammer 1 and Warhammer 2 to satiate my needs until that happens.",1683981997,1683981997,True,28,0,0.759593725204467773,0,True,False,False

""Total War"" is a concept that dates back to the early 20th century, maybe late 19th. it means ""war of annihilation"", ""genocide"" in modern words. This choice of title alone should tell you everything you need to know about the game series... 
But if you need to dive deeper, here it is:

""Warhammer II"" is STILL for the delusional Sunday warrriors and worshippers of the ""mighty and manly"" Sparta - which has been a ruin for over 2000 years while ""sly and effeminate"" Athens still endures as the capital of Greece...
Morale is STILL a gimmick. Humans can STILL almost run as fast as horses. Logistics, demographics, and natural ressources are STILL just an afterthought. And again, the only thing medieval are STILL the graphics...
But with the addition of so many new factions came two new treats! One from Games Workshop and the other from the Developpers!
The one from Games Workshop is wild inconsistencies. ""Take the money and run!"" Notoriously, there is no-one in the studio making sure the whole Warhammer world holds together. They just pile the childish gimmick of the week on top of last week's gimmick, milking it as dry and fast as possible before moving on to the next cash-cow. In game terms, this means huge and random balance issues that keep appearing. They fix one, and two new issues come up. At the time of this review, for example, the Empire is so marred in random events, rivals factions, and dissentions, that's is guaranteed defeat in 20 turns, even if you reload your auto-save every 3 turn... It's like playing with a pervert GM who love to throw a level 20 dragon at your level 1 group, just for ""fun"". Last year, Morathi's faction was crushing most of the map, wreaking havoc on the campaign. Now it's Alith Anar... Next year it's gonna be a new faction. Boring.
The one from the Developpers is FORCED paying content and unfair (illegal?) marketing. Notoriously, in every Total War title, even if you don't want a DLC, you are forced to play with it as it automatically shows up in your game. Oddly enough, the DLC factions even sometimes ruin your campaing until you buy the DLC. Weird, uh?  

But if you're into BDSM, specifically scatology and golden showers, you could still give this game a go! As far as I'm concerned, I've learned my lesson this time...",1683126621,1683126621,False,0,1,0.366513967514038086,0,True,False,False

The  game is particularly hard during the early turns, putting off a new player due to difficult starting challenge and early negative events.  For me, the number and frequency of these AI mechanics are irritating as they undermine planning, building, tactics and strategy. In diplomacy, long term allies will turn on you if they are able to join a stronger alliance and unprovoked neighbours will declare war pulling you into world war with their allies.  Missions mostly cost more to achieve than the rewards are worth and most cannot be achieved within the timescale or without leaving your home provinces vulnerable to invasion and ruin.  From the start, rogue doom stack pirate armies roam the oceans.  As a new player, I thought these would invade when I did not have an army capable of defending against them.  This upset my positive engagement with the new game.  I later learned that they don't land or attack unless you set sail near their path. This game would be more engaging for  new and casual players with the random negative events were less frequent and less severe.  This early experience of this game is the least satisfying total war game I have played in two decades., although it improves as you gain knowledge and experience.  The game development seems to be for experienced players wanting harder challenge rather then new or casual players.  I do not recommend this game for new or casual players or for players that are looking to build an empire through building, planning, strategy and diplomacy.  The game rewards battle and conquest above other gameplay. Nonetheless I have continued to play the game.

Now that I've spent a considerable amount of time playing Warhammer II, I can confidently say that it holds a special place in my heart. The game has very well designed elements, stunning graphics, and fun gameplay. And, of course, we can't forget about that one annoying faction in every Total War game that relentlessly sends armies your way. This time, it's the Rats!

Anyways, outstanding game I highly recommend to any RTS/Total War enthusiast. Also, the game becomes even more enjoyable if you play with a friend; there's nothing quite as amusing as listening to them panic as their lone ranged regiment battles a monstrous beast, especially when it's their first Total war game :)

Some con's though, (con's present in all the other Total War Warhammer Games in some form):

1. The specificity of the some of the units coupled with needing to micromanage the Lord/Hero's abilities becomes really cumbersome in the late game.

2. Kind of a late game thing - kinda not - but I enjoyed how visceral the battles felt in Fall of the Samurai and Empire.... I loved how a random cannonball could 1-shot your general and musket-volleys fire was loud and devastating. Pitched battles generally didn't last long in those games because units would die/route so quickly. Which I think is historically accurate as far as martial battles go.

Meanwhile, battles in WHII/WHIII can sometimes feel like pillow fights....

Units (particularly high level; thus the ""kind of a late game""-comment) can just got at each for minutes.... And there's plenty of Youtube videos of high-level lords solo'ing full-stack armies. 

It can make battles feel like a cartoon representation of a battle versus an actual battle.

Apart from that - great game.

But I can remember even 20 years ago wishing they'd ditch the historical settings and just go NUTS with a fantasy setting because there were little hints (like the Roman ""Arcani"" units in Rome 1) here and there that they wanted to go in that direction. I assumed if they did that it would be an original world, and I never would have guessed they'd get into Warhammer Fantasy. 

But you could not ask for a better setting for a High Fantasy grand strategy game than Warhammer. 

Otherwise, the structure of these games has changed very little over the last 20 years, where you work on a map to conquer the world, agents and armies running around taking objectives. The battles play out roughly the same in every game, with artillery, hammer & anvil tactics, etc. And each game brings a slight spin on it, enough to keep it lively.

So what makes Total Warhammer (all 3 games) special is the obsessive attention to detail, because Warhammer is the king of completely over the top purple prose. Unit designs are pushed to 11. Creative Assembly could have just copied the tabletop miniatures, but it's like they said no no, what if it was REAL. Let's go bananas with this. It's a match made in heaven to have CA on Warhammer. I would challenge ANYONE to find me a game with this much detail. Sheer volume of data and visual stimuli, pound for pound its not possible.

And for me this is what makes the game so god damn fun. As you go further into each faction's unit tree the units get more wild and unhinged and crazy, but with a loving attention to detail that renders them on the battlefield in their hundreds.

AND THEN YOU GET TO SMASH THEM TOGETHER AND BLOW THEM UP. 

It's better than any previous total war game because instead of boring units of roman legions re-enacting the battle of Cannae or whatever, you have flying Gorgon demons fighting wizards riding dragons. And the thing is, it feels as *real* and *respectful* to the source material as the old games did Rome vs Hannibal at Cannae. Imagine that!

After many                  more hours of playing this game.  What made this game more bearable, and                 actually fairly fun?   MODS.  Community Mods; made this game enjoyable.                   Without the Mods; my review would remain a Thumbs Down.ORIGINAL Review:I really wanted to rate this game as a ""thumbs up""; but I just can't.Really, I like just about everything with this game.  Cool Lore.  Great, entertaining battles.  Awesome diplomacy features.  Cool factions.  Nice events.  Quests, a great.  Challenging game on Normal.  Fantasy is fun.Here is the main HUGE PROBLEM.  And the reasons why I find this game so very annoying to play.  In fact, I can't play it anymore, the annoyance factor is so high.Bad implementation, regarding re-claiming your own lost territories.  In particularly when your settlement gets devastated or Ruin. When the player, or the AI lose a settlement; any other faction, including your allies can sweep in fast and 'take it' for free. I have had so many games, where I lost my settlement to Chaos Hordes; and it became devastated.  I was mere turns away, of not 'a' turn away from reclaiming it.  When... my ally, swept in fast and took it instead!  Right smack-dab in the middle of my Main province.  Where the ONLY way in the game that you get get 'your settlement back' is to declare war (on the ally).  There is no feature in the game to TRADE territories, or ASK for your territory back.Also; if you lose your territory to an enemy in general, even if not devastated;  then any other faction or even your own allies can War them and take that settlement which previously belonged to you!  And they keep it.  And there is no way that you can get it back, unless you War that other faction.  Too often, in my games, my allies are 'taking lands' that belong to me.  Where I just lost a Battle to an enemy, or some horde devastated my settlement.  And Swooooop!  In comes an ally to take my land.   And then I have no choice but to declare war on a 'long time' ally; just because the AI is too stupid to understamnd that ""Hm.  If, I take my allies land... that might piss him off.. and he will probably declare war on me"".  Real dumb AI mechanics here.It seriously kills my gaming experience.  Totally.  What a turn off.  It makes the game pointless.  Allies are pointless.  Keeping claim to territory is pointless.  Territory diplomacy is 'non-existent'.  Diplomacy in general is great!  Just not so, with territorial diplomacy.  Nor, territorial politics.  It is virtually non-existent in this game. All they need to do is simply program a feature in, that would totally fix this problem!  And they can't do that.It is an easy script too!  As I am also a game programmer.All they need to do it implemenet this logic:IF a faction loses a settlement (by devastation or occupation), that faction has 'X' amount of Turns to 'reclaim it'  If X amount of turns expires, then any faction may take claim to that settlement unhinged. It is such an easy piece of code!!!  And it would totally FIX a huge problem in this game that a lot of people have been complaining about.For real.  Stop allowing factions (even allies) to swoop in, and take my territories, the very moment that I lose one to an enemy!I have had some games where my allies will literally patrol around a settlement of mine; that they ""think"" I might lose to my enemy.  And immediately, once that happens, they claim my land in 1 turn.  it is so ridiculous.  Truly.  It breaks the game for me, every time.  Every time.  I am done with this game; after this review.

My last  attempt was  15 ranged units against 3 melee. MY units either run away or wont attack even with clear line of sight. Apparently the company tried to fix an issue of ranged being too strong for players that exploited their use. In turn broke single player campaign and the entire game. Do not buy until the company fixes this horrible issue. ( The next message is for the developers and anyone who contributes to PR Dept.) I bought the game and all of the DLC.

and i found that its as good as people say and it is now up there with Shogun 2, Rome 1, Medieval 2 and 3 kingdoms and honestly i could be the best out of all of them even being that i don't know any of the lore

Pros: 
       - Tons of fractions all different from one another and different units one minute you will be fighting giant 
          demons next minute you will be fight undead jack sparrow pirates with guns next minute you're 
          fighting elves with dragons then next moment you're fighting guys with tanks or helicopters stuff gets 
          wild
       - World map is really nice to look at tons of different terrains and some are not suitable for your clan
       - the Hero's are pretty cool

Cons: A lot of DLC that could have been in the base game
 
the game is a combination of 3 Kingdoms and Lord of the Rings Battle for Middle Earth i get mad LOTRBFME vibes from it i would recommend this to anyone who's a RTS fan don't be like me and knock the game because you don't know the lore",1631415803,1679091687,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

EDITED THIS REVIEW AFTER PLAYING OLDER TOTAL WAR TITLES THE 9/10 NO LONGER APPLIES,UNDER THIS IS THE NEW ONE

cant say enough good things and my play time speaks for it self easily a true 9/10 game one of the best strategy games 
so i will say what i dont like about it
-the diplomacy needs a large expansion A LARGE one 
(dwarfs should never listen to skaven and attack empire and should never make peace with greenskins...its insanity)
-sieges,warriors of chaos and beastmen need Complete Reworks but thats for game 3...but so do the wood elves
-the ai being able to cheat too hard spamming 3 full stacks while only having just their capital and its at tier 3
-military alies declaring war on each other when they are at war with 10+ other enemies 
-chariots and even some cavalry even in game one pushing enemies around and helping them escape instead of killing them
-lords and heroes spinning in place and not hitting enemies
and some more but thats what really irks me 
if a game can be so much fun even in spite of all of this than you know CA made something good 
plus the patches keep getting bigger and better even the free aspects of patches are entire faction reworks so even if you dont buy the new hotness you still get something...a hwin-hwin!

A edit after 2 years and thinking if this game is that good:
playing just shogun 2 and rome 2 (in 2022) and then returning to...this abomination of a total war is a damn tragedy
rome 2 with its legions and good looking armor,family tree and the politics system 

while its still has problems of the older total wars is still MUCH more fun than slamming big units into the enemy with bad colision/animation response (taurox being a big disapointment with his 3 animations and them looking wrong) (they exist in rome 2 but they are horribly on full display on most single entities in any WH game)

shogun 2 with its amazing unit uses,gravity to thinking ahead if you can afford to waste units in a fight and amazing situations where you just want to think of creative strategies for each fight 

warhammer is a massive disapointment now,it was a massive disapointment to return to this game and 3 will also be a massive disapointment to those who want any depth to these games like they had a lifetime ago (hyperbole but you get it)

Oddly enough its like reading what was all done and possible thousands of years ago where most dumasses today think people from then were stupid and couldnt wipe their asses without assistance

it was genuenly a depresing moment to think about (not just about total war) how our golden better age has long past and we a living better than ever but feeling worse and worse with the world going in a worse and worse direction          The Reign of Saturn has passed,only ruin is left of our civilisation

And a 40k example,discovering a STC and seeing what was done before in the glory days of the Imperium (franchise)

i was genuenly sad to see how just rome 2 had more depth to its gameplay and more fun politics than anything in warhammer 

And just to say Warhammer was the only RTT/RTS that i didnt need time to figure out (unlike Crusader kings,rome 2at the start,which fell off quickly,shogun 2 a little,stelaris and endless space

all those games took me like 1-2 days to get alteast the general use for each unit and building and what is needed even in war against 2-3 factions 

warhammer? i was bored of the medium dificulty and figured everything out BY TURN 20!!!!!!!
fucking shameful display CA   
You dont know how luck you have a new flock of retards and yes-men Youtubers to defend your lazyness against any criticism with ""unit diversity and unit type quantity"" and attack anyone who doesnt think your braindead new system of battle and ""diplomacy"" and every ascpect of the newer total wars is Absolute SHIT
                                                                                  6/10 
                                 i was naive and stupid thinking the older titles were shit becouse 
                                     they dont have warhammers big monsters and flashy unts 
                                                    the thinking and soul and effort was Lost
                                                                           Ruina Imperia

rome and shogun opened my eyes and its a damn shame they dont care about those games any more

if it was the first TW then sure 9/10 still stupidly basic
without mods saving its ass and it opening the Age Of Worst total war standards 
A SAD 5/10  
even rome 2 had something after they patched it to hell (never forget the launch) 
this game??? ""shiny colors and ai cheats are the only thing in it 

its only a positive rewiev becouse i !had! fun with it back when i didnt know they downgraded it SOOOO MUCH 
and saw what a scam all the dlc and 3 games were
dlc and nothing new but % bonuses  and 1 change  
and without the vortex mode to be game 2  all the factions are just dlc quality  THEY ADD NOTHING and yet you pay 60 to unlock a mode to play what you already payed for in game 2 and game 3 when it gets there 

Such a bitter taste to look back on the times i had fun with it,even then i knew something was wrong but i couldnt compare it to anything...until now

those who know their lore and have looked at the artwork and how CA just made it a cartoon depiction of each faction is another failure   chaos and the new pink horrors are the prime examples  they looked better and more menacing in dawn of war ffs  

i will say it again  
-there is no depth to this game,everything you do is a plus in game  everything is green(a boost) there are no problems with having too much of anything  
nothing you do is bad you always get bonuses for any click   no province management,your ruler is immortal,people eat air to survive and you have enough people in garisoned units to create a tidal wave of bodies and yet they dont help you? standing armies that are always drafted,,,its lazy a lazy gameplay excuse from them   make units able to split and get the AI to split his infinite armies a little by defending settlements that dont have a capital worth of units in them
 
if i ever return to this game it will be to play 1 final empire campaing with mods  and one settra campaign

There were plenty of bumps in the road to get there, but Warhammer 2 became my all-time favorite strategy game.  The variety of factions and the grandiose world map of Mortal Empires make for a fantastic RTS/TBS sandbox experience of humans, elves, orcs, undead, and more.  If you're willing to venture outside the historical strategy setting, there's a lot here.  Start by buying Warhammer 1 and 2 on sale, then playing Warhammer 2 Mortal Empires campaign (the Vortex campaign isn't so bad either, if you want to mix it up).  If you enjoy it, pick up the DLCs as they interest you.  If you can't get enough and just need more, then take a look at Warhammer 3's Immortal Empires mode (in beta and still maturing at the time of this review).",1665427125,1678053661,True,5,0,0.597701132297515869,0,True,False,False

Oh my this was incredible, for my opinion this was even better than the first! And the fact that you can play both at the same time with Mortal Empires is beyond all expectations! The uniqueness of every faction continues, with even better factions than the first game like the High Elves and Dark Elves for example. If you ever dreamed of playing a grand strategy game with massive battle that resembles The Lord Of The Rings then this is it!

There's a faction for everyone and they can vary quite a bit. It might not have super deep tactical depth when facing A.I, but on harder difficulties you do need to think a bit.

        Have you ever felt the overwhelming ecstasy of watching a pack of feral rats getting shit on by five dragons. Or laugh in delight as you one man an entire enemy army and still come out the victor. Have you ever wanted to feel like a god, I have. Let me tell you a story; I conscripted one of the finest elven armies the world has ever seen, with all prostrating themselves as they are inevitability conquered. Yet, I could not protect my coasts from the Mongolian horde that are the vampire pirates. After losing my coastal cities again in one of the biweekly raids by them, I decided I had enough. I sent my invincible armies into their hell coves to purge them one and for all, and I lost. not just one army, that would be embarrassing enough; I lost three of the finest armies that I could muster. So now it is personal, I pour my countries entire GDP into creating even stronger armies, near bankrupting my country to do so. Finally, I send the armies to destroy the vampirates for good.except, that the turn before the battle BOTH the humans and the dark elves land troops in my capital region. And that children is when you press quit to menu and swear to never touch that retarded piece of shit again.

In tabletop Warhammer, you have battles between equally powerful armies. Those armies have constraints that force you to make strategic choices. (I can have either a cannon or a monster, but not both.) For various reasons, that's not feasible in a Total War game. So instead, you can have whatever you can afford in your army, which is fine.

But that means the strategic constraint is put on your overworld economy -- and the problem with that is that that economic system isn't very interesting. It's pretty bare bones. Other systems are oddly implemented, like diplomacy, where the UI gets really confusing when there are 70 factions to interact with. I wouldn't say they're bad, just not particularly interesting.

Since the economy is the gameplay focus, you can also try to win by playing efficiently. i.e., you can win with an all-dragon army, but that's economically inefficient if you're just killing swordsmen. This means if you play tactically, you can get by with less. But I found this a bit awkward as well, because the game leans really heavily into battles. With brief interludes, you'll often fight several per turn. 

To fight efficiently, you often can't automate battles. So to make it tolerable to fight a hundred non-automated battles in a campaign, the game really speeds these battles up. Often, battles are over in five minutes. To do this, infantry must move close to 20mph -- once you see it, it's hard to unsee. This is disguised somewhat by being able to pause or slow-down time, but it creates a kind of surreal tempo to battles that I thought was chosen to be suitable for multiplayer and to enable a focus on battles, not strategy. 

Together, this makes the game less compelling to me than I think it seems at first. There's a pretty but gameplay-bland overworld map, and frequent battles where the main difficulty is a self-prescribed goal of economic efficiency. On harder difficulties, where you can't pause, there's some micro -- and that's mostly it. 

Overall, the game isn't bad. And it's definitely more fun than the first Total War: Warhammer. The attention to the lore, the tone of the universe, and the faction diversity all feel good. But after 70 turns or so, I find it hitting a slog that I think could have been avoided with a bit more inspiration. 

(For instance, nothing in the game has upkeep except for units. This means the economic side of the game is mostly unit/no unit decisions. But provinces should have things you can build outside the city for upkeep. Garrisons at choke points, shrines, mines, or other things that cost upkeep or had benifits/drawbacks would create a diversity of economic choices and make each province feel more interesting and personalized.

So enjoyable. The high elves are so great, all of the leaders were in my hands. Oxyotl and Eltharion campaign gave me the best experience with any TotalWar there is. Came back to vampire counts and went on to conquer whole world like in the 1st TW:WH game. Magic is satisfying AF! Units are beautiful, same the terrain. 900+ hours, such a good time... So nostalgic, such a good time....

And yet, I am so exhausted, so dissapointed at the end. Every single faction tries to attack me, no matter the distance, no matter the map situation, no matter the faction strength difference; just attack player, attack player, attack player. Everything dies so fast, I cannot even feel interested in a single battle or look on this shiny super unit graphics. Siege battles are so boring, ugh, I always autoresolve them, even if it not gives me a good outcome. The confederation system is idiotic, some races are just turbocollecting terrain and others are doomed to gain everyghing on their own. It hurts me the most, when almost dying faction, like Reikland or Naggarond confederates a lot stronger faction, just to spite player.

Had a lot of hopes for TW:WH 3 but this game wasted me so much... like, drained completelly to the point, I do not love TotalWar games anymore :(

Overall the game's fine and there is a lot to admire design-wise, but there are tons of glaring issues that leave a bad taste in your mouth. Most of them technical or monetary.

Having sailed the Black Ark for a while now - for the single-player and checking out the DLCs beforehand - I finally bought this because of the multiplayer, and only because there was a big discount. On the topic of high seas - the Steam version runs worse than the cracked one, there is at least a 10% loss to performance. I can only assume it's because of Denuvo. Give me a break.

[b]Graphics[/b]
It's personal to a degree but to my eye it clearly looks worse than Total Warhammer 1 (i.e. lighting is odd if not outright broken, something people pointed out at release and it seems to still be an issue).

[b]Performance[/b]
Bad performance is easier to point out. First of all, it simply runs very poorly on 1440p+ resolutions. The FPS are lower than TWH1 without offering a significant or justifiable improvements. The first game looked just fine, there was no need to push for more ""advanced"" tech. If you're making what frankly is a glorified expansion (TWH 1.5), don't force in more demanding tech that many players won't be able to run, just to be able to claim that's it's ""new and improved"".

If you don't set everything to High/Ultra, it's an eye sore and loses a ton of aesthetic value. And I'm talking about the campaign view here, not even the battles. There is nothing on the map that needs this kind of hardware. I don't have a habit of calling developers lazy, the story is often more complicated than that, but I can't come up with any other description here. The engine is trash and has been so for years now.

[b]Downloadable Content[/b]
The DLCs policy is by now infamously bad and for good reason. At best it's confusing and requires more than the usual amount of research to understand what works with what, across two games. Some of the content is very good and clear effort and thought went into it, but everything is overpriced. Some of it is laughably bad and should've been discounted to 1 quid/dollar or given away for free. The Blood God situation is terrible no matter how you slice it. I don't mind the Mortal Empires policy, but it could've been handled better.

[b]Positives[/b]
One thing that has to be said is that there was a lot of free content, patches and reworks of existing races that went into the title post-release. In my mind, that does somewhat make up for the past mistakes and fills with confidence for the future, but in the end I decided to leave a thumbs down review to communicate the lingering issues. If Creative Assembly continue with this level of quality and dedication, the third entry should be free of some of the problems that have plagued the franchise.

However I know that *if* I ever get around to buying the sequel, it will be years after release, at a steep discount.",1643554924,1673895827,False,2,0,0.486562937498092651,0,True,False,False

I've played too much. Yes. But I still come back to it. It's got to be my top game of all time, I remember saying that when WH1 was fresh. - and I've been gaming since the 80's (OK, Boomer!). 

Thinking of getting into it ? Want the option of a vet/addict? 

I'm going to be explaining why I've gone back to WH2 having played 600 hrs of WH3. For some reason i finally feel the need to express myself on what I consider to be a masterpiece of strategy gaming.

I have all 3 games and all dlc's other than WH3's ones. There is enough content here to keep you going and coming back for 10000+ hours. Value is not a factor in terms if cost. It's there. For all the criticisms that can be placed on the Dev, CA. They really put there heart and soul into these games and it shows. Not perfect, nothing is - get over it lol - but great, no doubt in my mind.

Engaging, challenging, fun and often very very funny - Brian Blessed is great as Gotrek "" Squeaky Bum Time!"" Goblins chanting "" Stab Stab Stab! "" poor Malekith complaining "" abominable snow!"" Voice acting A+

There's a depth and breath of mechanics that just provides so many options to explore and perfect. WH2 has some cheese to be exploited - they removed most of it in WH3 - but that's part of what I find fun - the Empire's endless hordes of Heroes with insane impact in the campaign and battle maps for one, there so many to pick as examples. It's just fun - not balanced - but fun - Pretty much all gone from WH3.

WH3 hasn't hit the right notes - for me - it feels slow and tedious compared to WH2. The world its so much bigger, they deliberately made the travel distances longer (2 turns between settlements compared to one in previous versions). The pace of battles has also been slowed. Some of the under the hood mechanics have been tweaked  - CP if you know about that - basically the enemy will route off the battlefield if you get too far ahead in any given battle. All too often in WH3 I've been sat the waiting for the battle to end and it just feels draggy - specially in Major Settlement battles. ""Is it over yet?""

The new races in WH3 are great, brilliant models and interesting (enough) mechanics, little short on troop rosters though. Love Nurgle armies personally, hilarious.

WH3 has some really really great QoL tweaks, much needed improvements to WH2. They removed the AI cheats that dominate WH2 meta - your melee troops will suck, regardless of tier in WH2 - you have to rely on missiles, arty and magic to do killing in WH2 - WH3 feels much more balanced from this aspect. So there are big positives for 3, I completely acknowledge that.

They removed the exponential increases in maintenance costs for troops so you can field many more armies to address the above issues. But the most recent patch did it in for me - removing (effectively) the settlement battles that were a key feature of WH3 - they almost never happen - and REMOVING WALLS FROM MINOR SETTLEMENTS!!! I can't tell you how much that ruined the game for me. Minor settlement battles were ok, the major settlement battles are bloated and tedious, they feel unnaturally drawn out and painful, as said above. tower and barrier mechnics - so meh.

I personally really dislike the look and feel of the new WH3 maps, graphically and design. WH2 is just straight up prettier and way more detailed. Sure concessions were made for the scale vs performance, I get there are reasons for these things, But WH3 looks like a cartoon in comparison - for the campaign map. Also the newly designed battle maps - some are just really badly designed, they look unnatural with weird isolated circular pockets of trees, also hill formations that just make battle more painful - a design issue so very subjective, but bugged me a lot. They feels rushed in design and don't really add much in terms of tactics.

WH2 had so much time to mature and that is still the case - WH3 may get there but for me there are some design choices that are jarring. The updates for WH3 are waaaaay too slow - CA appear to have less resources committed to WH3 than for WH2? dunno for sure bit seems to be. 

As a game, Highly recommenced, if you are ok with  long investments of time to do campaigns - I've not PvP'd at all, which would be more pick up and play for short periods of time - I'm saying it's a time sink.

WH3 - I dont thin it's going to get there my friends. There are some fundamental design choices that I think make 3 more distict from 2 that 2 was from 1 - haha if that makes any sense?

Buy 1 and 2, get all DLCs other than the blood one (pointless rip off).

Boomer, signing off. 

FOR SIGMAR!

I also like the different quest lines that follow and it's not just everyone rush to the portal. I also like the continued support for the game and the dlc that they continued to drop up until the 3 game. I don't like the dlc where they have introduced new lords and units etc for races that are already in the game or locked behind another dlc. That said I do like that not all the dlc has to be paid for and it doesn't limit your game play. There also some dlc which I think should be included in the base game like blood for the blood god.

Native to Central or South Asia, the cannabis plant has been used as a drug for both recreational and entheogenic purposes and in various traditional medicines for centuries. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the main psychoactive component of cannabis, which is one of the 483 known compounds in the plant, including at least 65 other cannabinoids, such as cannabidiol (CBD). Cannabis can be used by smoking, vaporizing, within food, or as an extract.

Cannabis has various mental and physical effects, which include euphoria, altered states of mind and sense of time, difficulty concentrating, impaired short-term memory, impaired body movement (balance and fine psychomotor control), relaxation, and an increase in appetite. Onset of effects is felt within minutes when smoked, but may take up to 90 minutes when eaten. The effects last for two to six hours, depending on the amount used. At high doses, mental effects can include anxiety, delusions (including ideas of reference), hallucinations, panic, paranoia, and psychosis. There is a strong relation between cannabis use and the risk of psychosis, though the direction of causality is debated. Physical effects include increased heart rate, difficulty breathing, nausea, and behavioral problems in children whose mothers used cannabis during pregnancy; short-term side effects may also include dry mouth and red eyes. Long-term adverse effects may include addiction, decreased mental ability in those who started regular use as adolescents, chronic coughing, susceptibility to respiratory infections, and cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome.",1625531217,1672304660,True,3,0,0.563492059707641602,0,True,False,False

Battles are exciting and AI tactics can be clever - the most dangerous thing is when they understand your army's capabilities (and weaknesses) better than you do.
Like all the Total War games, I like the ability to flip between strategic and tactical. 
In later turns, it can be annoying when you decide to do 'one more end turn before I log off' and 2 battles that you weren't expecting but have to play pop up, so you're playing for another hour.

It is a very unbalanced game... at least regarding AI opponents. It's the classic game developer problem of giving AI opponents WAY TOO MUCH resources, supports, map awareness, cheats, etc. to keep up with human players. Challenge is one thing. Balance is something else-- and the devs really missed the mark on this. Even playing on the easiest settings I was struggling to make it to ""mid-game"" (and I would consider myself an experienced Civ 5 player). But this might be remedied with a considerable amount of research and practice. 

Unfortunately, I was past the 2-hour limit of gameplay so Steam would not refund my purchase-- despite the game being bought less than 48 hours ago. Disappointing. 

I might come back and play this eventually, but much more likely it will fall into the deepest depths of my Steam backlog.



TLDR: If you can tolerate terrible balancing and AI, to the point where it is almost game-breaking... then go for it! There are fun moments to be had in this game. The large-scale battles are the saving grace.

Please note, the learning curve is steep, but after a few battles and mistakes (plus a few tutorial videos) you will be able to manage just fine. There is mixed feelings about the paid DLC, which I do agree with most of the negative attitude towards content that should have never been cut (looking at you Blood for the Blood God!!) and later charged, I did purchase most DLCs and was quite happy with said purchases.

The game really scratches the tactical itch. So if you're someone who enjoys tactical games with a fantasy backdrop then Total War: Warhammer 2 is for you!

NOTE: To unlock the ""open"" world sandbox-like mode, you will need to purchase Total War: Warhammer (the first game) in order to unlock this. Also plan to invest in a few purchases, especially with Warhammer 3 due out soon. If you are only interested in trying the game out and less interested in the big campaigns, then:

 - Purchase only Total War: Warhammer or Total War: Warhammer 2

If you're interested in the open world mode as well as the story mode (getting caught up with the current content) then:

- Purchase Total War: Warhammer
- Purchase Total War: Warhammer 2

For DLC, you only need to purchase ones that would interest you. If you are interested in Undead then:
- RIse of the Tomb Kings (The Tomb Kings army unlocked in both story campaign and open world)
- Curse of the Vampire Coast (Vampire Pirates, really need I say more!)
 (The remaining undead DLCs are more if you want another Lord in your armies and some are not very good, purchase if you only want to complete your roaster).
If you play High Elves:
- The Queen and the Crone is excellent and a must have for High Elves, plus it isn't too bad for Dark Elves either.
Now it is worth knowing that there are some DLCs under the Total War: Warhammer (first game) that player might want. If you want to play Wood Elves and Chaos Knights are purchased through the Total War: Warhammer (first game) page, but once you unlock these armies they DO carry over to Total War: Warhammer 2!

Okay, there is a lot of videos to aid you on your armies, tactics, etc. The game is fun and rewarding! Worth the price! Hope this helps, happy gaming! 

NOTE: As of now, Warhammer 3 is still being worked on with the option to purchase it before it is complete. Tempting, but most players want to play the sandbox mode - Immortal Empires, but it is seriously buggy and imbalanced.

EDIT - After all this time, I realize that CA's Warhammer IP isn't really all that good. The other Total War games are much better and to be honest, Warhammer, Warhammer 2 AND especially Warhammer 3 are troubled games. I know this isn't what most of you think, but there ARE much better strategy games on the market. OH and MUCH MUCH cheaper!! Anyways, I am sure there are many who disagree and some who just want to relive those tabletop Warhammer days (and CA's Warhammer series does that - sort of) but CA needs to do better.

For a long time I would have opined this to be the gold standard in Total War games - for the historical fan it offered an expansion on the exotic magic and monsters of Warhammer 1, and for the tabletop fans it introduced the more fantastical races with more ambition and faithful detail than ever. Mortal Empires was the pinnacle of this, both game maps mashed together into one huge campaign - a campaign which showed off the best of its global map strategy and real-time battle tactics.

Weaknesses (such as the one-dimensional sieges and flatness of older races) were concealed by dedicated modders, and eventually CA themselves once they began releasing DLC that reached across both games to offer extra race content for the old guard of the Old World. Although there is now an intimidating amount of dlc, I would say it all justifies its asking price, and you will certainly get your money's worth from this title.

This game will nickel and dime you out of roughly $200 or more for a single player.

It is really a cash grab and there is very little integrity in the business model for the game, but that doesn't mean the game isn't solid. 

The game itself is actually really well programmed and the faction balance is very well designed.

Pros:

1. Graphics are great
2. The game runs fairly well
3. The AI is very smart and is tough on you forcing you to not only focus on military prowess
4. A vast array of factions to play
5. A vast array of sub factions to play
6. As opposed to earlier releases of the series this introduces more ""abstract"" or ""fantasy"" style type troops ie wizards etc...
7. The interface is non-intrusive and well made
8. The tutorial in this game is very in depth
9. The battle details are amazing.

Cons:

1. Tons and tons of DLC. 
2. The AI can be rather rough to the point of frustration resulting in discouragement at times. (Managing to have way too much strength militarily etc..)

Conclusion:

Bottom line is that the game is VERY PRICEY and Creative Assembly has had this market cornered for a number of decades for a good reason. There is no way any other company that I have seen has placed this much detail, effort, and time into a strategic game

I say they have created a great product but have gotten too big for their britches.

The price tag is getting too big and a lot of people are leaving the genre because of it.

Total War: Warhammer III has released and though this review is not about TW WH3 must say their effort upon launch of TW WH3 is much less than the effort put into TW WH2.

This is very indicative of when a company has decided to cut quality while asking for the same price tag.

Build a brand with a good product and then take quality away from it. 

In other words, I truly believe that TW WH2 is the last of the series that any effort will be put into by Creative Assembly.

I say get it while you can, but only for people that are hard core fans of the genre.

As a longtime TW fan i was excited about the fantasy setting and in that aspect it's refreshing. However the mid to late game became frustrating after 100 or so turns. The layout of the map causes every race to be very isolated from each other and since your main goal is to achieve more magical shards than your enemies you barely have the need to explore. However, after 100 turns you will get attacked 20 times per turn from ships full of armies out of all different directions and ending every turn just becomes a tiresome process. The gameplay is simply not very well balanced and the map doesn't allow you to strategically secure your position. It seems this Total War forces a certain playstyle on the player, where there is no room for careful planning or empire building, but instead you should rush to keep up with the pace of the enemies and have dozens of fights every turn.

This game is great on so many levels. Music, graphics, game play, the depth and intricate systems. an easy 8-9/10.

some of the issues are really major. A simple one is, I am unable to win. I have conquered the whole map. And there isn't an inch left uncovered. And the final objective I need to complete to win for a victory screen, ""Kill the leaders of the factions of Chaos"", won't complete. There are no factions left to kill. And online, there are reports of players who have the Chaos invasion turned off, and still are given that unwinnable objective they can't complete. 

So there's a good chance you could be on turn 250+ and 80 hours in, with all short and long term goals complete, and unable to ""win"". I mean, I know i've won at this point. but not being able to get that victory screen sucks.

The 2nd thing I don't care for is how the diplomacy system works. I won't go into depth here, but I find it very lacking. A game I've played with a diplomacy system I prefer is Endless Space 2. But the two games are very different in how the campaign map is structured, so I know the way diplomacy works in ES2 wouldn't necessarily be the perfect solution for Warhammer 2. But it is a reference point for a direction to head in for where I'd like diplomacy to go in future installments in this franchise. I understand Warhammer is a higher emphasis on war, so maybe it was never intended for diplomacy to be a great option. 

3, standard diplomacy is bad. Lizardmen diplomacy to confederate with other Lizardmen might as well not exist. Lizardmen will only confederate if you outpower them 5 to 1, AND if they are surrounded on 5 sides by their other enemies. They will refuse your money and any offer to confederate even if your relations are over 500, even with mods. I had to wait until relations were around 700 to finally confederate with my next door neighbors, at turn 200. This forces you to wage war if you want to own that land. Which depending at what point of the campaign you are in, they may have a military alliance with the other major factions, so if you wage war to force the issue you may trigger WW3. Making Lizardmen the only race that becomes nearly impossible to confederate the entire race into a single faction.

I'm changing my review from positive to negative in view of the absolute state of Total War Warhammer 3 and the unceremonious abandonment of Total War: Three Kingdoms. Original text to follow below. The two main changes of opinion I've had on this game are 1. That I can't give credit to the developers for the amazing modding scene and 2. That Total War Warhammer 2 offers almost no improvements over the first game whatsoever and represents a complete lack of ambition by the developers. It falls short of the amazing potential that a Total War Warhammer game has. It doesn't even have an option to customize and paint your armies and units  - even though that really is an essential feature for a Warhammer inspired game. What's more, we are about to experience history repeat itself with Warhammer 3 where almost no gameplay improvements will be made, no army painter will be present, and the only new things will be a handful of new factions that don't really interest me. I won't be buying Warhammer 3 on launch and I'm left heartbroken over the realization that Total War's developers have such a low level of ambition for their games and the scope of the features to put in them. 

Original Review Text:
I did not play the original TWW because it seemed like too many issues were weighing that game down: Ridiculously fast battles, terrible siege battles, limited regional occupation etc etc. The launch of the sequel made me reconsider however, since new features were added and regional occupation was fixed - and because it included my favorite army, the High Elves.

I enjoyed my first foray into the Eye of the Vortex quite a bit, however there were also plenty of painful moments. Especially the Ritual mechanic is very frustrating with the way the Chaos/Skaven incursions are implemented. Later forays into Mortal Empires further informed my opinion on the vanilla game. I'll break down my thoughts in bullet points.

Pros:
+ great army variety (many different unit types), both within army lists and of course between factions
+ great character development for lords and heroes, also quest battles
+ good sandbox gameplay, especially in Mortal Empires
+ Interesting and appropriate campaign map features/mechanics
+ Vortex story and cortex currency work well enough

Cons:
- Battle speed is extremely fast, units die way too quick
- Lord and Hero characters have huge health bars are deployed as single warriors without a retinue of bodyguards as was the case in previous total war games
- One on one combat in battles is poorly animated, no Med 2 style sync kills
- Too many redundant activated unit abilities like magic spells and buffs
- AI problems in battle and on campaign map
- Overly simplistic diplomacy breaks immersion constantly, wars happen for no reason and you can't give/buy regions
- Terrible siege battles
- Units become obsolete as you tech up because of straight-up better units
- Vortex rituals senselessly punish the player as Chaos forces triple-team and raze ungarrisoned tier 5 cities on ritual turn 1

The consequences of the way too fast battle speed  are not to be underestimated. Battles will last for 3-4 minutes and you'll be pausing constantly to issue new orders. The two battle lines of disciplined infantry will break apart as one side wins after just half a minute of fighting. In classic total war, the infantry would slog it out for far longer while you would maneuver with your reserves, cavalry and skirmishers to swing the battle in your favor. That's how an inferior force is able to win. If the main engagement only lasts for half a minute, there's no choice but to rush in with everything and hope you have enough. If your army is weaker, that initial engagement will go badly and then it'll all be over. Not to mention that the high speed gives you zero time to appreciate the atmosphere of the battle - further reducing immersion. So much for my opinion on the fast battles.

Luckily this most glaring issue was solved for me by the inclusion of Steam Workshop mods into the game. My personal winning mod turned out to be Carnage in the New world, which slows down the battles and also gives each hero character a retinue of bodyguards in battle. The moddability of TWW 2 is thus what saved it for me and what will likely save it for many others as well.

Getting Mortal Empires and just going wild with all the 20-30 Legendary Lords at your disposal is a great experience as each faction will not only have different armies and campaign mechanics, but also faction specific victory conditions. Bretonnia's Errantry War is a personal favorite so far. 

So all in all this is a game you can have a ton of fun with. Mortal Empires brings virtually all of the Warhammer Fantasy universe to life, which makes it virtually an auto buy for any tabletop fan. And Warhammer newcomers will have a great introduction to this ridiculous but epic world. And the replay value is just off the charts since each campaign can last many dozens of hours.",1516468017,1670157657,False,0,0,0.47413790225982666,3,True,False,False

             Total War: Warhammer 2, by far is a really fun to game to sit down a play.
However, there pro & cons to every game so here it is as of what I think about the game.
I like the fact there alot to take in and on the start of on game like quests and missions along with info tips.
the game and interface controls are OK there some learning to do on what every button is for.
With some playing around I was building  army's and taking land quick.
As I progress though the game I seen that when in battle your army will fee and run to way to quickly and not just fight it out.
I ended up losing a lot of battles because of this.
Most of the time I out number my fighting army but my army run away to quickly in battle and end losing alot of man power and have to recover in base.
Then I get attack again lose my war lord and army and have to rebuild again.

I have no idea way engineers coded in your army to run away when under fire instead of just getting down and fighting back.
I mean did try upgrading my leadership on my warlord nothing works this is by far very bad for the game I believe after playing this game for 30 hours in. 

Over all good game but just look out for when you are in battle your army will run and fire.
I do use the auto button on short battle it more logical to me.

The vortex campaign is a decent idea but for me personally it had too many annoying mechanics and wasn't that much fun.

Where the game really shines is of course the Mortal Empires campaign. If you own both this game and Warhammer 1 you can access a grand campaign combining all the factions from both games (and all their respective DLC's). The replayability is endless and each campaign feels way more alive and vibrant.

However, Mortal Empires more than makes up for this. The AI turn times while playing Mortal Empires doesn't feel as long as CA predicted, in fact it feels infinitely faster than it should which is amazing.

Each faction feels unique, even the different sub-factions. All of the Legendary Lords feel distinct from each other. The AI is aggressive but not overbearing, a fine balance was struck. 

Mortal Empires is both incredibly frustrating and rewarding. Watching allies crumble in the face of the combined might of the Vampire factions is the cause of 80% of the stress in my life, especially considering the Empire is sitting on four stacks of twenty unit armies and refuses to do anything to combat this threat. However when my allies who are warring against the Vampires with me do finally listen to my advice and help push back the horde of undead I do not believe I have ever felt a greater sense of relief and satisfaction.

The combined land mass and races of Warhammer I and II in the Mortal Empires gives players plenty of options. The factions are different and depending on the legendary lord, the races themselves can work in many ways. Replay value is high!

Warhammer II offers lots of replay value even if you don't own the prequel. The Vortex campaign with the different main races will provide plenty of entertainment. Some of the DLC races and legendary lords have their own campaigns, keeping the game fresh. Playing as the Brass Bull is quite different from the Sisters of Twilight for example.

With the launch of Warhammer III, those that own all three games Warhammer III offers unparalled replayability in the form of the Immortal Empires. For those that want a good campaign though, Warhammer II is still the answer.

Edit here: im discounting in-game Dlc content, and will *try* to talk about vanilla only m'kay.

Main Cons (which cripple the game) -Poor Optimization; Game runs like pooh (Like real bad if you dont have a decent pc and was/is still poorly optimized so prepare for that). 

-Simplification&Blandness; Every faction just seems like they're just copy pasted of each other with only a few couple slight touch-ups here to differentiate. (funnily enough and a example would be The Dark Elves and the Skaven who almost play similar to each other aka ((""the numbers game/meat grinder tactics"")) in TWW 2, even though while dark elves in the warhammer, tend to be glass cannons ((Hit like trucks,break like glass)) however in TWW2; they lack the truck part).
skaven however shouldn't really be Glass cannons in the game, since skavens should in warhammer (rely massively on meat grinder tactics, swarms for the bulk of their armies and *really* hard hitting abominations and contraptions, while receiving buffs if they're in a swarm, which they do not, they also cannot naturally climb/dig over/under walls like they can in both lore and in other games, same like gobbos but that's up for debate) and that's a *single* example to also make them all seem somewhat ""special"" but they really aren't and it really does show.  

-Greed; CA also has a greedy policy for their games and DLC just like Paradox does ($15-25 per DLC $75-85+ for the base game) with lack luster-mediocre content and the sad part is 90% of TTW 2 is exactly just like EU4 in regards as it is only DLC and it is pretty fucking bad...... don't believe me? uninstall *ALL* the dlcs and we'll see who's right.

-Sheer Laziness; There are many, instances here of such. but I will provide a quite (in)famous (unfixed/not added) example here; ""The Musket animation issue"". There is a textbook definition of: ""no excuse"" here for all the musket men in the game *Especially for the Human ones* to not have *any* of type reloading animations for their muskets (they just literally wiggle their guns up in the air). Especially since *such has already been made in prior games*
all CA had to do here; was just simply add the prior animation code for their unit tables that was already in Empire/Napolean&Shogun 2 here to TWW2's unit tables (TWW's engine is almost similar to all those three games, I can gurrantee you this here. since I have knowledge in modding the series. starting from the first 3-d games here to the newer engine games ((starting From Empire+)) )   

Side Cons:
 Lore inconsistencies- (units and factions), Repcons of previous lore- ( Ex Weaker famous warlords, like Grimgor and Archoan the EverChosen) 
(also they only did the repcons for JUST this game btw), 

Missing units and hero's/lords for factions- ( ex, no mummies or scarabs for TK's or Valten/Luthor Hoss for the empire, No Empire chapterhouse knights, no hochland long rifles, none of the empire unique steam tanks, 90% of actual choas units are non-existant, no daemonettes, no plague-bearers, no bloodletters, pink horrors or choas juggernaughts,nurglings and etc), 

Missing/improper Factions- ( Ex no Marks of chaos, its only a mechanic for the main chaos faction), the Nippon colonies-(the japanese-like faction in warhammer, The amazonians(the aztec warrior-like people in the new world), The Dogs of war (its a ""unified"" merc faction in the warhammer universe), The southern kingdoms (basically the italian-like factions in warhammer, they somewhat are different and distinct from the empire itself, which the empire itself is German-like), the pirate kingdoms of Sartosa, ((saltspyres faction)) does *not* count in this review because a) its dlc and b) it's wrong; There should be another island close by sartosa which HUMAN pirates ((and Ogres)) inhabit and their a ""unified"" faction is called that. saltspyre's faction should be completely different from them), The ogre kingdoms, Araby-(the saracens of warhammer)  and etc) ((Sidenote here about Chaos- Chaos Cannot be generalized as easily like it is currently in the game since it has multiple AND different ""Marks"" or factions for all the chaos gods and each of the chaos gods, their warriors who fight for them in this game are summarized as one which is incorrect and makes no sense since 90% of the time, they fight amongst themselves in lore due to them being the opposite of themselves (like Khorne versus Nurgle) and pretty much in every other source, the game also does not state that if the main choas faction represents choas undivided or not and even if it was so it cant *really* be a ""true"" faction since most who are choas undivided usually ends up siding with one god themselves or the warband leader decides for them by force since they all usually get tempted by one of the choas gods somehow or someway (unless your name was Kul but he died WAY before the setting of TWW 2 takes place ((like a couple of hundred years before and during the reign of  Magnus The Pious))  *which TWW2's setting/backdrop takes place, in the end of times era*) ,

it has Pathetic Gore and strategy- its honestly the worst In any TW AND Warhammer i've ever seen and both are *known* for their Gore (mostly Warhammer here) and TW for its strategy.

Pepperidge farms remembers- CA also employed alotta main influencer-like TW youtuber's to be falsely positive about this game both at launch and currently as I write (Edit a year later of the review: they've been tonned down a little, since the creation of the review)........

.So in short Just play Team BOTET's version (Call of Warhammer) mod for Medieval 2 instead it's alot more better, fun and more detailed than this........ and its free or better yet play the mount and blade mod of warhammer called Warsword Conquest (its literally based on warhammer). it is also free to play like BOTET's mod and it is as equally true to the series.",1552836660,1669263737,False,2,1,0.397355020046234131,4,True,False,False

I don't pretend to be the best Total war player. But looking at things like, i can have a lord recruit troops out his ass in the middle of the map, but if i do this the lord on the other side of the province in a settlement shares the same 3 recruit pool. so you manage a faction. one lord at a time. Also, god mode beast men will be waiting in ambush at turn 4 outside the ruins your quested with taking. A full army, no economy, no recruitment cost, no upkeep, no settlements. they are rogue, scary and spawn out of the blue, early. If your army is standing still, on the map, with no destination planned. you can still get ambushed. meaning you get no deployment phase, your enemy can spawn anywhere around your army, you cant retreat, and your army is stretched out in a column as if it was in march. I remind you, that would be really cool. If your army wasn't standing still and you already knew the enemy was there for 2 turns. Also they had to move the length of your lords maximum map movement range to ""ambush"" your army. God mode beast men. Total war aside can we all agree that Warhammer needs to stop with the gluttonous behaviour. If you want the sand box mode, If you just want to manage a faction without playing the vortex campaign. which, in my opinion is a pushy and annoying mess with constant pop ups from 3 different advisers. compared to Medieval 2 or Napoleon. To unlock the ""free"" mortal empires campaign you must first purchase the previous game at full price. Because overpriced 3 foot tall Titans and miniatures don't make them enough money, cool as they are. If you love Warhammer, maybe try 3. maybe you'll have a better time with this game.

Feral interactive needs to fix this issue.

The other steam linux forced compatibility version are so poorly ported that they're unplayable.  

Great.  Now the prophet and the warlock DLC is not working.  Games says to restart to use new DLC which was working before but now does not work after restart of game, computer, or reinstallation.  What a mess.

The segfault and dlc issues are still there even after upgrading from lucid linx to jellyfish ubuntu.  This wasn't a problem until I wrote the review about feral.

Very Very Annoying Tutorial Forced onto me that makes me frustrated as all actions are blocked until you make tutorial guy happy.
Takes away your camera control a lot, makes the whole game feel jarring as it zooms down. And you have to spend your time fixing the camera again how you had it, causing you to loose orientation.
Also the tutorial is horrible UI wise and keeps taking away control, on my widescreen there is a small button to press to continue, getting me stuck for minutes until i see that and oh.. they blocked all actions until you click X, then they let you do WHAT I TRIED TO DO for 2 MINUTES... and got ""NO I BLAME YOU, NO CANT DO""
And again, Tutorial... oh my god stop moving my CAMERA AROUND. It feels like a bad 2000's game that has camera pans 'YOU GOTTA GET THIS TARGET""

But i feel for anyone who has to redo the whole save game and has to suffer though HOURS of tutorial.
Maybe its done this way so you go over the 2 hour refund time, and can't get your money back when you get to the actual game and its terrible.


Unit Selecting is tiresome and forces too many Actions, no CTRL + 1 - 0 Binding of units to hotkeys. Causing endless moving camera back and forth between units to actually place them. 
Oh my god the camera even has a delay and you fight against the inertia to have an actual fast action per minute..
There is also no mini map to click and move between parts of the map, making even harder to play properly.
There is a way point option but they ignore it half of the time if you manage to do actually the properly set it up, they ignore it halfway and just sit around while the other half does something...
And then its horribly bad when you are trying to set a route, then set way they should line up and you end up making a cross as you try to get it working and have to start all over as you did too many useless way points.. UGH!

When a enemy is routed, they run and scatter and even if you click on the right hand portion, they just go all run after 1 unit on the far left... Wtf is that path finding and priority.
And due the lack you can't hotkey units, i end up having half of them somehow forgotten in some forest till i zoom out enough.. Cause there is no dam mini map to tell you.
Bad Camera Controls, there more meant for an Editor than a RTS. Horrible lag by switching between map and tactical view, by forcing repeated scrolling (20 sec) to switch.
Why do they let you scatter the enemy, i want to kill them all, this just seems horrible to leave some alive, as technically they could rally later against you again. What flawed logic in this.

It seems like this whole game is written and balanced around the top down tactical view. Which is Incredibly boring.
Yet you miss out on the End Battle button in the Overview Mode that's actually more overview than crappy sideways 3D camera that has not enough fov for a proper overview and no proper movement.. And i spend 5 minutes figuring out wtf going on when i routed them all, oh boy is it booing...,oh wait i am in the overview camera.. and it hid the dam End Battle Button...

Overall it seems like its geared towards Players who never had an Actual Proper RTS. 
Or i am just too old and used to Warzone 2100 and Conquest Frontier Wars or even the so beloved starcraft.
Even settlers 3 did it better.
Overall it feels like it wants to be RTS but also wants to be addicting like Mount and Blade, Bannerlord.

I would quit and throw a Physical copy out the window, shatter the CD by accident and never play it again as it had 'Insert CD to play' if it was really a 2000's game :P
I guess this is what you call RTS Lite with Addictive Elements so you keep playing and playing..",1656893941,1668869231,False,2,1,0.46492418646812439,3,True,False,False

Total War 2 has finally the story campaign we desperately needed, but that story is just another generic warhammer story where some things could've changed the setting and then revealed that it's not the case. Not a spoiler, but finishing the story is part of the campaign since you're technically raced againts other faction which isn't a desperate race. You could even say that the whole racing thing isn't a race since you keep having opportunity to catch up with ease. Even if you finally finish the race, the reward is rather ok and not that fulfilling.

In the base game, you'll play 3 factions like the Nice Elf, Evil Elf, and Rat people. And they have their generic traits; Nice Elf is good at archery (ranged), Evil Elf is good at sword (melee), Rat people are good at number (quantity). These 3 races has few factions too and their interaction is as limited as their race. This means Nice people can only interact with nice people since why not.

Battle gameplay, it's good.

With all the existing DLC, you better get it in a bundle since its improve many aspect of the game. And get it in a sale since it's obviously wants you to get all the DLC for the best experience. Too bad the ending of the base game is just OK, so just get it on SALE.

But for what it provides in graphic quality and gameplay, it removes it in being particularly infested with glitches and bugs. And that's especially true with the multiplayer aspect. In solo mode, the game is fairly steady. But in multiplayer, expect *atrocious* loading times(in the area of 5 full minutes to load the game and another 5 minutes to load every multiplayer battle). In terms of glitches, this game has entirely frozen my PC multiple times to the point where only a hard PC shutdown would fix the issue. Along with numerous crashes along the way and the screen stuttering simply by moving the camera around the map. I am equipped with a Ryzen 7 5800X and AMD Radeon 6950 XT with 32 GB of Ram so hardware is not at fault here. I have tried to locate fixes to these issues and apply corrections to it but literally nothing works. 

EDIT: This game actually requires you to install it to an SSD for it to work correctly. Something that the developers should have added in the game requirements but haven't.

9/10 overall for the game but it gets a point off for not warning their clients about the importance of installing this game on an SSD.

EDIT #2: The multiplayer mode of this game is bugged and causing my entire PC to dead-lock after an hour of play or so. No fix exists despite this game being released 3 and a half years go. For this reason, I cannot recommend the game.

After 40 hours, I've uninstalled and it will remain uninstalled in my library till the end times. Its still amazing just how much the devs didn't playtest this game. One highlight was I was facing a Dark Elf lord, He Malus something, the legendary lord of Hag Graaf this was 35 turns in. He lost his entire army but wasn't routing. So I literally dunked all my high tier archer arrows onto him. After he lost about an eighth of health from like 7 or more volleys. He full healed, mind you this was the second time he used a full heal (or atleast a very powerful heal). So I used the rest of my arrows and he healed to full after that. So I dunked literally my entire army onto him. He kept getting stun locked so I suffered no casualties from the ensuing fight, but it took and I do not exaggerate. Atleast 10 minutes just to whittle him down, he had insane regeneration. For every 200 points of damage he took, he'd heal 100. 

Why the hell do Strategy game devs think that to make the game harder, the AI needs more cheats? Like come on, instead of making their AI smart and make good decisions to counter you. The devs just say, meh thats too much work and slap on a plus X amount of gold per turn, plus x amount of unit replenishment and x amount of attack and defence buffs. I'd rather get outsmarted by a foe than out-cheated. 

Old Review:

I had very, very high hopes for this game. I liked the factions, the map (before ME), the races, the beasts. But there are too many flaws to give this game a good review. 

                                                      NOT MODDABLE LIKE MEDIEVAL 2 TOTAL WAR
NO LOOSE FORMATION.
NO FORMATIONS AT ALL
-Before ME-
1. Extra army upkeep. This feature was horrible in Warhammer 1, and of course they had to keep it the same in this.
2. Diplomatic relations with certain factions while doing the rituals. It kinda makes no sense how the Lizardmen and the High elves can't team up considering that their goals are for the benefit of the world, or Dark elves and Skaven, since their goal is to use the Vortex for their own will.
3. Dragons and Hydras having cool downs on their breath attacks are just stupid. How can these mythical beasts have a cool down on breathing?
4. Intervention armies. so you pay 2000 for a crappy army to be destroyed 5 seconds later, pay 5000 for a somewhat good army but will be destroyed by the garrison or your last and final option, 10000 for an army of elites that a garrison stands a chance at winning. I found it idiotic how you can't decide where it can spawn, if i want it to be at a capital or a far flung island, makes it impossible for cordinating a double attack when your army spawns far away from the capital, but always the AI spawns at the capital.
5. Rituals requirements. At the first two rituals it took long to get the stuff, but later on it only took like 5-10 turns to unlock the next ritual.
7. Chaos armies during rituals. As i was playing as the High Elves i had major issues with the armies spawning out of nowhere as i start the ritual, its kinda hard to manage a war with the Dark elves, A war with Skaven and a war with the Lizardmen while five chaos armies and two skaven clans are torching ulthuan, and some people may say, get more armies scrub, but its impossible when you are losing 5k+ from extra army upkeep. And how Chaos armies always spawn in your weakest region.
8. How you can't dismount someone while they are riding a horse or chariot.
9. You think that in this that Eagles could soar through the skies and attack weak units like archers or artillery but no, they are very slow and are useless for running people down.
10. Spells, the spells were nice but there are far too many limitions for them, Teclis and Morathi are some of the best spellcasters there are and yet they have only a dozen spells.
11. Income, income was for the most part hard to raise for the high elves unless you have the Gold mines or gem cutters. The Entertainment building at tier 5 only produced 240 gold while the Industrey building at max produced 200 gold.
12. How few special settlements during battle there are, there are only a handfull of unique settlements, most of which are faction capitals. Attacking a faction capital was a suicide mission considering it would require atleast 2 full stacks of elites to attack it IF there is no army garrisoning it. While one really awful feature is when your capital is besieged your income just plumits by nearly 5k. I was playing High elves at 4 ritual so i started it and Dark elves sent a intervention army, it spawned and besieged me right away making my income which was 7k+ per turn go to a -1000 per turn which ruined all my garrisons and armies, right away i lost about a tenth of all my forces everywhere and that made it real easy for the Chaos forces to just steamroll me.
-After ME-
I had very high hopes for ME, because it would turn this game into a sandbox again, i wanted to play as the High Elves and just Fortify ulthuan and make it a fortress. Or play as the Dark Elves and Enslaved Bretonnia or the Dwarves. Then After it released i had the biggest disapointment of my life, bigger than COD Infinite Warfare.
1. Ulthuan lost multiple locations like Caladors Repose, The Glittering tower, Shrine of Lileath, Carin Thel, The Shadow peak and more. 
2. You could travel from the Cult of Pleasure's shore to Ulthuan in one or two turns.
3. Most of Naggaroth and Lustria was is gone.
4. Half of the New world is gone making it much more difficult for The Lizardmen, Order of Loremasters, Skaven, Vampire Coast and more smaller factions.
5. Half of the map below the Badlands (past the undead empires) are gone.

I have bought Medieval 2 total war, Rome 2, Attila and Warhammer 1. Warhammer 2 is better than Rome 2 and Attila but in comparison with Medieval 2 total war i would not put over 500+ hours into this because of how how little moddablity there is.

I had never touched anything else apart from some good single player games. Playing those FPS games every day really affected my mental as somedays were awesome, but most were exhausting as I played the same map over and over and got outplayed by or just outgunned by others. Finally, I decided it was time to stop.

I began scouring Steam for random games that I may like and then Warhammer 2 caught my eye, partly because it was on sale. I had never played a strategy game ever but for some reason, the screenshots of entire armies fighting each other seemed really cool to me. So, I began searching for some gameplay videos to see how it played and then I found this video by ""LegendofTotalWar"" from his ""Save your disaster battles"" series. It featured a doomstack (essentially, an extremely powerful army) commanded by ""Ikit Claw"" a character lord from the game. The moment the battle started; I was spell bounded! Thousands of rats throwing poison bombs, shooting lightning cannons, firing Gatling guns and throwing pink fire at the enemies and burning them off! Even as someone who knew nothing of the game, I quickly realized how overpowered that army was and how quickly it was eradicating the enemy! That video basically sealed the deal for me, and I purchased the game immediately!

But I still was absolutely clueless as to how to play the game. I quickly searched for LegendOfTotalWar but realized that he was a veteran player and further Reddit searches informed me that he is an extremely good player who discovers and uses ""cheese"" tactics a lot, which while amazing, take time and practice and weren't suitable for beginners. And thus began my journey of schooling to learn Warhammer 2 as I began with Zerkovich's ""You such at Total War"" which taught me a lot of basics, and then watching multiple full campaign gameplays by awesome people like ""Elven Plot Armor"", who explained everything they did and ""lionheartx10"", etc.

The game is pricey but its worth every penny (youre gonna wanna buy total war warhammer 1 and most of the dlcs) also be prepared to spend many many hours of enjoyment for the full experience.

Do that a couple of times and you win. Or you can clump them up in the same way and then shoot them with arrows and bolts or artillery. 

Basically, you slow the enemy down and then shoot or magic them to bits. Sometimes you have to take out their artillery, missile troops or heroes first. That's when the battles get more interesting. 

That's how you win Total War: Warhammer 2 battles. And when you win all the battles, you win the (total) war.

Lizardmen FTW

edit: After another six hours with the game, and coming from a background of RTS games (I was diamond in Starcraft II), the A.I. of unit control is simply too frustrating to allow me to enjoy this game.

Example: I would issue orders for my units to begin engaging in battle. Separate orders for each separate squad formation.  Of all the groups, it seems that half the time only 20-40% of the squad formation would fight, the other 60% would sit in the back and chill. Yes, even archers would do this for some reason.

I would then reissue orders for that single squad to attack the same group, or a different group, it doesn't seem to matter. Most units would continue to pick their noses and enjoy their meal in fruitful delight.

This also seems to happen at the same consistency (very high consistency sadly), even when the battle just started, leadership is high and the squad of units isn't shaken, startled, panicked or anything along those lines.

The game simply feels unplayable to me due to the lack of responsiveness of units.

To add pain to the suffering, this is nearly 10 Total War games later, after they've had plenty of time to make the units have half-decent A.I. (or at the very least, listen to the player's own damn orders for god's sake), and as such I cannot recommend Total War games, at least not if you prefer any sense of order or control in a battle.

Your mileage may vary, but holy crap is this frustrating to me as an RTS player. Which really sucks since the game is very cool thematically and aesthetically.",1580191862,1665469310,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Designed for high IQ players, the total war games are a refreshing unicorn, in an every dopamine quenching call of duty player and game base. 
Its an absolution perfection of a strategy game, with the ability to conduct and control incredibly fun real time battles if you wish, or just automatically resolve in a split second and continue your turn-based campaign. The turn based removes the stress, and allows complete focus on your empire, as well as giving the ability to dive in or out whenever.
Warhammer 2 release is the cherry on the top of the franchise, and one for simple reason. It leans into the magical theme and goes hard on it. So many factions to play as, so many unique abilities and features for each faction, makes each campaign decision or battle action special.

It is a time suck though, set a timer or you'll find you've wasted the day away.  All that said there are some pros and cons:

*The pros:*

Fun campaign and map.

Can play this same campaign from any point of view and faction you want.

It's very challenging. 

Lots of strategies to win.

Can play fun battles or just auto win or lose.

Can save your place.

*The cons:*

The only campaign.

After a while this same campaign and map will get boring and you'll be wondering why there isn't more to this game other than different factions.

The AI cheats, in fact this is deliberate laziness on part of the developers. The AI cheats non stop. For once I would love to find a WH style strategy game where the AI doesn't cheat on what is basically infinite moves, omnipotence and infinite resource mode. Once you realize it cheats it sucks ALL of the fun out of the game. Every time I come back to this game it's on some idealized wish where I forget this is the case, then quit out of frustration because I can't even win on normal mode. I long for a game where nobody is cheating. Instead I'm stuck with literally every game out there being grossly unfair to play.",1577413901,1664913571,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But it's buggy and needs balancing from what I've seen. After my 500+ hours I've barely bought any DLC. And I like the variety of approaches each faction and lord has. I've played around 5 Total War games, but there's just something amazingly shiny about Fantasy Warhammer Total War. It's well done. 

I should note. I do not play anything but Mortal Empires in this. Never even tried the other mode. Mortal Empires requires the purchase of Warhammer 1 as well as 2, It's a much bigger map that combines the 2 games in a more sandbox theme. 

Also, when Warhammer 3 gets better, It's worth noting that DLC purchased carries over to the new ""Immortal Empires"" epic massive entire world.... If I'm not mistaken. Feel free to comment and let me know.

The graphics are epic, with huge creatures dwarfing the humans and, well, Dwarfs, but good luck finding a point in the chaotic battles to be able to enjoy those visuals. 

The units are awesome, from dragons and cannons to ents to simple footsoldiers, but despite the uniqueness to them, it really comes down to which unit has more experience. The strategy is lacking. I've had shield units hold a line while weaker units run behind the enemy and attack...and I still lost. Meanwhile every battle turns into chaos as units rout and then return to battle time after time. There's a ridiculous amount of micromanaging in this one compared to other Total War games because the speed is so high. 

As for the campaign, it has a beautiful map and lots of cool features, but I personally find it to be almost too chaotic as well. It's hard to keep up with where your armies are and what your relations are with other factions because the map has so much going on. Edit: Additionally there's almost no time for peace, where you build your nation and prepare your armies for war. You'll constantly be at war from the start and allies do more harm than aid as they call you into their wars. Continuing the point of endless war, you'll be limited to two armies around turn 30 because you never get to build your economy. It's incredibly hard to fight a two front war with just two armies...and then you must factor in unhappiness in your towns that pops up at the drop of a pen. If an enemy is raiding, your town is unhappy. If corruption gets too high, the town is unhappy. Soon you have rebellions, adding MORE foes to fight with your two armies and weak economy. 

Maybe this is an unpopular opinion, but I recommend sticking with the Warhammer mod for Medieval 2.

Edit: Maybe I'm just a loser whining because I'm bad at the game, but this is my opinion and having added edits after an additional 20 hours of gameplay, I stand by it.",1642376290,1662767151,False,0,1,0.476190477609634399,2,True,False,False

This game costs a ridiculous amount of money to really get into and on top of that it's completely unfriendly to anyone trying to get into it. Selecting a starting ""race"" ""faction"" or even just the specific character is like playing slots at a casino, you could be alright but odds are you're just going to get absolute garbage. For some characters or even whole factions this is actually how it's supposed to be, to give players a challenge if they want to choose that but with no indication or warning for any of these you're just rolling a die and hoping you get a chance to even play the game to begin with.

On top of the previous flaws the advisor in the game is absolutely worthless. The advisor tries to tell you all about the backstory of the character you picked but doesn't say anything about what you should try doing to start or warning you from attacking the 1 single enemy they place right next to you because you're guaranteed to lose against that 1 single enemy despite anyone coming from literally anywhere thinking ""Well, they gave me 1 enemy to attack at the start, I guess I should attack it.""

I have basically the same army composition as my enemy but I always need 2 or 3 armies to be able to beat them, in battle or just auto resolving. I create a spearmen line but some guy comes with cavalry and all the soldies in the unit so flying like 30-50 meters and they all scatter. I can't use real tactics, and yes you may say: ""it is fantasy"" but I don't know, after 80+ hours combining both games, how to play, I don't know why I need so many armies to defeat another, or how the AI seems to just roll out full armies that destroy mine even on the easiest difficulty setting, I don't like the small and simple sieges, the battlefields where theres too much stuff happening, the units that pull ladders outta no where. Im ok with the fantasy setting, in fact I was super hyped for Warhammer I, but after that dissapointment, and then playing this game I can't recommend it, What happened to tactics in battles, to creating lines, yes adding huge units and monsters and magic will make that stop working, but it feels to me that Im just throwing everything in the middle and hoping they win, there is good fights now and then that feel propper Total War battles, yes. But most don't, a easy AI completely destroys me in the campaign, my army garrisoned in a walled city gets erased by 1 enemy army with similar army comp, then said army comes to fight me and again odds are in their favor, I try to fight the battle but theres no use since I too get destroyed. I feel the best technique is a massive melee and hope for the best. Sorry, I don't think is a bad game, is quite fun, but is not Total War, and is not something at least I can learn after 80+ hrs. I have a lot of experience in games like: Medieval II, Rome 1, Rome 2, Barbarian Invasion, Attila, Shogun 2, Empire, Napoleon. And yet im completely lost, as if I was playing against hardest AI. There is nothing I can do, im reasearching, using agents, checking unit stats and trying to figure out a good army comp and strategy, getting annoyed trying to keep my corruption or untainted levels, even an enemy with 1 city gets like 4, 5 armies and there is no way for me to beat them, I have a fortified province capital with a 95% strenght full army and it gets erased by 1 enemy army, then the main army also gets erased in the next turn by the same enemy army. Im not complaining the game is hard, but if im struggling so bad even on the easiest setting, with stuff than in any other TW game would allow me to have an easy time exploring and learning the game, then the fun goes out, Im trying to immerse myself in the world of fantasy that has been delivered here and I can't because of basic gameplay stuff. I wish this was more like Rome 2. I can't describe more my feelings but I try to like this game, and I kinda do, but I can't recommend it for a Total War fan, and maybe for someone new the fantasy element attracts them, fine, good luck trying to figure out how this works.

The economy side of things can feel a bit shallow, more so than the other games depending on what race you choose to play. That said, I really don't think it takes away from the game and is fairly enjoyable in its own right.
 For a game series called Total War it should come as no surprise that the battles are the main highlight of the game. All the races feel unique and play pretty well given the long series of updates. Everything feels pretty solid on a balance front in my opinion but given the nature of the game having a wide variety of races with their own specific niche, there are some matchups that just feel pretty one-sided: i.e. Wood Elves vs. Dwarfs.
There can be a bit of a barrier of entry given the amount of content and dlc on offer, but it doesn't feel like a Paradox game where you are almost punished if you don't have the dlc, the game still plays perfectly fine all on its own. Also in my experience I found this game, and the Total War: Warhammer series as a whole, to be the easiest of the Total War games to just pick up and play without any real experience.

Overall I would give it a 9/10, with the only issue being some minor technical bugs and balance issues.",1661932490,1661932490,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

All in all, this game is apparently just a very expensive DLC, which also has its own DLC.  No doubt they'd give the DLC of the DLC some of its own extra DLC if they thought they could wring a little more money out of you.

Still, the base game is okay enough if you don't mind being constantly reminded of all the extra stuff they want you to buy.  I wouldn't recommend it if you just want to pay a normal price for a full game without getting sucked into a money pit a bit at a time.

I was cautious about buying it because it's price is $60 even though it came out in 2017 according to steam. I feared I was dealing with a greedy company that cares only for the profit rather than the quality of their game. In this regard I was half-right.

+ The game it self is fun. I enjoyed the vortex campaign and it definitely has replayability. My first completion of the campaign was as nagarythe which is supposedly one of the harder high elf factions to play because of its starting location. But I like ninja/assassin style classes so I went with that. The ambush mechanic is soooo fun! 

+ There is a bit of a learning in the form that you have to learn what each unit type does. Most of the units have counters, so you should take the time to learn what counters what and what makes for a good team composition. You don't want to be filling your team with just pure 20 units of shock cavalry like i did in my first playthrough, thinking you are gonna dominate in an epic showdown like Rohan did at Gondor in LoTR. You will get obliterated. I like the balance of knowledge you need to obtain in this game. Learning how to play wasn't too much of a head ache. I had to watch a few youtube videos explaining the units and good strategies but other than that I was able to learn everything I needed to know to win my first campaign(on easy lmao).

+ The music in this game is great. The tracks in-battle makes the battles feel really epic. Good job to the composer(s)!

+ I was worried about the city-building aspect of the game. I am use to city-builder games like civ6 and Humankind. In these games the emphasis is less on the battles and more on the cities up bringing. So I was worried the lack of city interaction would reduce my overall enjoyment of the game. But it didn't. You can raze cities to the ground and build ruins into cities and you can also customize them to have certain districts based on your needs. But it wasn't on the level of customization of the games I mentioned. However, this is fine because the focus point seemed to be the battles and the vortex anyways. Everything I was expecting to be able to do with my cities but could not do, was disappointing but acceptable because of the epic battles. Infact, I found the city management to be in the way at times. Many times I did not want to devote any time to my cities but instead just focus on the vortex and wiping out them filthy druchii and skaven neighboring me.

- For what the game offers, I really enjoyed it. But I can honestly say it is absolutely not worth $60. I would reason $40 at the max. After you complete the campaign, there is really not much to do after that except do the campaign again on a different faction. You can do multiplayer but given the nature of the game, I didn't really care to try the multiplayer. There is also the immortal empires, but you can't play it unless you own the previous TW:W game. So basically, the meat and potatoes of the game is infact the campaign.

- As I just mentioned, the game kind of lacks content. The campaign is fun, but not nearly enough for the price tag of $60. This can be countered with the Immortal Empires campaign, but you can't even play it unless you own the previous TW:W game. I find this to be absurdly unfair considering you have to pay the initial price of $60 to even play TW:W2. But to make it even more absurd, to play the Immortal Empires you have to basically pay another $60 to buy TW:W1. There are many who will argue ""Just buy the bundle on discount"". But if these people can not understand the error in that mentality, I'm not even going to bother explaining it. Simply put: I feel it is greedy and unreasonable to ask me to pay basically $120 plus tax, to play a simple campaign mode that is already present in your game but locked behind a paywall that is only unlocked after forcing the player to buy the previous installment of the franchise. And no, I'm not going to wait until the bundle goes on sale. Many people - myself included - have no idea about this before they buy. How many people fell into the trap of waiting for Warhammer 2 to go on sale to buy it alone. And after they buy, they realize the unfortunate truth that is: You shouldn't buy warhammer or warhammer 2 individually, even on sale. You should buy them both as a bundle on sale. And I guarantee they are doing warhammer 3 like this. Locked content only unlockable by buying warhammer 2. And just like me, people will have no idea to buy it all as a bundle and not individually.

How can they know to do this? Do your research? Did you? If so, good for you! But personally, I'm not going to scour the web searching about whether or not I should buy warhammer 1 to get my moneys worth out of warhammer 2. That's absurd.  Why would I waste my time doing research about something like this? That is unreasonable to ask of me. If people can't understand how much of a cash grab this is, that is there problem. This is clearly a scheme for the publishers to bait people into giving them double the money for a game that shouldn't even be worth its initial price tag. i would actually support it by buying Immortal Empires as a dlc. I wouldn't mind giving the company $10 or even $15 bucks to play Immortal Empires. But no, they want me to give them a whole $60 to play immortal Empires. F--- that...I don't want to buy warhammer 1 because I don't want to play warhammer 1. I wanted to play warhammer 2 that is why I bought warhammer 2. I am NOT going to buy a game that I have no desire to play, just to be able to FULLY play the game I DID want to play. That is complete bs...


- The campaign itself was lengthy. But I found a lot of the time required to complete the campaign was forced from me by the game. There is a term for this, I believe it is Artificial Game Lengthening(?). Your mission is to basically gain control of the vortexs power. You achieve this by gathering these magic fragment things to perform rituals. This is the first example of the game forcing you to put ""extra"" time into it. Basically, you can't do those rituals until after you acquire enough of those magic fragment things. You acquire them passively every new turn. You can speed up the generation by capturing settlements that have them in abundance. But no matter what you do, you basically have to sit there and wait turn after turn until you have enough required to do the ritual. After you acquire enough of those magic fragment things and begin the ritual, you now have to wait for the ritual to complete. This is the second example of the game forcing play time out of you. Each of the rituals require a rediculus amount of turns before they complete. And you basically just have to sit there and wait turn after turn until they do. After that, you rinse and repeat the process: Wait until you gain enough fragments > wait until ritual is done > repeat. I truly hate mechanics like this. This artifical game lengthening crap always leaves a bad taste in my mouth. 

---Final thoughts---

Overall I enjoyed my experiences in the game. The campaign was really fun and it made me actually care about warhammer lore. I don't know much about it but after playing the vortex campaign, I found myself watching lore videos on youtube. It is all quite interesting to me. So yes, the game is good. But imo no, its not worth $60. If you are one of the unlucky ones like me(you took the logical approach of choosing which warhammer game you want to play, waited for it to go on sale before you buy and then finally bought it), then I am deeply sorry for you. Sometimes its difficult to avoid cash grabs that are oh-so-subtle, like this. I recommend the game, but ONLY when its ON SALE and ONLY as a BUNDLE.

And to all of those who have no yet fallen into this trap but may in the future: 

DO NOT BUY ANY OF THE WARHAMMER GAMES INDIVIDUALLY EVEN ON SALE! WAIT FOR A BUNDLE SALE OF AT LEAST 75% OFF!

I don't know how many countless of hours I've spent trying to complete one campaign because oh my god one campaign takes FOREVER to complete, all because the objectives are sometimes quite absurd (in mortal empires at least).

But even with the long ass campaigns, there's just something really appealing to the game that makes me replay the game over and over, and that is the HUGE roster of factions you can play as. With different legendary lords that has specific play style, you can legit make an army that will greatly benefit you on how your Legendary Lord plays. I was also a big fan of Warhammer 40k, so apart from the DoW series, this is the closest I can get to a grand strategy version of Warhammer universe(on fantasy at least).

All in all, if I have to rate the game base on my opinion:

Story wise: 8/10 - If you like Warhammer fantasy novels, then you'll feel right at home here.(for Vortex campaign story at least. cuz Mortal empires is just sandbox, so no story there)

Gameplay wise: 7/10 - Vortex campaign is complete doo doo shit because of the campaign mechanics that force you to have a race with other factions that becomes absurdly difficult especially in harder difficulties, But thank god for Mortal empires saving this game. I'm gonna give it a solid 7/10(could've been lower if it wasn't for Mortal Empires saving it though)

Map design(for mortal empires): 8/10 - I'm glad CA really followed the designated faction's true map locations base on the faction's lore and all, but holy hell the map design and positioning is just awesome.

Price tag: 2/10 - I'll be real blunt here, nobody buys this game for Vortex campaign, most people play this for the multiplayer and the oh so good Mortal Empires. And with it's price being 60 bucks, you'll need another 60 bucks to buy the original Total War Warhammer 1 just to unlock Mortal Empires and the other races to be playable in multiplayer and all. So if you're in a tight money problem, I would NOT recommend you get this game unless you're 100% sure you're okay with spending large on this game. Because apart from needing the first Warhammer game, they still have DLCs to unlock certain factions and stuff. So all in all its quite pricey. And with Warhammer 3 Immortal Empires just released, the price of this game should drop if I have to be honest.

Replayablility: Very High -  All thanks to the HUGE roster of factions/races with lots of different Legendary lords with certain play styles, you get very high replay value on this game, even though one campaign can  take you HOURS just to complete it.

All in all a really good game; especially for a Warhammer fan like me.",1661513652,1661516932,True,1,0,0.527559041976928711,0,True,False,False

I think that Total War is a fantastic series and that Warhammer II is the best of it [EDIT: With Immortal Empires in Warhammer III, I now believe WHII has been usurped]. As my hours would suggest I have spent quite a bit of time on the game and will likely spend just as much (if not more) on the third game once Immortal Empires drops. With that said, I can not recommend this game for its price-tag. If it was a single 60 dollar purchase I would still question its price-tag given the third game has released, however 60 dollars is not what you will be spending to enjoy this title. Very few players play this game solely for the Vortex campaign and factions, most play this game for the multiplayer battles and, more importantly, the Immortal Empires campaign. You do not get the further with this purchase. If you plan on buying this game on Steam and also wish to play Immortal Empires, you must pay an ADDITIONAL 60 dollars for the original Total War: Warhammer game, bringing the price-tag up to 120 dollars. But even if you spend THAT amount, there is still a large amount of money a player can expect to spend to access all of the content within this title. 

I can not wholeheartedly recommend this game to any new players as the expense-to-access cost is ludicrous. I will continue to play these titles because of the amazing content the developers put out, but it is the company's horrendous business model that earns my downvote.",1660119298,1661489241,False,233,13,0.758650600910186768,63,True,False,False

I've really wanted to enjoy this game!  I really did!  But the egregious R-P-S syndrom, cheating AI, and little room for experimentation, with fresh eyes this game doesn't really have much fun factor once you can see past the eye-popping visuals and well constructed GUI.
Against a CAI opponent, there seems to be one thing that is hammered into your play, run after run.  Stay alive long enough to snowball and then win.  That includes the Mortal Empires campaign.  This is easier to do depending on the faction leader's start condition.  Starting areas that are wide open and easy to navigate have an advantage over areas that have 3 or less paths to take.  Seafaring empires take the cake on this one, no surprise.
Starting conditions are also dictated by the other empires you START OUT at war with.  The Empire has one of the strongest starts but also one of the weakest in this regard.  
If you can get past the initial hurdle, that's just the start.  If the game decides to kill you, it just will.  If you choose an aggressive faction, the AI will try to slow you down by fighting you en masse, usually effectively.  If you have a defensive faction, the AI will try to bore you to death by micromanagement.  If you try to blend the two styles, you might have more fun, but it can vary from game to game.
For whatever excuse I might come up with, I didn't have much fun playing TWW2.  From hyper-aggressive AI, to constant micro-management headaches, the game got stale for me.  It won't be like that for everyone, and I already know I'm in the minority here.  But I really do like TW games.  TWR2 is my most played game in my library to this day!

Its greatest deviation from other Total War games comes in the inherent asymmetric experience found in utilizing different factions. I enjoyed this because many other Total War games quickly became stale after a few campaigns, as most factions are so structurally similar.  The asymmetric gameplay may not appeal to everyone, as there are some drawbacks with balancing issues that can always emerge, especially in the PVP meta.

It brings Total war to a whole new level of strategy and replayability. Add to that the huge amount of mods and you have the biggest opus of the TW series. Some mods add more content than official DLCs...

Now after saying this, keep in mind that if you just buy the base game itself for 60€, you will have to spend 223€ more to unlock the game fully (you need all TWW2 DLCs + TWW1 Base Game + All TWW1 DLCs). Yes a few DLCs will add some cool content like new gameplay mechanics. But their main purpose is just to make playeable the factions and races that were already present in the base game !!!!!!!!!

But like they handle the DLC makes me angry. So far i didnt had problems with DLCs. If they release a Peck.. i mean Dwarf DLC i just didnt buy it because i never play Pecks. 

But right now i played the Lizardman Campaign and seen something.. im not sure.. is it funny, brazen, idiotic or sad? 
Lizardman have a building you can build for 3700 gold that does nothing. Really nothing.. its just there. no positive or negative effect. If you dont have a DLC for it. 

Its ok that DLC has content you dont get if you dont buy the DLC.. but insert a Building that doesnt do anything without the DLC? Is it an advertising poster? Or just bad Programing? 
The building should be part of the DLC like the units of that building. It has nothing to do in the main Game. I really feel fooled about it. 

Another Point i dislike is that they make DLCs in doublepacks. They make 2 Races in 1 DLC. So if you like Skaven but dont like Lizard (as an examble) you have to buy if and get an Helf DLC you want and an half DLC you didnt want. 50% money waste in my eyes. 

Well all in all the Game is still good and worth playing. You can see by the Time i played it. 
I just wish that the People who hold the strings of this game in thier hands would be a bit more sensible. Care a bit more how the Game looks for people who take a closer look. Offer DLC packs in a Sale once a year would make alot people happy. And to be Honest. I can understand why some people Pirate this Product. If you want eh full Game you have to give you firstborn child and your soul! ;)

My favorite game of all times is Warhammer: Dark Omen, a 24 year old precursor to the series as well as the proto-game for the genre as a whole. But somehow the studio behind this new iteration makes us suffer again from the same problems that Shogun always had, just on a 10x scale. It's boring, repetitive, bloated and pointless. Everything that was good about Dark Omen is gone here. 

Storyline that makes no sense and was added as an afterthought. A ton of stuff that doesn't change your core mechanic but adds more work you need to do. Crazy grind to get to new armies (unlike in DO where you simply gain new troops as you go - and btw you always had just one troop of each type and it really made it feel unique and also personal). Completely visually unreadable units. It feels like it simply was made with no love. Basically both mechanics - battling and city development are just tiresome, repetitive and not fun.

Maybe this is all done this bloated way so you can sell games for $60. But if you'd just create a super slick polished one with much less bloat and clearer progression and narration, even if you could sell it for $30, you'd still make more players happy and make more money?

To me this is similar to new Baldur's Gate, having the same problems and just being totally overloaded comparing to the old game. Bloated, no fun, overcomplicated, uninteresting story. Why is it hard to simply do what was done before, but with modern tools?

Do yourself a favor. Find Warhammer: Dark Omen (it may be hard to make it run on your PC) and give it a try.

For everybody involved. Study Dark Omen and stop bloating your games!",1659818667,1659818960,False,0,1,0.432154715061187744,0,True,False,False

Warhammer keeps doing what it does best, giving you a LOT of room for an insane elf, lizard, different elf, rat, and vampire battles with some (not so) friendly pirates thrown in for good measure.
lord skills now apply unique bonuses to gold tier units so you actaulyl have a reason to keep our vets alive and well to make use of those insane powerups.
also, quite a lot of small QoL changed from the first version, subtle UI tweaks, and a better organized pretty much heverything.
a lot of units got new, more fitting passive effects and changes to the combat ability accordingly, the game feels much more balanced and nuanced than before.

This can be pretty much game breaking at times and makes battles that require any micro at all (i.e. cavalry charges, skirmishing) frustrating at best, rage inducing at worst.

Why this issue hasn't been fixed yet, I don't know. It's a very common complaint and only half assed solutions have been offered in the form of disabling a few default options to limited effect.

In addition, units lose their shape and cohesion very quickly, and cannot pull back to reform due to them ""gluing"" to the enemy, and this is compounded by the previous point. There is little tactics in play here; It is just a moshpit with hundreds of units.

Instead, not only did they go with one of the better established fantasy settings out there in Warhammer Fantasy, they have really done their utmost to be faithful to the extensive lore put out by Games Workshop. Every faction's style of play is unique, and (most of the time) the lords themselves have their own special strategies and identities. At it's best, WH II feels like an excellent turn-based strategy game AND a great story-driven role-playing game.

The large number of factions/lords means that the most popular and latest ones tend to be less challenging and more enjoyable, while others languish. Factions like Warriors of Chaos and Norsca, who were once the ""new hotness"" when they were DLC for the first game, are now so ""old and busted"" it's a common joke among the community. However, the ""fun"" factions all have multiple lords, so there is still a great deal of replay-ability. 

Another issue is the inherent macro scale of the game. For all its rich flavor, at its essence, this is a strategy game, one in which you probably end up simulating most battles. That means you spend the majority of your time staring at a large map of a fantasy world, which is cool, but you often wish the game would embrace its RPG elements and narrow the focus of the game. Instead, CA has done the exact opposite, blowing up the map from the Old World to include the Warhammer Fantasy equivalent of the New World. WH III, the newest installment, blows up the map even bigger to include the setting's Asia analogue, something the original material didn't ever really do. The end result is a staggering number of factions and lords whose concepts and mechanics inevitably are bland, broken, or just bad. There is a tendency in games that ""more content is always good content,"" but the WH series proves that, even with an excellent AAA game, that's not always true.

Instead of locking themselves into producing three different games and spreading themselves thin on flavor (which we are seeing now with WH III and Chaos), it would have been better if CA had stopped with WH II and spent its time perfecting what works and improving what doesn't with the various factions. Some of the even more RPG-ish stuff in WH III, like the customization of Daemon Prince lords, could have been incorporated into a new and improved Warriors of Chaos faction--which, even if it isn't popular to play is, is meant to be THE end-game force in Old World games. Presently, I'm far more worried about undead or greenskin doomstacks than I am about the armies of the dude literally chosen by the Dark Gods to usher in the end of the world.

Still, the merits of this game far outweigh the flaws. If you enjoy turn-based strategy games period, get this game. If you enjoy turn-based strategy and high fantasy, I can't believe you haven't bought this game yet.",1659297910,1659297910,True,1,0,0.51754385232925415,0,True,False,False

In order to take advantage of this game fully it's recommended you get the previous game and some of the DLC races, you plan on playing as.

This depends and you've likely already read a bit about the Warriors of Chaos DLC, they're expected to get a major facelift to come to the new immortal empires FLC in the next game.

I have created a mod list of about 677 mods with Kaedrin's Mod Manager.

So yeah, the game is highly fun and compatible and well worth the chance to get the other DLC you're curious about checking out. Might I suggest checking out The Prophet and the Warlock, the Queen and the Crone, The Warden and the Paunch, the Silence and the Fury, and finally the Shadow and the Blade.

If you are a fan of the sadly decommissioned Warhammer Fantasy and / or any of the older Total Wars, you should buy this thing immediately. Even without any of the DLCs, the fun is incessant and the possibilities endless.
Of course, the Mortal Empires campaign is the ""real deal"" - it expands the number of playable factions from 6 to 15 the map five times over. You need to own Warhammer I for that, but this is easily worth the investment.
Plus a veritable shipload of all possible mods - my guess is you could probably play this forever.
That said, some of the Lords / campaigns might feel underwhelming at first. If you are a member of Camp Volound and prefer the old school style of Total War battles (pre-Atilla), you will hate the battles, as they are considerably less tactical and more arcade-y compared to the older titles. If you are looking for that grimdark feel of tabletop Warhammer, you will be disappointed - it is watered down to the point of nonexistence. The color palette resembles My Little Pony more than Warhammer. If taken to the extreme (painting the map in glorious Reikland red, for example), the campaigns can get long, repetitive and sort of tedious, as you just curbstomp anything that comes your way without even trying and the hardest part is logistics (getting your doomstacks across the ultrahuge map).
Even so, this is a 9,5/10 for me. 
0,25 point down for the aforementioned cartoonization of a universe that could make you retch with grimdarkness in its original form - and this can be done right, too, looking at you, Mordheim.
0,25 down for sometimes falling prey to grind and repetition.

The higher the difficulty, the more the ai cheats. It doesn't get smarter, it doesn't get better in battle, it cheats. AND. I. HATE. THAT. While it is cheating, you are also taking penalties to things like leadership for your units, upkeep, diplomacy, etc.

For instance:

The higher the difficulty the more the upkeep costs.
You can control a whole province (2 - 4 settlements) and barely afford one army on hard with mostly garbage units, if you want to keep building up your settlements. Control two provinces and you can get some nice units in your army! GOOD LUCK DEFENDING THEM! The AI can control one SETTLEMENT and have 2 and a half armies along with the garrison (3 and a half total armies). Making it INCREDIBLY frustrating trying to finish off factions with your single army. Because if you manage to corner a faction into one settlement they will sit and turtle on their last settlement until you get lightning strike or ambush them.

The AI has more movement points than you can possibly spec into. Unless you are Vlad Von Carstein. The AI regularly ignores your army and sprints through your lands raiding and razing to their hearts content because guess what? YOU WONT BE ABLE TO CATCH THEM. Your jaw will drop at the amount the AI can move and do in a single turn. THERE IS NO OUTRUNNING THEM.

The AI WILL NOT attack you unless they have overwhelming numbers. When they catch you there is little you can do. Now the devs recognize this so they put a skill in the game called lightning strike, that is a must have and only works when you attack. It allows you to ignore the enemy reinforcements and attack one enemy army 1v1 (very realistic btw this happens a lot in war). Nevermind that after the battle your units will be diminished and their reinforcements will attack you next turn, destroying you anyway because they can afford ridiculous numbers. BUT LIGHTNING STRIKE!!! In a game called total WAR: WARhammer, the AI does everything it can to avoid actually fighting you with one army. You must trick it with ambush to fight.

Most cities on water have mandatory ports and only the major port cities offer the entire port building chain, so if you have a minor port city, the port takes up a building slot and you can't build it up all the way and its AWKARD, especially since you can't recruit anything with them! And there are a lot of cities on water.

There are no navies in the game with the exception of the dark elves who will completely control the sea. If you want to cross over water your army becomes a ship when you move it over water, despite there being a million port cities, you can't build any ships with them. So you can't blockade any ports or trade routs because water is only meant for traveling. There are ship battles now, but they happen on land ? lol.

There are no unit formations. No wedges, testudos, phalanxes, shield walls, or loose unit formations to take less artillary/arrow damage. The battles are: whoever controls the flanks with their boxes of units wins. AND. ITS. BORING. Boxes of units going against other boxes of units. And unit stats? They don't matter, what matters is their traits like anti infantry, anti large, armor piercing, etc. rock. paper. scissors.

Regardless of difficulty the AI does not have fog of war. They can see everything you are doing. Want to send a fleet across the ocean and surprise attack the elves? They'll be waiting for you. RUINS. THE. FUN. If you take one wrong step because you can't see the enemy armies while they can see yours, you will be surrounded and deleted.

Diplomacy = everyone hates your guts. The AI can confederate twice in the first 10 turns (absorb other factions of the same race that requires the player to have almost impossibly high diplomatic relations) meanwhile you will get laughed at asking for mutually beneficial trade deals by factions of your own race because of diplomatic penalties called aversion, and great power that you have for NO REASON. 

The best part about diplomacy is when a faction across the world declares war on you and sends all their armies your way. I've had factions completely ignore their own defense to zerg me, another faction would be attacking and absorbing them on one side while they were sending all their resources at me, despite the fact that i had done nothing to provoke them in the first place. DUMB.

The AI has zero problems with public order. They can be in a settlement with an inhospitable climate, with me raiding them and they still, will have no issue with public order. Meanwhile I have to use precious building slots on buildings that only maintain public order. expect to use 1 - 2 each province TO BREAK EVEN in public order. Anything that happens (enemy/neutral army trespassing/ enemy heroes trespassing/ corruption goes up because the beastmen are on your continent(?) expect a rebellion shortly. The only time i see rebellions for the ai are from vampiric, chaotic, and skaven corruption. As you can imagine the AI can spread like wildfire with confederations and no public order problems while you could not possibly dream of doing so ( i wouldn't want to do it that way, I want things to be equal).

Units now have health bars! I almost did not buy this game because of this alone. But there is an option to make them invisible so it looks like the old games.

Sieges. After turn 50 the game becomes a non stop siege fest that is tedious and boring because the AI only runs from your army and turtles in their settlements. Every siege battle feels exactly the same, copied and pasted but with different colors and themes. The city towers have unlimited range, insane firing rate and will single handedly destroy your army if you don't charge the city the second you press start battle. Why would my army set up under enemy tower range to begin with? And when attacking units rout in a siege they RUN INTO THE CITY instead of out. LOL. The AI can recruit units WHILE sieging you, you know that 12 stack rebellion sieging one of your walled settlements you're not worried about? It will magically turn into a 20 stack in two turns despite the fact that there is no indication that they are RECRUITING WHILE SIEGING in their unit status flag.

The best things about this game are the large units and heroes but they manage to mess up heroes too.

Legendary Lords (LLs) that don't have mounts will lose to the weakest LLs that do have mounts. EVEN if you spec into buffing the hell out of your LL. GRIMGOR IRONHIDE the biggest, baddest orc ever, can't kill a horse? really? He's bigger than the fucking thing. but he gets knocked around like a soccer ball, and all you can do is facepalm.

Auto Resolve is a laughing stock, seriously, google it. You can have high end armies lose to basic units because one unit of enemy peasant archers gets 300+ kills while another gets 200+ kills and so on. Then you fight the battle, because quicksave and those same archers will get 7 and 15 kills. it's a complete joke and forces you to fight easily winnable battles or else have random units in your armies wiped which gets tedious FAST.

Reinforcements seem to spawn in wherever they feel like, with no rhyme or reason, despite being strategically placed on the campaign map, don't ever expect to rely on them being consistent.

Multiplayer has also played a big role in ruining the fun of this game, anytime they release something fun to play with, all 5 people in the multiplayer community complain about it being op and they nerf it for the rest of us. This is meant to be a single player game and should be prioritized as such.

It's. Not. Fun. So I can't recommend this game. It costs WAY too much money to have so many things wrong with it.",1518530178,1658836421,False,753,70,0.785731136798858643,87,True,False,False

Yes, it is expensive in extra DLC but that's what kept the game alive. Yes, if you played the original Warhammer, the power creep of the new races might be a bit extra and make the already super complex gameplay even more complicated. However, there is enough content for at least 2000 hours of gameplay. I played 4 factions through and through and I'm just at 500 hours.

I had to spend more than 100 hrs to get used to how important heroes and generals were, taking into consideration that you can use them both in and out of combat and that in combat are close to Godlike creatures, unlike the previous titles were your general would just die. I finally completed the game with Bretonia no less, and fell in love with the game.

Diplomacy is basic, still the fact that you can coordinate with the AI is something interesting, especially if the AI responds... Unfortunately enemy AI is way better in recruiting units than your ally counterparts. I found the AI on many occasions stacking units well tailored against me, so I had to keep diverse (preety tough with Bretonia but still...)

Unlike previous titles where you had to win the game in like 120 - 150 rounds, since Rome 2 there is no definite point in time to win the game. You get objectives, certain global or race events and you have all the time in the world to build and expand. Of course this is easier said than done, enemy AI throws at you stacks after stacks with very little regard to upkeep costs, so you need to play smart. Use your Hero to assasinate enemy army specialist heroes while at the same time use another agent to slow the enemy army down giving you more rounds available to weed out enemy heroes and bring the enemy army to it's knees. Or if the enemy army is suffering attrition in your territory, dont engage it, delay it, slow it down, let it suck up on that attrition damage for a few rounds while you continue building etc and when you feel ready attack the enemy weakened force with lower casualties on your part! Facing of a melee specialist in combat could cost you tens of units and even a hero, when dealing with him in the campaign map mode only costs money which are fairly easy to gather! Be smart!

There are so many races to play that use different set of tactics and their units are variantly different in strengths and weakness that there is a great deal of replayablity. For instance I finished the Mortal Empires campaign (which is the main campaign) and started the Eye of Nexus I think? A ""side"" campaign where you get to chose from certain races and each one has each own unique questline to complete. My first was completed with Bretonia, now I am trying Dwarves and the list goes on....

Graphics are good, and at some points you are gonna get your Visual Card and RAM stuffed up their neck thanks to the AoE effects of spells, Siege equipment of flying monsters breathing fire!

When I went into combat I had to think on a scale of two dimensions now, what do i have to deal with in the Ground and What do i do against air targets! Incredible change of dynamic!

I can't recommend enough this game, despite of it's pricing etc which I agree it feels utterly ridiculous to have to pay so much money just to have a race available to you... The campaigns are ok, new maps, new events, special campaign units, more lore, sure I can pay for that, but for a race already included in the games code simply to pay extra 10 - 20 euro in order to just be able to play as Wood Elves or Nordlings?/?? Come oooon... 

Wait for 50% + discount and buy it... Oh yes,... You need to buy the Warhammer I game first, buy the races you want from Warhammer I game and THEN buy Warhammer II which balances out and improoves almost every single race in the game.... Yes I know terrible pricing and milking... You buy the first game for it's races,. ignore entirely the title and go for the Warhammer II...

Enjoy.,..",1658244322,1658244322,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In short - the game is great. Especially with the right overhaul mods, but I recommend playing through some in vanilla first. I'm not a fan of the base ""Vortex"" campaign but the combined Immortal Empires campaign map with the factions from both WH1 and WH2 is fantastic. The only real flaw in this game is that the AI occasionally can fail in specific scenarios - such as in siege battles - but it isn't that bad unless you actively try to exploit it. I prefer playing Head to Head multiplayer anyway with a friend of mine, where he can fight battles as the AI opponents, and that works around the issue. I'll be grabbing WH3 once they release the combined map for that game and it has had some time to get polished, as all of the Total War games in recent years have been quite unpolished (as well as lacking in good mods) close to release.

Original Review: 

Where to start...

As of this time, I have played around 26 hours of Total War: Warhammer II. In 26 hours I have played all factions within the game at least a decent amount, and have gotten familiar enough with the game mechanics to feel confident in writing this review. 

For those of you who are new to the Total War series of games, Total War: Warhammer II is a game based around two things. The first thing it is based around is a turn-based strategy element, where you build armies, conquer cities, maintain an economy, and fight wars with other factions on a world map. The second thing it is based around are real-time battles, and it is in these battles where the love that many people have for the game truly begins to shine.

You control large numbers of units in formations, and use these units in order to fight your enemies. You have infantry of all sorts to choose from, from spearmen to swordsmen to monstrous beasts which rampage among the enemy lines. You have archers, slingers, javelin-wielding maniacs, and more to wear your enemy down from afar. You have giant solar-beam cannons strapped to the back of dinosaurs, warp-lightning cannons, catapults, ballista, and other things which you can use to wear down your foes from extreme distances. You have cavalry, monsters, flying beasts, as well as lords and heroes who can level up through experience and influence battles through direct combat might or through powerful magic and special abilities.

In Total War: Warhammer II, there are four main races to play as as of this writing. Other factions exist in the game (ported from the first game) as minor factions which you can wage war with, but they are not playable as of right now.

You can play as either the sadistic dark elves, the haughty high elves, the fanatical lizardmen, or the scheming skaven (ratmen, essentially).

Each has its own unique roster of units and specific racial mechanics (which is reflected in gameplay both in the campaign map and in battles). Each faction also has two unique starting positions on the campaign map, which correspond to a unique faction leader (for a total of 8 starting positions). Depending on which faction you begin as, and the faction leader which you choose, your playstyle will be encouraged to be one way or the other in the campaign by the unique skills and bonuses your lord provides, as well as their geographical starting location.

Throughout the campaign, you fight battles with the other main factions in a battle to achieve the campaign objectives. In Warhammer II, you are expected to win through the Vortex campaign, which sees your faction gaining control over the great vortex - its purpose to siphon away the winds of magic that draw the forces of chaos to the world.

This requires you to perform rituals after obtaining enough of a certain in-game currency produced in certain cities on the map, or by doing quests you may occasionally be assigned. While a ritual is being performed, the main enemy factions may send intervention armies to attempt to stop you by razing the small handful of cities in which the ritual is being done. Armies of chaos will appear on the map to stop you as well, destroying everything in their path on the way to their objectives.

Here is where the troubles begin. 

The game does not provide you with the economic means to maintain many armies in comparison to the territory that you can hold, so performing a ritual requires you to basically spend the 10 turns of the ritual camped and holding on for dear life in your important cities. You can spend money (as well as the AI) to send intervention armies towards enemy rituals, their quality dependant on the money you spend, but these armies are controlled by the game AI rather than by yourself, and appear in the middle of the enemy territory. 

Given the extreme size of the map, all four main factions may never end up fighting eachother during a typical game until near the very end, as well. Two of the major land-masses are inaccessible to the other two (which are connected) without traveling by sea, yet if you are caught on the sea by an enemy army, you can only rely on the game's often imbalanced auto-resolve to hope that your army is not immediately destroyed. 

The Vortex campaign is highly flawed for many reasons, primarily being the fact that the map is too large, the seas too vast, and the rituals too short for you to meaningfully fight against them without using the previously mentioned intervention AI armies. Additionally, you can win the campaign without even performing the rituals necessary by simply winning against the AI in a laughably easy final battle, knocking whoever performed that final ritual out of the race for good.

All of these concerns pale in comparison however to just how fun the core gameplay is. 

Fighting battles as any of the four factions in the game is a blast, and not long from now, those who own the first game will gain access to a combined campaign map (including the land masses and factions from both games), which will not include the broken Vortex campaign mechanics. The sheer fun of the game, and the knowledge that many problems I have can be fixed through mods and upcoming developer work, make me able to recommend this game quite readily.

However, know what you are getting yourself into. Watch some gameplay videos if you are unsure that you will enjoy the core gameplay; Youtube is filled with them. For all of my concerns about the Vortex campaign and general game pacing, these are minor concerns compared to just how fun it is to see your giant dinosaurs rampaging amount enemy soldiers, or seeing your Skaven hordes surround and massacre the enemy while magic flies across the battlefield, as all the while heroes and lords battle it out in the crossfire.

If you enjoy real time strategy games, this is probably the most fun that Total War has ever been. If you enjoy turn based strategy games, it can be fun, but the turn-based aspect of the game is not the main appeal of the game. As of right now as well, the workshop is not available for this game - so until it is, many mods that could improve the gameplay experience and allow you to tailor it are not ready.

I won't lie to you and promise you that this is the best game ever made, or that it is devoid of flaws, but there simply is no other game out there quite like Total War: Warhammer (I or II). It can definitely be worth the money, and then some, if the core gameplay is to your liking. I've enjoyed my time in Warhammer I and Warhammer II more than I have in any other Total War game to date, and for all of the problems the games may have, they are definitely worth giving a shot!",1507077471,1657582980,True,4,0,0.565073490142822266,0,True,False,False

You need to be in the good level in all categories to succeed (several lords, heroes, finances, updates in cities, communication with other parties, vortex spell making)
Can not deal with only 1 main lord and make him the best in the map. Yes you can try, but it will not bring victory. You need balanced teams and give battles (experience) to all of them. Need to be ready for raiding parties and chaos and other extra forces what will attack you in regular basis. This means you can not leave some flanks without defense. Or if you do you need to have forces able to defend the cities. Big work on developing city to level 4 or 5 can be destroyed in 1 move. These are the first impressions and in my opinion this game has huge depth and challenges what I like to overcome. Definitely recommend to try it out at least.

All the best,

So, as far as I went through it, I have somethings to say. The game may be unwelcoming for beginners is TW games, that was my case, each time my campaign ended into a defeat. I learned a lot, but by youtube videos, mostly M4f. Wrote notes when needed. Then I stepped-up, a lot. By the way this game has unclear tutorials. Just saying. But, this wee-end, I launched a high-elves campaign. And, god! I spent 18 hours since. The famous one more turn, you know. Lots of options, many different gameplays. Sea deep content. Didn't even scratched the surface. Now I understand why some people got thousands of hours in. This game will swallow every thing of your life. So, if you want to keep friends and family, work.

For example, I was playing on very hard as Eataine. It was really fun until I got control of the gates. Then for the rest of the game, the enemy AI just suicides their armies into my gates, and making the game far too easy.  I'm fighting against multiple factions which are stronger than me, but it doesn't matter because they just can't get enough of my gates. They walk past my cities which they could easily take but they just love those gates so much. I have this exact same problem with the empire forts. The AI will repeatedly attack the fort. Auto resolve says I will lose, but when manually fighting the fights are really easy. So I have to manually defend my forts/gates basically every second turn. This completely ruins the fun.

If you like epic fantasy battles and a lot of weird factions and unit variety you will like this.

[b]The Good[/b]

+ Huge scale in terms of the overworld map, number of factions and number of units possible in battles.
+ Tons of personality and variety in each faction and sub-faction. Many have their own specific UI features for research, units or buildings specific to them. Most of them still share the vortex campaign, but the differences are deep enough to make each play through feel different.
+ Even though the scale is huge the graphics when zoomed in during a battle look really good. Giant fireballs raining down on hundreds of units looks awesome.
+ Lots of cool extra factions to add in as DLC (many of which are Free DLC) so you should be able to find one you like. (Ikit Claw from Prophet & The Warlock is tons of fun!) Sadly, there's no way to try them out first before you buy, but you can face off against them in singleplayer campaigns to get an idea of what they do.

[b]The Bad[/b]

- While there is a help wiki built into the game it doesn't do a great job of explaining all the battle movement controls so I had to go on Youtube to figure them out.
- Installing the free DLC is really strange. You have to manually go and add each one (despite those characters/factions already showing up as opponents in the game), download from Steam while the game is running and then restart the game for them to activate. A few random ones also require you sign up for a Total War account, which is annoying but you can just skip those. I don't get why they don't just let you install the Free DLC from Steam or patch it into the base game like other games do for Free DLC. The paid for DLC works normally with it being added directly from Steam.
- While the customized UIs for each faction are really good in general, there are some awkward UI issues where things don't do what they say they do. For example, there's a ""Rite of Summoning"" to ""summon"" a Slann as Lizardmen, but when you click it nothing appears to happen despite saying the ritual is done. What it actually does it add that Slann to the Lords list where you can recruit them like any other Lord but the UI doesn't say anything about that and makes it sound like they should just appear. There's a couple things like that randomly throughout the game that are annoying when you run into them.",1657143570,1657143592,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's not bad, but CA has already shown they are capable of making it much better. Again, in my opinion. And the last thing to say, the DLC policy. I know a lot of people complain about it, but I find it fine since every DLC is worth the money, though if you look at the later DLCs it is clear that CA has listened to the community and greatly improved it. Look at the Warden and the Paunch compared to the Queen and the Crone, Grim and Grom are objectively better. They're both great, but the latter is better.

tl;dr : Amazing game for amazing people with amazing brain

at first i thought total war : warhammer is like the other warhammer series where the gameplay is like starcraft or warcraft campaign, i didn't expect that it is a turnbased strategy game like this ( i'm a big fan of strategy game since age of empires 1 )

i'm only playing as a Dark elf malekith so far but i've been really addicted into the game. The environments, unique heroes, unique subordinates, unique abilities, different main base with their special building to build, TONS of skills and items, and lots more. Everything in the game is just a perfection in my eyes and brain, it might be a little bit exaggerated but you will find out when you try and choose your first faction and character to play.

do i need to mention FREE DLC? yes you read it correctly, FREE DLC!!! they have been updating their game since release with new characters to play from each faction and lots of them is actually free so u can just download and play, some more interesting characters need to be purchased to be played. 

so far i haven't seen anything that makes me dislike this game other than the pacing, sometimes the enemy progressing super fast than you expected and you have to fight their advanced unit with your basic unit, but hey I WON!! XD the true art of the TWW is how you can turnaround the battle with your unique heroes, subordinates, skills, units, formattion, and terrain. literally need your brain to maximised the output of your units so you can win every battle which is very appealing for me.

there is no try for this game, I WARNED YOU! once you try this game, 1 hour won't be enough to see wether you like it or not, the moment you realised it is already passed 1 hour and you won't be able to refund the game... but hey! who needs to refund a masterpiece game?

This is an expansion pack. not a full game. It is not worth $60, nor is Warhammer 3. No naval. How dare you add entire factions whose society is based around the fact they live near the ocean and not have naval.The dumbing down and oversimplification of mechanics, assuming those mechanics are even still present. Magic and heroes being the single deciding factors for victory, making armies inconsequential. The cartoonish nature of the whole thing, making it more and more arcade-like to where it more resembles a MOBA. Over monetization, unsatisfying gameplay.

Don't buy this however, just get the third installment when it comes out, which I  hear will be in the near future.

But first, should you buy Warhammer 2?

Get it on discount alongside Warhammer 1. The price of both on discount cost $34.81 (at time of writing). Each game costs $59 so you'll still save $24.19. If you bought them at full price, that's $118 - not affing worth it. 

- Now for the long review.

I played more Paradox Interactive games than Creative Assembly's in my life. Europa Universalis, Crusader Kings, HOI and Stellaris being the main ones I've tried in different points of my life. They're all very complex. Total War titles can be just as complex, but the most important thing is them being historically-rich and accurate. And thus, TW Warhammer is the elephant in the room: Creative Assembly took a risk by removing history in favour of fantasy.

However, it's unfair to dismiss TW Warhammer for it since it is still a Total War game. Large-scale battles and turn-based grand strategy. The environment is staggering, with refined details. The developers really put the work into designing virtually character model, equipment, structures and vegetation. It makes you realise Total War has come a very long way.  

For seasoned TW players - I'm not one of them - I hear criticism about the grand campaigns being toned down in favour of warfare. Though I agree, I feel that this is forgivable given the nature of the Warhammer franchise, wherein the war machine is king, and I reckon this was intentional. After all, Warhammer fans from the tabletop games or video games like Dawn of War 1 & 2 would definitely prefer Warhammer retaining that flair of merciless violence and unremitting brutality. Think about Blood Bowl and how it turned peaceful American football into a gory affair. It's just Warhammer. Hence, the dagger is more preferred than the tongue - a notable keepsake for the Dark Elves perhaps. 

When I bought Warhammer, I expected grand strategy as complex as Rome II, but I was pleasantly surprised it wasn't. Now, I could just focus on harassing my neighbours and befriending dinosaurs, instead of thinking hard about my decisions like in Paradox's games. Sp, Total War Warhammer felt like a breath of fresh air for me. Furthermore, being Total War, I now commanded large armies again; kinda feels like Dawn of War 1. 

Criticisms:
You'd think I'm very happy with this product. Not entirely. 
Total War Warhammer is a trilogy and it is all interconnected. However, it is not like Call of Duty Modern Warfare in which you continue the stories of recurring characters. Rather, this has to do with the campaigns and the playable factions. Upon purchase of Warhammer 2, I am told to claim my FREE Mortal Empires DLC. So I went ahead to click it install to no avail. Turns out, you need to own TW Warhammer 1 first in order to unlock Mortal Empires. I never played Warhammer 1 but from what I've heard, Mortal Empires just allows you to play the Warhammer 1 factions in a brand new campaign and see them with better graphics. Seriously? FREE DLC if you've bought and owned the first game. So it isn't free. 

How about those who bought Warhammer 2 from the store? The ones who haven't discovered Steam, let alone create an account? Perhaps Creative Assembly addressed this before, and told players about this, but still it's a business practice that disrespects the customer base. I hope CA doesn't do this again.

_ 

For those new to the Warhammer franchise, TW Warhammer takes place in the Age of Sigmar (AOS). It is high fantasy as opposed to the gothic, grimdark scifi fantasy setting of Warhammer 40k. You will not recruit and command Space Marines, and melee units dominate the battlefield. There are Orks, Chaos, Elves and Monkeigh around but they'll be loosely connected to the Warhammer 40k universe. There is of course theories about that claim AOS occurs after the events of Warhammer 40k or were concurrently happening alongside Warhammer 40k. You can come up with your own theories, but the idea of magical factions murdering one another for the planet before the uninvited arrival of the Imperium and its Space Marines sends chills down my spine.",1656661610,1656661610,True,1,0,0.508928596973419189,0,True,False,False

CA has yet again, added another irremovable rubbish spam ad to WH2. This time you can't remove it. It's advertising wh3, a game I already own! Scumbag company at this point. Clearly they believe WH3 is too awful a game to sell without ruining WH2

EDIT:
I've updated my review which was mainly a knee jerk reaction to CA's bs update they pushed recently but after going back to play WH2 some more I really do need to revise my review. I'll leave my old salty review below since it's still relevant somewhat.

New Review:
Amazing game. I have over 600 hours in this. It's my most played game according to steam and for good reason. Most replayable TW game of all. Combat is super fun, campaigns are super fun. Insane faction and unity variety. Damn I really do love this game. Legit 1000x better than WH3. I stopped playing WH3 and came back to this game and the difference is huge and I don't just mean the bigger campaign and factions but the performance is vastly better than 3. I get a nice 60 fps with some dips during crazy magic and major battles but that's expected(WH3 performs 30% to 40% worse in fps).

The one issue with WH2 is that the vast majority of content is locked behind dlc. It's an expensive game to get the full experiance. No way to sugar coat that. Buy this game on a sale and WH1 as well, that's the most bang for your buck. Get dlcs on sale too. Absolute must buy game

Old salty Review:
CA has 'updated' this game post WH3 release so they can put literal spam on the main title screen(you can remove this by linking your tw account and steam but that's the only way, which is bs since you are psudo forced into giving them more marketing info). They also removed MP chat and this update is messing with some mods too. Actually BS move from the devs. This was not needed, they should be working on making the mess that is WH3 better but CA clearly has nothing but contempt for the customers. Such blatant disrespect to us.

So how is the actual WH2 game? It's good, vastly better than 3. Do not buy 3, get 2 but I'm still pissed at what a trash developer CA has become these days. Only buy on sale",1651227877,1656263945,False,0,1,0.54051518440246582,0,True,False,False

I so far have purchased all of the dlc and don't regret it.  If your on a fixed budget wait  till black friday or one of the sales events.

Since the formula for the Total War games is already known and tested in all the previous releases, no game breaking bugs have occurred when playing my 1400+ hours, and I'm still not fed up with the game. 

The TTW games and DLC are kind of pricey, but compared with the time played I find it justified. They also often come back with discounted prices during steam sales.

It's nice to see the lore and familiar characters brought to life, any warhammer or Games Workshop fanboy should own this title :)

The Good:
Total War: WARHAMMER II is exactly what you would expect if Warhammer fantasy and Total War had a baby together. If you like either one, you'll probably like this. The combination is entirely natural and works together beautifully. Pausable real-time combat is perfect for a table-top tactical combat game, and the grand strategy map gives you all the nuance of the game's lore and complexity.

The Bad:
Product registration and DLC download is so poorly handled that both failed repeatedly. Registration failed on Chrome, Edge, and Firefox due to the registration button doing nothing. DLC in-game brings you to a website, which brings you to Steam, which brings you in-game. At no point does the download/get DLC now button actually download the DLC. Following advice online to fix this buggered Steam so badly that it crashed. I've never seen Steam crash before. Eventually everything got reinstalled, and the game mostly works. I still can't access all of the DLC that I bought though.

Once the game is working, there is another impediment to playing: the tutorial. The tutorial is so aggressively bad that it prevented me from learning how to play the game. DO NOT PLAY THE TUTORIAL! Just play a campaign on easy until you learn the controls, then start a real game. The game actually has a reasonably intuitive user interface.",1651291077,1656224516,True,0,0,0.508928596973419189,0,True,False,False

You can't really pay very close attention to what's happening with individual troops while you're actually fighting a battle, but when you watch the replay you can zoom in and see all the bloody carnage in full glory (Note that there is 0 actual bloody carnage unless you purchase the DLC that adds blood and gore to the game, which rubs me the wrong way, but the game is far less playable without it). It's so much fun to see your spells obliterate whole units or to watch a huge monster tear into formations and toss everyone around in a shower of blood and viscera. 

The game does a terrible job of teaching you how to play. You'll have to figure out how everything works through trial and error. I have a pretty decent handle on how the game works after 35 hours, but there are still mechanics I don't understand and plenty I have to learn about how to fight battles. It's very overwhelming at first and you might feel like giving up, but if you stick with it the game will reward you with an experience you can't really get anywhere else. 

That said, if you want the full Total War Warhammer experience, you're going to have to buy all 3 $60 games. That's a minimum $180 price of entry, which doesn't include any of the DLC factions of course. In my professional opinion, you're going to want to wait until there's a sale to buy these games. I don't have Warhammer III yet, but I bought Warhammer I and Warhammer 2 plus two major DLC packs for around $55 on sale, which is pretty good value. 

If you're looking to buy this game, you should buy Warhammer I first, because Warhammer 2 is essentially more of an expansion pack for Warhammer I than it is a standalone game. You'll notice the huge amount of DLC available for these games, but don't worry- you don't need any of it (apart from the blood and gore DLC, you'll want that, it's about $3) to play the game, they're just new factions you can buy if you want to.",1656170698,1656170698,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The only way to get ahead in harder difficulties is to cheese since the AI is so bad they need free resources/armies coming out of their ass to have a chance to compete with the player.

The AI can always see where the players armies and weak settlements are and they have the ability of knowing exactly how far your'e armies can move while also having the advantage of having more movement points than the player. 
This pretty much ruins all the strategic aspects of the campaign and leaves the player with just the decisions of what building to build in their settlement and the choice of expansion.

Meanwhile endless legend with the community patch and age of wonders has way better campaign AI.
The technology is there but SEGA doesn't seem to want to put in the money and time to make it happen.
All I am saying is that this game could have been so much more if it weren't for one of the worst grand strategy AI to date.

Three Kingdoms caused me to raise an eyebrow, but I still enjoyed it quite a bit. I realized that they were falling into the same trap that most games do these days - paywalls. This is the most dumbed down version of Total War that I've seen and it's a shame. I was really looking forward to this one. Fortunately, I waited until it was on sale for $20. I feel that that's a fair price for this. You have 4 factions and 2 faction leaders to choose from each. Otherwise, you'll be paying for any other beneficial leaders.

I remember when you'd have 20, 30+ faction options to choose from - all with unique pros and cons - rich in lore and history when opening the codex to learn more about them. You'd at least somewhat care for your family members (there are none in this game, AFAIK) and the continuation of your family line. The UI sucks, map design sucks, city design is cheap, the units look roughly the same, etc. In a nutshell, it feels like a knock-off of the series.

Disclaimer: I've only played one Warhammer game prior but I love sci-fi/history/fantasy stuff. As a kid, this series was a part of the spark that fueled my interest in Medieval and Roman history. I thought this may have the same magical effect with the Warhammer games. Unfortunately, it only reaffirmed my decision to stop buying from them.

Diplomacy system is terrible, the AS controlled factions are random and hyper aggressive or totally inert and passive, with no in-betweens. Since there is so little effort in building a competent ai the developers just give ai factions bonuses to economy, building and recruitment. So most of the time you steamroller the battle only to have the same enemy respawn a few turns later with a full stack army. 
A wasted opportunity.

I enjoyed this game for hundreds of hours.
Yet I do not recommend to get it right now due to bugs with the new Intel CPU and coop crashes.

During Winter Sale I recommended this game to a friend. I praised the game and he finally decided to get it.
He can play it solo just fine. But the biggest selling point was the COOP. However we cant get the COOP campaign past turn 3 without the game crashing or corrupting the save for one player. Not just the two of us but it crashes with another player aswell. This never happened the years i enjoyed the game but is a known bug for the last few weeks ( maybe months). COOP Campaign is broken right now and a frustrating experience right now.

On top of that, the game is extremely buggy with the new Intel Alder Lake CPUs. I was able to play just fine with my 12 year old computer, but now that i got a new CPU the game crashes in solo game frequently. Sometimes it will not even start a brand new campaign.This is also a known bug.

There is a lot of DLC and cost you need for it to become that however. You do need the previous game, its DLC, this game and its DLC. Mortal Empires is an amazing experience, with generally fun mechanics for each race; however, you should wait for a sale to experience it unless you really don't care about money.

The AI isn't perfect but they do not blindly go into sieges with 5 dudes they will lose handily like I remember the Medieval II AI doing. The AI is heavily helped by cheats, especially on higher difficulties, but that's kinda to be expected. 

The Beauty of total war games is the combination of turn based 4X like strategy, and the real time battles. Combat is not just a numbers game or luck, your skill plays a pivotal role in success. You maneuver your troops, use abilities, and use the terrain to your advantage. Outside of combat you decide what troops and structures to build, what to research, with whom to engage in diplomacy, and move your armies. 

There really are not man games that combine these two elements., and that is what makes Total War special.

What makes Warhammer 2 special is the differences between each race. The magic and undead masses of the Vampire Courts, the familiar and varied armies of the Empire, the defensive nature of the Dwarves and so on. Not to mention how fun it can be to level, equip, and play with the Lords and heroes.

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I...

I do not auto-resolve battles. And I recommend that you do not either. The combat (terrain and army formations) is second to none that I have played.

It is a mixture between turn-based settlement strategy and a RTS battle simulator. From what I can tell, the technology/building development trees are palpably unique per each race.

I have had the most fun playing co-op campaign with my good buddy. Spectator mode is even fun because you or he can point out areas of concern such as where enemies are charging towards units, or if a unit is standing idle.

I play on hard mode because normal will make me fall asleep and very hard and legendary are just silly.

The higher the difficulty, the more the ai cheats. It doesn't get smarter, it doesn't get better in battle, it cheats. and. I. hate. that. While it is cheating, you are also taking penalties to things like leadership for your units, upkeep, diplomacy, etc.

For instance:

Your army goes up against the dwarves, and they almost refuse to break and rout down to the last man for every unit. Now you play as the dwarves because you figure, hey that must be nice. Your dwarves will be mistaken for small children as they start to rout almost instantly at higher difficulties because of the leadership penalty and or you don't have other units flanking and cycle charging.

The higher the difficulty the more the upkeep costs. You can control a whole province (2 - 4 settlements) and barely afford one army on hard with mostly garbage units. Control two provinces and you can get some nice units in your army! Good luck defending them!

The AI can control one SETTLEMENT and have 2 and a half armies along with the garrison (3 and a half total armies). Making it INCREDIBLY frustrating trying to finish off factions with your single army.

The AI has more movement points than you can possibly spec into. Unless you are Vlad Von Carstein.The AI regularly ignores your armies and sprints through your lands raiding and razing to their hearts content because guess what? YOU WONT BE ABLE TO CATCH THEM. 

I've seen an enemy army leave their settlement, come into my territory, raze my settlement, adopt FORCED MARCH STANCE and go all the way back to their settlement so they can hide with their garrison. LUL. As the player, once you raze a settlement your turn is over, but not for the ai. Now my problem is not that they razed my settlement, my problem is, they don't have the same opportunity to be punished that i do.

The AI doesn't attack you unless they have overwhelming numbers. In that case there is little you can do. Now the devs recognize this so they put a skill in the game called lightning strike, THAT IS A MUST HAVE and only works when you attack. It allows you to ignore the enemies reinforcements and attack one enemy army 1v1 (very realistic btw this happens a lot in war). Nevermind that after the battle your units will be diminished and their reinforcements will just attack you next turn, destroying you anyway because they can afford ridiculous numbers. BUT LIGHTNING STRIKE. 

What's even cooler, is when engaging multiple enemy armies from the front on the campaign map, you can see them standing next to each other IN FRONT OF YOU, and on the battlefield, their reinforcements come in BEHIND YOU. It's a great feeling when your setup and plan for the battle goes out the window. It happens rarely but more than 0 times can ruin your entire campaign

The AI can recruit units they don't have the required buildings for. Orc factions recruting big un's 10 turns in, the vampires recruiting grave guard 20 turns in. The Tomb Kings recruiting well passed their building limits.

There are no navies in the game. You can't blockade ports, your army just becomes a ship when you move it on to water. You can't strangle the enemies economy. you can't target critical infrastructure. It doesn't matter because it doesn't affect how the ai plays.

Most cities on water have mandatory ports and only the major port cities offer the entire port building chain, so if you have a minor port city, the port takes up a building slot and you can't build it up all the way and its just awkward especially since you can't recruit anything with them

There are no unit formations. No wedges, testudos, phalanxes, shield walls, or loose unit formations to take less artillary/arrow damage. The game is just whoever controls the flanks with their boxes of units wins. AND. ITS. BORING. Boxes of units going against other boxes of units. And stats? don't matter. what matters is their traits like anti infantry, anti large, armor piercing, etc. rock. paper. scissors.

Ambush stance almost never works. don't even bother. i would say a clean 98% chance it won't work. Unless you are skaven or beastmen.

Regardless of difficulty the AI does not have fog of war. They can see everything you are doing. Want to send a fleet across the ocean and suprise attack the elves? They'll be waiting for you. RUINS. THE. FUN. If you take one wrong step because you can't see the enemy armies while they can see yours you will be surrounded and deleted.

Diplomacy = everyone hates your guts. The ai can confederate twice in the first 10 turns (absorb other factions of the same race that requires the player to have almost impossibly high diplomatic relations) meanwhile you will get laughed at asking for mutually beneficial trade deals by factions of your own race because of diplomatic penalties called aversion, and great power that you have for NO REASON. 

The best part about diplomacy is when a faction across the world declares war on you and sends all their armies your way. I've had factions completely ignore their own defense just to zerg me, another faction would be attacking and absorbing them on one side while they were attacking me. DUMB

The AI has zero problems with public order. They can be in a settlement with inhospitable climate, with me raiding them and they still, will have no issue with public order. Meanwhile i have to use precious building slots on buildings that only maintain public order. expect to use 1 - 2 each province JUST TO BREAK EVEN in public order. Anything that happens (enemy/neutral army trespassing/ enemy heroes trespassing/ corruption goes up because the beastmen are on your continent(?) expect a rebellion shortly. The only time i see rebellions for the ai are from vampiric, chaotic, and skaven corruption. As you can imagine the AI can spread like wildfire with confederations and no public order problems while you could not possibly dream of doing so ( i wouldn't want to do it that way, I just want things to be equal).

Units now have health bars! I almost didnt buy this game because of this alone. You can have a unit with almost all of their guys in the unit but have almost zero health. It is a site to see them all fall over at once when the unit health reaches zero or see routing units squeeze through enemy units instead of dying because they haven't reached the right health threshold.

Seiges. The towers have unlimited range, insane firing rate and will single handedly destroy your army if you don't charge the city the second you press start battle. Why would my army set up under enemy tower range to begin with? And when attacking units rout in a siege they RUN INTO THE CITY instead of out. LOL.

The best thing about this game are the large units and heroes but they manage to mess up heroes too.

Legendary Lords (LLs) that don't have mounts will lose to the weakest LLs that do have mounts. Even if you spec into buffing the hell out of your LL. GRIMGOR IRONHIDE the biggest baddest orc ever, the black orc that headbutt and shamed Archaeon the Everchosen, lord of the end times, loses to ANY mounted LL.

Auto Resolve is a laughing stock, you can have high end armies lose to basic units because one unit of enemy archers gets 300+ kills while another gets 200+ kills and so on. Then you fight the battle, because quicksave and those same archers will get 7 and 15 kills.

I can't recommend this game. The game in its entirety, costs WAY too much money to have so many things wrong with it. Save your money.""

Not only can you enter a vast Campaign map and fight against online and AI armies but you can also fight into custom battles on huge maps. I love the detail in cinematic mode and have been addicted to this game from the start. 

Only a few downsides:
- It is actually now dwarfed by the new Warhammer which I would also recommend
- Depending on your PC the graphics could be a bit jerky

Overall this is a great game with good graphics and adictive gameplay that I have barely covered in this review.

If you get this game and like it make sure to tell me and I hope this helps you buy the game.

If I could I would give it a stiff maybe, on the grounds that all of the content is going to be used in Immortal Empires.

WH1 and WH2 are amazing games and the mortal empires campaign has been giving me hundreds of hours of fun over the last few years. The races are refreshing and enjoyable to play. DLC content has kept the game fresh and expanded an already large map. However, if you want to play as every single faction be prepared to pay a hefty fee to do so. As a player who has bought new DLC typically at release, I have spent hundreds of dollars to date.

I've been lucky to see this series through to the end from start to finish. As a whole its better than any other Total War game (and I really loved Medieval II), the systems play beautifully and I rarely run into issues after all this time. Hopefully the developers can turn WH3 around and get it to the same state they did WH2.

Now for the bad. Because all the games are interconnected, there are factions that just simply haven't gotten enough love. Dwarfs, Warriors of Chaos, and several others have been left behind. It doesn't mean they are unplayable, but they don't have the same gimics and features that new factions have. Thankfully this should be taken care of by the time WH3 is completely finished. There is also a growing trend with several factions that have the attack ambush stance. This single feature can destroy even the strongest doom stack.

Campaign... It's boring. If you're not a fanboy of the Warhammer stuff... then You'll probably not like this game. The politics are boring. You just set up non aggression pacts and trade with the ones you don't want to deal with. Declare war 1 at a time and take cities. Build all the econ buildings up, and pretty soon you're just throwing 20 Stacks at the enemy and using numerical superiority to auto-resolve every fight. 

The combat is... tiresome. You bait the enemy to attack you, either by sitting outside their city, or sieging it... You take the high-ground, let the enemy roll into your middle ranks, and then send in hidden calvary to hit from the rear... then just check in every so often while you watch tv... until you get the ""Victory"" icon.

Cut to some backwater mountain canyon and this angry fuckboy is out cruising the world to bring back the relics and great fame of the mighty Dawi.. or some shit, all i know is that he likes rocks and crossbolts.

First mad lad to try and teach me that he was more angry than me was some green slobbery fuck boi who spoke in broken sentences.. but he didnt understand with just how much i fucking love rocks and throwing them at people with huge machines.

I rolled up into his house and took that shit for my own angry short man ways. Some other angry short man is going on about some big fucking book that we hold all our beef with other people and that ""the grudges must be settled"" or some shit, all i know is that this calls for some more rock throwing diplomacy.

so i finally make it down this fucking canyon, throwing rocks all the way.. and finally capture my last town to call my region complete, when i get attacked by some fucking Rat by the name of Headtaker or some shit.. ill show you who's taking heads, my rocks now are heat seeking and explode mother fucker.

Glorious exploding rocks throwing Rat fucks all over the place, and i just stood there yelling obscenities about how its okay to be this short and angry all the time.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

This on the other hand (and obviously because of it having been out for years) is a very fun game to play. There are some issues I tend to notice that really ruin the fun such as an AI running your army around in circles attempting to chase it otherwise they will destroy you from behind where you aren't protected, then while you're running around in circles after the one unit another faction that decided to go to war with you for no reason what so ever comes in an swoops away half your damn settlements forcing you to disband half your army because they end up making you go negative. That and AI on the other side of the map randomly declaring war on you because they have a stick up their a$$ for no reason in particular but the game calls it aversion... some instances of aversion make sense like orcs and humans (elves, dwarves), others don't but its more of a lore thing which I guess isn't too bad, except when that one faction all the way across the map in mortal empires decides to send a doomstack of overpowered units all the way over to you and annilate you after 20 turns. Another issue I have is far into the game  its like the smaller faction AI's just stop doing anything altogether. You got the major factions taking up 40-50 settlements and you're trying to get your 10 allied factions that are all underdogs to help you and they just sit there or basically spam peasant like units and attempt to go after the target you have set for them. I've had this game for a few weeks and have 111 hours but I honestly do love it.

UPDATE: Sadly despite updates providing enormous amounts of good new content I have to change my review to thumbs down for one reason: they forced Epic Online Services on TW:WH1.  I'm 99% sure TW:WH2 will soon follow suit, so I'm preemptively downvoting to show my dislike of this cancer infecting PC gaming.

Sieges are the worst battles in this game and the main campaign (vortex) is quite bad. The game is filled with both fun moments and frustration  since the AI is literally braindead and has a million cheats at higher difficulty. Higher difficulty just focuses on debuffing the player and buffing the AI as much as possible, which doesn't really make the game very difficult, since i have completed many legendary runs. After playing other grand strategy games i have noticed how shallow TW is. The land battles are quite good and the grand campaign map can played in multiple playthroughs.

The main reason that this is getting a negative review is that the updates for the game have been stopped and the last update made cavalry units useless. The teams have shifted to wh3 which imho is an inferior game with the next iteration of immortal empires being months away.

It's 2 completely different games that have NOTHING whatsoever to do with each other contained in the same product. FORTUNATELY they are very easily separable and one is NOT forced to play both of them. I underline FORTUNATELY.

Game 1: Battles. Battles are very interesting. It was completely new to me and I really enjoy the mechanics. You choose which units to put in your army, you may also build the enemy's army, you dispose the units on the battlefield, you send them into battle, you manage their movements, you match which units have an advantage against which and depending by your management you win or you loose a battle. You play, as a matter of fact, a military leader. In this game I also want to talk about the content of the game you pay for. So, speaking materially/artistically you pay for a rich multitude of 3d textured models, animations and atmospheres, not to talk about artistic design of these. These contents are VALUABLE, well done. There are many creatures, including dragons, manticores and monsters of all sorts. There are knights, warriors, vampires. You can play in various settings and with various elements, which all deliver different vibes. Seeing your armies clashing against those of the enemy by moving the camera is a joy for the eyes. This is where the product really shines, a lot of art and technical production articulated in an interesting battle dynamic. I LOVE the fact that you can play this game in custom battles, so when you want, without any burden and using ANY element you wish without having to unlock it through any boring process. You have to buy it, fine, but it's honest. You pay for content, not for illusions.

Game 2: Campaign. Boring. Deadly boring, and useless in my opinion. It's a completely different game that has NOTHING to do whatsoever with battles. The content you pay for is not actually this. I would define campaigns as a mortal trap to cripple the content you pay for by showing it to you in a dreadfully long sequence of repetitive non-interesting battles that you end up skipping with auto-resolve and having to deal with a game that you didn't actually want, the one of expansion in the territory and diplomacy and stuff. I mean... I just don't like to play that. It has nothing to do with the 3d models and the battle mechanics, it's a strategic game of land movements and timing based on turns which I really don't enjoy. I tried several hours of campaign both in WH1 and WH2 JUST because the map looked to good, but it wasn't enough to keep me playing. I totally discarded that side of the game and now I play just custom battles which is what I really like. FORTUNATELY I can do this. If I was forced to play battles only through the campaign, without having any option to do it separately, I would have never continued playing WH nor bought the sequel.

In conclusion, PLEASE keep focusing on custom battles with everything unlocked from the beginning and give campaigns a secondary importance if you really have to keep them. If it was for me I'd COMPLETELY remove campaigns form Warhammer and focus ALL the efforts on material contents to be played in custom battles. Where the game really shines is the art, the variety of elements that are materially present in the game and the battle mechanics, NOT the campaign. God, if they are beautiful.

Do yourself a favor and just by Medieval Kingdom 2 and get the Warhammer mod, there I just saved you a crap ton of money.  In fact Medieval 2 has such a huge and dedicated modding community that they practically make whole new games on their own for FREE.

They changed nickle-and-diming into dollaring, seriously, some of the most basic DLCs cost $20.00, and many of them honestly should be included in the base game. So do the math, $60.00 for each of the 3 basic games, and then probably another $100.00 to the DLCs you want the most, that's almost $300.00 for a game. Crazy. But if you end up like me putting hundreds of hours into it, well, then you're getting your money's worth I guess.

Now, onto gameplay. It's good. This one fixes most of the issues that other TW games had (namely insanely bad tactical game AI and cheating campaign enemies). The only major gripe I have about the gameplay is that sometimes you'll be totally gangbanged in the first 20 turns because factions that have no real incentive to declare war on you, and which would never declare war on the AI in your position, will do so, and then beeline all their troops at you. This is fine unless you're trying a minor power and 2 majors do it to you. OK that's really my only complaint though.

So just realize that it's gonna cost you an arm and leg for the whole game before you buy. If you can do that with a clear head, then I recommend it.",1651972618,1651972618,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you get ambushed, the game puts your whole army into a single column march regardless), and there is significant variability in the quality of content for each race

I recommend buying this game on sale, and playing with significant number of mods which will help fix the content quality disparities and the broken diplomacy.

Also CA decided that putting intrusive ads in the main menu and removing multiplayer chat was more important than fixing a serious gamebreaking bug that causes the AI to not fight back when attacked by artillery.

The ad while irritating goes away if you confirm you have a connected total war access account however if that is something you have an issue with it is present now when it wasn't before. The game itself is great, allowing you to play out epic fantasy battles in the world of Warhammer Fantasy Battles in real time  battles potentially hosting thousands of soldiers, heroes and monsters with a world map resembling a 4x strategy  game in the campaign from which to expand and build your empire, lay ambushes etc. In the base game there are 4 races with roughly three factions each (including free DLC factions) that you have access to with wildly different playstyles and if you happen to own its predecessor Total War: Warhammer you get access to a free combined campaign map with access to 9 races and a huge sand box of a map to play in which I highly recommend.

They seem to have patched the issues with old saves being unreadable but if you're still having those issues try this:

Although the cost to enjoy ALL of the content is this game can be steep (if you are lucky you can wait until a steam sale / bundle), this game delivers on a wide variety of content and replay-ability. 

Total War: WARHAMMER II will take a toll on your system at times (although this is something which is has been drastically improved since the game's inception) and has a steep learning curve to those not familiar with Total War / lore curve to those not familiar with the franchise. Getting past though barriers however is one of the greatest joys a game can bestow. Learning how to properly place armies, mastering building tech chains, and enjoying the lore behind this wide variety of content more than makes up for the technical flaws this game sometimes brings up.

Well Total War Warhammer 3 was the first one i ever tried due to it being on game pass at the time. Once i started it and my friends found out they told me about Mortal Empires and how theres going to be an Immortal Empires. so i stopped playing W3 and got 1 and 2. Never played 1 but i downloaded 2 and got the vampire dlc and tried it out. Then i got nearly all the other dlc over the course of this last month or so that ive been playing it. Then to try and take a break while waiting for Immortal Empires to come out i read reviews on the other older games to see what would be fun and still look good to play. Shogun 2, which i love Samurai and Japanese anything, was the next one i tried and it was amazing as well. 
Do these games have issues? yes. Do some mods help with some of the issues? yes. Are all the weird game design ideas or bugs fixed or patched out? no. STILL I've now played W2, Shogun 2, 3k, and demos of a few other ones and they are so much fun!
I'm not going to give a super detailed review of the functions and what not of this game because if you google search there are so many awesome people that have made really detailed guides or reviews on all of these games that it wont be hard for you to beable to search and read up on any of them.

Pros:
-Extremely addictive, and immersive campaign map. (I mean it's absolutely huge.)
-Without having background information, the game does a really good job of giving you the *aesthetic* and *immersion* of each faction. I wasn't super well versed, but had a basic understanding of Warhammer Fantasy lore coming into these games, as I took to 40k a little more. For me the game did a great job of giving me a general sense of what each faction was fighting for.
-Combat is exciting! The clash of battle lines put me on the edge of my seat every time, and lets be honest, who doesn't enjoy a nice Cavalry charge, and watching little people fly across their screen.
-Mods! Oh how we love you independent modders making our lives so much easier.
-Warpstone Good-good kill man-thing.
-Do you think Lord Toyotamundi has a toilet in his Star Chamber? And if so, does he think about the Great Plan while taking a dump?


Cons:
-Nakai (Sorry Papa Croc.)
-Unit responsiveness feels a little... delayed for me sometimes. Maybe it's a user error since I only have like 3 brain cells, but in combat the units feel like they delay their actions in the most crucial moments for me.
-You have to pay for EVERYTHING. It's a Total War game, which is not new to me, so I kind of expected this one. Most of the DLC's are worth the purchase in my opinion, but do I feel like I should've paid for them? Not really. I'm looking at you, Blood DLC.
-This one is another personal issue I've run into here and there, but on the Campaign map, I'll have some issues attacking settlements and what not. Like, no shit hitting the attack button. I just can't do it. It's only happened a select few times, but the game has those bugs here and there. Completely ruined my campaign for me.

Overall:
Really great game. I honestly love it. It has it's imperfections like any Total War game, but it's a gem truly. If you're on the edge, I recommend getting it for sure. The replay-ability of this game is awesome, and I couldn't recommend this game more. You'll most definitely put multiple hours into this game, and spend days, if not weeks on just one campaign alone. Now go kill-die some man-things in the name of the Great Horned Rat!

The majority of armies function by their own unique method of play and that does translate to a tangible experience when switching from one to another. 


AI requires four major improvements; 
     
     1. Companies need to be able to disengage when ordered to. Presently, they generally require you to click multiple times at a 180 degrees from the point of contact. At times you have to click constantly until they separate. The front line of the company should have difficulty as they are engaged, but 1/2 to 3/4 of the troops who are simply waiting behind, should be able to follow the instruction immediately.  If you fight in real time that takes away valuable seconds from your direction. This leads to the next point. 

     2. Companies should try and flank another company automatically. Alternatively, allow the player to toggle the option per group. At least 50% of the company is idle waiting for your front line to die in order to advance forward. If they could walk forward in the manner drivers dodge traffic in the Philippines we would be golden; no lining up just fit where you can. Companies route when low in troops. If my own troop is superior, I could force another to dwindle down in numbers to reach a possible route much quicker if everyone is participating together. Liberating another company to assist elsewhere is the root goal. 

     3. To be persistent. You order your company to attack company A. Before reaching A they are engaged by company B. B is decimated and chooses to route off of the map. Your company should continue to A but instead they pursue B until they exit the map. The maps are large, it takes minutes for B to arrive at the borders of the map in order for them to exit the battlefield. I need that company to push another objective and they assure me when they are done pursuing ten guys or less, they will be right back in the action.  Later I find out that my lieutenant was lying because his company is AWOL, chilling at the map border waiting for better days.

     4. Enough of the clairvoyance. When ordering a company to attack another they are aware of that decision from the moment you click your mouse. You know this because they will immediately start to take evasive or offensive positions to counter that order. At times it would be impossible for these companies to know that they are the specific target of a group. Archers are the worst offenders of this. Delay the awareness and in the right situations, don't permit the AI to react fast enough or know that we are hiding in trees.",1637540815,1651076722,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

And the battles are great - they're spectacular, flexible, and accommodate both deep tactical min-maxing alongside brainlessly throwing random units together and watching the carnage unfold, with all the violent campiness that the Warhammer setting yields. There is a level of army roster and hero customisation and depth unprecedented for the series, enhanced by the relatively elaborate magic system of match-changing abilities, encompassing huge torrents of damage, powerful healing or necromancy spells, and strong buffs and debuffs. The lack of competition cements Total Warhammer 2's ability to produce unique encounters on the battlefield. The seemingly infinite pool of paired animations also reward pressing your nose up against single units, taking in the chaos of enormous monsters tearing poor peasants apart as armoured horses send infantry flying in violent charges and preposterously clothed lords elegantly duel on the frontline. The only major complaint of the battles is that the city siege maps are worthy of their infamous reputation as, boring, uninventive, buggy slogs that fall short of siege maps in previous Total War games, so hopefully the sequel's marketed improvements will be fruitful.

On the other hand, there's the campaign - specifically the overworld - which continues to be a huge detriment to the whole package. It's bad across the board, suffering from incompetent AI, little meaningful management, painfully obvious critical progression paths that decentivise experimentation or role-playing, and an inescapable air of staleness inherited from years of legacy mechanical design. There's no interesting storytelling or any particular depth or challenge, and other than the occasional touch of flavour, every campaign quickly ends up feeling the same through repetitive actions and tedious, shallow strategy.

I recommend this with the huge caveat to not expect to enjoy it as a 4X or grand strategy game, and instead solely on the strength of its battles and vibrant PvP skirmish scene.

It have many races and many different type of units to fit anyone.

I recommend it heavily for strategy game fans.

The only negative thing I can think to say about the game is that there is a bit of a learning curve for getting used to how each Faction plays and what their strengths and weaknesses are. The Eye of the Vortex game mode is probably the best experience for new players to get used to the game-flow as Mortal Empires can be intense with all the factions at the start, which means this is also a game that is going to need a good rig to run at optimal settings.

I have never played WARHAMMER I.


Pros-

#1.It was cool seeing/using special magic units in total war

#2.I like the different factions

#3.Mods



Cons-

#1.The difficulty seems harder in this game compared to other total war games

I can beat Rome 2 on very hard but I find this game much harder.


#2.You need a high end pc and monitor or the graphics will look more ugly and the game will run slower



The Bottom Line -


Still a good game and nice addition to the total war family.If you do not have a really new and expensive pc you should not buy this as the graphics will have to be downgraded so low they will look ugly compared to top end pcs.


If you have a top end pc I would say the game is worth about $10 or so if you like total war games.",1646826978,1648744599,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Update 4 - 24/11/21 - The last update to the game before the sequel broke several things (cavalary, ambushes, etc.) but only the cavalry was addressed. I say ""addressed"" because it was not fixed, CA just kinda of adjusted so the problem is not as drastic. The bugs caused by the update will not be fixed and only WH3 matters.

Update 3- 27/11/20 - The game is good. If the next update (on 03/12/20) screws the game like the last update did I will change this back to negative.

Update 2 - 29/06/20 - I was ready to change my review to positive. After seen all that CA was doing for the old factions I really wanted to say they redeemed themselves but this new update broke the game like no other did before. It has been more than a month and the ""beta"" fix not only fixed at best half of those bugs but also added it's own bugs that manage to be worse than the ones it fixed. The game is good, but if you don't want to deal with a game that is broken, fixed and broken again just buy something else.

Update 1 - 04/11/18 - The DLC came out some months ago. More bugs were introduced. All CA's communications are about Thrones of Britannia. Abandon all hope.

The game is a mess, unfortunately. Two months in and the bug fixing is abhorrent, with old bugs not been fixed (in some cases despite the fact that CA said they fixed it), the implementation of ME is just terrible, with half the new map been cut out, and just for clarification, if you think the smaller map is good all power to you, but if they had announced that prior to release (and thanks to the leaks we know they already knew the size would be this one) I would not have bought the game, and many more other problems.

As of right now they still have to implement one of the old races (Norsca) and fix a significant number of bugs that have been dragged since release.

The old factions feel dated compared to the new ones, and with so much to do, I don't think they will even try to fix those things.

Also, some mechanics are broken but shouldn't be. The chaos invasion on ME are just a recycled use of the invasions on the Vortex campaign (and they are not good there by the way) instead of using the old method from the first game. This game been just an extension of the first, why can't they use the same mechanics is beyond me.

If you can, avoid this game until is 50% off, with all the bugs fixed, in 6 months or something close to that (we hope).

The only thing that saves this mess is the awesome mod community that fix and improves where CA doesn't or can't (and they are extremely limited in what they can change since the mod support is also bad, been one of the main tools for moding made by moders because of lack of support).

CA said they learned from their previous mistakes, I believed in that and I was wrong. Now I learned from my mistake. I might update this after the updates they are promising come in.",1511525522,1648662886,True,0,0,0.539098739624023438,0,True,False,False

It would seem Creative Assembly rushed their production of this game's sequel, so I would recommend waiting for a Summer Sale, or until the release of Mortal Empires for Total War: Warhammer 3. 

THIS game, however, is excellent. I will say however that in order to get the full experience, there will probably be some gentle modding, and a LOT of DLC. Would definitely wait for a sale on a package deal though, because this game is absolutely worth it in it's entirety. 

A campaign map that is absolutely massive, with turn-based movement and simple but fun empire management. Each race is unique, with unique objectives and mechanics. A personal favorite of mine are the Beastmen as a faction, with Taurox in particular being a satisfying campaign to play. Just something about a screaming, 10-foot tall brass Minotaur dual wielding fire axes that makes me smile. I really smile when that self-same Minotaur literally dives face-first into a mob of Skaven rat men, sending most flying, but there are definitely a few that just... pop into gore fountains on impact. 

The campaign map is gorgeous, and every time one of your armies meets another in battle, you have the option to fight in real-time, or the game can auto-resolve the combat for you. Campaign objective battles are not able to be skipped, however, so you will be commanding troops in real-time. 

I have over 1200 hours of game play under my belt with no intention of stopping anytime soon, so yeah... I recommend it. 

Just wait for a sale unless you're in a place to buy the whole thing full-price. It really is a lot of DLC, but fortunately at least half of it seems to be free. Worth every dime either way though.",1648656783,1648656783,True,30,0,0.726033329963684082,0,True,False,False

DLC can get expensive but hell I thought it was worth it, There are always sales going on many times a year to get them on sale too. Even though I have moved on to Warhammer 3 I will never forget many awesome times involving this game, From my first  Tyrion Campaign when I thought I was doing great only to get steam rolled by the Dark Elves  120 turns in and lose to a hail of Black Arks and Dragons, or my first co-op campaign as the Dawi on mortal empires...endless turns of not knowing what to do and learning many things through trail and error with my friend, We finally got our empires strong only to have Arachaon come out of the fog of war and send our souls to the Chaos gods. Every single race from this game has given me a story or a shared memory with a friend,  I remember fighting what felt like an endless war against Chaos and Norsca as Karl Franz, bulking up Kislev with many armies and walls waiting for the waves to come, Or taking over the entire mortal empires map as good old Settra.  I have being the hero thousands of times, saving a weak faction or allies from utter annihilation and purging evil wherever it is found. I have also been the Harbinger of death, dooming entire Nations, Empires, even continents to the void. Watching allies burn just so I could take their land or laugh as they beg me for mercy every turn after I decided to wipe them out for the smallest slight against me. Epic victories, crushing defeats, with battles so close and intense it makes you wonder how you went from two armies on each side with thousands of troops, war-machines, magic, and beasts that will blow your mind down to a nail biting slug feast between the shattered remaining men, four horses, a fart of magic, one squad of missiles with only their bare knuckles left to throw, and a couple of LL's ready to duel to the death.

But the fact there's more DLC than a Paradox game (Which is saying something) and it costing $71 Canadian for me [b]not including[/b] DLC, it'd be impossible to get everything together unless you're either rich or got lucky with someone gifting you all this for free. But I will put up a few positives I have with this game.

First being the races and the wide variety of factions if you own anything related to it. There's almost everything in TW II: Elves, Lizardmen, Skaven, and countless others with the first game and along with both paid and free DLC.

Second being Mortal Empires. It's a sandbox mode that's fun to play in. While you have to own both games, I recommend you do so when it's on sale. Especially if you're playing as Grimgor and want to give chaos a good krumping. Or with Queek who is a monster when it comes to the near late game. (Had him take in almost every other Skaven factions and him ruling over the east side of the map one game.)

Third being the fact that this is keeping Warhammer Fantasy alive. (For those who don't know, Fantasy was a miniatures game alongside 40K but was ended a while ago and was unfortunately replaced with Age of Shitmar. It may not sound bad at first but that's until you realise that they took Fantasy and inserted some generic fantasy things in it. And even then, we still don't have new Skaven models for how long now?!) This game got me more into Fantasy and has me considering on buying Vermintide 2 given that it's Warhammer's take on Left 4 Dead but with Skaven.

But there's a few problems I'd like to highlight.

First and foremost being ""the Blood god DLC"". They took blood and gore, an option that comes free with any other game, and made it a paid DLC. Yeah, a bad idea in a nutshell. What makes it worse is the fact that they did so with their first one and are planning to do so in their third addition.

Second being the amount of DLC. Yes, a good portion of it's free but at the same time, this game has more DLC than a Paradox game. It's good but for quite a bit of money, it's not worth it short term. Like I said before, wait for sale then buy what you can.

Last being the campaign. [spoiler]The cutscenes look decent but for something that ends up devolving into a hold objective city from random Chaos Marauders until a set amount of turns. Then in the mid to late game, becomes a game of keep away the Skaven or everyone dies. The Vortex mission is a bit fun though with the powers and what not.[/spoiler]

To sum this long review up, buy it if you're interested and when it's on sale when you can along with it's DLC and the last one to play Mortal Empires.",1648202887,1648202887,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
