They are also done in a beautiful and fresh new way allowing ""Cult of the Lamb"" it's own space at the table. I don't even like ""The Binding of Isaac"", but this game has made me willing to give it another shot. I am absolutely in love with this masterpiece.

I do have one con though...Your cult is damn near helpless. I constantly feel like I am on the backburner to keep up with it. There are a lot of QoL improvements towards the end of the game, but so many times I have felt my game progression stagnate because I have to get food, medicine, or gold. I feel like I have to choose between my progression of cult survival or the story. In my opinion the cult upgrades do a good job of rewarding me for my progression taking certain tasks off my hands. They don't do a good enough job keeping up that progression though.

Theres so much we still dont know and the world, but it's still somehow so fleshed out and well lived in. Theres so much to look into and explore, characters to get to know and learn more about, its amazing.

It can be a bit buggy sometimes, but as far as I know the devs are constantly working on patches and fixes. The base game itself is amazing, but we're still getting content updates (a reason to keep coming back !!) Plus even in the complete endgame you still have purgatory, or even just living with your followers in your cult.

I'm not a fan of games that give me false choices and the entire opening sequence is nothing but controlling what could have been a cinematic rather than having pointless gameplay that serves no real purpose.

The combat is shallow and boring and the artstyle/humor is definitely in that 'love it or hate it' mold.

I'm in the 'hate it' camp.

- there are maybe 10 aspects in this game which are actually unique
- of these aspects maybe 3 are fun (the fighting, the dice game and caring for your cult to an extend)
- a lot of times it¬¥s repeating the same 5 things to advance in the game
- without the arbitrary hurdles to advance the actual game would be maybe 2 hours long depending on your skill
- you can¬¥t leave your cult alone for 1 minute which prevents from playing the actual game instead of babysitting everyone. 
- a lot of mechanics get introduced way too late in the game, like for example the sin mechanic. You need way too much to unlock everything and it takes way too long to get the necessary amount.
- there are many bugs which feel so frustrating. One time 2 of my cult members were drunk and shortly before they sobered up and I went to bed they started fighting. So I woke up and one of them died. Or for example half my cult just get stuck on the spot while trying to head to their beds. You have to talk to everyone to unfreeze them so they don¬¥t get to be tired the next day.
- way too many actions have the same button mapped. I butchered way to many dead members because I missclicked or used my cursed instead of selling the old one.
- why is the ""y"" button used twice on the rhythm game? 
- fishing feels useless because the amount of time you need to fish every available fish that day takes too long and the reward is compared to other methods too little
- the game feels in almost every part too easy and when you get damaged it feels undeserved (for example the mob just spawned in or you can¬¥t see the attack because the environment obstructed the view)
- on the topic of difficulty: how should I know at the start of the game what difficulty level I should pick? yes you can change it later on but I gain nothing from it so for what reason should I put it anything higher than normal? And if you want a challenge, the more reasonable modes only get unlocked after clearing the main story and even for that you have to start a new save
- caring for your cult feels like work after some time. Had a chain reaction once because I had 3 newborns who shit everywhere which made my other members throw up

tl;dr - the game is a min-max simulator, still has a lot of frustrating bugs, way too many repeating parts and important mechanics come in way too late
The game wants to be way too many things at once. To juggle everything at the same time hinders the fun. Save to say I still could find some enjoyment but because of the things listed above it¬¥s sad to see what the game could¬¥ve been...

I still enjoyed my time with it, and I'm sure I would have been utterly blown away had my expectations been lower, but the overwhelmingly positive reviews got them a bit too high.
I'll explain more in depth:


[h1]What exactly is this game?[/h1]
It's an action rogue-lite mixed with a colony management sim. You go on ""runs"" where you fight enemies to gather followers and resources, and then you go back to your cult and use those resources to grow and expand it, perform rituals, introduce new doctrines, and generally just manage your cute animal followers. Or sacrifice them for more power. Either way, the goals are the same - go on runs to grow your cult, manage your cult to make yourself stronger.


[h1]Strengths[/h1]
For most of the game, the balance between the two gameplay elements really works. Your cultists start out completely incompetent, so you gotta avoid leaving them for too long, so you really gotta consider how long you want your runs to go on, as the risk of death is far from the only problem with continuing too far. You gotta make sure your cult is as prepared as possible for a long time without their leader before you go out, and then you wanna gather as many resources as possible as quickly as possible so you can keep expanding when you return.
Your followers can starve, get sick, grow old, kill each other, dissent against you, and more. You always gotta keep an eye on what's happening back home, and when you're back home you're eager to fix everything so you can head back out. It creates a very enjoyable loop that'll make time go by ridiculously fast.
Other than that, the art style is great, there's a lot of fun humor, you sometimes have to face pretty tough choices, and the fact that you have several different ways to build up your cult means there's some replay value.


[h1]Weaknesses[/h1]
Like I said at the start of this review - things kinda started falling apart by the endgame. I didn't find the action gameplay itself all that great -
[olist]
[*]It's a little too simple - there aren't that many weapons, abilities, or enemy types, so it doesn't take very long before you see all there is to see.
[*]It's a little too easy. I'm not claiming to be some incredible gaming god, but I just found enemy attacks extremely easy to avoid (with a few exceptions). They just telegraph them very obviously, aren't that fast, and you're invulnerable while dodging so it doesn't matter what direction you go. Just press the dodge button when an enemy is very obviously about to attack, and you're pretty much never gonna get hit. Cranking the difficulty to ""hard"" only gives enemies more health and you a little less health (plus a few other things like followers aging faster, but that's hardly noticeable) which isn't much of a problem when you're rarely getting hit. (The first time I died, it was on purpose to see what happens. The second time, it was on purpose to get back to camp. The third time I really did f*ck up and got myself killed. The fourth time was during the final boss where I came in really unprepared. That's it, I only died 4 times. I've never played a roguelike where I died so rarely in over 25 hours)
[/olist]
And with the action gameplay itself not being that great, the thing that really kept the game so engaging was the need to balance the action with the management. So, once I've reached the point where my cult was fully upgraded (which happened quite a while before I reached the final boss, as I spent more time managing my cult than I did on runs, since it was more fun), the appeal very quickly dropped. The cult was pretty much completely self sufficient. I had nothing left to do at my home base, and so my favorite part of the game basically just vanished in an instant. What followed was a series of quick runs where I didn't even bother collecting resources or anything, and I just rushed through it to reach the end and get it over with.
The game could have really benefited from a longer cult-expansion tree. More buildings, more doctrines, more rituals. Enough to keep the separate gameplay elements balanced until the very end.
With this being the case, even though I spent most of the game thinking I'll do another playthrough to see what happens if I develop my cult the opposite way, I don't see myself replaying it.


Other issues - Follower quests are fun at first but start repeating themselves quite early on (how many time can you make a cult member eat poop before it stops being funny?), there was an annoying stutter that appeared after running for a long time on the Steam Deck (fixed by restarting the game), and some things took a little too long to unlock (I unlocked the tailor very close to the end of the game, and couldn't care less about what outfits my followers are wearing by that point).


[h1]Final thoughts[/h1]
I had a good time with it, and would recommend it to anyone who wants a simple, casual experience that's addictive but also easy to drop in and out of. I do think it could have been better though - much better, even - and it wouldn't take much to get it there... so, I guess the fact that it's so close to being great but isn't quite there is a little disappointing.",1708766355,1708766607,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Music is awesome. I especially love the church music during sermons. Play with headphones to appreciate it.

The rouge-like system is not punishing. You cant perma die. 

The only real issue I had with the game is you can sit at your camp for a long time and you are not bothered. It would be interesting if the other gods sent their followers to attack your camp once in a while to try and undo your plans.

I would warn though that even after enabling available light sensitivity options it is still quite taxing on the eyes.

The main story is relatively short but there is a large amount of post-game content that allows for some continued play without pointless repetition, though admittedly many of the gimmicks are kind of obnoxious in this post-game.
A large portion of achievement hunting later comes down to RNG, so if your goal is competition then you will have to deal with a fair bit of slamming your head into the wall for chance encounters.

So, I have been following this game since the developers released a demo for it during that one event for demos EDIT: It's called Next Fest. The game is a decent game, I am not knocking it but I kind of saw the plot and end climax coming a mile away from reading Faust and many of the Brothers Grimm fairy tales, from watching Ghostrider, Hellboy, Black Butler seasons 1 & 2, and Supernatural. The game is enjoyable and it is a challenge at some parts but more then anything I enjoyed, mostly, the journey in the 20-something and a half hours I played

Keeping tabs on followers while crusading is quite nice, as now the followers can kinda 'take care of themselves'. My one problem with the game is the fighting. 

  Its just flat out easy for a rouge-like. Its even a little strange as well, given how you cant look directly up and down when attacking. You get over that though pretty quick to be honest. But that doesn't help that there's really no versatility or flexibility in the tarot card you collect on your adventures, they hardly let you build off of anything outside of having more health and attack power. However I think its pretty easy to see the devs strived more for quality of life than combat. 

  Since the ""relics of the old faith"" and ""sins of the flesh"" content updates, all other problems I had with the game were fixed, taking my old score of 7/10 strait to a 9/10. I hope we see more for the game in the future.

At times the game made me feel ill to play. I feel this game is a deterrent to joining a cult because I doubt many people want to live in grass huts, eat poo, and let their selves be constantly abused by some leader or other members. This game offers you to think skeptically about things like virtues and what those mean and HOW they mean different things to different people. That's very relevant in the real world because many people like to advertise in ways like saying ""We have integrity!"". Cult of the Lamb may prompt you to reconsider religion, culture, and anywhere there is some ""leader"" or ""more powerful being/force"" than you. I would not like to play this game around too young of an age, but I know there are probably kids out there playing this. I do enjoy the artstyle and the gameplay mechanics. The fighting in this game is often very satisfying. As someone who was raised in a church that preached to me that I was less than human or good for being born a female, I am surprised to find this game as an outlet for so much aggression that I keep in check. It's also satisfying to see things like ""sermons"" and ""blessings"" and ""prayer"" being ran through the mud in this game. So in that sense, this game is very enjoyable.

Honestly, there is so much to say about this game that I don't know where to start...

- Visual is amazing and full of tiny details, it's just impossible to notice all of them the first time you play it.
- The music are great too and perfectly fit a game like this with this kind of spirit and mood.
- Don't let the art make you though that it's a game for kids, it is not!
But the game-play loop, the art and the story and all you can do in this game, all together create some weird perfect combo for a game like this.
- Replay value? yes there is
- Easy game ? yes if you select the easy difficulty, but there is a real challenge otherwise, and you can even try the don't starve collaboration/event mode where the lamb need to eat and sleep, and on top of this with a perma-death if you die from one of theses.
- there 4 main Dungeon, (biome) with their own resources, monster, visual, special things etc.
Story boss put aside, there is other bosses who sometime could look like an other one but for the most part, they are and unique.
- The number of weapons, spells, skills etc is large enough to let you play like you want.

- The follower and Cult management could be a stand alone game itself, it's like a colonies game in the game, but don't make me wrong, it's not a ""mini useless game"".
And a very good point is that you can spend a lot of time in all of this, creating a big cult of 30 followers or more, and make use of each tile in this area and customize it.
Or... you can just do the minimum and focus on effectiveness and rentability and not talking so much care of it.
You aren't forced to spend more time than you want, and for players who don't like this kind of content It's a good point.

- And I just scratched the surface... there is too much to say, so many positive stuff, good ideas, and well executed!

- Ho! just a work about accessibility, in this game there is Time, and when you are in Dungeon, the Time isn't paused for your follower in the cult area, but there is an option to make the time freeze during dungeon for players who don't like this.
-An other good point, there is a special police for Dyslexic people, it's rare to see this and I'm somehow concerned by this.
- There is more options, I will not list all of them, it's just to say that this game have some options for peoples who could need it, and you can turn them On or Off as you like.


[u]There is only two negative point for me:[/u]
- First, the middle of the cult area isn't customizable, it's not a real problem, but the ground is full off mud and grass, and if I want to use the Gold floor everywhere, I will still have this island of mud in the middle... it's ugly, and if I can understand why they didn't let us put building or decoration there, I don't understand why the floor have to stay the same :/

- Second, the ""wall"" around the cult area can't be changed.
Now with the most recent update (sin of the flesh), we can customize the inside of the temple, and if we want to try to make the cut area fit in the same mood, we can, but only for what is on the floor.

It would be a good thing to not stop there and let players go a little further, I'm sure you can make a few background inspired by the different dungeon or else and let us choose between them ^^


In conclusion, Cult of the Lamb is maybe a perfect game, and it's again a proof that big company aren't where to look for if we want innovative games, with new concept or more.

A Big Thanks to Massive Monster Team, you made an amazing game and I'm happy to have seen it and be able to play it.

The animation is nice, the art is nice, the concept is great and visuals are amazing.

The gameplay loop is bad. In the beginning it looks like it is gonna be a relaxing roguelike. Then it turns out that the village you build along with followers demand your constant attention, want to drown you in mundane chores and your ability to automate annoying tasks is extremely limited, and then it turns into one huge annoying and increasingly more irritating chore. You keep shoveling poop till the end by the way.

Around the 3rd boss someone had an amazing idea to make it into bullet hell so relaxing roguelike thing goes out of the window. Obviously when you effortlessly defeat first two bosses and get stuck on 3rd, something's off with the design.  Weapons you get at beginning of run are random, that means you can get stuck with a poor weapon, then good luck finishing it. The more weapon types you unlock, by the way, the higher is a chance that you get something bad, as number of possible weapons grows.

I can happily declare that Hell Architect has been dethroned - Cult Of The Lamb is the new king of cuteness-meets-coprophilia. 

A darkly cynical cult management sim combined with a very fun roguelike, Cult Of The Lamb has such a very unique tone that oscillates between ""adorable"" and ""hardcore Lovecraftian horror"" (with occasional detours into icky scatology) at remarkable speed. The result is bizarre and macabre in the best possible way.

My only complaint with the game is that its a little too short, which wouldn't be a huge deal if the final boss wasn't such a pushover. sure there's harder difficulties to play on after beating it, but everything sort of becomes static once it's all completed if that makes sense. like, when you're done with a character's quest, they don't feel alive anymore. like a robot that's served its purpose.

This should be told front and center in the store page, or at the very least, when getting your first follower.

The game is showing some cracks too. Quests given by people outside of your cult gives you a Fleece piece, which apart from making the game harder (Apart from the Golden Fleece, which does make the game harder but with a good advantage in return) there is no point in doing so. Or unlocking certain Tarot cards (Gameplay modifiers, by certain I mean something like 'Break rocks on touch') makes the chance for each card spread more and more for bad ones, and you only get two choices each time you obtain one in a run. This could ruin Permadeath playthroughs, which are unlocked once you finish the game.

You get more useful Fleeces unlocked once you finish the game and can use them in the endgame content, but it was 20 hours without caring about Fleece pieces, and Fleece pieces i've used on useless ones when I didn't know useful ones existed.

If you're playing Penitence Mode or Permadeath, not using the Quick Start option bugs the difficulty, and Penitence Mode disables most of the scenes and dialog between The One Who Waits and the Bishops.

The enemies are simultaneously simple and a little too easy to fight, yet whenever you are hit it is frustrating. the attacks are poorly choreographed and the hitboxes on both enemy and player attacks are poorly communicated. The artstyle, while beautiful, often fails to properly signal the difference between decoration, obstacles and enemies within runs. In general the game just has poor visibility and readability, and the constant dark filter in some stages doesn't help. movement feels ok but it is a slog backtracking through half the stage you have already completed to get to another room. often the best strategy to beat bosses is to run up to them and spam click while tanking the boss' own attacks. the tarot cards (main semi-permanent upgrades within runs) vary extremely between power, and the lack of choice within runs on the cards you can get means i was sometimes considering not unlocking new ones so as not to have a higher chance of drawing bad cards. 
I also encountered several bugs, some that were fairly game breaking. I have a fairly good gaming setup and the game often has lag spikes mid combat when nothing else is particularly running in the background. at least on two different occasions i have been softlocked, and once the game just crashed after beating the final boss, without allowing me to save. 
I don't know if that was purposeful, but overall it left a bad taste in my mouth. it is a mediocre action game with a fairly good base building element incorporated, but in a lot of ways it is unpolished and not really worth my limited time alive on planet earth. (and possibly more importantly, my limited wallet.) I can see other people enjoying this game, but I can't honestly recommend it - at least in its current state.
TLDR: Like, it's not bad, and i did end up playing until i beat the boss, but unlike other games of similar genres i have no desire to replay at all, and i find it hard to believe I will remember the game or its story long into the future. It's definitely a pretty game in a lot of ways, but it is mechanically and thematically boring and mediocre.",1707927773,1707928563,False,19,6,0.509920835494995117,4,True,False,False

This game takes the concept of cult leadership and turns it into a wildly unique and captivating experience that's both darkly humorous and deeply engaging.

The art style is striking, with its mix of cute and creepy elements, and the storyline is compelling, keeping you hooked with its twists and turns.

What really sets this game apart is how it blends strategy, action, and simulation elements so seamlessly. Managing your cult requires a careful balance of resources and follower loyalty, while the exploration and combat portions are thrilling and challenging.

In summary, Cult of the Lamb is a brilliantly crafted game that offers something truly unique.

I was immediately hooked to say it simply. The dungeons are randomized, making every run unique and never becoming boring. The dungeons do definitely have a difficulty spike, but you can remedy this with some practicing and strategy. The taking care of your cult aspect is fun since you can customize just about everything to your liking. You can also interact with your followers which is personally my favorite thing to do. 

And the music? It's heavenly. Massive Monster definitely made the best decision when they had River Boy make their music. It's so unique and stands out compared to the soundtracks of other games. I sometimes go out of my way to enter dungeons just to stand there and bop to the music, it's just that good!

Overall, you should absolutely buy this game if you have the chance and the money, it's a must buy for sure. 10/10",1707760989,1707760989,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I recommend starting on normal and then doing 2 other saves with hard and the next difficulty to soak in the experience.

Gameplay 9/10 (variety of weapons and combat options on crusades makes it so gameplay is not as repetitive. able to customize how you fight based on what fleece you wear / managing your cult and choosing how you wish to run it is a fun and experience. taking a point off for not that much areas to explore on the map)

Art 10/10 (its a pretty ass game with a captivating art style)

Music 8/10 (I liked it at first but after a bit, i just turned it off and played while listening to spotify).

Or, alternatively -- do you want to make them eat poop, put them in prison for no reason, and occasionally sacrifice them to a giant tentacle for being annoying? Well, this game has all of that!

There's a nice balance between micromanaging/caretaking and battling/scavenging. If you want to give your most special followers a unique outfit (which helps a lot with your overall cult happiness!), then you need to do some crusades (scavenges/battles) to gather the materials. If you want a strength boost in crusades, you need to spend time helping your followers level up so they can become powerful demons to assist you. It's very intentionally balanced so each activity supports the others.

This game has excellent accessibility settings. I LOVE that you can entirely disable the timing-based minigames, especially for fishing. You can also customize the screen shake, depth of field, and chromatic aberration, so if those kinds of effects bother you, no problem! I hope more games add accessibility settings like this.

I began playing shortly after launch and the new cult mechanics provided by free major content updates are far and away some of the best I've ever seen. This game's developers deserve all of their success.

The roguelike gameplay needs some work. The lack of choice of weapon in the beginning of crusades feels odd, as I prefer to main Gauntlets/Blunderbuss yet can never seem to find them and thus have less fun throughout. The mechanics and over the top visual styling don't really lead to precise gameplay all that much.

Regardless of this fact, I'd say it's for sure one of the best games i've ever played. It's fun, has heart, and embraces its theming with open arms.

The art is cutesy, detailed to surprising levels of sophistication and the animations all flow very well, improving more and more with each update.
The music feels perfect for each and every setting you come across and adds to the overall upbeat feel of CotL
The gameplay is kickass, it's fun! The combat is smooth and easily learned but some enemies and elements of gameplay are a bit more intricate to master. The cult aspect (especially since the new update ""Sins of the Flesh"") is also lots of fun, interacting with and managing your cult can absorb tonnes of time without you re entering a dungeon and you can actually grow slightly attached to the charming recruits you will surely come across.

The pitch alone had me scratching my head - a lamb leading a cult? It's like someone threw darts at a board of ""least likely leaders"" and hit the jackpot. Yet, there I was, captivated by the bizarre allure of orchestrating my own fluffy-led doomsday cult.

The game's uncanny ability to draw you into its woolly, sacrificial world is nothing short of black magic. As the story unraveled and my cult grew, I found myself gleefully navigating the fine line between divine shepherd and baa-d influence. It's a rollercoaster ride where you're not just along for the ride; you're the one laying the tracks, and somehow, the train is both on fire and serving refreshments.

""Cult of the Lamb"" isn't just a game; it's a masterclass in how to make following a lamb into the abyss seem like a reasonable weekend activity.

Not to mention, it is INSANELY cute. The little noises the cult members make are adorable, & the art team on this game has done an amazing job combining creepy cult elements with cute little animal guys. The themes blend seamlessly visually and auditory. I have nothing but compliments for the art & sound team!

The game does have a couple glitches here and there, but I've been playing this game on and off since 2022 and it hasn't bothered me a lot. I haven't run into any glitches in 2024 that breaks the game fully, only minor annoyances. (Although I acknowledge they probably still exist...) There's also a lot more postgame content now due to the free updates, and the devs are pretty good about fixing bugs regularly.

There is a lot of things that I enjoyed about the game, but first ill start with the devs. The devs actually care about the game. Rare, I know. Just today at the time of writing this, lots of people were complaining that one of the achievements that you had to get after completing post game, was extremely hard to obtain as the room that you needed, barely spawned in [spoiler] meat room [/spoiler]. They actually changed it, and I was finally able to get it to spawn and finish all of the achievements. Besides that, the game play, is good, at the start it will seem confusing and like you can't keep up, but after a few runs and upgrades, you will get it down. The art is fantastic, I enjoy the 2D/3D art of the game, and it shows how much more they could do with the animations of the characters with them being 2D. The one thing that I found annoying was not being able to get descriptions of quests. Some of the times I would skip dialogue and a random quest would show up, which you can't even get a description for, so I have to search in the wiki how to do it. The bosses are easy but also challenging in different ways. 
This game is a roguelite, so it is random every time you go in to the dungeon, which is good and bad. It provides a random different experience every time, but sometimes you are a lot more powerful than others, and it feels kinda luck based with powers you will get. In general it is balanced, but for some of the achievements, I would keep resetting to get a good run to complete them. 
Overall 8/10.
Just needs some improvements with quests, such as descriptions if you click on them and small patches to random things that felt clunky. Otherwise, would be perfect.",1707424571,1707424571,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b]This is a story about wrong expectations, the game is not that bad after all.[/b]

Heard quite a lot about this game. Like it's a decent roguelike, thanks the media, I guess, and, after trying Hades, I've decided to try this one, too.

[i]Oh, boy, how wrong I was, thinking that this game was about combat and adventure.[/i]

The game is positioned as a roguelike where you can also control your own cult. In fact, this is the game where you must build your cult with the opportunity to fight.

Most of the time you spend cleaning poops in the camp and feeding everyone. Of course, there are buildings, rituals, shrines, blah-blah-blah. And that's it, folks, that's the core gameplay. 

And, as I said a bit earlier, Cult of the Lamd is not a bad game! It's just a bloody (literally) Stardew Valley. 
Very nice visual style ‚Äî check.
Own farm with flowers and fruits and whatever ‚Äî check.
Reputation (kind of) system ‚Äî check. 
Mines to gain resources and ocasionally kill someone ‚Äî check. 

Art work is monumental, though. It's obvious from the promo materials, but inside the game every art element feels great. Work on impact and combat itself is also quite impressive. Really. It's a shame that this is just a small part of the experience.

I include my old review here to showcase how much developers have improved on past issues, they optimised the game a lot. Running the game lately, I ran into no problems and way less bugs. The added content is not only cosmetic but adds to the main gameplay, story and building mechanics. Quality of life changes have been added. Content that was originally locked behind a Twitch connection feature has been made accessible ingame. This game has had an overall improvement being now more than double of what it was before in regards of content, playability and fun. Due to the new additions, it now can speak to different kinds of audiences and playstiles, being the Binding of Isaac-like we always wished for as well as a fun base builder with cult implementations. The astethics and world design are a big strongpoint that adds to the mix. 

Big recommendation!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Warning: Outdated Review Below]
First game I genuinely wrote over ten bug reports each for a different bug. Everytime I boot the game it doesn't hold up longer than half an hour before deteriorating into an unplayable mess: I freeze in fights or spells do not trigger, the events also freeze, yet in camp it is way worse: I regularly find ways to bug myself out of bounds without trying. Followers are buggy, won't do their tasks or don't memorize relationships, the cooking pot grows buggy as heck when other processes go on in the mean time, that's why I don't even have stone mines or wood sheds anymore and don't dare to collect money from the shrines. The scarecrows do not show when they are filled or are simply ignored by birds even when in range. When I sacrifice a high ranked follower, the 3k gold output holds your game hostage for over a minute! or it just freezes and crashes instead. 
This game is a buggy mess and badly coded, also proven by it's enormous size compared to the assets and functions. 
By now it is clear that the developers do not know how to handle it themselves, given that some bug reports I rendered almost a year ago still are recent. My guess is the localisation on different hardware and ambition of adding content conflicts with the fixing they have long promised to get going with. Patch notes show integral problems solved, that are pathetic and shouldn't have been there from the get-go. Added content so far is so unseeming, that I didn't notice a change since I first booted the game shortly after it's release, the Halloween event added 10 minutes of no-brainer grinding.
And forget any sense of convenience or quality gaming experience. Everywhere I turn in this game, there are unoptimised or unnecessarily annoying parts, that could have easily been fixed with a little time and consideration. A giant quantity of missed potential. Not to mention that the content provided is way too short for the price, the experience doesn't even start before it is already over - and I played on different difficulties and made two different cults using all options given. You know, every half of an hour that it let me play before exploding.
Not to mention that solely cosmetic DLCs for a quarter of the initial price and Twitch connection features are shady a.f. 

This is a game I really liked the idea of and tried my best to get the most of. But the game itself has hindered me from continuing to play it. It is literally unplayable for me at this point. I do fulfill the requirements needed, plus the settings on all the lowest options, I prayed to a three eyed cat, did not temper with anything and had no mods ever installed. This game is as I bought it and it is unplayable. This is unacceptable.

First negative review, I've ever written. More salt than in the wheels of this games functions.

PS: Making integral parts of your mediocre gameplay skip-able is one of the worst fixes for bad gameplay I have ever seen. 
Instead of actively triggering fans and basking in praise, you could try to bug fix your mess. Or set the price to an appropriate of 1 Dollar.",1674238667,1707307550,True,0,0,0.501196920871734619,0,True,False,False

Inspired by the classics, (Zelda series, TBOI and a bunch of other Devolver games), but also achieves so much. Lots of versatility when it comes to gameplay, you have these Binding of Issac-esque arenas with destructible environments and varying sizes and difficulties of enemies paired with these bullet hell driven boss fights, of course, sprinkled with those aforementioned roguelite elements. Then you head back to base and now you have a cul-, I mean, colony, to take care off, making sure they get fed, get some good shuteye, get them to praise the lord, become sacrifices and of course make them work for a living in your base. You can also travel to different areas in this small map that provide you with a gambling addiction, a fishing addiction, a shopping addiction and maybe you'll even find some cool secrets along the way. There is nothing all that bad about this game, it's really good and has some replayability to it. If I were to complain about something, it would probably be the boss fights, they all play the same up until the final fight; a lot of it is just dodging the same attack patterns while also avoiding the boss' peons, not really all that difficult despite how menacing the game makes them look. It's a small nitpick for me, I just really enjoyed the versatility on display but thought this could improve for maybe a future installment or a huge update.

In all seriousness: This game is a heartfelt marriage of Animal crossing-esque village/town life, and Binding of Isaac roguelike combat. These two genres bring very different audiences, but Cult of The Lamb caters well to both: you can raise and lower the difficulty of the combat to suit your needs and what you prefer to focus on. 

The art style is adorable and simple: the sexual aspect is portrayed cartoonishly, and there is little traces of violent bloodshed. Hell, the only blood I can recall is on character designs. Speaking of: every design is adorable and thoughtful. My favorite character is Leshy: his boss music is groovy, his gameplay mechanics are appropriately simple as the first boss, and [spoiler] you can make him a follower! He makes THE CUTEST SQUEAKIEST SQUEAKS EVER. I have put him in the wedding suit and kiss that squeaky boi every day. [/spoiler] Also there is a short about him tryna cook, and it's so silly.

Anyway, the soundtrack is bop after bop. Every combat theme is filled with power and confidence. The cult area OSTs are adorable and sweet; that lust festival OST is a certified buns-shakin' beat.

I do think this game needs a bugs patch and general adjustment to quality-of-life. It would be so useful if we had a follower call system. Perhaps a way to summon them via the followers list. I also think a crowd-calling method to gather them (like a bell?) would allow us to easily bless/inspire/intimidate. 

Additionally I think follower quests should be weighted. Refusing a minor request (such as feeding poop to a follower...) should not impact faith as badly as, say, refusing a marriage request. It is comically frustrating to be forced into feeding my favorite follower poop, or murder my spouse, or build 3 decorations, simply because I do not want my followers to dissent.

It's the perfect match of a Rogue-Lite Dungeon Crawler and Base Builder for me.

Additionally the music is great, the visuals are gorgeous and cute, the fights feel very good, there is a lot of stuff to do (until a certain point) and so on.

There are some technical difficulties though. I'd experienced some bugs and the occasional crash, but it didn't bother me too much.

---

Well after a long time, all the bugs seem to be fixed.
And they dropped 2 free updates that added lots of new content. Thats so nice!

They only release some cosmetic stuff accompanied with the free updates to help them fund further development. So if you have some spare change and enjoy the content, give them some love.

---

The only thing that bothers me with the ""Sins of the Flesh"" update is the Achievement regarding the Lore. Especially one piece of lore (I'm not gonna spoil it) requires lots of grinding because you have to get one specific thing on a crusade, which unfortunately is also pretty rare. 

And, if you're already done with all the available content, this leads to lots of mindless crusades to hopefully get this one thing that you need.

It's fun and I CANT STOP PLEASE YOU GOTTA HELP ME. ITS BEEN 35 HOURS AND THAT MUSIC AND GAMEPLAY IS HYPNOTIC. ITS TOO FUN.

Gameplay:
Base Building is solid and fun. Followers are like children you nourish and manage, but adds a layer of micromanagement that would catch some people's fancy. Combat is okay. I can see how latest DLCs have been slowly improving on it, but it's simple Roguelite mechanics make it fun enough to not anger you, nor to bore you. It's an okay balance.

Music:
It's been living rent free in my head for 8 days. I CANT STOP LISTENING TO IT. FR THE MUSIC AND SOUND DESIGN IS GOD TIER. LOVE THE MUSIC AND SFX TO BITS.

Difficulty:
It is easy for a bit... till you hit the endgame content. It gets a tad more difficult at that point and your reflexes are put to the test. It got better, I'll tell you that.

This game was very cute, fun, and full of fast paced combat! It had a little bit of everything I love honestly.
I'm not much of a dungeon crawler player but the fighting in this was very smooth and quick without being janky, so it was very satisfying to fight the monsters. My favourite was definitely the final boss, it was a good balance of bullet hell and kiting without being so difficult that I had to redo it multiple times (Which I hate cause it breaks immersion). Building the cult was also fun, although it got a little grindy at the end but I think that's just because I died to the bosses a couple times and had overpopulated my town saving everyone I met. I'd complain about the price to gameplay ratio but you can just tell they put a lot of effort in for such a small developer, the graphics are stunning and the cult has a lot of funny dialogue so its definitly quality over quantity in my books.
TLDR:

If you are looking for a casual game get an actual casual game like Stardew Valley etc. If you are looking for a roguelike then get a roguelike with good combat like idk, Dead Cells or Isaac etc.

This game is a mix of taking care of your ""cult"" (more like daycare for cute anthropomorphic creatures) but your followers can't be left alone for longer than literally 5 min until you get the rituals to extend it to like 20. What do you do with that free 20 min? You mostly go into the dungeons to fight but the combat is very mid. Some enemies telegraph projectiles some don't, most weapons feel the same with fast attack weapons being FAR better than the slower ones. btw, you can only go through 4 stages at maximum, after that it's just going back home.

btw, difficulty levels are there but those also affect the cult so if you want your cuties to b**ch even more often than usual you can do that but it's just adding more busywork not real difficulty. In combat difficulty is just the usual HP bloat. Honestly after playing on hard for like 20h I switched to easy and never looked back.

imo if you want this just get it on sale and don't expect anything spectacular because the edgy cult stuff wears off fast and what you are left with is just 20 toddler-minded followers to babysit and doing mid dungeons on your breaks.",1707060631,1707060748,False,1,0,0.466484278440475464,0,True,False,False

Game itself is good but after-game/endgame looks boring. 
The music is good, the sound effects are also good, battle mechanics are good ( except hammer, it is awful ) 
The early game is interesting, a lot of things that players can do in a cult and various locations with bosses.
First 20 hours enjoyed the game but: 
Endgame had a lot of grind without any particular reason, no new boss or exciting things, last 3 to 4 hours of playing the game are just waiting to day change to do rituals and farm sin.
Lore looks interesting but feels like was added for just taking long time players in-game ( random, nothing changes after collecting them all )
The last DLC ( Cult of the Lamb: Sinful Pack ) is not well synchronized with the origin game because sin can be obtained after a long AFK, chance to get it from the bosses is low which is boring.

I love how you gotta balance base building management and crusade runs. My favorite is the base aspect as there really isn't a limit on what you can do since some things can be sustained without going on runs.

Now that I'm on post-game, the part where I'm having a problem is getting fertilizers since I have the upgraded janitors, and seeds as I always seem to run out as plants don't have 100% drop rate. (Can be gotten in different ways, I'm just too lazy LOL)

The only negative part that I'd say is the occasional crashes and lag spikes, as well as the SUPER LOW FPS on the Divine Inspiration Tree (seems like a general problem if you don't have a beast of a device, but manageable since you rarely open it and once you finish the tree its nonexistent).

On crusades this is a rogue-like game. Similar to games like ""Binding of Issac"" and ""Moonlighter"". Fight a lot of enemies in a procedurally generated dungeon. Gain power-ups that can help you on that crusade and resources that can help you later. 

Outside of crusades you will have to manage your cult. This includes making sure your followers don't starve, have beds to sleep in, and do not lose faith in you. You may direct them to gather resources for you that will either benefit your cult or benefit you on crusades.

Masterclass in game design and aesthetics (graphics, OST). Lacking in combat and writing. Play this is if you like being addicted to gameplay loops and having the game lead you to make the most fucked up decisions ever.

UPD: On my second playthrough and I reached a point where there is no motivation to do anything. Upgrading the base? For what? The variety of things you can do in your base and with your followers seems limited, even with updates -- surface level, visual. You just wait for upgrades to ""automate"" your base, this automation is boring, limited and surface level, too. There is no challenge in keeping your followers in good terms with you. I could use my followers for bonuses but what's the point if I can kill any boss in 5 seconds by spamming a spell on the highest difficulty?

Concept:
It's a game about becoming a cult leader, at first you care about your followers, then you start using them for your own cause, then you drug them up and murder them when they annoy you. And it always pushes you to do more.
Right from the start the game tells you: there is no story and no characters, except for the most flat and zero-dimensional ones. Later they seem to try to slap ""lore"" on top of it. The symbolism and ideas are quite cool sometimes. I think I could sum it up like this: There is nothing worth spoiling even if one wanted to spoil the game.

Gameplay:
Have a dozen small and immediate tasks to always keep you busy and engaged. Micro-managing your resources and followers is fun. Building and managing the cult is also fun. Once you get to your second playthrough and exhaust all the quirky quests and their shock value, it also gets boring.
Combat is generic and sluggish, but has a bit of depth to it. Also extremely easy, If you get a few cards or buffs and a correct spell you can literally just spam invincibility or tank bosses. Controls are crap, especially on keyboard.

Replayability:
You can get different cult upgrades and abilities, perma-death and other added difficulties. There is really only one path you can take when building a base, unless you like decorating A LOT. There is also artificial randomness to all decorative drops.
The hardest difficulty doesn't make the combat much harder, I think it increases wait times/costs for upgrades, lol, annoying. At least the bosses don't die in 10 seconds, upd: nvm, they still do.

Combat feels much smoother and more enjoyable with the inclusion of the Heavy Attacks and Relics in Relics of the Old Faith, and Sins of the Flesh takes the base building aspects of the game and makes them feel much more complete. The mechanics aren't too deep, but Cult of the Lamb takes its base mechanics and manages to combine them to create a game I can play for hours after beating the postgame. The difficulty options are nice, letting less experienced players enjoy the game without getting frustrated, while providing some challenge on replays of the game.

In particular, a noticeable lack of invincibility after being hit on crusades means you can go from full health to dead in a few seconds on harder difficulties, not to mention the absurd difficulty of the third major boss (how do you even dodge the three fireball lines in phase 1?) 

In my opinion, this game's main strengths come from the constant updates and the dedication of the developers to constantly improve the game. It went from a game I enjoyed at launch to something I play regularly after the updates, and I feel like it can get even better. I have to admit I'm not very good at ranking things objectively and without bias, but I love this game and think it's worth a shot if you have the money to spend.",1706894764,1706894849,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Its incredibly fun and perfect for those into cuteness juxtaposed with dark and sinister themes. Game play is addictive, well balanced, and satisfying. Creating your cult the way you want it is so fun. Do you want it wholesome loving, or twisted and brutally violent? Do you want to work with your followers, or have them with for you? I can play this game over and over and still find value in a play through.
I do have some criticisms though.
The new weapon the Blunderbuss is really bad. It feels incredibly weak and can be very frustrating to use. The reload mechanic makes sense, but it gets really annoying when I run out of ammo and try to shoot, just for the reload progress to reset. It sounds really fun on paper to try to time your shots and keep a rhythm to your attacks, but if you mess up once, you lose all momentum. That on top of its pitiful attack damage. ON THE CONTRARY, the blunderbuss is ESSENTIAL if you use the Fleece of the Berserker. Its actually overpowered with that fleece. The range keeps you safe from risking getting hit, and its ability slowing down time and increasing the range makes any battle room a breeze. With that said, the blunderbuss needs to be reworked a little.
The alcohol addition feels tame. Its very funny and I get enjoyment out of it, but it feels useless at times.
With all the new building additions the size of your cult feels very tiny. I constantly have to rearrange. I'm thinking of doing another play through without decorating my cult, which sucks to say because you can make some really cool looking cults. A size increase would be more than welcomed.

Overall, this game is great. Every update gets me excited. The developers obviously care for their game and continue adding additions that fans love. If you don't have it, I would recommend doing so.",1706745711,1706745711,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h3][b]Review[/b][/h3]
The Cult of the Lamp is a merge of dungeon crawler, craft and crew management game. The game presents pretty solid setting using religious themes with a satire telling. The conflict between cute visuals and vile attitudes of the characters actually works pretty well for the theme. Also, this blend makes the setting more fun to consume. The game starts with a scene of our dear lamb being a sacrifice for the elder Bishops. The lamb, who is also the last of its kind, has been chosen for this ritual and being victimised by the followers of the bishops. Right at the death moment of the lamb, the forsaken Bishop (One Who Waits) occurs in front of him and tells our character to rise and get revenge of him. Then our character comes back from death and slays the followers. That way our lamb starts its crusade against the bishops and we start to collect pawns to create our cult. With this basic premise the game sets our goal to kill the bishops and manage our cult.
As you can guess from the explanations above the gameplay consists of two separate parts. At one hand we are going to crusades against other cults. This part plays as a classic isometric action title with some bullet hell challenges. In these crusades our character can carry one weapon and speel. There are several types of weapons in the game. Also, few of them have some little gimmicks to vary the gameplay. But the most obscure difference between them is attack speed, damage output, and weapon reach which is kind of dull for this kind of gameplay which requires repetitive gameplay. This dullness presents in the skill department as well. There are few skill types. To decrease this issue developers tried to give some spice with adding some weapon and spell upgrades such as having a critical hit chance or poison possibility on hit that you can get during the cult management part. Also, there are tarot cards you can collect each run that gives some advantages to you. These tarots cards and weapon upgrades actually bring good variety for gameplay, but they‚Äôre not enough to keep the gameplay fresh after a while.
Each bishop has their own biome and their own three followers at their service. In each crusade we choose a bishop‚Äôs biome, that way we start to explore a randomly prepared map. These maps have some similarities to the ones you can see in Slay the Spire. This is a good addition to gameplay. Each stop in maps provides you a place to explore, shopping spot, healing spot or another event to explore. This way the difficulty of the runs or the materials you can get during each run changes depending on your choice. Bishops have servants (Mini Bosses) three for each. Which makes plenty of variety on the boss section, and worth mentioning.
The management part of the game has similar mechanics most of the same types of games has. You gather pawns and materials during your crusades for crafting new things and building a cult. Then you gain some buffs for your crusades. Each pawn has their loyalty and they also have a life cycle. To implement this life cycle, they included a day-night cycle. This also increases difficulty for the management, so some might like this. There is a build tree for you to get new upgrades, but you need to have some Devotion as a currency. The need of Devotion increases with each upgrade you make. As a result, it becomes tiresome at some point. This issue occurs for every element of the management part. So later the game suffers to let you get upgrades for the next run. As a problem these blooms during the mid game at most. During you have some decent number of pawns you realise you need to lookout for them, and to do this and go into another run you realise you need to automize some of the things like making food for followers. But it‚Äôs not that simple if you haven‚Äôt spent your devotion on this department. You also have a church to pray, do some rituals and some other things that can give some buff your cult, village management or crusades. 
Lastly, the team behind the game makes a decent thing to update it constantly with free contents. They added a kind of New Game+ mod after beating the game. Also, last update lets you make babies in the cult, so it doesn‚Äôt need to add anything more. Right? Jokes aside it‚Äôs definitely a fun addition and the team knows what goes nice with the theme.

I will say! I wish that there were more in depth upgrades for combat and I have been encountering a few bugs here and there. I also maxed out all upgrades super quickly on normal difficulty. (Right before fighting the 3rd boss I had quite literally everything unlocked)

- Extremely polished
- Good graphics
- Good sound design, voice acting and OST
- (low quality) dopamine factory
- A good blend of roguelike and management mechanics

Cons
- Lacklustre writing
- Overal all mediocre management gameplay
- Poor roguelike gameplay
      - Roguelikes runs depend too much on RNG.
      - No synergy between relics and curses and weapons
      - Over time a diluted pool of said items
      - Lack of consistent and somewhat predictable health replenishment mechanic (unless blessed by RNG

The animations, the sound design and soundtrack are all very charming amusingly contrasting with the dark themes of the game in which you'll play as a lamb forced to become a cult leader in the name of a demon who saved your life for a price
In your cult you decide of what is right and what isn't, work hard to make your followers happy, or make sure they never dare to question their place. As you make your clut flourish you will be tasked to grow your fighting powers in order to crush the opposing cults who dread the return of the demon they chained away.

It doesn't bring anything new to the table. It wasn't the first to make a colony sim, or bullet hell, or horror theme + cutesy art style. However, using a combination of the three(and never leaning too hard into any aspect), Cult of the Lamb makes a fun and casual game that you can reasonably beat in a few days. 

I like the art style, which semi-downplays the eldritch horrors you're consistently exposed to, and the barely better living conditions of the colony you return to. Characters are interesting, wacky, and memorable. Making all the characters basically speak Simlish was a good call. I do feel like they leaned a bit too hard on poop jokes. 

The music is memorable and meets the style of the game. It fits in 90% of areas, except for boss fights. Combat with the Bishops and the final boss felt a little underwhelming, and I ended up muting music for those parts and putting on other OST's in the background. 

The bullet hell aspect has a good foundation. I normally don't play that genre of game, so I can't say much about it other than that I like it. Challenging, rewarding, fun, and not too punishing. 

The colony sim side of the game is relatively simple to it's peers in the genre, but keeping the good bits. Managing food, faith, and sanitation can be challenging, but become less of a problem as you gain more options. Doctrine is also made very well, with simple ""one or the other"" decisions driving just how you plan to be a leader. You could be the benevolent and beloved leader who guides hand in hand with your subjects, or a (as your boss suggests) a brutal draconian dictator who keeps their victims alive long enough to be useful and murder/eat/sacrifice them to a dark god when they are no longer. Gameplay significantly changes depending on what you choose. Also, despite their appearance, your subjects actually aren't rock stupid and require little handholding. You can order them to perform a job, but if there's no more work or were never ordered in the first place, they will (usually) find something else to do by themselves. 

I would recommend it if you're dipping your toes for the first time into the game genres mentioned above, or want a game that doesn't require tens of hours to become proficient in.",1706674418,1706674418,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Bosses are hardish, with right weapons, relics, and curses it's pretty easy to kill a boss. Dodge mechanic works well. Controller works good, but mouse arguably is easier for combat.

This game requires ALOT of time for Followers. It's easy to get distracted trying to Min-Max followers and eventually food becomes a huge issue. 

There's no casual way to get an abundance of food, so after 30 followers abusing Tier 2 scarecrows and Missionaries are crucial to even be able to progress the story without followers starving to death. 
 
Farms help as well and make sure to stockpile on bones. Name each follower that you want to appear first in Character Select Screen with a Numeral in the beginning of their name so that you don't have to scroll for them.

She watched in awe as their small group turned into a very fearsome, powerful, and influential sect that slayed those who opposed the great leader‚Äînamely the four Bishops of the Old Faith and The One Who Waits. It wasn't easy and with every new follower indoctrinated, new problems arise and one of them is in a form of an otter from Anchordeep. Jultymer did nothing but obey and worship the cult leader without question, always lowering her head as she is naive and faint-hearted. The compassionate cult leader noticed this and reassured her time after time and when she finally found her voice, someone started hating her for it. Pamerbre, a hot tempered otter noticed the weak Jultymer climbing the ranks and it did not sit well with him so he started making her pay for it.

[i]Pamerbre looked at Jultymer, and in his eyes, she recognized a hate big enough, wide enough, and deep enough to match her own. A hate you could drown in like a vat of wine.[/i] The small arguments escalated into full blown fist fights but none of them were punished. The tolerant and tenderhearted cult leader can only sigh and break off the fight, but this cannot go on. One time, the leader was a little too late to get in between the two of them so Jultymer got injured badly, and while she was healing all she could think about is how to permanently stop Pamerbre's ill doing. She has a plan and all she needs to do is to ask the leader, a fight to the death! A fight pit ritual! This will settle everything once and for all. But the ever benevolent leader have different plans for the two of them. Instead of using violence, the cult leader decided to make them mates. Jultymer is utterly dumbfounded, speechless even and the same can be said for Pamerbre. The poor innocent Unique Corn was damned after he became stupidly drunk thrice just to extract his Sin, something that is needed for the mating ritual that was bound to fail. Oh, it did fail but the cult leader is very persistent so he tried, and tried, and tried again. This time the cult leader has gotten clever in extracting sins and from 0% to to 50% success rate, Jultymer and Pamerbre gave in and produced an offspring. A tiny egg that the cult leader adored. He couldn't leave the settlement for a while since the egg needed to be tended to but he didn't mind, he treated that egg as his own as it fully hatched into a child‚Äîa child Jultymer and Pamerbre didn't care for as they pick up where they left and that is to antagonise each other. As Pamerbre continue picking fights despite the cult leader's effort, he had to make a tough decision. A choice to sacrifice Pamerbre to reopen Silk Cradle, and with that, peace and order have returned in the community.

TL;DR: Two of my followers won't stop fighting so I had an amazing idea of making them mate. I thought it won't work because they are enemies and there's 0% chance to breed. At first at least. I'm nothing if not persistent. Their baby is the first baby in my cult so I was really happy when I manage to pull through.

Fun game, my children love it I will highly recommend this cult of the lamb game. The little lamb guy is very cute and the game is fun, not too easy and not too challenging. Normally games like this make me want to rip my ball hairs out with tweezers, but this one doesn't and it's a nice change, however I haven't played on harder difficulties yet so maybe it's actually infuriating, but if you play normal as the developers intended, I think that I will have a good time with playing the game, which by the way is called Cult of the lamb.

Don't get me wrong, the ""dungeon-crawling"" aspect of this game is e a s y. I play enough of these types of games to go ahead and start on the ""hard"" difficulty and frankly, if I do another save file/there's another update in the future, I'm going to try for the next-hardest. 

But I keep coming back to this one. While it may not have the depth of story that a game like Hades does, its graphics/art, mechanics, and sound/music design are all great, and despite having more hours clocked on Hades, I've only restarted Hades maybe twice. I've run into a visual or audio bug here or there, but nothing that makes things unplayable, and the resource gathering/dungeon loop while time still passes for your Cult is very satisfying. Unlike Hades, small crawls only last me maybe ten minutes max and then I'm spending at least if not more time at the base arranging and managing things and all in all this game just hits all the highlights of replayability for me.",1706568157,1706568157,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
-  The game consistently introduces new elements, keeping the gameplay fresh and engaging. This approach enhances replayability and maintains player interest over time.
- The combination of action-roguelite mechanics with base management elements offers a balanced and absorbing gameplay experience. 
-  The game‚Äôs art style is a standout feature, striking a perfect balance between adorable and ominous. The Dev team leans on this even in social media and does amazing! (CoL cartoon when)

Cons:
-  While the integration with Twitch adds a layer of interactivity and community engagement, it suffers from occasional glitches and connection errors that can disrupt the gaming experience.
- Although enjoyable, the combat system and base management aspects lack depth compared to other titles in similar genres choosing a more basic version of both instead of mastery of either.
- Some players might find the game's loop of dungeon crawling and base management to become repetitive over time, especially after the mid-game when most upgrades and features have been explored.

Conclusion:
 ""Cult of the Lamb"" is a commendable title that will delight players looking for an inventive and aesthetically pleasing gaming experience. I think it is very franchisable and I hope we get to see more come from this wonderful world Massive Monster made. I give it 18/20 Followers ready to sacrifice.",1706567066,1706567066,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It pulled me in by reminding me of a childhood fantasy of me and my friends all living in a little community together. Those fantasies never included cult stuff and sacrifice, though, haha.

The cult management side of the game is cute and fairly easy. You really do just organize a little village, really. You can treat your followers as resources to grow faster, but I didn't really do much of that and found the game works just as well without much of it. You can absolutely play and roleplay at your own pace in that regard.

The combat side of the game is very well done! People say it's similar to Hades, but I've never played that. Instead, I'll compare it to Darkwood's combat for anyone also in the beta of that. Everything feels viable and fun, whatever you're given, and it does get fairly challenging. Especially in the post-game. Even here, you can pace yourself however you like! I actually struggled with some boss fights because I was going too fast and should've slowed down to properly dodge some shot patterns.

I have almost 50 hrs on Cult of the Lamb but once I finish it and get all the achievements, I most likely will not start a new save file and replay it. 

Cult of the Lamb is like if Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing, Hades, and Moshi Monsters had a love child

The game itself is beautiful, the story is intriguing, and I love the way the characters are designed, but I personally am not a fan of the repetitive dungeon-crawling to finish the main story and side stories.  However, I LOVE the farming and base-building aspects, along with the small amount of fishing. You can also marry your followers, and they can have sex and create amazing baby followers who can really benefit your cult, but that's pretty much it.

I created a dystopian hellscape of State-supplied food, medical care, funeral & religious services, luxury single apartments, and social welfare programs, all while enforcing a reasonable rate of taxation. Truly, the depravity of the Satanic knows no bounds. 

Memes aside, this game's actually pretty great. It's like a cute, scaled down version of Binding of Isaac, where you can lean into/out of the more f**ked up stuff. Like yeah, you can create a cannibalistic murder-necromancy cult if you want, but you can also create a fairly peaceful/naturalistic one with high living standards too. Base building ties in pretty well, there's a good gameplay loop of running a dungeon, then spending 1-2 days afterwards tending to your base and maybe exploring a bit. Dungeons are short & last approx. 6 - 12 minutes, though Isaac fans may lament the lack of sick combat metal. 

There's a lot to go over, so let's get to it.

General:

-Very cute aesthetic, Lamb especially so. Game's like a mini Binding of Isaac, but not nearly as gross. Varying levels of disturbing/uncanny stuff that you can lean into or out of

-Base building is fairly simple. I'm not always great with artsy construction, but even then I was able to create some pretty eye-catching stuff. Could use some QOL though, like being able to move building tiles before they're fully built & not having to re-enter the base building menu constantly. Additionally, I found the wood & stone buildings break way too quickly for my liking, and the main shrine could use more devotion cap. Late game it was being filled every 30s or so

-Stability started noticeably dipping during NG+, and got to the point of crashing/softlocking every 3rd or 4th dungeon run. Same goes for audio bugs. Notable examples include a repeating ""hit"" sound after summoning skeletons during a boss fight (persisting all the way to the main menu screen), cultists constantly talking during animations, and getting locked in a dungeon room after defeating a possessed cultist

-Lots of animations but only some can be skipped, frankly they ALL need an option to be skipped/sped up. Beyond annoyances of seeing the same things over and over again, some events later into the game are time sensitive. It's quite infuriating being stuck in a long ""cultist levelling up"" animation while you can hear two others trying to kill each other off-screen

-Regarding the alternate Don't Starve game mode that introduces hunger and sleep requirements: I liked the general sense of urgency it introduced & played my second full run on this mode, but I would have liked the ability to refill the meters mid-dungeon. Like if you killed the boss and had the option to refill both as a loot option. As it stands it basically constrains you to a single dungeon run, which is a problem for NG+'s ""Purgatory"" mode. Having to full clear 7 dungeons in a row with no refills or escape options is a bit too much to ask for a permadeath feature

-Rituals hit a good balance between accessibility and affordability. Food & mushroom-related ones are very powerful
 
Combat & Upgrades:

-Major point: not all weapons are created equal. I don't just mean that in a ""different styles for different folks"" sense, I mean some are just straight up bad. 
‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇThe dagger has way too low damage & range, the hammer & it's alt fire mode are kinda too slow (really needed to be a quicker, smaller alternate attack instead --- devs if you're listening, I will buy all this game's DLC, no questions asked, for the ability to G-Maul spec with the hammer. Make it happen)
‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇThe claws are fast & have the best AOE damage in the game, while the axe has probably the best DPS & a very powerful thrown alternate attack that takes skill & positioning to use properly 
‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇThe new blunderbuss gun is sorta meh early on, but gets way better once upgraded. The bane/poisoned version is by far the best weapon in the game, no questions asked
‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇThe sword I think might be bugged, I legitimately can't remember the last time I saw one in over 40 hours of play

-Dodging is... the only potential shade I'll throw regarding game design. Weapons drag you in the direction they're swinging in, leading to movement loss that actively fights against your intentions. This is the reason why the dagger's in a bad spot. Moreso, you don't roll in the direction your pressing the direction keys/controller in, you dodge in the current direction you're facing. There's no buffer input for this either, so if you're in the middle of a chaotic fight and roll to early, it's often deeper into danger instead of away from it. The implications of this on gameplay are very frustrating, to say the least

-Regarding weapon, curse & tarot upgrades, weirdly enough I actually found most of the later ones detrimental overall. For weapons, bane (and to a lesser degree vamperic) ones are worth using, but everything else before godly seemed too niche/inconsistent for my liking. Curses too; ichors, freezing and invulnerability ones are great, everything else is passable/situational. Most of the good tarot cards are also unlocked immediately, most of the purchasable ones not worth using and contaminate the drop pool. Example: damaging enemies when hit doesn't quite have the same value as doing increased weapon damage, or having more health

-Relics are mostly balanced, being able to recharge them by destroying environmental objects is a nice feature. All 3 lightning relics are still very strong

-Overall, I found dungeon runs to be very momentum-based. Combine all above points together; if you're tired/hungry/angry IRL, you can still probably have a good run if you're given proper weapons/resources. But you can easily lose a dagger or hammer run even if you're in peak mental condition

Regarding Sins of the Flesh Content:

-Drinking wine and being naked will turn you into a frothing demon that needs to be violently exorcized. Who knew. This is the kind of s**t hardcore Evangelists think will happen when they say you'll go to hell for touching yourself too much

-Anyway, Sin is the new mechanic that lets you beautify your temple, and also lets you monster mash your cultists together to produce customized hellspawn. If you've ever said to yourself ""I don't have enough golden feces to properly fertilize my drug fields"", this is the update for you. Jokes aside, it is nice being able to create tailored cultists who level up quickly with proper attention. With Skull necklaces they're functionally immortal. Sadly though, you can't breed the Lamb

-Too much Sin can make cultists turn into demons and fight against you in the next dungeon. This used to kill them when the update was first released, and created an interesting dynamic where it was optimal to ""sacrifice"" new/useless members as Sin generators. But I think people complained about it, so now they can be re-recruited after you've knocked them around a bunch, which I'm honestly not too keen on as there's now zero consequence for abusing this

-Tailoring is neat, but expensive. Again I'm not very creative with this, I only ever mass-produced outfits with resources that I wasn't using, and gave them to people I knew I was going to keep. Your mileage may vary. Also the tailor NPC runs out of stock WAY too fast and quickly becomes a useless room/encounter, would be nice if they sold crafting supplies after you've bought all their designs

-Final point; the new content comes VERY late into a main campaign run, like ¬æ of the way through. So if you aren't planning on doing the NG+ run afterwards, you'll realistically only have a single dungeon left to experience the new stuff

Overall a pretty great game, despite some gripes with weapons/spells/tarot stuff, and a few nagging QOL/stability issues. Main campaign run will probably last you 15-20 hours, pseudo NG+ a bit more than double that.

Some relics/tarot cards can do things like increase your size, Improve attack rate, And add some abilities. But none really change your weapon's kit. I'm hoping we eventually see a content update that gives me a reason to finish the Dungeon mode, But as I've already finished several runs with all the weapons there's nothing new left to do with them.",1706460048,1706460048,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I think the game is well-made and worth the money for people who enjoy this kind of horror-esque macabre tone, but it's just not my taste.

--

I went back and did the post game. I'm now at 58 hours of playtime instead of just 8. I feel uncomfortable that it's required to permanently sacrifice followers to finish that portion, but I guess it's fair since you *will* get a replacement follower after you finish the zone. So I guess one can think of it as offering a new body to replace later.

Overall, I think the game is really good, but it *is* kind of a horror game and has quite a number of uncomfortable moments, no matter how hard you try to play it as a friendly cute and trustworthy lamb.

And no, you can't bang your favorite disciple. The lamb will be forever the last. (You can hook up your favorites with the other characters though.)

I don't know how intentional it is, but a lot of the cult-specific elements of the game do feel kinda like subtle social commentary. When I birthed my first new follower in-cult and saw how quickly the loyalty bar was going up, I nearly screamed. And then when I realized how fast loyalty goes up when taking care of them as a child I had the moment of ""Wow, that's just like when I was a kid! Wait. WAIT. SHOULD I BE DOING THIS TO A KID, UHHHH THIS FEELS SLEEZYYYYY"" and then next thing I know they've joined as a full time follower and already level XII, darn close to the max. In hardly a tenth of the time it took to get other characters to that level.

Also, if you get tired of the fishing/repair/cooking minigames, or if the battles start to drag on, go into the options and turn on all of the auto-fishing and change the difficulty and whatnot to whatever feels good. There is no penalty for it, you can genuinely just customize the game to be whatever is fun for you... except the cult stuff, the cult's gonna cult no matter what you want.",1705469432,1706453227,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- fps problems when have many Buildings and Cultists running
- some animations issues when you play too fast

The gameplay, the vibes, the art are all great. The level of customization you have for your cultists is great, but also feeds into it's lack of replayability- cultists are just randomly generated and are either useful or not. It would be more fun to have some fixed characters with more mixed upside/downsides. Or just give us deeper village-building or something, IDK, it's a great core concept, but feels like the gameplay loop needs a little something more to keep people interested long term, which I think you can see from the playtimes on the reviews.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3136751519

The story is pretty silly. A group of monster bishops go about the business of sacrificing all lambs in the world. You‚Äôre the last lamb, but when they sacrifice you, an evil god intervenes, making you his avatar in the world. Your goal is to found and build up a cult to his worship while building up your cult‚Äôs base to feed and shelter your cultists, gather their worship energy, and generally build both your power and the power of your cultists. You will use your cult‚Äôs base as the launching point for various quests including your other primary goal: to kill the bishops that have imprisoned your god.

The base building is not disimilar from various RTS games. You‚Äôll build a variety of buildings that will accomodate your religion and your cultists. You‚Äôll also farm, mine, cut lumber, cook food, gather that worship energy I mentioned earlier. You‚Äôll (unfortunately) also clean up your cultist‚Äôs poop, which they‚Äôll drop indiscriminately around your base until you finally build some outhouses, and even then, they‚Äôll let it go sometimes. Freaking animals! You‚Äôll also also build a prison to discourage dissent amongst your followers, crypts for the dead, etc..

Your cultists can and will die despite never leaving your compound outside of some story moments when they‚Äôre summoned elsewhere. Some will grow old and die of old age. You‚Äôll sacrifice others. Depending on circumstances, cultists can also murder each other. However, they also develop relationships amongst themselves and with you, and maintaining your relationship with your cultists is of paramount importance.

Then there are the dungeons. These are presented in Binding of Isaac fashion. However, this isn‚Äôt a twin stick shooter. Instead, it‚Äôs melee and magic focused, where you‚Äôll use weapons, relics, and sometimes actual spells to fight your way through each dungeon. However, it strays from Isaac by also including node maps between dungeons that might also include new followers, supplies, extra battles, etc‚Ä¶The Zelda mechanics show themselves in the actual combat. Plus, there is a heart health system which is used in both of CotL‚Äôs main influences.

The node system will eventually lead to the area boss, who you will defeat and then recruit. In each bishop‚Äôs area, you‚Äôll need to complete them four times. The fourth time, it unlocks the bishop battle.

The world also features other locations where you‚Äôll meet allies and complete quests and such. Which leads me to the RPG mechanics. You will have several categories of unlocks, from weapons and relics to rituals (which you‚Äôll use for buffs, resurrecting dead cultists, and so on), new buildings and decorations, etc‚Ä¶there are a lot of upgrades and many tiers to some of them.

So yeah. There‚Äôs a lot to Cult of the Lamb, and I‚Äôm really just scratching the surface of what is available in the game. Once you finish the game, you can keep playing, wrapping up cheevos and doing some extra story stuff if you‚Äôre so inclined. You also unlock some difficulty modes.

The graphics and audio are all geared towards emphasizing the cutesy and yet murdery nature of the world. It‚Äôs a very pleasing game mixed with pleasing horror, lol. And the soundtrack was really cool as well.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3136751294

I will also note that despite the various gameplay mechanics, the game does a great job of teaching you how to play in a very approachable and intuitive manner.

It took me right around 13 hours to play through the campaign, but I think you could easily get another 10ish hours trying to wrap up cheevos. I played on the Steam Deck on the highest settings with no issues and about 2 hour battery life.

Cost vs value is definitely there with this one. The devs do recommend using a gamepad, so if you‚Äôre strictly k/m, you might want to look more into it before buying, but it‚Äôs an easy recommendation and one of the best Indies out there.

I've sink so many hours into the game. So when I tell you its awesome and cute, it is!
There's a lot of things to do after completing the main story-line nowadays compared to launch. So props to the Devs for improving on the End Game content.

It's a good game, and it's good for the money.

But it's dreadfully short without really any replay-ability. They've added endless mode, but frankly, the dungeon crawler is the worst part of the game, and the town elements max out much too quickly.

If its on sale, and you want a go through, do it, but don't expect to put more than 10-12 hours in.

I played on medium difficulty, which is recommended by the developers, and the fighting game was probably too easy for me, so I advise you to take a higher difficulty if you want the game to have some kind of challenge. 
Building a base was quite interesting at the beginning, but then when the base gets bigger you don't want to run around cleaning up the poop after your slaves, and you can automate all the processes only at the very end of the game, so I personally didn't like this moment, but someone will probably like it. 
Very cool animations and the visuals of the game are generally very good, so it's worth trying to play at least for that.

At first, it's exciting and fun managing a cult, but as you progress, it quickly becomes repetitive doing the same daily tasks for the cult: cleaning, cooking, performing a sermon, and ritual. This basically needs to be done after EVERY dungeon run, and takes a considerable amount  of time. There are plenty of things to unlock, but these are basically upgraded versions of previous buildings that grant some minor bonus effects. My biggest gripe with this game is the combat. Not once have I had a run where I felt like I was progressively getting stronger, to really encompass that ACTION ROGUELIKE feeling. The upgrade systems are so bland and boring, and never change the actual mechanics of the combat. Basically just boring passive effects, with some rehashed abilities. Its the same gameplay loop, and doesn't suck you back in for another run. The art style is great though.

But it simply will not play for me. there's weird graphical issues with red, all throughout the intro sequence, and when it gets to the point where the one who waits gives you the crown, whatever cutscene is supposed to play just doesn't have any visuals. I can still hear it, but there's nothing but a black screen and a skip prompt. The skip prompt also doesn't work, and it just sits on a black screen indefinitely. This makes the game unplayable for me. I've tried resetting my computer, updating my graphics drivers, reinstalling the game. I'm tired of playing through the intro cutscene over and over again. So while the game is good I can't exactly make a recommendation on something I can't play. I've requested a refund.

Edit: apparently this black screen bug is a pretty well documented issue and has been for years.
Edit 2: I'm fortunate enough to be in the same house with someone who also owns this game, so I was able to test if the patch they put out today fixed my issue and it did.

The tonal whiplash of cutesy furries one moment to lovecraftian mutated abominations the next;- within the same artstyle -is well executed, and the humor is often on-point, either subtle sounds or smashing you in the head with a joke.

There are other abnormalities, it's not a perfect title, but it's definitely worth keeping tabs on if you're not already sold.

Firstly, this game is a joy for your ADHD addled brain. I cannot exaggerate how much STUFF is going on. The gameplay loop is so fast. There's always something happening and there's always something to do; it's like Stardew Valley on steroids. The difference here is, by nature of the passage of time - and that passage of time being relatively short - your time is valuable. What you do, when you do it, and how you do it, and in what order, can really make a difference if you love optimization. And because all the tasks are different - from dungeon crawling, to town management, to villager decorations, to fishing - none of the gamplay loops outstay their welcome. You're bouncing between 9 different tasks, and because all of the tasks are different, you never really get bored.

Which is where the actual problem in this game lies: it's deceptively shallow. It feels like there's a lot going on here. But in reality, everything is based on timers. With the exception of dungeon crawling, and some side mini-games like fishing, and the mini-game knucklebones (otherwise known as addictive), most of the actual management tasks are really superficial and simple. Regarding attention again, they definitely hold your attention. But only just. 

Cult of the Lamb uses lots of dopaminergic responses to make you feel good, more than any other game I've ever played. Everything is in a constant state of making you feel good, from the animations, to the art, to the satisfaction of the combat, all the way down to making your villagers happy. It's designed, top to bottom, to make your dopamine swim. The issue is, it's almost rude in a way; it's almost like the game is tricking you into believing that waiting-mechanics are fun. It's very good at doing this. But at the heart of every mechanics, except for dungeon crawling, you'll be waiting. Waiting for a villager to complete a task, or the building to be built, or the thing to be completed. There's nothing inherently wrong with this. But there's a lot of it, and it's concealed under a giant layer of quaintness and cuteness. That is to say, if you played this game and bounced off of it, disliking it incredibly, you are super valid and there are a lot of reasons you might not like this game.

But I liked this game. It's addictive tendencies suit my tiny brain perfectly. The management systems, although they are not complex, are fun and rewarding. I basically maxed out my village before I even half-way completed the game, because I was so obsessed with making everything perfect that I overdid it, and hyper-optimized everything. The fact that the game continually rewards you for that, and also doesn't punish you if you don't optimize in the way that I did, is a testament to its own design.

And also, like, c'mon bro. This is fun. Play this game for 10-20 minutes, and you'll be smiling. Even if you don't like this, you can't knock it for being FUN. It's just cute, and neat, and silly, and sweet. And we need more nice things in this cold, cruel world of ours. Even if something isn't perfectly, sometimes something being pretty neat is all that's necessary.",1706077327,1706078107,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

It was quite a fun game with an enjoyable, snappy combat loop, but the QoL for town management was rather poor and the total amount of content in the game is pretty low. While $25 is a reasonable price for a game, it only took me about 13 hours to reach the end and I don't really feel compelled to keep playing for achievements.

Pros:
- Aesthetic is great. Really amusing plot and the don't-starve-like graphics reinforce the vibe.
- Combat is fun and responsive. 
- Decent balance of mechanics to learn without being overwhelming and good pacing

Cons:
- Very poor colony management QoL features
- Infuriatingly slow, unskippable animations throughout (especially annoying is the new blueprint pickup)
- Passage of time during combat runs makes everything feel rushed
- Resource acquisition and management was tedious
- Lack of variety and choice in combat loadouts - you basically just pick random weapons and roll with it
- Upgrade paths are mostly irrelevant

I think in general, the main thing I didn't like about this game was that it both encouraged you to explore dungeons and break everything in them for loot, but also your colony gets messed up while you're away and the longer you're away the worse it is. So there's this competing interest that resulted in me basically speed-running the combat portions just so I could get back to my cult sooner.

So, while the combat and premise were good, there were a lot of small complaints about the game. Still worth a play (if a short one).",1706064728,1706064728,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Generally, it's pretty cool being able to run your own cult, but I've already gotten most necessities in the game, and I don't like decorating, so having more things to build would be fun I guess .  I upgraded most things to its limit too, so I'm currently at -4k- [ 15k ] coins which I gather more than I spend .

So anyways .

Pros//
- fun and dark lore
- fun battle elements
- cool game references everywhere
- fun game overall
*- new update gave lots of fun updates !
*- i've been peeking at harder game modes which helps my disinterest in lack of things to do :D

Cons//
- you kinda run out of content when you finish upgrading your cult, i know i should focus more on beating the bosses but eh ?
- I thought I'd have to worry more about my cult's faith but it's really easy to raise it + dissenters aren't that hard to correct

Previously I would have only Recommended it on sale, but now I think it‚Äôs well worth its Full price. But if you take anything else from this review let it be at least be these 3 funny cult names:

The Graveyardigans

Flowerpach Kin

Happy Tree Fiends

To start, Cult of the lamb‚Äôs central gimmick is that it is split between two different game loops: Cult Management and Crusades. Which are Base-Building and Rougelike respectively, you cannot play entirely one or the other or you will not be able to make any meaningful progress. This is a down-point for people who are fans purely of one genre or another, base-builders don't like grindy dungeon crawling, rouge-fans don‚Äôt like babysitting the followers back at base. These are Both valid personal points to take, as each side of the game is verifiably diminished by the other existing. But it is as combined does CotL‚Äôs appeal lie.
Together, each side of the game gives special context to the other, you are encouraged to go through dungeons as quickly and effectively as possible, as time in your base does not stop when fighting. Building up your cult as well and giving your followers attention and time can give you unique advantages in crusades, giving a significant Powerup at the beginning. Both are a Yin and Yang you must engage with to get a full experience.
Being a fan of both genres, like me, will also greatly increase the enjoyment of CotL but is not essential I think as an appeal to enjoy it

It rocks a cute cartoon aesthetic that is infused into everything as well. From the beloved followers, to grimy eldritch titans and all that falls between, accompanied by a mid-sized cast of unique characters, who really need more ways and reasons to be talked with as interactions with them are very limited. Alongside much of other side content outside of the main two game-modes which I feel needs to be expanded greatly and holds it back from being a fantastic game. The Irregular updates the game receives have also something to consider if buying, as they will be continuing into the foreseeable future.
Felt as a whole that CotL was a good experience for me and that it fit snugly within my gaming preferences and aesthetics. It's a nice recommendation from me.

The fast-paced combat, reminiscent of Hades and Gungeon, keeps each run thrilling, while Isaac's influence shines in dungeon-crawling and quirky enemies.

The unexpected farming aspect, inspired by Stardew Valley, adds a serene touch between dungeon runs, offering a delightful break from the chaos. Though the base game has four dungeon types with limited enemy variety, the addictive gameplay compensates, encouraging replayability and strategic exploration.

Noteworthy is the developer's commitment, evident through consistent updates and new content. Cult of the Lamb is a captivating blend of roguelike intensity, farming charm, and dedicated developers, making it a must-play for indie game enthusiasts.

The two main gameplay loops are tending to your cult and going on crusades. While caring for your flock, you'll be managing resources to keep everyone happy, healthy, fed, and complacent to your demands. While crusading, you'll be destroying your competition in combat to gather more resources.

The game does a nice job drip feeding you new unlocks and mechanics. There are whole subsystems that open up to you after a while, so stick with it even when it seems tedious. There are lots of ways to automate features the further you get into the game. The base building is satisfying, and seeing the cultists do their work is quite funny. 

Humor is interwoven throughout the game, even when it's trying to be imposing. If you enjoy macabre humor about religion and cults, you'll find this game amusing.

There are some minor issues that I have with the game, such as trying to select one individual cultist to talk to later in the game and struggling to get them to highlight (likely wouldn't be as much of an issue if I play with KB+M) but overall I had a lovely time and chewed through my playthrough in a handful of days.

Initially I was hesitant, because I saw a lot of combat footage online and very little story/base building. I am so glad my initial feelings were wrong. This game absolutely rocks, and I was addicted very quickly. If you like games that have in depth base building, good lore, and actually fun combat: buy Cult of the Lamb today. 

The DLC I'd also say is completely worth it. It adds richer story building and even more base decorations/activities.

Did you ever want to scream at your screen asking for the 69th time WHY OH WHY DOES EVERYONE IN NEED OF TAKING A DUMP OR VOMITING HAVE TO WALK AT THE EDGE OF THE MAP TO MAKE IT EVEN MORE ANNOYING FOR YOU TO CLEAN IT UP?

Or do you like to see your followers eat each other to bits and pieces, sacrifice them to a monster or bind them to torture devices to make them obedient - but when they see the corpse of someone who died of old age, they are going to freak out and immediately VOMIT EVERYWHERE? Even better, Jeff 55 days died of old age, and Marcus came from his work 100 meters away just to visit the corpse only to fucking puke. It's like Marcus thought ""Hmm, I could vomit right now, but I dunno, I'm not keen on eating something rotten.. oh hey, is that a corpse over there? Let's FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"". BRUH I EVEN TRIED TO MOVE THE CORPSE AT THE EDGE OF THE MAP AND YET VOMIT LIES WHERE THE CORPSE SHOULD HAVE FUCKING RESTED INSTEAD.

Do you like when you recruit mature grown-ups only to realize that when they get sick, not only won't they do any work, they instead run around the map aimlessly until you explicitly tell them to go fuck themselves in the healing tent or go to bed until they get better?

How about your followers admiring and worshipping you as a literal god, only to act like a puppy who enjoys looking at you in the eyes while you have to clean up the shit they dump all over the map, because YOU have somehow a fucking broom but they refuse to take care of their own shit. You like that, don't ya?

Or the fact that you have to run through dungeons stressful and in a hurry, since the time in the dungeon reflects the time outside and if your fucking followers are left alone for a whole day, they start to get awfully hungwry and all angsty as they shit the fucking bed and of course can't feed themselves or clean up after themselves, resulting in sickness and lovely non-stressful messages during your runs like ""HEY YOUR FOLLOWER IS SICK NOW AND WILL DIE IF LEFT UNTREATED"". 

This is one of the reasons why I fucking scratched my head why oh why you unlock endless dungeon runs so early. You can't leave em alone without your followers dying or worse revolting.
However... after a while you unlock the technology tree as you learn how to automate wiping your followers butts, building a fucking shed with a broom so they can use to clean up their own projectile vomit and even a second kitchen that followers can use, because the first one has a bomb implanted that would result in killing everyone and everything in a 5000 mile (are we still using retarded unit measurements? What's that in even more retarded units? 300 football fields?) radius as a follower touches the kitchen. With that, you finally start to go through dungeons less stressed and you can go for longer.

You also learn ways of capitalism by making your followers admit going on a dietary restriction of eating air while still working at 100% capacity for couple days, coupled with abilities of free speech aka modern free speech where everything they say is forbidden as it is non-compliant with a healthy work relationship, meaning they have to endure it without losing faith in you as the god. Oh and of course non-paid overwork as they won't have to sleep too now. And don't forget to introduce a tax for just existing, that will keep production up even higher Ah yes, the modern free world.

So yeah, I recommend this game.",1705928633,1705928633,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Presented with a cutesy 2d style, cult of the lamb is intriguing from the get go and doesn't waste time pulling you into the cult life, you will soon amass plenty of followers to do your bidding, be it working in the quarry, eating poop or sacrificing them to the elder gods. For me this was the strongest aspect of the game, your followers are flexible and the level of interaction is really impressive. Had a favourite follower die? Fret not, just use some arcane knowledge to resurrect them and if the extensional dread of being pulled back from the afterlife is too much and they start to lose faith, kill them and serve them up for dinner. 

Combat and dungeon crawling is the other big game mode and it's the weakest part though that's not to say it's bad because it really isn't, it's deep enough to be engaging but simple enough that you don't need to worry about balancing builds. You have attacks, heavy attacks, spells, passive buffs and summons but it never feels too overwhelming, might be a drawback for some but doesn't bother me, you are always rewarded with something for your efforts and generally Combat is fun if a little samey by the end. There isn't too much incentive for re-running completed areas for now but it seems a free update will be focused on endgame content. 

The devs have been amazing with this games support, we've just had a massive free update which adds seggs and they are going to bring a significant update to endgame, all while selling completely optional cosmetic dlc which thankfully doesn't impact gameplay. 

Simply one of the best indies in recent memory, an absolute joy to play and I hope it's a game that gets plenty of support (already has to be fair) in it's life. I have been fully indoctrinated into the cult and it's time for you to convert.

My biggest gripe is the disregard for Quality of Life features. Equipping a follower is done by hunting them down and interacting with them, instead of a simple menu. Summons need to be refreshed after every crusade for no particular reason. Unskippable animations every time you unlock another minor aesthetic upgrade (which happens frequently.)

Lots of pointless busywork. You need to tell followers to sleep when they're sick or tired or they'll just work until they die. Why?? What is the point of this time-wasting mechanic?

The combat is ok. It could use a lot more visual clariy, as enemies tend to blend into the environment and their attack cues get lost in the sauce. It doesn't develop much over time either.

Only buy this if you'll get a lot of pleasure out of customizing the appearance of your followers and base.",1705907236,1705907236,False,28,5,0.489848077297210693,0,True,False,False

The game is fun, and the combat is great. The colony management was awesome at first, but it gets boring and somewhat annoying after completing upgrade trees. The game started going downhill as soon as I maxed out my doctrines (not including sin). Managing the colony started to feel pointless after I maxed out the combat benefits tree.

I appreciate that at many times I was given options to choose good or evil directions, but I hated that the Sin mechanic doesn't seem to allow much choice. Even if I used the non-violent options to generate sin it still ended up harming my followers. Overall I don't feel that the sin update added anything enjoyable to the game. I would rather see more doctrines allowing the colony to manage itself, ways to build more meaningful relationships with followers, and more combat related challenges and upgrades.

Overall I enjoyed Hades more than this game, but I would still recommend Cult of the Lamb to friends if they've played Hades already. I had a few good laughs and the combat in this game is exciting.",1705888929,1705888929,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

What complaints I do have about the game are minor: mostly that I think your cultists grow old and die a little too quickly, I wish the building map was a little bigger, and I find that the diagonal grid you build on can sometimes be a little finicky when placing small 1-tile objects.

The enjoyment from managing followers quickly wears off and feels like it just slows everything down. By the final dungeon I had enabled the option to pause time while on a crusade to avoid follower management. The dungeons themselves feel repetitive and the build depth and options you have in the rogue lite aspect is very shallow.

The whole roguelite build system could really be expanded, it's all on the tarot cards, but unlocking new tarot cards actually feels like a negative as you are just watering down the pool lowering your chances at the good ones. The relics all feel too similar especially with all the damned and blessed versions.

The devs have done a massive amount of post launch support, but rather than adding new systems and extending the grind maybe they could flesh out what is already there.

The postgame and sin grind isn't something I even want to try engage with. It's great that there's options to skip all the pointless things like crafting, cooking and fishing. But still feels like it could really do with more quality of life options like skipping the same animations that repeat (travelling, sermons, doctrines, rituals) having all the resources collected go to one place, infinite ways to harvest wood and stone, extended resource conversion to the higher tiers, followers going to bed when they are sick without you having to tell them.

The last boss is pretty difficult (in a good way) especially since you have random weapons and spells, so it was really frustrating their was no easy way to retry and you had to go through the walk and cut scenes again every time, though sometimes I could skip the first cut scene and sometimes I couldn't.

On technical side the game is fairly polished, I experienced one crash early on from sitting in the church screen too long. But received multiple crashes on the last boss and going to and starting the post game. Bug wise, had some issues where I would be put into cut scenes but still take damage from the hazard I was standing on. Also not sure if it was a bug or something I missed, but sometimes half my followers would just get sick from performing rituals (not the mushroom ritual with the prohibitionist trait) had it happen from alms to the poor, ascension and sacrifice.

The most frustrating bug I had though was after the 4th boss the game would just vibrate the controller and ignore inputs at random intervals when in a dungeon. I know it was caused by this game as it didn't happen in the steam controller test or when in other games that I opened at the same time to test it. In the end I just had to switch to mouse and keyboard.",1705847044,1705847193,False,3,0,0.493617385625839233,0,True,False,False

And the gameplay loop surprisingly works so well. You build you cult from the ground up, gather resources or gain new follower by going into the ""dungeons"", where the roguelite aspect comes in. Depends on your skill level, average runtime per dungeon run is 6 to 8 minutes. And then you go back to your cult base camp with your resources / new follower, do some colony management sim thingy, and then off to do another ""dungeon"" run again. 

Combat is pretty simple, although some of the weapon hitbox is kinda jank (the axe comes to mind), and on some boss fight, it gets so hectic that there's so many particles cluttering the arena. Beyond that, the gameplay is pretty solid. 
There's 3 choice in difficulty, so if you prefer a relaxed experience, you can do that, and if that is not enough, there's also accessibility option if you still feel the game is kinda hard.

Best of all, they actually added sex into the game, as per other players request. What a mad lad.

But making a cap at level 10 is a bit... low? A big core part of the game is gaining loyalty of your followers. Removing the heart demon's effects from the fragile and beserker fleece was fair. Everything else was fair, but this is still pretty contradictory given that in the accessibility settings you can have infinite HP or Fevour. I genuinely feel like there was a better way to nerf the followers versus removing the ability to level them up completely.

I really don't care if there's a demon level cap or if there's a devotion cap for sacrifices or anything else, but I'm an idiot who likes to grind levels.

This is a very cute game, that's very thoughtfully built. The mechanics of roguelike and town builder blend nicely and the time given for runs before things fall apart feels just about right to be manageable, with extra options to extend your time out if needed. I think the very beginning of the game it's a pain to get established, but after a few necessary resource runs it picks up a lot more. 

I think the follower mechanics are interesting and both the aging mechanic and random element make it difficult to keep your whole flock alive, it encourages you to accept the inevitability of members you like dying, and even encourages you to do it yourself. 

The combat is simple but just mechanically varied enough to be satisfying, mostly relying on your movement around enemy attacks and remembering patterns and exploiting weaknesses. Some weapon types seem infinitely better than others so it can feel like a massive die roll for how good the first area of the run will be, but after you have some good curses and relics that starts to matter less. 

The visuals and audio carry a lot of the game for me. The rarewarespeak and music are both very charming, and the characters are very cute. I like how much control you have over individual followers looks, and the NPCs are all memorable. I don't feel like the core game has a whole lot of story to attach yourself to, [spoiler]but most of it seems to be locked behind post game. [/spoiler]

It can get a bit repetitive and you can get locked into a loop of meaningless follower tasks if you allow yourself to, but I think this game has a tight enough game loop to come back to, and is simple enough that I could check in a year from now and still be able to play and enjoy it.",1705822455,1705822455,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

   genuinely and not just a stupid response, the game is very good and has breathable graphics so you don't have to constantly being laggy, it has cute and also in some aspects horrifying details yet reaches out to a lot of aspects of peoples likes. I love the building aspect and customization, its nice to have a small sense of direction and ability to customize when playing. the crusades are a nice place if you ant to fight or engage in combat where the cult area is more calm and nice to hang out and talk with the followers.
   there is only a coupe of things that i don't like, for example getting the blazing trail tarot card whilst using the fleece of the hobbled heels, it doesn't work since you cant roll and it still doesn't work if you were to just walk into them. another thing that i find as a problem is the fact you cant have a defined choice on which necklace you get from the mysterious god [in this case i call him fenko,] possibly with the new flesh of the sins update you can spend one sin to get one you like, or possibly a god tear extra.
   I also have a few recommendations i haven't really asked around for so they may be a little self directed. I would love if you could spend a second sin for a golden egg without any guessing, this would be a little overpowered so possibly 3 sin. Maybe an expansion for the cult? i keep on running out of space for farming and followers with all the other needs, its getting to the points i have barely any room for my newer things beside the bed area which i also need room for. it would be nice for these two to be added if many other people have a positive view or opinion on it.",1705808062,1705808062,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Everything about it, the colorful visuals, the base building, the combat, the leveling system, all of it.
I came into the game expecting more of a rougelike game, but it really isnt. 
The rougelike aspect is used more of a extraction, get in, get stuff you need, fight a boss, get out. And yet, it is still verrrryy fun! The cult mechanic is super fun to also work on, making a cult that is horrible in every aspect, to making a cult thats loving for one another, its all up to you. The levelling system is fair, and doesnt feel too slow or too fast, its just right. The atmosphere of the game makes it feel like two difrrent titles. One one hand you can go to a garden thats filled with nature and life, and go somewhere else, you find someone getting sacrificed. This game is super fun if youre into building and caring for your followers, and fighting bosses and unlocking sweet new weapons.

approximate amount of time to 100%: 20-40
Estimated achievement difficulty: 4/10
Minimum number of playthroughs needed: One + DLC (a sort of NG+)
Multiplayer achievements: No.
Missable achievements: Yes. A single super easy one. (play dice with Rattau and win once you can and you can continue easily)
Grinding Achievements: No.
DLC-Only achievements: No. (but new achievements were added with updates)
Time-gated achievements: No.
Speed-run achievements: No.
RNG-achievements: A few. (some collectibles can spawn in rooms at random)
Does difficulty affect achievements: No. You can get 100% on easy.
First achievement unlock: Almost immediately at the start of the game. (sign the contract/Recruit a cultist)

Notes: 
- The game features negative achievements (like dying, sacrificing followers) achievements depend on these.
- The last 10~ hours were spent grinding the final item from cards/follower skins/relics etc..
- QOL Mods don't block achievements (like lock weapons or auto gather from chests...)
   (somewhat spoilery)
- the npc that sells ""the Intangible"" card is only found ONLY in Anchordeep [ The guides lie, he doesn't spawn everywhere ] - My advice is to keep 200~gold on hand and always buy all the card unlocks that are offered in random dungeon events.
- Make sure to chose the ""resurrection"" dogma.  With the free update you can select the dogmas you missed but that's very late into the game.

Overall the game was fun, It kept things varied between combat and base building just enough to prevent either from becoming stale. I personally love the art style and the only thing I found lacking were quality of life features (some of which can be easily modded in)

Overall this gets a strong recommendation from me. Go do unspeakable things to your followers

Edit: 6 New achievements were added as part of the free ""Sins of the Flesh"" DLC addition.
- Most of the new achievements simply reward getting to the end of a gameplay feature, (like making eggs/disciples etc...)
- The Lore and Costume ones however are a different story..  Wasted tens of hours on just the Grindy RNG of trying to get that damned Meat room for the final one.",1699023292,1705760266,True,13,0,0.619800150394439697,0,True,False,False

POSITIVES:
‚Ä¢ Large selection of fleeces makes combat interesting, and let's you tailor it to your preferences
‚Ä¢ Cult building is actually super fun, I tend not to enjoy more passive stuff, but cult building is my favourite part of the game
‚Ä¢ Absolutely fucking gorgeous game, super stylized and cute while still being genuinely unsettling at times
‚Ä¢ Plenty of fun characters that make you wonder about the rest of the world outside of the few areas you can visit.
‚Ä¢ A metric fuck ton of enemies that are all pretty distinct, and you have to play around them differently
‚Ä¢ GOD HAVE YOU SEEN HOW PRETTY THIS GAME IS OH MY GOD
‚Ä¢ Did I mention how good it looks yet?

NEGATIVES:
‚Ä¢ Can get a bit grindy at times, I've had to spend 30-45 minutes just getting followers so I can open the next area.
‚Ä¢ You sometimes get screwed over with bad weapon luck. ""oh you're using a glass cannon build? TAKE A HAMMER!!""
‚Ä¢ The game does depend on you doing about equal amounts of cult building and dungeon running. It'll break otherwise

There's probably a couple more positives and negatives I forgot to mention, but they're all pretty minimal.

This game is weird in the best way possible. Make your followers eat their own sh!t! Sacrifice them to a demon! Make everyone trip balls! It's got it all.
In all seriousness, Cult of the Lamb is very fun and very easy to sink lots of hours into. The art style is iconic and charming and the combat is quick, snappy, and a fun challenge. With the randomization of the 'dungeons', weapons, abilities, etc., the gameplay doesn't get stale super fast like some others of this type fall victim to. Between the story, delving the dungeons, and managing your growing cult, there's a lot to do and have fun with. 

Now, we just need the sex update.

It feels very lacking in QOL for the management, its a pain to figure out which follower has which trait, and i dont think it is very fun to have to go in and out of the same menu nonstop to give simple orders just to minimize the busy work you do. Just sorting through 10 followers its already a 10 minute process to sort through the followers to figure out who has what and assign them to jobs. And then they just ignore what you said and do every other job. Nobody will farm for more than a second, so i have to do it all so they dont starve. Maybe worth it on sale but i doubt i will play more than 5 hours of this game, as it seems to only get grindier as it goes on

I liked it when I bought it, but something just didn't click with me. I like games with light management, dungeon crawling, and base building. But the game just wasn't there, yet.

With Sins of the Flesh, the free update, the game feels right. The management is coming together later in the game and I think there are even more necklaces and blueprints for me to find. The dungeon crawling feels better. Hits seem to land more accurately and the blunderbuss is a fun addition to the arsenal. The base building is expanded with the new sin mechanic letting followers be even more self-serving and beneficial.

Cult of the Lamb is certainly worth your time when on sale, but even at full price it's a fun, entertaining game. The combat isn't super deep, but it is rewarding. Collecting the right cards and finding a great setup feels good. Changing fleeces and discovering what works for you makes runs so enjoyable.

If you like managing villagers, though, Cult of the Lamb is a must-buy. You can collect them, get rid of them if you don't like their perks, breed them, dress them, and care for them.

I appreciate the variety of going back and forth between harvesting materials/progressing through the storyline with combat and then returning to your little cult at the end of the day to take care of all your little animals. There's always something to do, it feels very fast-paced the majority of the time, never a dull moment.

The added Twitch-integration makes it even better (I played through this for my first run livestreaming), allowing your viewers to participate by ""becoming"" cult members, adding to your totem, and ""deciding your fate"" which is a vote to cause you hindrances or give you bonuses, can even resurrect dead members if they want to! Playing with viewers is exceptionally fun because there's so much *drama* that goes on in the cult and getting your audience involved with that is like telling a little story that keeps them coming back for every new episode. ;)

- low DPS, which is not making things harder but just frustrating

This game is a solid 9.5/10 in my book.

I highly enjoy this DLC! It adds a fantastic amount of replayability with some grinding that is not excessive! Overall, i still absolutely LOVE this game.The art style, music, characters, and gameplay is overall just fantastic. The amount of value you get out of this game and the dedication of the team to continue to update the game with so much new content for free (with each expansion offering a very affordable bonus-DLC option) is absolutely amazing.

For context I've spent about 20 hours playing the update so far at the time of writing.
Pros:
- Sin offers new rewards and a new grind that is actually enjoyable
- Mating allows you to combine traits of your favorite Cultists, reject eggs can be broken for a new resource! They did a great job making the value of breaking your eggs balanced.
- New quest lines are enjoyable, especially the Sozo questline! (I have not yet finished the Lore one, but the fact that it has brought back a lot of value to running Crusades again makes me very happy)
- The Blunderbuss!! New weapon, fun times. If you were wishing that Cult of the Lamb had a ranged weapon, then you'll be thrilled! It has ""ammunition"" that takes time to regenerate after each shot (it takes longer to reload if it fully runs out). Adds some extra thought to combat and is a very refreshing edition for someone who will reset a run if he doesn't get the dagger. (me)
- They added new kinds of poop.
- New follower forms are hilarious and adorable
- New Traits! Some are great, some are negative, some devalue Devoation in exchange for boosting Sin and vice versa. Never a bad thing to add more variation and automatically adds so much value to the mating system.
- Outfits - You can put Leshy in a Maid Outfit....'nuff said.
- Several other Quality of Life improvements (please read the Patch Notes for all of them)
- New Doctrines and RItuals!! (read the patch notes)

There are so many more, but these are the most notable ones in my opinion!

Cons:
- Level for Followers caps at 10. This genuinely bums me out, it does not revert existing Followers to level 10, which is very nice, but it is disappointing that this was implemented as it deters me further from bringing followers on crusades with me. (I also really wanted to get a follower up to a ridiculous level) I feel like it was added to justify the new Disciple mechanic, but why drop the level cap?
- Sin is very cool, but be careful with it because you'll find yourself needing to resurrect your Followers quite often! (this is mostly a con when you first start trying to farm it and do not understand it)
- God Tears are still pretty underwhelming. I find that the only thing that I want from farming them is the Gold Skull Necklace to prevent followers from dying of old age. I have probably 70 necklaces I just don't use and nothing to really do with them if I don't use them. After receiving all of the follower forms, cosmetics, and Forgotten Doctrine, it just feels like I'm gambling for the necklace I want.
- Purgatory: The above opinion sorta plays into Purgatory, aside from the Achievement, Purgatory does not seem to offer more than a self-fulfilling challenge that lays there at a relative completeness depending on the value you place on challenge runs. Maybe that was the intent? Regardless, I haven't really touched Purgatory since getting the Achievement for it.

(God Tears and Purgatory were introduced in the previous Expansion, Relics of the Old Faith, I did not think to update my review for that patch, and my criticism is based solely on the fact that there did not seem to be much motivation added to doing Purgatory runs and I was hopeful that there would be.)

Original Review after about 40 hours of gameplay: This game is just fun. The followers are simple and adorable, the rituals and doctrines are extremely satisfying. This game takes all of the stimulation of a mobile-farm game, dumps all of the crappy parts about them, adds in some extremely fun roguelike-bullet hell flavor we all know and love from the Devolver catalog, and sandwiches it all together with amazing lore and a truly gripping experience. I may only have 19.8 hours while writing this review...but this is after another 26 hours on my Switch as well. (and all my PC time was spent in a single weekend binge)
The update that came out in late April added SO MUCH AMAZING post-game content...the game is a bit of a grind but I just love it so freaking much.",1682926005,1705689374,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's fantastic, reminds me a bit of Stardew Valley.
It's so cute,  and addicting, I only have 4 hours in the game (at the time of writing) and I didn't even know when the time flew by!

The only thing bad, is that Unity backstabbed the developers, not just of this game, but any game using unity. I don't follow the news anymore for I don't care about that engine anymore, so I hope unity hasn't gone forward with the pay-per-install model. 
Maybe it will encourage the dev to make a sequel or a remake in Unreal Engine, who knows, that would be cool!
Maybe they can make it even better? Or more grandiose?

I can't really find a way to praise it anymore than just saying it's good, I can't really be bothered to go into detail about why it's good.

I do have some gripes, combat is kinda hard to get used to because its melee based in a 3d plane with 2d cartoon characters, so getting a hang of knowing when and where you and your enemies strikes are gonna land takes some getting used to, I honestly think the game would've been easier to pick up if it had 3d models in a cel shaded art style akin to Okami or Wind Waker, but this is not to say the current art style is bad which it ain't, it's fucking adorable and I love it. 

When it comes to the rougelike side of things it's pretty tame, you ain't gonna become an unstoppable demi god on a good run like in most other rougelikes but you are able to melt bosses if your good enough so I guess that's a plus, I do wish there was a bit more though, like I love the formula they got going on here but it feels like there's still more potential to be had in said formula, maybe a couple of updates will help that or maybe we'll get a sequel who knows. 

also side note and I know this suggestion gives me a couple red flags but I honestly thought the game would've been more violent, combat is already satisfying but it would've been more satisfying to see a limb fly off here and there, I know red flag but that's just me.

anyway buy it


EDIT 5/3/23: Disregard my third paragraph there, apparently loads of people were asking for the same thing I was asking for and the devs heard us and said ""yeah okay, bet."" Now it's not super duper complex, but it's also not so complex where your brain accumulates wrinkles with how hard you have to think, it's perfectly in the middle.

Loving the (surprisingly) free update, makes me wonder how much deeper they'll go with paid expansions. Hey here's an idea, give us a co-op mode where we play as Aym and Baal and do stuff for either the Lamb or Forneus.

1313140,156218943,76561198429936820,209,106,39,0,39,1705561367,"I didn't think it was possible, but they did it. They made a botched PC port in the year of our lord 2022. Never before have I bore witness to a botched PC port of an indie game, but alas here it is. 

Oh boy, where to start? First of all, optimization. This is not a complex game, so naturally you'd expect it wouldn't be very demanding; and in the grand scheme of things, it isn't. Most of the time. I have regular stuttering and frame dips from just regular gameplay, but some screens (namely the upgrade screen) make my PC's GPU skyrocket all the way to 100% usage, and dips the frames to the low TWENTIES. Being my computer is far, far above the specs listed in the ""recommended"" requirements, this is really bad. Furthermore I know this isn't just my computer as it also tanks my Steam Deck; for which the game is VERIFIED. Same story with the stuttering and frame dips too. This was reported in the forums as far back as the game's release, and still occurs for some users (like me). 

Second is cloud saves, which have been completely botched. More minorly, the game does not sync data between Windows and Mac versions of the game. While this doesn't affect me personally, I do think it speaks to how little care was put into the PC version of the game. While it's [i]possible[/i] that the saves aren't compatible between versions, that almost never happens with Unity, so I don't believe that to be the case at all. More majorly, the game does sync graphics configurations onto other devices. How fun! Now the game goes completely ape-shit when I switch between PC and Deck because of the conflicting resolutions. How nice. This also means if you wanted to play the game on higher settings on one machine and lower settings on another, you don't have that choice since those options sync to the cloud! Not that you'd want to with the game's poor optimization, you really are better off keeping the game at low. This issue, like the prior one, has ALSO been an issue since release! Once again, no effort was made to fix it, even after all the content updates. Very cool.

As for critiques for the game itself, and this is very personal taste but I want to keep my review to the rule of 3, I never cared much for the artstyle. And no, I don't mean the weird snout-mouth thing some guys have going on. More I just think the ""cute thing go scary"" thing is wildly overdone, and this game does not try to set itself apart in any way. It feels like it goes way too hard with the overt edginess both in theming and in dialog, and most of my time playing it that wasn't spent gawking at my poor framerate was spent feeling just kind of turned off by the whole thing. It's super on-the-nose, but not in a funny, self-aware way; it feels like the game feels like the juxtaposition is way more original than it really is. Having the juxtaposed cult theme with a cute artstyle could work super well if the game had some better writing making it clear it knows the trope is overdone, but it doesn't have that, and it just feels...sad? Cringy? Gross? I don't know how to describe it, but it's some emotion between those three. I don't like it. Bottom line: I don't like it.

TL;DR because no one is going to read allat, game's performance is poor and some areas are obviously severely unoptimized, cloud saves were an afterthought that cause more issues than they solve, and the game's general juxtaposed cute-but-scary aesthetic is extremely overdone and the game brings nothing else to the table to make it feel original. Gameplay's fine, but somewhat generic as well and marred by these issues to the point that they really can't be ignored. For the price especially, I really can't recommend this game.",1705565086,1705565353,False,1,1,0.423529386520385742,0,True,False,False

Cult of The Lamb has two game modes, so I'll review them separately.

[h1]Combat & Dungeons[/h1]

Fighting and dodging little balls of pain while collecting random weapons in a dungeon full of square rooms just makes me wish I was playing Binding of Isaac instead, so I think it's fair to compare it to Cult of The Lamb. The random weapons don't synergize in interesting ways like the tears in Binding of Isaac. Unlike Binding of Isaac, this game has character progression with permanent skills and upgrades, which inverts the difficulty curve to make the game easier over time. Even without the upgrades, the highest difficulty in this game is a lot easier than Binding of Isaac.

[h1]Village Management & Tech Trees[/h1]

Managing your village doesn't have much to do with the combat. The two modes could have been two different games that you alt+tab between. Villager requests and buildings in your village require materials that can be found in the dungeon, but you'll always have more than enough if you spend a lot of time in the dungeons, so everything might as well be free. There are two tech trees to fill by managing a successful cult: one upgrades the village, and the other upgrades the Lamb. I found it too easy to complete all branches of both tech trees before I was even half way through the main story. Since the main story can only be progressed by fighting the bosses at the end of each dungeon, your reward for managing your village too effectively is to have a pointless village before the game is even close to over.

[hr][/hr]

Since this game is still actively updated, I hope the village management gets more depth and more meaningful interaction with the combat half of the game. Right now, it just makes me wish I was playing Binding of Isaac with one hand and Animal Crossing with the other.",1705528502,1705528597,False,7,1,0.493844062089920044,0,True,False,False

Not only he the best cultist, which is mostly comprised of mammals, The One Who Waits are an average of 3""03' tall and 63.9 pounds. this means they're large enough to be able to handle lamb dicks, and with their impressive Base stats for HP and access to three eye, you can be rough with one. Due to their mostly water based biology, there's no doubt in my mind that an aroused The One Who Waits would be incredibly wet, so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without getting sore. They can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll eyes, Captivate, Charm and Tail Whip along with not having fur to hide nipples, so it'd be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. With their abilities Blood Absorb and sacrifice, they can easily recover from fatigue with enough offering. No other Cultist comes close with this level of compatibility.

Lil introduction in case you somehow aren't already aware: Cult of the Lamb is an innovative indie game that can be roughly summed up as 'Animal Crossing meets Binding of Isaac' with an aesthetic within that ballpark too. (It also really pissed off Christians which is a bonus). If that sounds interesting then this is highly recommended!

Bit of a rant further down.

Been playing since Launch day. (Pre-ordered)
Good game for a rogue-like style. Poor balance choices though.

Golden Fleece being nerfed (I am still malding over this).
Heavy attacks still feel like ass, better to just avoid upgrading to not deal with shielded enemies (As they won't spawn if you aren't holding a weapon that has a Heavy attack upgrade).
Curses still steamroll this game (Blunderbuss seems promising as a ""melee"" replacement though, other weapons don't feel as powerful unless you have a specific tarot build, which is RNG).
Lv 10 follower cap meaning it's harder for new saves/players to gain inspiration when they start demanding nearly 1400 faith for a single god tear (For reference, my highest level follower is 63 before they implemented this cap, every time they pray, I get 63 faith out of them per cycle).

There is a relic that converts blue hearts into x2 diseased hearts but unless I missed something in my 70+ hours in this game, this is no downgrade at all. You just gain 2 diseased hearts (4 hits of retaliation damage) at the price of 1 blue heart (that does nothing but just soak extra damage). The fact this relic isnt a Fragile is a bit of a bonehead move.



Still rating this up if people are still seeking to play a rogue-like time-management game. Though if you hate either option, there are accessibility options that make the game easier to your liking.
Music's great, combat feels mostly smooth, healthy amount of collectibles if you are a collect-a-thon nerd (be aware some are uniquely locked behind special requirements like Twitch or PAX/Discord events. A Pre-order skin also exists. as of typing this review, this is currently unobtainable if you missed out.)

In particular, the level 10 follower level cap seems like at best a lazy attempt at fixing the scaling issues in high level followers, and it ended up making one of the core mechanics of the game even more flat and boring than it already kind of was. I was hoping that the deciple system would be a prerequisite to achieving higher levels as a small way of adding more depth to putting in the effort to level a follower that far, but all of this has just left a bad taste in my mouth. Id still recommend this game to a new player even with the update, but I do think it's overall a worse experience. 
In general, I think that the cotl team could really benefit from rethinking their current balancing methods, as I feel that often times the approach is more to make it not strong than it is to make it more healthy for the game. The rebalancing of the 3 dice relics also shows this, as the issue with them before was that they were a button you got to press every minute or so to make yourself immortal, not that they were strong. Making them fragile relics doesn't fix the fundamental problem with them, it only makes them weaker and borderline unusable. Balancing updates should give you more options, not take away options. 
I do genuinely love this game and I deeply appreciate all of the work that's been put into this game by the developers, but it's because of this love that I worry about the direction the game is going in. This whole review didn't even touch on my issue with the sin system and how little it effects the wider gameplay for how many buildings and rituals are devoted to it, and while I love a lot of the ideas that went into this update I feel like a lot of it could have been implemented without the sin system at all and it would have fit in with the rest of the game much better. 
I hope that many of the balance changes are heavily reworked, or if not then completely revoked. I also hope that at some point in the future the sin system can be expanded upon to feel more intertwined and relevant to the rest of the game. I do think the balance changes are the bigger issue though, and I would be more than happy to change my review to a positive one if just those were fixed.",1705474020,1705474020,False,3,0,0.452791869640350342,0,True,False,False

CotL is one of the most charming games I've ever played. It hits a very specific kind of whimsical eldritch demonic charm that is uniquely it. The music is great, the art direction is lovely, and the story and world are entertaining.

That being said it's gameplay can be a liiiiiittle shallow sometimes. It never feels HARD to maintain the Cult. Typically you have X problem, so you put Y solution on there, and it's more out of convenience rather than ever actually being a threat. Cultists are rather docile so even things like dissenters just get one or two days in the naughty corner before it's all back to basics.

The crusades (the dungeon crawling) has gotten a lot better though after the first major content update, though I'd argue there's still too few interesting enemies, fights, and items - especially when there's only around six different spells split up five ways into different elements.

However with the quality of the free dlc this game has launched I'm confident that this game will only get better and better with time, and that gradually all my little complaints will wash away. Still an amazing game even in its current state.",1705471269,1705471269,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Sure, you can commit a whole lot of sins in this game, but it maintains a strangely lighthearted feel of adventure. That tone is not taken seriously at all; it's just the weird world that the game takes place in. A world where the concepts of faith and power are reminiscent of irl groups, but not preachy or threatening to players. More often than not, most of the doctrines, rituals, and text come off as comedic reference to irl religious concepts and practices. In the end, this is just a game. What you do here does not reflect how you live in real life unless you let it, and you are not doing any moral wrong by playing it.

If you like colony sims/base building and/or action roguelikes this is a must buy.

Bought this game about two weeks ago during Steam Winter sale, I didn't have terribly high hopes, gosh was I incorrect.
Has become one of my favorite games to play after school/work, and I just can't put it down.

[h2] PROS : [/h2]
[list]
    [*]Lovely art style
    [*]Awesome OST
    [*]Cute, but dark
    [*]Gameplay is fluid and doesn't get stale
    [*]Game Time
    [*]Awesome bosses/quests
[/list]
[h2] CONS : [/h2]
[list]
    [*]Endgame kind of becomes a drag later on [b][u] (This might have been improved with the new Sins of The Flesh Update I will come back and update this review if so!) [/u]
    [*]A tad grindy at times
    [/list]

It is the right mix of cozy base-building and rouge-like fighting. The balance is really up to you: go boldly into the dungeons non-stop, or hang with your townies only dip your toe in a dungeon to get a few coins.

Add to that an upgrade progression that lets you decide whether your townspeople will be enriched or sacrificed by your religious sermons.

I felt like the game design was very well thought out, which is so important for a base-building game like this one. You will spend tens of hours doing the same tasks over and over, so they have got to be fun or at least avoidable if you do not want it. I never felt that I was being pushed to do the ""fishing mini-game"" (yuck!) like so many other Stardew Valley clones.

I recommend this game at full-price, but then there are always sales and bundles for this game title. If you can get it on-sale, then it is a big thumbs up for fans of the base-builder genre.

The biggest issue is the game doesn't respect your time. I don't mean it's overly grindy- though it can also be that. The problem is how many unnecessary animations there are for EVERYTHING. Here's a short list of every time the game will stop what's happening and make you watch a 5 second animation:

-When you find a new card
-When you find a new blueprint
-When a boss appears mid level to talk to you
-Every.Single.Ritual. No matter how many times you do it.
-Every Sermon

The worst example is the last boss fight. You need to go through a summoning animation to start the fight, then the first two phases have a short cut scene/dialogue, and the final phase has a separate summoning animation. The game gives you a ""Skip"" button for part of the dialogue, so they're aware that sitting through it is obnoxious, but apparently just that one part. The rest is just TOO GOOD for us to skip past. 

Another issue is the fighting. They give you all of these choices as if you're going to want to theory craft builds, but it's so basic that you'll stop caring within an hour or two. Plus the power attack for the daggers is so OP that you'll find yourself stuck between two options:

1. Do I use something besides the daggers and actually put effort in?
2. Do I use the daggers and just try to finish the level/game ASAP?

Personally, I found myself leaning into option 2. And even if you decide you want to put effort in with the other weapons, the fighting is basic enough that I bet by the end of the third dungeon you'll be looking for your own low effort/fast finish setup. 

The town building is fun, but not hard. I played on hard difficulty, and there wasn't a single time I actually got into trouble in town. Instead, it just makes you babysit it very hard in the beginning. It can be a little annoying, but overall it's one of the better aspects. 

Beyond the gameplay, the art is solid and the juxtaposition of cute animals and cult sacrifices is fun. The story is pretty cliched, but it's good enough to keep you interested.",1705346523,1705374919,True,1,0,0.506172835826873779,0,True,False,False

The music is catchy and adds to the game's atmosphere, but it can get a bit repetitive after playing for 30 hours.

This game is both exactly what the devs intended it to be and at the same time somehow has no idea what it wants to be. Let me explain.

The art direction = phenomenal
The sound design/music = perfection
The theme/lore/story = amazing
The gameplay = ... it's complicated...

I actually think the gameplay is really quite good. The combat is snappy and taking care of the cult is very engaging and fun. The problem I had was mostly a pacing issue I think.

I liked each game mechanic in isolation. But being on a crusade and having to stress about what's happening to your cult in real time... well that stressed me out and made it hard for me to pick up the game again or go on crusades because I was worried the minute I left everything would fall to shambles. This was obviously an intentional design decision and works perfectly with the theme they're going for so... yes the game is exactly what it wanted to be. And I had a hard time finishing it as a result.

And I guess that's fine. Two things can be true. I don't think this game will go down as my favorite game of all time as a result but I still really enjoyed Cult of the Lamb and look forward to toying around with future updates. I don't think I will do a full playthrough again for quite a long time though so here's hoping future updates give me more objectives to continue in my current save file.",1705209609,1705209609,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

That being said this game is quite fun. it has a very cutesy aesthetic, which is in contrast to the fact that you are the leader of an evil cult.  The game has two parts. The first part is a base management sim where you take care of a bunch of cultists and build a settlement for them to worship your character, the Lamb. 

The second part of the game is a rudimentary Roguelite where you battle monsters and collect resources, and cosmetics for your base. This part of the game reminds me heavily of the binding of Isaac, which is also a very messed up game with religious themes. It even has hearts of the same colors that do the same thing.
It still doesn't have any meaningful end-game content. After you unlock everything There is absolutely no reason to continue playing.  it takes about 12 hours give or take to do this. Once everything is unlocked, it's just about collecting endless resources for your base to keep your cultists alive. The rudimentary combat consists of Daggers, Swords, Axes, Hammers, and Gauntlets. There is also 25 magic spells called curses. There are also tarot cards that give you bonuses and abilities that change up the gameplay a little, but mostly all you'll be doing is swinging your weapon, and dodge rolling most of the time. Curses almost never come into play because the enemies and even bosses are ridiculously easy even on the hardest difficulty.  Finally there are cloaks you wear called fleeces that give you a powerful gameplay changeup, but at the same time give you a really bad disadvantage. One example of this is a fleece that allows you to draw four tarot cards before a run, but then you never get any more cards during a run. even with all these things the combat still feels empty and repetitive. 

If you are a bible-thumper stay away from this game as it will trigger your religious insecurity.",1677401610,1705205966,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

There truly is never a dull moment with this title. Its extraordinarily well paced and superseded my expectations in every manner. There was never a moment where I felt as though my time was being dominated by a particular aspect of play. To achieve such a harmonious balance with as many gameplay features that this game contains can only be described as just short of genius. Progression feels natural. NPC stories sprinkle themselves in alongside your progression and there are times it grasps at your heart (pun not intended) to really engage the player and to make them question their actions.

Completeing the game probably won't take the average player more than 20 hours, but the post game content is just as engaging so expect to find 40-50 hours of enjoyment with this game. Also make sure to turn on Vsync if you know you'll be needing it because its not turned on by default. I had a bit of screen tearing but I don't mind sacrificing a few frames for a more whole picture. Unlike most titles anymore, this game's highest fidelity graphics are surprisingly undemanding provided how gorgeous they are, so I hadn't even noticed I was having issues on the graphical front until the first boss fight.

My only regret in my play through is that I wish I would've spent more time taking quests from the villagers. I will admit I was a rather cold and apathetic leader for these poor creatures, but it was hard to stay attached to any one for too long because of how short their lifespans were. Poor things drop like flies. Hopefully the coming updates expand the number of interactions you can take with them, and maybe give them tails?

There is interesting progression, though with a total lack of precedence or substantial automation. There is both base building and top down rogue-like gameplay. However, both become rather shallow once you're a few hours in. There's just far too much babysitting and needless padding for me to really sit down and genuinely enjoy this game. There isn't a way to absorb all of the surrounding essence, and the cap for devotion is far too low on the main totem. You have to manually instruct your followers to do the most obvious of things, such as laying in bed to fight off a sickness. And these things constantly progress while you're in the dungeon. There are good ideas surrounding this, but the time element here just feels off. Famine events are unique and a step in the right direction for this type of risk/reward to adventuring. However, I feel that you have to hand hold far too much for these events to feel worth while. Combined with the generic stupidity of the NPCs, it can be difficult to spend more time out and about completing the actual quests rather than tending to gardens, cooking meals, and doctoring the ill.

This is hopefully another Devolver title that improves substantially with time. Enter The Gungeon wasn't released in any form near the masterpiece it became after a few years of patches and content additions. There is a listed roadmap for this game in progress, and I think the ""sex"" update that is to be released soon addresses some of these concerns. Time will tell.

With this said, I can't tell if this game was intended to be speedran - quickly slaying through all 4-5 of the dungeons - just to finish the game, resetting with new doctrine decisions or if it was intended to be this long grind to build up an ensemble of a cult like following. It supports both options, but in all honesty this game is probably best enjoyed plowing through the main content rather than scaling up your base for improved weaponry, relics, and curses. It's essentially a casual and cute game that's pretty to look at, but shallow on deeper consumption. The progression ends far too soon, and exists more as horizontal damage progression rather than providing enough new and unique ways to enjoy and play the game. It's enjoyable and fun initially, however I wouldn't recommend this game in it's current form for those who are more interested in the traditional difficult/rewarding rogue-like game format (ala Hades, Gungeon, Issac, Nuclear Throne, etc) which stand to still be enjoyable 200-300 hours in.",1705192577,1705192715,False,4,1,0.498169213533401489,0,True,False,False

The hook of running a cult to power up your lead is actually pretty bad. Most of what you do you your cult just goes to keep them running and automate some of the more tedious functions, which even then remains tedious do to a lack of simple management menus. The cult only powers up your character via sermons and the occasional sacrifice which just unlocks nodes on a relativity small skill tree. Most skills just unlock new flavors of the magic and melee weapons. I never really felt like I was getting stronger as my cult grew. 

The combat half of the game, and what you need to complete to roll credits, fails as well. The spells are decent enough but most melee weapons are too slow or too short to feel effective, the AX was the only weapon I actually enjoyed using. It also isn't a game were you can combine skills and become broken one way or the other, it's painfully basic. The art style, camera angle, and the amount of shit the shove in the foreground can make it a strain to look at and just obscures too much in the combat to push it. 

Both halves of the game come off as incredibly basic and don't mesh as well as you would hope. There are better action in this genre (Hades, Dead Cells) and probably more interesting sims too. The greatest failure is probably Dave The Diver does this combo with more charm and cohesion and I played that first, and I would recommended most people do the same.",1705006179,1705006247,False,0,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

I adore this game so much I literally immediately bought it on my PC and the my Switch, and I have multiple different cult saves operating all at once because theres just so much you can do with the content! And I have to give a huge shoutout of praise to the developers because this game is the definition of a passion project and they showcase it constantly. The amount of content they've given players with ZERO expectation of additional DLC purchases has been absolutely insane, They have truly set a high bar for me for any other game company, and they've won a fan for life with the quality of this game and all they've given us so far. 

Even when the game had some bugs on release, the devs were always upfront, they were honest about it all and were constantly pushing updates as quickly as possible to provide us with the best experiences & then have repeatedly since been giving us glorious bonus content. I've never been happier to support a company before and I have never had a dev company whose ass I was willing to kiss with this amount of praise, without being forced to by threat of a paycheck, so anyone who knows me can tell you that my love for this company and game HAD to be well earned ( and it absolutely is )",1704746585,1704746585,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Cult of the Lamb is a mixture of Hades and Animal Crossing gameplay with Don't Starve art style and Binding Isaac's demonic story type.

The main aspect of the game is its contrast between cuteness and satanic nature of the game. You recruit a little cute animal to be your follower then the next day they ask you to feed poop to another follower or sacrifice one of them with that cute smile.

Combat is either boring at first and suddenly too hard if you don't get it, which I don't.
Maybe its the camera angle or the positioning of mouse-users.
Yeah, playing with keyboard and mouse sucks awfully.

A lot of little things and repeated animations that just takes too long. 
Like you can't skip the rituals or collect the faith with ease.
Colony sim and roguelite elements are both limited, which is not an issue if the story/gameplay is a bit less repetitive.

As a gamer who is honestly not the best at gaming, I would say that this game is accessible for even those of us who live by the button smash. Easy mode still poses a challenge, but the challenge remains surmountable. Each boss has its own move set and at least two phases, something I really enjoy. The art is beautiful and the characters are super cute- though tragic. I hope that future game updates have our choices further effecting the world around us. 10/10.

EDIT: 

The relics update has added SO MUCH. I am loving the direction cotl is moving and I do have to say this is by far my favorite game. Genuinely, this is the funnest game I've played in a long time. I have to take breaks from games and usually when I come back to them, I don't feel as interested and invested in them. However, I haven't yet felt that way with COTL. There's a lot of replayability with this game, and the update has really amplified that. 
Which, by the way, for a game of this level of detail, style, and graphics, the constant stream of updates is a shocking. Each update is a delight, and I'm immensely grateful for all the work the programmers, artists, and other developers have put into this fantastic game.

They have a fine amount of available customization options for the members.

Though I wish there was more content when it comes to cult things. You atm can do various things like build, do rituals and other things.

The animation is charming, the fighting mechanic is very satisfying, and the variety of activities makes sure my flitting brain always as something to latch onto. 

I do feel I need to clear up some comparisons that aren't really accurate, though. I'm an Animal Crossing player, and if you're going for that specific feel, you're really not going to find it here. Your followers will die of old age within hours, which means you really don't get to know them or get overly attached. It also isn't a real time game, which means the days go by super quick. I'd compare it more with Starview Valley in the mechanics department.

My biggest concern going in was that I would have to treat my followers like dookie in order to progress the game.

The storyline itself is wonderful, The base building aspects are done great, The rogue-like aspects are done great. The one flaw I'd say the game has is- replay ability.

Not only have they added multiple expansions but after beating the game there's a bunch to do, new areas to unlock on the actual map. And more buildings to build, more to do with the doctrine.

It feels like 2 separate games however. 
One part is the 'Roguelite Dungeon', the other is the 'City Builder'.
The just feel very disconnected, one time you are playing the one, then you decicde to go play the other. They should be more intertwined in my opinion.

Both parts don't have much depth sadly, but they are fun in their simplicity. I would prefer depth still, they are not mutually exclusive.
My biggest issue with the City building (Farming Sim pretty much) is that everything goes so fast, you can't do a couple things before a day is over. Followers grow old very fast, which takes away from the sacrifices because they are just a resource that will go away soon anyway.

Presentation, art style, animations are universally incredible.

""Cult of the Lamb,"" developed by Devolver Digital, emerges as an unconventional and intriguing blend of dungeon-crawling and religious management simulation. Set in a whimsical yet dark world, you play as a lamb resurrected by a deity named The One Who Waits, charged with building a following and combating otherworldly forces.

The game excels in its unique combination of genres. It splits your time between nurturing a devoted cult and embarking on dungeon expeditions. These procedurally generated dungeons provide a variety of stages to conquer, yielding resources essential for your burgeoning community. The game's loop of resource gathering, cult management, and dungeon exploring is surprisingly satisfying, enhanced by a charming art style and expressive animations that infuse joy into every aspect of gameplay.

Cult of the Lamb's storytelling and gameplay mechanics are its standout features. The game delves into themes of escapism, responsibility, and the complexities of leadership. The dialogues and interactions with NPCs are well-crafted, with each character adding depth to the game's narrative. The management sim aspect, involving resource gathering and cult maintenance, is well-balanced with the combat elements, ensuring a varied and engaging experience.

The game's combat system, while simple, is enjoyable and addictive. A variety of weapons and magical abilities add diversity to the battles, though the challenge may be mild for seasoned players. The enemies are well-designed, each with unique attack patterns that require strategic thinking and quick reflexes to overcome.

One of the game's high points is its presentation. The mix of cute animal characters with darker, satanic themes creates an intriguing aesthetic that is both endearing and unsettling. The attention to detail in the sprites and animations adds a delightful touch, bringing the game's world to life. The sound design and music are also noteworthy, enhancing the game's atmosphere with catchy tunes and character-specific voice effects.

The management aspect of the game is thoughtfully executed. Tasks like farming, sermon giving, and ritual performing add layers to the gameplay, intertwining base-building with the narrative's progression. The game cleverly uses these activities to deepen the player's connection to their cult and the game's world.

The game's world is not just confined to your cult's base or the dungeons. It expands to include various characters and locations, each adding to the game's rich lore and providing a welcome change of pace from the core gameplay.

However, the game is not without its flaws. The base-building elements, while engaging, can become repetitive, and the impact of player decisions on the overall narrative is limited. This lack of depth in decision-making affects the game's replayability.

In summary, ""Cult of the Lamb"" is a refreshingly unique game that successfully marries two distinct genres into a cohesive and entertaining experience. Its blend of dark humor, captivating art style, and engaging gameplay make it a standout title in the indie game scene of 2022. While it may not delve deeply into either the rogue-like or base-building genres, the overall experience is greater than the sum of its parts, offering a memorable adventure for players seeking something different.",1704299582,1704299582,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I played Cult of the Lamb earlier this year, and while I did love it, I finished the main story in a week and basically forgot about it until I realized there was a bunch of endgame stuff I didn't even touch and there were a bunch of achievements I didn't get
SO I PLAYED THE WHOLE THING AGAIN
And boy oh boy, was it amazing all over again. The game combines roguelite with base building, and it works PERFECTLY. You're gonna spend hours customizing your base down to every single tile, and then you're gonna go to the woods and beat the shit out of some heretics with some kick-ass gameplay and a PHENOMENAL soundtrack
Oh, and also, this game is METAL. AS. FUCK. You're a tiny little lamb guy that rules a religious cult in the name of an unnamed god made prisoner by his siblings and now you gotta set that mothefucker free, and while doing that you have an endless supply of followers that, as long as they have faith in you, will do whatever your dark heart desires.

This is one of the only games I've ever played where I just can't stop. I always have something to do, preach the daily sermon, set a new doctrine, fix the broken beds, tend to the farms, and then I get to the woods and the gameplay is so good I just don't wanna stop doing runs. I spend hours upon hours playing this and time just goes...

You can build your base however you want, as long as you keep everyone well fed, healthy and faithful to you. Of course, if there's not enough food, or if someone is trying to dissent against your teachings, there's always a way to make them change their minds... As the leader of your Cult, you can perform rituals that do all kinds of things, from forcing everyone into a fast so they don't bitch to you about hunger for a few days, to entire sacrifices in the name of The One Who Waits, or just straight up make your people do shrooms and get them so high they don't give a shit no matter what you do, so you can dance with them or just straight up murder someone in front of them and they'll literally not care

The game also has some amazing endgame where it gives you so much to look forward to and actually interesting ways of going back to places you've already visited, without it feeling boring. 
I will say that it would be a good idea to check the wiki or some online guides when it comes to certain doctrine choices, because with the right ones you can make your Cult extremely low maintenance and allow you to do some really long runs, but with the wrong choices, just a few minutes can make everything fall apart and make the overall experience very stressful, basically, the more you can avoid losing faith while you're away, the better (NEVER pick Good Die Young). 

Cult of the Lamb is yet again another certified Devolver classic, with the devs at Massive Monster still updating the game (sex update incoming btw).

I spent a long time shrugging it off because I was worried that it might be trying to be too many things I'm interested in at once and thus fail to be what I wanted it to be. I was so, so wrong.

1) The music. I am such a sucker for a soundtrack and this has one of my favorite ones to date. The lighthearted songs that play while you manage your cults camp is the chefs kiss in this game and it makes things like farming, cleaning up, and other activities just so enjoyable. The track ""Faith Up"" literally gives me chills I find it so good. 

2) The art style is perfect for what this game is. It perfectly captures that cute but dark mood they are going for. Looks great on Steam Deck which is what I played it on and I would imagine even better if you play on the new OLED screen. 

3) The combat is by no means difficult (I decided to play on Normal for my first playthorugh) once you get a feel for the semi-bullethell gameplay most rooms offer. The weapons, powers, and relics are all fun and upgrades keep it fresh. I plan on upping the difficulty to its max and playing on the penitence mode (you unlock this through an in-game event) for more of a challenge next time since I have a grasp on the mechanics now.

4) Besides some important structures that help the game progress and expand your cult base building is as much or as little as you want to make it. I'm not a huge decorator and like minimalism so I kept my area simple but there is lots of potential for you to spend hours making your camp perfect. The UI for moving and changing pre-existing structures and building new ones is quick and effective.

5) I think the pacing of this game is perfect and it offers so many ways to play. For your first playthrough I recommend playing on the normal difficulty to just experience what it has to offer and keep things moving. Even fishing can be streamlined to auto-fish which I loved because I don't care for mini-games much. It's not trying to be too difficult but instead just be friggin fun. And since there is lots of ways to run your cult its also funny and dark. Want to make everyone the same name, eat poop, and fight to the death to be the rule enforcer? You can! And thats hilarious, but it also doesn't make the game impossible to beat just paced differently.

As others have said, the sum of this games parts is greater than the whole. And the whole is a fantastic game thats going to add the nookie soon. 9.5/10 buy it

100% edit: after 50+ hours, I do enjoy the game, the art style, visuals, ambiance are just calming, perfect to be a game played casually. The main story is quite short if you speedrun it, but I do take my time with things. This game has quite the grind that can make people roll their eyes. The Purgatory sub-levels are a nice endgame and replayability option after one finish the game, although may not be enough for some. Overall, Cult of The Lamb is an amazing indie game, with a cute art style, cartoonish violence and world building elements. Thank you Massive Monster for making this experience like any other.

A game that works much more heavily on the presentation than its execution. The game is really neat and has a unique dark vibe to it that makes it appealing, but the depth of its mechanics leaves much to be desired; the combat is incredibly simple, with very little trade-offs or tools to make it interesting beyond the RNG weapon drops and upgrades. The runs are extremely short, and they have to be because your cult runs in real time when you're gone.

A lot of the building and tasks in the cult-building mode is extremely simplistic, and really does not go beyond farming food and crafting food so your cult doesn't starve. A lack of in depth automation or random events happening makes the routine of this mode all the more boring fast, and eventually an afterthought.

But then you're left with a game where the rogue-lite element is too simplistic and made to be done extremely quickly and without much thought, and then you have a base-building element that is also extremely simplistic and you get a pretty average game.

EDIT AFTER RETURNING:
I came back to this game to finish it as part of a project finishing games in my backlog I hadn't completed. After finishing the final boss I can say the rest of my review still stands, it's inspired but the gameplay is bland and better elsewhere. The town management sucks and is too manual. The final boss is still awful and the RNG setup is still a bad choice. Why couldn't they let people have fun at the end of their game?

Still a hard no recommend. Go play one of a million other games with gameplay similar to this but are far better and respect your time more.",1662422881,1704153570,False,1,0,0.496732026338577271,0,True,False,False

#1. you can smooch the rat (Just getting that outta the way. instant 3/5)
#2. Refreshing roguelite UGH daddy.

This game is like if Animal crossing and binding of isaac had a gay baby and shot it up with heroine straight in the spine, both of these elements are a fun and enjoyable struggle to juggle and make a WHOLE lot of time pass, making you feel like you have issues for playing it so damn long, or maybe im just projecting. 

Anyway this seemingly cute game is is rather cold and disturbing, (Like me) bc its both, it never lets you believe that what youre doing can be mistaken as heartwarming and kind, you will convert, use, manipulate and murder your pions for you own selfishness, nothing is disguised and you shouldn't feel bad, bc this is a radical cult. but that's just Morales. its satirical as much as it is accurate.

there isn't much to say about the roguelite gameplay, its not gaming changing, truer to formula with its progression, rng and weapons, and thats not a downside by a long shot.

Cult of the Lamb was set to be a winner for me. Combining management sim and roguelike mechanics is, on paper, absolutely my cup of tea. Cult of the Lamb does a pretty good job at executing this combo, but it's definitely not perfect.

The art style and sound design in this game are brilliant. It's wonderful to look at and really stands out from the crowd even as it sits half-in a genre that has other cartoon-y contenders; Binding of Isaac, primarily. At times, there are small visual elements which make combat tricky, such as white flashes for both hits on enemies and enemy hit charging times, difficulty with perspective in a strictly 2D environment, and issues with correctly reading hit boxes as a result, but none of this is game-breaking or frustrating enough to break the loop for me - I'd find myself playing for 3-5 hours at a time, unable to put the game down.

It's clear that this management sim / roguelike match is made in heaven, and as a result the biggest 'problem' with Cult of the Lamb is that there isn't MORE of it. And I don't mean lengthwise, I mean depth. As you reach the 15-20 hour mark, I found that the repetition was beginning to wear thin, and this is where the game's lack of depth begins to show the most. There isn't enough combat variety or depth in management systems to hold my attention much further in either halves of the game, so I pushed fairly quickly to the end and, following the credits, ran out of energy for achievement hunting, 100% completion, or new game attempts.  

I've been happy to see frequent updates and a DLC release since launch. It appears the devs take great care of their game and community and are giving it longevity where they can. The game's deserving of it, and I'd love to see what they could do with a Cult of the Lamb 2. Hopefully, they can take some time to push both the management sim and roguelike elements even further, as it's clearly a winning formula that I would love, love, love to return to.",1704039193,1704039193,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The management portion of the game is pretty lightweight, you have to keep morale and food to acceptable levels while progressing through the building tree and completing objectives to appease your cult members. You unlock augments for your cult doctrine over time, though they don't impact the gameplay too severely. The cult members are fairly autonomous day to day, which is useful since the game's time continuously ticks away, no matter the activity.

The cult system is fine, but it's pretty shallow. Not a bad thing persay, just doesn't allow for much replayability. Then there's the combat sections in the dungeons which are pretty fun, if punishing. You roll a random weapon and ability for every floor of a dungeon, and you gain cards throughout a dungeon giving you minor bonuses until you eventually die or live to kill the boss at the end of the floor, unlocking the next floor. It's a satisfying enough system, if a bit repetitive.

i think the way its portrayed online tends to lean into the humour, often with a memey twist, and while thats a part of this game, i think theres more to it than that. theres a balance struck. there are times where the atmosphere is dark and oppressive, the colours can be striking and visuals beautiful-- there are moments and ideas that i think, despite the humorous wrapping, can be quite poignant.

sometimes this balance doesnt work, and the game steps on its own toes. and i find that even on the developers/games social media pages, they tend to not even try to do so, and instead just focus on the funny, 'charming', marketable bits. but i do think this game is a bit more than that, if you let it be. and for what its worth, the gameplay loop is, to me, satisfying enough. im not particularly experienced with the type of combat in this game, so your mileage may vary-- i can understand if it might be a bit simplistic to people more experienced.

still, if it interests you, give it a shot-- theres a lot to like, even if theres occassionally some things to dislike.",1703990444,1703990444,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You take the role of the Lamb, a creature tasked with operating a cult for an elder god being.
A very fun mix of town building, resource managing and dungeon crawling awaits. It never gets too much, with the ""rogue"" parts of the game being bite sized and taking about 10 minutes to complete (with an option to extend them, should you wish to do so.)
The game operates on a day-night cycle that can sometimes get a little repetitive with tasks that you should be performing every day, such as holding sermons and greeting your cult members, however it never got to the point where I would skip these tasks on purpose, as they don't take very long and give you nice perks.
As your cult grows you gain access to more difficult areas and a wider variety of decorations and functional buildings, as well as unlocking perks for your members and new rituals to perform.
Should you want to switch up the gameplay a little, the game allows you to change the Lamb's pelt, which gives them different buffs/nerfs, such as stronger attacks in exchange for taking more damage.
The story is simple yet engaging, and there is a lot of post-game content to keep you glued to your screen.
The developers have an update roadmap available, so there's always new features to look forward to. The mythical ""sex update"" is on the way at the time of writing. I can't wait~.
All in all, a very fun game and worth the pick up both on and off sale.

A great game to spend some of your time on! Very pleasing visually and the gameplay is pretty nice too! Bossfights are challenging, but with a few right decisions you can break the game down (sort of TBOI-style) and make your adventure a breeze.

Bad thing is repetitiveness of the gameplay. Various weapons and magic seemingly help with that, but not for long, since very few things change.

Because that is basically Cult of the Lamb.

The biggest difference is that you personally don't actually need food or sleep, only your cultists do, so failure to manage them won't result in a game over, it mostly just sets you back in time. You unlock more and more buildings as you progress, and as you unlock buildings it unlocks jobs your cultists can do, so over time the things you have to personally oversee becomes less and less and more streamlined to deal with.

Taking care of your cult is pretty easy, it mostly just involves making sure they stay fed, manually sending them to ""sleep it off"" if they get sick, or imprisoning them if they start to dissent. The other half of the game is the roguelike dungeon crawling. Every dungeon run you start gives you a random weapon and a random spell, and you may upgrade or swap weapons and spells multiple times throughout a run, as well as picking up a bunch of different buffs from tarot cards and relics you find along the way. The only thing you actually have control over is your Fleece, and aside from your starting one that does nothing, all of them have bonuses and negatives to using them, so you can sort of change your playstyle based on what fleece you're using. My first unlocked fleece, and favorite until end game, was damage focused and gives a stacking 5% damage buff for every enemy you kill, but you lose the buff if you take any damage and you take double damage from attacks. At end game though, you get more hardcore versions of the starting fleeces, like one that makes you do 10x damage but you only have half a heart so you die in a single hit without mitigating factors. My favorite end game fleece though makes it so you don't get weapons at all and instead makes you a full on spell caster, letting your power regenerate over time, your spells cost less power to use, and you get a full bar of power every new room you enter.

Steam says i've played it 26 hours, which is hard to believe it has taken this long, but I had finally finished the post game content, although to be fair, the post game content is mostly just running through the normal game a second time with everything a little harder but using overpowered new fleeces to make it not even matter.

All in all, I enjoyed the game. I bought it for $15 on sale and its definitely worth the price for me. I didn't bother with the DLCs because they only add cosmetic stuff like follower skins and new decorations, which I didn't care about at all and still don't regret not buying them.

That said, i'm probably done with the game. There doesn't seem to be a whole lot of replayability, and you technically have to play through it twice to really finish up anyway. At this point, there is nothing left for me to do but run the dungeons over and over but I don't get anything useful or interesting as a reward anymore (since I have already got all the stuff I want) and the runs aren't unlimited anyway because theres only a finite number of rooms until it ends each time, there is no infinite run possible to see how far you can get or anything like that, which is kind of disappointing.

Either way, I think i'm done with it, but i'm glad I got it and got to experience it. Cute game. I'll come back and check out the new update that is in the works and supposed to be coming out soon, maybe it'll add more fun stuff to do.",1703816204,1703816204,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

IMO the developers did not really understand the roguelike/roguelite genre, and ended up making something that appeals more to the casual gaming audience. 

To sum up the main problem: the town sim exists to prevent you from playing the roguelite.

Time continues to pass for your townsfolk whenever you are doing a run, this leads to you losing 1-2 days per run. Missing days translates to various missed opportunities/resources. Also, you must provide your townsfolk with food constantly or they will starve. The result for me was frequently spending 3+ days between runs to minimize losses before going on the next run. That is 20+ IRL minutes between runs, doing chores.

A lot problems could be forgiven if the the roguelike elements weren't so bland. I am not a very skilled player, but I enjoy the genre from time to time. For this reason, I chose the ""normal"" difficulty. In my hours of playing, I have not died once. Not a single time. There were 2 times when I got down to 1/2 heart, but only because I was lazy. The amount of invincibility on the roll is way too high, and most enemies are slow + melee. Boss battles are often solved by tanking their hits while spamming your melee weapon mindlessly. Despite looking like an isaac clone, it lacks much in the way of nuance and challenge.

Overall, this game has a lot of potential, and the developers clearly put in a lot of work into the aesthetics. But it is not ""fun"" to play.",1703753703,1703753703,False,4,1,0.496478855609893799,0,True,False,False

Gameplay is easy enough to figure out, as are the objectives. Activities to manage your Cult keep you active and the story itself is quite immersive; it is easy to suddenly realize you've been at it for over an hour. Speaking of which, it is a game which very much discourages dawdling; even in non-critical activities, you are often up against the clock, as it should be. Staying engaged is its own reward. While there are no overtly measured timers, many things do decay, spoil or wither.

In terms of technical gameplay, it is rather one-note, but you'll hardly notice because what it does, it does very well.

The world in which it takes place is interesting and there is so much mythology and implied history, with the addition of some other aspects to exploration in gameplay, Cult of the Lamb has a great deal of world building potential.

Combat is not super complex, but serviceable.
I normally avoid rogue-likes, but this has a strong progression system and it's only the individual dungeon runs themselves that are generated. The different areas and NPCs and story are all scripted and well-defined.

It felt incredibly difficult and frustrating. Bearing in mind, all of my games on Steam I have not used a controller, but also that this game is unlike any other I have in my library.

I set it down for a few months, picked up my husband's bluetooth Xbox controller, and then ended up no life-ing the game for a couple weeks. Like I mentioned, this game is unlike any of the others in my library. I play a lot of simulation, tycoon, management, cozy games. But this story-rich, roguelike dungeon crawler with a touch of life management stole my heart. I love this game, bought my own Xbox controller so I'm not always using my husbands, and continue to no-life the game on and off. Am I good at it? Sometimes, but I'm getting better.

Are there specific pros and cons to the game? Not to me specifically; the game is very well rounded with updates and content still being released. It's a labor of love and the devs obviously love their game. There are occasional bugs and visual glitches, but they are easily reportable and seem to be taken care of quickly.

I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to spice up their game library, or if you already know you like this type of game. It's a fun play with lots to do and an interesting spin on the genre.

Spoiler free part
Summary: I would recommend if you like dungeon crawlers and roguelike games

Cult of the Lamb is a dungeon crawler (binding of Isaac or enter the gungeon) combined with building strategies (timberborn). And this combination is to my surprise well made and fun. Theoretically, you can dump the base building if you don't like it but I can assure you, you will like it. Combat is swift energetic and can be quite challenging (depending on which difficulty you're playing). There is some story but I would say it's not that big but the devs say they're working on it. And finally, I would like to say the ""simple drawn"" graphics are just amazing. That's what I like about indie games, they're unique style of art and in this scenario, it works wonders. (when your cute little lamb performs a ritual where you sacrifice your cute little cat follower and your other followers start clapping and cheering it is just wonderful XD)

The long analysis
The base building aspect
I generally like this experimental combination of genres, but I must say I enjoyed the vision of the cult growing for like the 2 or 3 locations and didn't really bump into: ""You need more cultists to open this door"" but at the end of the game you need about 20 cultists to progress, so I needed to grind. There are rituals and other things but I really did not pay much attention to them (that doesn't mean they're not fun but I enjoyed more the combat side). But that's just me.
The dungeon crawler aspect
So in Cult of the Lamb, you go to crusades for materials and to kill bosses to progress in the main story. I really like how different the scenery and enemies are in the four parts of the game. There are many playstyles you can choose, you can have a ""mage build"" or just depend on your demons to do all the work or you just hack and slash, That is for you to choose (if the RNG and cards are right). There are four weapons you can get at the start of your crusade and all of them have unique playstyles and abilities for you to master. So the crusades don't get repetitive and every crusade is unique in its own style.

All in all cult of the Lamb is a great game and you should play it, or I might send some very hungry fellow your way :).

Short story, Spoiler alert
[spoiler] You are the last of your kind, the last sacrificial lamb. The four bishops of the old faith want to kill you to get rid of a prophecy. They kill you and then you meet in the afterlife with One Who Waits. He gives you a Red crown that gives you immense power and commands you to make a cult in his name. Then you return to the land of the living with a quest to kill the four bishops to release One Who Waits. When you do kill all the bishops then you need to go to the afterlife and make yourself a god by killing your master. [spoiler]",1702855309,1703357040,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

What I like: 

- Has an enjoyable gameplay loop that bounces you from managing your village that is easy to understand and not ""micro-managey"" to fighting in rouge-like dungeons and like side quests and tasks in-between to make the game refreshing

-Has a killer sound track that has the mix between cutesy (think Animal Crossing) with a more sinister and dark tone. It fits the game extremely well with every dungeon type and area having a completely different vibe. 

- As someone who can be quite sentimental towards the characters in games, being able to not only choose your cultists' names and facial appearances, but having different decisions made for you to make to each cult member leaves you with moments of going, ""Awww, do I really want to sacrifice you for _____?"". I have some favourite cult members but don't tell the other please. D:

- There is always something to do in this game, it feels like most of the time I complete a task, there's always something else I could do after. Even after defeating the final boss, there seems to be a good amount of things to do after the game but I have yet to play that. 

- The relics that have been added with the previous major FREE update is a very welcome addition. Relics are one or multiple use abilities that have big effects. These can include giving the lamb a random set of health via a dice roll to decreasing the lamb's size, making him faster with a smaller hitbox. 

- Enemy types are varied for each dungeon type which reflect the types of bosses you will fight as well. Some are not as unique with most having unique ways of attacking. Everything from little guys hiding in bushes to conceal their attacking animation and ambushing you, to toads that upchuck red heat-seeking bee's

- The story is kinda cookie cutter, nothing mind blowing but it's the type of story you would want out of a more chill game like this. 

- S-X UPDATE?????


What I dislike: 

- Some of the tarot cards (buffs you gain while in a dungeon) you earn can sometimes be kinda useless compared to the rest. Having cards better than others will obviously happen but one's such as ""makes you break rocks by standing near them"" is a lot less useful than gaining a ""1.5x damage boost with your weapon""

- The final boss fight was cool but I wish I could've customised my loadout before fighting him. Instead you're tossed into an RNG scenario of hoping you get the weapons and spells you want to use. 

- I recommend getting the ""outhouse"" building ASAP when playing the game as it can be very annoying at first to pick up your members' ""fertilizer"". I wish you could acquire it sooner so I'm not spending a large chunk of time cleaning up after them when I could be doing other things instead. 

- Because of the unique Paper Mario like aesthetic, the hit boxes can sometimes be hard to follow. There have been many moments, especially at the start of the game, where projectiles and enemy attacks seem to hit you in awkward spots. Not too much of a big deal, it's something you will just have to adjust to. 

- Some of the enemies which you would think would be easy to fight can ironically be the most annoying. One dungeoun features flying bats that are not only quick but can attack at a very ridiculous range imo and even fly out of bounds to where you can't even attack them! 


Overall thoughts, the game is fun that offers FREE major updates with a lot of content even after defeating the final boss. Very much worth the original price but is a nice steal when on sale :>",1703288929,1703288929,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Cult of the Lamb is a rogue-like game centered around building your own satanic cult and indoctrinating cute forest animals to grow your divine powers, which will come in handy when you venture in the lands of the Old Faith to fight against false prophets in a dungeon-crawl like experience. You play as the LAMB, a poor sheep who was brought from the dead by THE ONE WHO WAITS to eliminate the false gods and restore his powers. In your way you gather gulible cultists to hear your sermons and follow your word.

First and foremost, the artistic design for this game is simply put: PEAK. The environments, the characters, the animations, all of it is extremely original and well made. The cartoony and cute aspect of the characters clashes against the dark theme and rituals performed by our lord and savior, the Lamb, making it a really fun and impressive game to play! As an amateur artist, this game's art really inspires me!

The gameplay is also phenomenal! Not only does the base building aspect not feel just slapped onto the game, but it also is quite fun and enthraling, for I catch myself just running around my cult doing chores, tending to my followers and editing building just for the fun of it! The combat is great, involving mainly being able to dodge enemy attacks and memorizing boss attack paterns. It provides a challenging yet rewarding experience for those who like crusading against the infidels in proceduraly generated combat rooms. Although I must warn you that this game is better played using console controllers (I play using my ps4 controller).

On top of all that, the soundtrack is also really great! It perfectly fits the setting and is actually really enjoyable. The songs feel whimsical and mysterious, and it's really fun to watch the lamb just swaying around whilst the background music plays lol.

To add even more compliments, the developers of Massive Monster are always in contact with their community and never cease brewing up quality updates and bug fixes to present the best game possible. 

So yep, I really do recommend it. The only downside I could possibly say about this game is that it can become repetitive as you grow your cult... but honestly I don't even feel that, everytime I open this game I usually spend several hours playing without noticing! And after the Relics of the Old Faith free dlc dropped, even the endgame got new chllenges and content!

The game is INCREDIBLY charming.  Your cult members are adorable little animals that make fun noises.  The art is fantastic and does a great job of making you forget just how dark the subject matter is.  The sound design is just as good, mimicking the whimsy of the art style.  Combined, these make what could easily be a game that's far too depressing, dark, and scary into something fun to pick up and play.

Sadly, art and sound are the best part of the game.  The core loop of the game is spent 1) building your base 2) manipulating your followers to love you and gather resources 3) going out into the combat area of the game to collect more resources and followers.  When you return from combat, repeat.  Simple!

Both the combat and the base-building parts of the game are lackluster.  I completed the game without bothering to build more than half of the buildings and never suffered for it.  The base building and cult management felt like spinning my wheels for the purpose of spinning my wheels:  I need more followers to harvest more resources to support more followers which requires more resources.   Luckily, this doesn't take TOO much time or thought, and even though it wasn't great, it didn't drag the game too badly.

The combat, which is a huge part of the game, also feels lackluster.  Your kit consists of an attack, a dodge roll, a spell, and a heavy attack.  This seems like a fine enough kit for a game like this, but the game doesn't challenge you enough to truly master anything.  Most of the time, I was just mashing attack while dodging the enemies' telegraphed attacks.  The combat was so trivial that the rare times there was a more difficult fight felt like an absurd difficulty curve spike, but really I just needed to dodge a little better.

There's a few inconsequential side quests, a gambling game, and a fishing game that serve no real purpose and aren't entertaining on their own.  You can give gifts to cult members, inspire them to dance, turn them into demons and bring them into combat with you, marry them, force them to eat poop (yes lol), but all of this micro stuff is unnecessary.

Overall, I spent about 15 hours going through the game on 'hard' mode.    I did enjoy it for the most part, but nothing is compelling me to go back for another spin.  It's a very strange game that acts like it's going to challenge your micro and macro abilities, but the low stakes involved and the simplicity of combat make me feel like the developers designed a game to truly test you, then pulled back at the last moment.  What a shame.

Maybe this is a computer thing, since it was way easier on xbox. The hitboxes are just ridiculous. It might be hard to get good hitboxes with 2d characters on a 3d plane, but the binding of isaac and castle crashers did it, so I think the devs just to work on it a little more. (Castle crashers CAN be a bit annoying, but no where NEAR this.) Even when you're LITERALLY INSIDE THE ENEMY your attacks rarely hit. The game is also a bit laggy, and while the artstyle is good, maybe it would help to tone down the assets a bit?

It is a funky combination of a roguelite battler mixed together with some colony sim. It being a mix of 2 genres, neither of these parts felt properly fleshed out.

The dungeons felt way too short to feel real impact from random pickups/upgrades making me not really care about them. One of the 5 weapons (claws) felt absolutely terrible making me frustrated whenever that (sole) option was presented.
Also the fish RNG is definitely broken which was also a frustration on my part.

Cult of the Lamb is a cute game with cute character designs, and it‚Äôs weird how well it fits with it‚Äôs dark theme (sacrifice and death etc).
It has nice soundtracks, and it‚Äôs combat mechanics are just smooth, it feels really good to play.
The gameplay alternates between hardcore fighting and chill cult management. You can easily forget about life for hours straight while building, upgrading, preaching and playing god on your cult.
I never used it, but it has a nice Twitch integration, you can name your followers after your real Twitch follower‚Äôs usernames, and they can vote about decisions in the game. It‚Äôs the closest thing to really playing with the chat.
From the beginning it‚Äôs very addictive, it has a nice progression and an interesting enough New Game +, making the monsters harder, and adding new moves to the bosses, a new gamemode and depending on your late game choices, a more complete conclusion. it‚Äôs worth playing.
It‚Äôs very creative the fact that each character has their own fictional language, for us it‚Äôs just some random goofy noises but it makes sense in that world.
 I played only on Extra Hard and it was challenging, maybe I could‚Äôve 100% it way sooner on easier difficulties.
Where the game really shines is your freedom of choices, what kind of cult leader you‚Äôll be, and even having so many possible solutions for the same problems, for example: Your followers are hungry. You can: harvest berries and cook something; go fishing; unlock upgrades that let you make food out of grass; make a feast ritual; make a ritual where they will not eat or be hungry for 3 days; decrete that cannibalism is acceptable so they can eat dead followers meat... it gives you a lot of autonomy and freedom.
Thre are different possible gamestyles with your fleeces and curses, whether you want to play like a mage focused on using curses, or maybe equip a berserker fleece that makes your hits 10x stronger but you die with 1 hit of anything. There are a lot of options and each one is very different and fun to try.
I‚Äôve been wanting to play this game so bad, and it was really worth the price.

During that process I experienced the game fully and explored many aspects of game play. Over all I would say Cult of the Lamb is a good game worth playing the combat and town building aspects of the game both are fun.

   However it isn't a game without issues for me at least during the start of the game having to manage cult members was incredibly annoying and time consuming and I often found my self just wishing to get back to the dungeon crawling. That being said later in the game you can automate maintaining your cultist and it is very fun to fully build up and decorate your cults town.

   The combat or ""crusade"" sections of the game are fun with smooth combat and movement, the bosses are fun and it is fairly challenging especially later in the game. Post game you can replay through the dungeons on harder difficulty all in a row which is a fun post game challenge. Unfortunately I found that while trying to beat the game at certain points the requirement to progress being number of cult members led me to simply rush through the easiest dungeon hoping for cult member spawns which was very tedious and boring.

  The bosses them self's are very fun and the combat lends itself to being able to specifically opt for a certain combat style. That being said while I do understand its listed as a ""rouge-lite"" it was getting repetitive by the end of the play-though there's effectively only 6 weapons and 7ish curses. Instead of adding new ones the game opts to simply put a new effect on an existing weapon as the ""new"" one. However if you don't mind the somewhat limited options I'm sure you will find the combat very fun as I definitely did.

  I think that while it does have its issues cult of the lamb is a very good game with a distinct style that sets it apart from other rouge-likes and if your looking to dip your feet in the water its a good start. But if you want a lot of variety and intense fast combat it might not be the game for you.

   I would give it a 7/5/10

Plus there's no good way to automate all the extremely boring and repetitive parts of the game. 

Days are really short as well so half the time it felt like all I was doing was tidying the base, transferring poop from the outhouse to the fertilizer, blessing everyone daily, etc and before you know it the day is over again and you have to make a ton of meals and get ready for the day again.

If you are like me and have deep regret anytime you make any kind of ""dark side"" decision in video games, don't worry! You can be a kind, benevolent leader who cares deeply for your followers. I love to throw a feast for them and give them a day of rest. They all smile and look very happy. You can take in enemies you've defeated and show them the true meaning of love and compassion. 

Not feeling so kind? Make them fight to the death for your amusement, imprison dissenters, sacrifice them, murder them, make them cannibalize each other, sacrifice them so you may grow stronger. 

Additionally the combat is fast-paced and snappy, very satisfying to maneuver around enemies and slice them to ribbons.

Cult of the Lamb is a great mashup of civilization builder and roguelike action. One half is cultivating your plot of land for your cult, building structures, harvesting resources, making sure followers have their hunger, hygiene and faith needs satisfied. The other half is spent on ""Crusades"" where the Lamb enters the realms of the Old Faith to fight heretics and collect resources for their cult back home.
The action is about halfway between Hades and The Binding of Isaac, where it has Hades' close range combat, a dodge roll, and a limited ""cast"" ability. It is like Isaac in that the health system is nearly identical, with red gray and black hearts, all having the same function. The Relics update adds active items that can be activated, then need to be recharged by fighting enemies, similar to Isaac space bar items.

The developers at Massive Monster have been keeping the game very interesting with regular updates and new content. I respect their desire to make the game the best version of itself, rather than move on to the next game, and leave CotL in the bin collecting dust. I reccomend following CotL on twitter too, their social media manager is a riot.

I think this game is incredibly buggy and It's combat elements require more depth if it should be looked upon as a roguelike or even roguelite. 

On release I thought the game was interesting, but disappointing. The concept of managing the needs of your cult while balancing the time to venture into dungeons to further the story is cool. Though I think both aspects of this balance are flawed because of how the cult managing aspect is incredibly easy and the combat aspect of the dungeons is janky, which makes it difficult. I think the combat in this game is exceptionally frustrating from the fact your moveset on each weapon is very limited and your dodge roll is unreliable. On release your moveset was a single combo, a dodge roll, and a button for using your curse attack. This is very underwhelming and not very fun. The weapons definitely feel different, but not in a meaningful way that makes me invested in the system or have a weapon I prefer. This is paired up with the fact that the range enemies can hurt you at isn't clear and becomes impossible to judge when certain moves come out so quick. Along with that there's a dodge roll that is way too slippery to be very helpful at weaving between enemies or dodging projectiles (which the game makes you do a lot of later). Because of that every bossfight or difficult encounter feels like a frustrating mess because of how unprecise the dodge roll feels and the way some weapons insist on finishing a combo for extra damage that stops you from cancelling it with a roll to avoid getting hit. This is to say the roguelite aspect of the weapons is very limited and I would say the same about the tarot cards in this version. you'll get at least 2 tarot cards every run, but the way they modify the game doesn't change the way you play it at all and so doesn't create the image of this game as an interesting roguelite.

I mention this Roguelite stuff a lot because if you google this game and ask if it's a roguelite most places will come up as yes. As someone who has played a lot of roguelites good and bad, I felt tricked and lured in by the games weak and surface level mechanics that I hope would give the game some depth later. But honestly the city builder aspect feels like the more polished part of this game because the amount of strange glitches and softlocking this game's dungeons have is upsetting. Some of the glitches can just be an enemy not giving a clear visual tell they are doing an attack, but sometimes it can be a strange softlock that prevents you from finishing a dungeon and forces you to start the whole run again. Sometimes if enemies live after the boss died or you get damaged in someway while your in the middle of picking up the boss's item it's over for you. You will now be stuck in a hell of not being able to finish picking up the object and the walls sealing the room up so you can't progress. The only option being to exit out through the menu and start the dungeon again. Of course these are issues I had at release so they can get fixed or improved on in the future ideally, but the reason I'm doing this review is because it hasn't.

After getting Softlocked on one of the big bosses of the game (the third dungeon's Bishop) I took a break from a game. It just felt too unpolished and buggy to enjoy in it's current state so I waited for over a year to come back to the game. Which I will say did thankfully add depth to the combat and roguelite mechanic through giving each weapon a unique button to do a special move with that only consumes a bit of curse meter. Along with that, more fun tarot cards were introduced and they added relics that were bound to a button you could use inside the dungeon that have a variety of effects. This is an upgrade, but all the special moves (including the ones that come out quickly) lock you in place really hard and make you an easy target so you are discouraged from using them. Also it takes a while to unlock all the new tarot cards so most runs have you using the boring ones from release. Still an improvement though despite the amount of bugs that still exist inside the game. It only took me 3 hours of playing this game again to somehow get myself totally softlocked into a boss room again. Being forced to quit out of the menu and restart the dungeon. Because of this I think the combat is too frustrating and or inconsistent thanks to bugs to be fun to play with.

I'm leaving this review not because I hate the game or anything, but because I don't want anyone coming into this game expecting something like an interesting roguelite and getting disappointed by the combat aspect of the game. I still think there's fun to be had in this game if you know what you're actually getting into with it. False advertising on it mainly being a roguelike was the reason I bought this game and so it's what is important to me covering here. It would take a lot to make me try this game again, but I hope my current perspective to those who glance at this game and check the reviews before buying.",1702444716,1702444716,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The management of the cult is my favourite part, the feeling of upgrading your base, being better, building better buildings, everything is so smooth.
I think the only downside of this game is hit-boxes. Indeed, combat is OK, but sometimes you really don't know why you're hit and why you don't hit the enemies.
But except from that the game is absolutely perfect. Endgame content is... like... infinite.
I have decided to stop, not because I don't like the game, but because I feel like I've seen everything. You can fight bosses again, you can complete some part... But I feel like I have to stop if I want to play some other game.
For me this game is a 95/100 just because combat is a little under develop, but except from that, absolute perfection.

I bought this game on Switch when it first came out and I'm pleased to say I am a happy convert - I especially enjoyed meeting the creative team at PAXAUS! It's great to see a homegrown indie game have such great success, and I think the combination of the crunchy playstyle, gorgeous and creepy-cute art, and the absolutely stunning soundtrack by River Boy are what makes it such a wonderful game.

Also, shout out to the accessibility features - this game was my first ever rogue-lite, and my first ever that wasn't turn-based in some way! With the difficulty grading and ability to tailor the game play to my needs, CotL acted as a gateway that soon got me playing more difficult games like Hades! So it will forever be a favourite and a comfort game for me that gives me a much needed pick me up whenever I play!

The whole game¬¥s art style is cute-looking, but with a dark undertone, it¬¥s beautiful. 
Music also helps create this atmosphere of calmness and harmony, but when the action starts, it can drop some great beats.
Combat is swift and precise. Thanks to the DLC, the combat is even more harder and has many things to complete and gather, like bishops as your followers.
The only complaint I have is the end game with your followers and buildings. There needs to be more stuff to build and upgrade because there is nothing much you can do after you build everything available. The same thing is with your followers as there is nothing much to do with them, mostly used for prayers and farming.
Other complaints are sometimes the game crashes during rituals, and sometimes the game lags when a lot of things happen at the same time, but it is not game-breaking stuff.

Feed your people Before you leave for dungeons or different places.

DO your rituals and all of your other Church things First and then Run your Sermon at the end to help make everyone happier in the end.

... Still a positive review though.
[i]Barely.[/i]


All jokes aside, the cult of the lamb is a game with a great art directory. The game excels at it's great artstyle, music and sound effects but is blood-boilingly mediocre in every single other regard.
Because of this I sadly cannot rate this game higher than a 6/10, despite having the potential to have easily been an 8/10.

Cult of the lamb is based around the interesting idea of combining a dungeon crawler rogue-lite with a colony-sim but fails miserably at both in the process.

To start it all off: 
The game is glitchy at times, thankfully it is rare, but when it does happen it does tend to be quite big.
An example from my playtrough would be the temple building: 
This is the biggest and most important building in the game and you are supposed to only be able to build one of them in your colony. In my playtrough I somehow placed 2 of them at once on the same spot overlapping eachother. 
After that, everytime I went into my temple the game would load the interior twice after a delay, creating a really annoying short wait I have to sit out every time I enter.
Eventually I moved the temple to hopefully fix that issue, that was when I discovered I somehow built 2 of them inside eachother, moving one of them fixed the issue but created a new one: the duplicate temple still existed and cannot be destroyed. With the duplicate temple being stuck in the place it was, I permanently lost a decent chunk of my colony landmass. 

Secondly, the colony sim part of the game I can only describe as boring as hell, I sadly lack the ability to describe why exactly but the best I can do right now is say that the entire colony just feels like a way to grind for grinding sake instead of creating a truly living society.
Likely because the NPCs are incompetent and cannot do almost anything without the player instructing them to.

The amount of unskippable animations or 'cutscenes' in this game gets frustrating very quickly, there are hundreds of unlocks in this game and for almost all of them you have to go trough a 10-second animation, this is okay at first but dear god does it get agonizing quick. 
Same applies to shorter animations that you see very frequently such as increasing the loyalty of a follower to your cause.

It feels as if the entire game is based around the gimmick of ""cute artstyle but dark evil story"", 
which isn't necessarily a bad thing but where the game does start to feel incredibly lazy is that it starts feeling like an excuse or distraction for the mediocre gameplay.
""Oh the colony is boring as hell but look over there! they are doing some messed up sh*t over there! damn ain't that awesome?! It's completely messed up but our artstyle makes it look so qute! Please ignore that there is barely anything to do!""
>repeat for the entire game.

Now let's talk about the roguelite dungeoncrawler part of the game!
As with everything else, the music, art and sound effects are great, but utterly mediocre or bad in all other regards. 

1. A horrific shortage of weapons and abilities:
COTL might very well be the roguelite with the lowest weapon variety I've ever seen (and I play a LOT of roguelike/lites)

It's literally just these:
A Dagger
An Axe
A hammer
A sword
And claws 

Yup. This game got 5 f*king weapons. The only difference is that there are multiple types of each weapon, just not in a good way.
It's literally just default axe but with poison damage added, or default axe with higher damage, default axe that gives mana when hitting enemies, default axe that makes you wish this game had actual weapon variety.
None of these have different movesets or animations, just a different sprite and a (de)buff for each different type. Repeat this for all weapons.
The end result is that the game only has 5 weapons.

2. COTL dungeon runs are extremely short: only 5-15 minutes per run depending on which area you pick.
This is neither a positive or a negative itself, the issue comes from that you spend so much more time prepping for the dungeon run than the actual dungeon run itself, this is especially the case in the endgame.

3. I must first note that the game is controller recommended, but there is straightup zero reason in the gameplay that would indicate keyboard users to be inferior to controller users in this game, given that the game actually functions properly..
I don't bloody know how but for some reason the character often rolls in a completely arbitrary direction, I really hope this does not exist for controller users. 
Furthermore I often seem to get hit for no reason mid-roll immunity frames as well somehow.
These 2 combined are the cause of 70% of all damage I take in this game, causing the dungeon crawling to be BLOOD BOILINGLY INFURIATING at times.
The combat itself is also very simple to the point of almost being boring.

Finally, the game continues after the default ending where you reach your main goal in the story. Neat I guess. Sadly it is done in such a way I was genuinely unsure if it was a true continuation of the story or if it was just a massive amount of bonus content, a new game + of some type perhaps.
And because I avoid spoilers like the plague in games (and also because I am a completionist), I decided to grind to the end of it.
The issue arises that it marks the halfway point of the game when you start it and the game heavily implies there is a great reward at the end of it all, I expected a true ending of a sort.
The way it is done is by literally locking away all your dungeon progress and the game telling you to beat all dungeons in the game over again from start. There is straightup near 0 new content.
The final reward of doing nearly the entire game over again is a complete letdown as well, pretty much coming down to ""you did the thing"" The end.

There are more minor negatives I would like to list but this review is already too damn long.

Hot damn am I close to flipping this to a negative review now I wrote all of this out, maybe I will one day. For now it stays barely positive though.

Only buy this game at a heavy discount and if the gimmick really interests you.
Final verdict: a low 6/10, maybe a medium/high 6/10 if you are a controller user and really interested in the cult gimmick.",1701957130,1701957339,True,2,0,0.524691343307495117,1,True,False,False

Don't let the cute graphics fool you...this game has blood, gore, death, poop, vomit, supernatural beings, demons, monsters, tarot cards, an upcoming sex update, and decisions that will have you question your sanity. Did I REALLY just murder a follower in the middle of the night for becoming elderly? Yes...yes I did. Your followers are adorable, but don't get attached to them. Some of them may not last long or they will randomly get killed or leave your cult. This game is like Supernatural meets Hello Kitty. I won't spoil the story or the major surprises, so I'll just talk about the gameplay.
 
  The combat is super easy to get used to and the different weapons and curses keep it interesting. I like it when games play different every single time with random dungeon generations, different items, enemies, rewards, etc. The different areas that you can visit are fun and add a nice touch to the game. The boss fights aren't too difficult and if they are, you can scale back the difficulty. I appreciate the fact that this game has a ton of accessibility options, such as auto cook, auto fish, dyslexic friendly texts, and a dark mode option for the main screen. Good on the game devs for keeping everyone in mind, I respect that. 

  If you like fun beat em ups, supernatural/cult stuff, and making lots of decisions, then I highly recommend this game. If you don't think you can bring yourself to make cute animals kill and eat each other, throw them in prison, or do anything that a cult leader would do to their followers, then maybe skip this title.

Cult of the Lamb is greater than the sum of its parts. It doesn't quite achieve rogue-like or base-building legendary status, but the overall package is elevated higher than its reach.

[h2]Story[/h2]

You're a lamb sacrificed by four gods named ""the bishops of old faith."" Upon death, you meet an imprisoned fifth bishop named ""The One Who Waits."" The One Who Waits provides a crown embued with godly powers, tasks you to start a cult in his name, and kill the other four bishops.

The story is a simple one, but I never felt I wanted more. It's a solid foundation for satirical humor, and the religious references are funny and land often.

As things progress the game rewards you with little tidbits about your origin and place among the bishops. It's all light fare and works well.

[h2]Gameplay[/h2]

I didn't know I needed a genre blend of rogue-like, bullet-hell combat combined with the progression of a base-builder, but it's a beautiful balance.

Combining these genres creates a nice pace where you do a dungeon run to collect resources and hurry home to take care of your followers. The flow is reinforced by a daily timer prominently displayed at all times. I also appreciated how your cult's base progression advances combat strength. Outside of combat and base building is a variety of minigames, including fishing, a gambling dice-based game, and other cults to visit and exploit.

[h2]Base Building and Your Cult[/h2]

The gameplay is fun and addicting but never very deep.

There are familiar elements like resource gathering to build new structures and you can refine resources to create more advanced structures.

You need to farm to feed your growing cult and use their feces to fertilize new crops. If followers get hungry or unhappy for any reason, they will dissent and start spreading ant-gospel to everyone else. You can then imprison them until they learn to behave or sacrifice them for meat to feed followers.

Followers level up, and you can send them on adventures to get resources or bring back new people to indoctrinate.

There is the ability to customize every follower's appearance and there are endless unlockable decorations to personalize your base.

The base-building gameplay loop is tied to the cycle of a new day. Each day resets cooldowns like sermons and rituals. Both sermons and rituals boost cult morale. However, rituals have special effects like making everyone feel full for a couple of days, motivated to work tirelessly through the night, or building extra devotion by marrying a follower (wed multiple if you want but they'll get jealous when they witness you smooch another.) You can then extract devotion to level up combat abilities or unlock new structures.

Base progression is well done, and I liked how advanced structures automated farming and other mundane tasks. I was growing bored of some repetitive tasks right around the time I unlocked structures that let my cult do it for me. Nothing is overly complex or overstays it's welcome.

[h2]Adventuring and Killing in the Name of Your God[/h2]

As with base-building, the combat part is also pretty simple. There is a spammable weapon attack, a dodge-roll, a resource-based magic ability, and a charge attack that uses the same magic resource but at a slower rate.

There are several weapon types, such as daggers, swords, axes, and heavy hammers. The only change in gameplay from weapons is attack speed, damage, and how long you're left open after an attack. 

Weapons can also have a single modifier type. There is nothing too crazy here with the usual assortment of poison, crits, health-leeching, or the chance to spawn a little ghost that will attack a nearby enemy. All the modifiers play the same and only add more random damage that the player doesn't control. The crit weapons always give the most bonus and make other options feel trivial.

Enemies range in size, speed, and attack patterns. They flash a moment before they attack. You can dodge-roll at any time and even when charging up your own attack. Other enemies spew projectiles on the screen in bullet-hell fashion.

Your first priority is to avoid damage. Watch for the spew of bullets and enemy charge attacks. Next, get in as much damage as you can. Each weapon has a combo string, with the final hit doing a nice bit of extra damage. The slower the weapon, the shorter the string. There are also charge attacks, but I never found them to be an efficient use of your magic resource.
There are a bunch of magic cooldowns with various ranges and functionality like AOE pushbacks, long-range seeking missiles, and temporary invincibility. The resource requirement is well-tuned, and abilities feel powerful but not overpowered.

The combat loop is fast and fun, if rarely challenging for the seasoned player of these genres. 

[h2]Graphics[/h2]

Cult of the Lamb lives on its presentation and deservedly so. You can't go wrong with cute animals and satanic overtones. Every sprite is lovingly crafted and often hilarious. The animations are excellent, too. I never grew tired of watching Lambert open his cult bible, hover in the air, and extract every bit of devotion from his followers.

There is a large cast of characters and places to see other than your own base and the procedural dungeons. One favorite was a town where the cult leader was obsessed with gold and all things shiny. All his followers were dipped in melted gold and could only shake to acknowledge his presence.

[h2]Sound[/h2]

The music is catchy and memorable. I liked the sound effects, too. With any base-building game, you're bound to hear the same blips and beeps over and over. The effects were always crispy and satisfying. There is no voice acting, but the animalese-like chatter is themed to each character. The spider has a SssSss to his voice, and the fish has an underwater blooping to his tone. The voices always made me laugh.

[h2]Conclusion[/h2]

Cult of the Lamb is a smart game with tons of features and ideas going for it. That said, it plays things safe. The base building is approachable but too simple and one step away from greatness. The combat is good but never as exhilarating as some of its rogue-like peers. However, the presentation and humor are excellent and make Cult of the Lamb feel special enough not to be missed.

[h2]Pros[/h2]
[list]
[*]Genuinely funny
[*]Great pacing and blending of genres
[*]Fun, addicting, and doesn't overstay its welcome

[h2]Cons[/h2]
[list]
[*]Combat would benefit from more variety
[*]Base-building remains essentially the same from hour one to hour twenty
[/list]

[h2]Challenge[/h2]

I played the game on ""Very Hard."" There are several levels of difficulty that adjust how much health you have, how much damage you take, and how quickly your followers get hungry or sick. I found the game relatively easy and desired a bit more challenge. The final encounters were fantastic and a great example of what's possible within the game's framework; I just wish there was more of it.

This game is VERY addictive, and you can easily see why: the animations are satisfying, the colors are lush, the whole gameplay loop of running through dungeons and bringing stuff back to build your settlement just feels so smooth and natural. The settlement shenanigans quickly become the more important part, given that they lead to more of both upgrades and fun moments, but the combat segments don't feel lackluster either, they are pretty fun and challenging at times. The game doesn't go too deep with its systems, but the main story isn't long enought for this to take a toll on the experience. The only gripe I have with the game is the fact that some combat strategies seem obviously inferior to others. It feels like some of the weapons and spells simply exist to dillute otherwise a very powerful loot pool so that you don't constantly get fireballs and crit weapons to plow your way through the rooms. This power level divergence is a necessary measure, but I still feel like the weapon/spell pools could use some tweaks so that discrepancy isn't between getting the better or worse stuff, but rather getting stuff that significantly alters your playstyle in a way that is still viable. The game is otherwise fantastic, and it is super engaging all up until you beat the final boss. This is when the post game content starts, and it gets kinda repetitive/grindy, as you essentially repeat everything you've done in the main plot but with a difficulty modifier. I feel like counting the post-game content as a full-fledged downside would be unfair, but I cannot just omit it either.

I would give the achievement difficulty a 6/10 because of the purgatory mode and no hit bosses and there are a few missable achievements to watch out for, such as the achievement for winning a game of Knucklebones against each NPC that stands around the table.

Setting up and looking after the cult back at the base is rewarding and fun! The followers start off not much better than actual infants when it comes to looking after themselves. It can be as amusing and endearing. At moments it can also be frustrating coming home to poop everywhere - but now I look back fondly on my days of tending to my early followers poop!

The crusading has a brilliant combat system, and is very beginner friendly if you haven't played many roguelike games like this one before. The story was really compelling to unravel too, and the breaks between story arcs and tending to the cult were very cleverly structured. 

One thing I wish was in the game... without trying to spoiler anything, my dumb fingers managed to misname a character in my cult who is very important to me and now I can't change it and they're stuck like that D:

My own mistake of course! But whenever I see them now a little part of me internally is yelling 'noooo!' I wish it would be possible to have a renaming function? I've seen this mentioned online and suggestions of a few different ways to implement it so thankfully I'm not alone in pressing the wrong button! 

The cult menu when pressing - doesn't seem to actually do much of anything right now. Would be awesome to have that feature in there. Or maybe a ritual which allows you to reset the name and attributes of a follower to hopefully roll for better traits? Might be quite useful for later game...

I'm so sad I didn't play it in time to vote for the 'Labor of Love' award! It really has earned it - there is so much heart and personality bursting from this game. Can't wait to see what comes next!

I hope everyone enjoys this game as much as I have!!! <3

IMPORTANT EDIT: Since postgame I've personally had a lot more Unity Runtime Errors than I had in the main game. Main game I had about... maybe 2 total? Since post game it can be frustrating trying to get through dungeons.

Is it bold to deem this is as my all-time currently favourite rogue-lite? Honestly, I'm a little unsure.
Straight-up I'm no rogue-lite nor rogue-like fan, I don't like the formula nor the ideology behind the genre for the most part. While there are a few games within the genre I've managed to enjoy a little, sort-term; mostly -- Cult of the Lamb however is however the first one I've managed to enjoy for more than 2-or-so hours, which is very impressive to my standards.
If you're interested to hear about my personal problems with the rogue genre, specifically the rogue-lite genre, you're welcome to check out my Hades review! Thank you.

But I really enjoyed Cult of the Lamb. I may never have finished it, nor do I imagine myself ever doing so... Not because it's ""too hard"" or anything, I just eventually got bored & unmotivated.
Still, I quite enjoyed the majority of my time with this game.



[h1] Rogue-lite [/h1]

As previously stated, if you're interested in hearing a more in-depth opinion on the rogue-lite formula you should check-out my Hades review.
However Cult of the Lamb truly stands out, it really stands apart from the others in the genre. I can really praise that, especially as my biggest gripe with the genre is the formulaic & stereotypical; untouched ideology behind all the games. Maybe there's some other rogue-lite game I don't know about which also changes it a tad, but I don't know & all the majour ones don't.

But it really strikes out & carves its own path using the bare definitions of rogue-lites. It plays itself much like Animal Crossing x Hades; and those are 2 games I've really somewhat enjoyed. Yet their combination just seem to work so flawlessly here.
The rogue-lite pieces seem to not be the main attraction here, but instead only be half of the puzzle pieces to the entire jigsaw puzzle. It works in conjunction alongside the cult management to fulfill the entire set, and each piece seem to smoothly transition into another largely seamlessly.
And I mainly focused on the cult parts of the game, as that's what I enjoyed the most. I really enjoyed building up this little town for my members, and decorating it very nicely, and pleasing my cult members. All very satisfying, all very cool. I truly enjoyed the resource-management part of this game. I felt like I constantly was running out of materials, and then had to gather some by going through the rogue-lite doors to gather materials & villagers to turn cult members. It's a truly cool system, as I've been starving for a twist in the formulaic & copy-paste formula of rogue-lite games. So when the rogue-lite parts aren't treated as a constant grind to beat the game, but only as a occasional grind for loots; with an end-goal set around beating the game. For most of the game, once you walk into a rogue-lite door it's not because you want to beat the game, because the majority of the doors don't allow that. The doors are split up into 5, and 4 of them you need to grind through multiple times individually to even unlock the last one. Entering the previous 4 doors after beating them are not necessary to beat the game, as such repeating areas you've already mastered are not mandatory. Take some f#cking notes, Hades.
And one of my favourite features are the fact that even if you die, you don't lose all your loot -- only a percentage. This means that even if you mess up, and die, you didn't just dedicate yourself to some 30 minute ""nothing-burger"" run, where all you achieved were some arbitrary upgrades for your next attempts... no. Instead you get the materials which you can actually use outside of the rogue-lite aspects of the game to build your town up. Amazing!
And it's even better by the fact that your weapons are basically 100% randomized. You can never rely on a singular weapon, as you're always pushed into enforced use of a weapon you maybe haven't learnt yet or feel comfortable with; so that you can get out of your comfort-zone & learn other play-styles... again... take some f#cking notes, Hades.

I consider this game the 'Hades successor'. Not only does the ""hub"" area actually mean something, but failed runs does too. This game is just really perfect, truly.



[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

I really enjoyed Cult of the Lamb. I had low hopes for this game, I only played it because I wanted to hate it... but surprisingly, I didn't.
The only probable actual criticism I have for the game is that the music is somewhat lame, and doesn't fit with the game very often. It also gets very stale & repetitive. But don't worry, it's nowhere near as bad as something like God of War 2018's lame-ass soundtrack.

I really hope more future rogue-lite games copy the ideology of Cult of the Lamb, without copying its formula too. Rogue-lites deserve some actual changes, and to experience the uniqueness other majour genres do.
I'm deeply grateful for Cult of the Lamb, and I have a lot of respect for it too.
I'm sad that played so much upon release that I essentially burn myself out, as I've basically lost all my will to play for now.
Still, I can't wait to get back into it once I get the will to do so once more!

But not the one who resigned themselves to their fate. Luck in the form of the enemy of elders gods saved you from a tragic final. Now you are alive, dangerous, and ready to take revenge. The only thing is to get strong enough to challenge the enemies. To do that, you need followers who give you what you seek. With the help of a supernatural patron, you will run your cult and kill elders gods.

It`s how your Cult of Lamb will be started (or not ""Cult of Lamb""‚Äîit's yours; you can give it whatever name you like). And it`s up to you how your cult will finish. The adventure of the little cultist lamb has started.

The game provides us with two main mechanics. First is the cult builder sim. You manage your village, look after followers, build buildings, hold ceremonies, etc. Second is rouge-like dungeon rides called ‚ÄúCrusade‚Äù. You collect resources, get new followers, and, of course, defeat bosses. Also, there are mini-games and some interesting mechanics which make the game process deeper. All of these things combine ideally you don`t have a chance to be bored (maybe a bit with a village). Tired of building a village - move to crusade, tired of dungeons - your followers are awaiting. Switching mechanics imperceptibly moves you to the game final, providing a lot of joy. What else provides joy is the game style. I`m sure Cult of Lamb developers hardly see this review, however, I need to say that the character design and visuals are terrific. Your designers are rocks. Characters look not only cute but also scary. Which is not so easy to achieve, obviously.

Cult of Lamb is practically devoid of cons. Someone might say modest duration is the main minus of the game. But developers works on that and the latest update provides us with additional quests after beating the last boss. So I would say the major con is not addictive base-building mechanics. Yes, it`s good to get rest from the crusade by building a village but it might be much more interesting if we have some reasons to improve the cult, except to be stronger on crusades. Or to build a more posh-looking village.

However if you are fan of unusual settings, not trivial ideas and rouge-lite games choosing Cult of Lamb would be great idea!  Be sure to try

But, in cult of the lamb the game is just a mix of hack n' slash and combat that you have to think about your attack and dash. And the fact that the game is well scaled, I feel like giving the rogue genre another chance. 

I've seen a couple of reviews and some people seem to be saying that the fights are too simple or that you can abuse certain mechanics. But if you play the game and don't really think about pushing the big min-max game, you're going to have a really nice ride.

You have city building/management aspects and the adventure portion of the game kind of plays out like an old school top down Zelda game.  The game play is very addicting and is one of those types of games where ""one more run"" keeps you up until after midnight.  There are some rogue-lite qualities as there are permanent upgrades with random generated maps.

Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ (5/5)

Step into the enchanting world of Cult of the Lamb, where adorable creatures, cultish endeavors, and a quirky sense of humor come together in a delightfully bizarre package. This roguelike action-adventure from Massive Monster manages to strike a balance between challenge and charm, earning its stripes in the indie gaming realm.

The game introduces players to an unexpected protagonist‚Äîan adorable lamb who finds themselves at the center of an eccentric cult. The premise alone sets the stage for the kind of quirky adventure you didn't know you needed. The pixel art style, combined with whimsical characters, creates an atmosphere that's both cute and strangely captivating.

Gameplay in Cult of the Lamb is where the magic truly happens. The roguelike elements ensure that each run feels fresh, challenging players to navigate through procedurally generated dungeons while mastering the art of combat. The combination of precision and strategy keeps you on your toes, making each playthrough a delightful dance between chaos and control.

Now, let's address the cheeky suggestion of a ""Sex Update"" that could allegedly elevate the rating to a mythical 6/5 stars. While the idea adds a humorous twist to the review, it's important to appreciate that Cult of the Lamb's charm lies in its quirky, family-friendly appeal. However the idea of a ""Sex Update"" would definitely be an addition that would have players enjoying themselves for hours longer with their Cult Followers especially if including the Twitch Integration with your followers and viewers on Twitch.

In conclusion, Cult of the Lamb earns a solid five-star rating for its imaginative concept, engaging gameplay, and the sheer joy it brings to the indie gaming scene. While the idea of a ""Sex Update"" might be tongue-in-cheek, it's essential to recognize and celebrate the game's existing strengths without veering into territories that could compromise its wholesome charm. So, whether you're a seasoned gamer or just looking for a dose of cute chaos, Cult of the Lamb is a divine experience that's worth every pixel.",1701206519,1701206519,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
