Enjoy!

UPDATE

Over time, there are a few gripes I have with the game. 

1. You can combo into Antea (woman), but not into Red (man)!? So combat combos can flow in only ONE direction. Very curious on why this is. 

2. I believe this is a bug, but I do not really know. When I aim the rifle, for some ODD reason, the reticle yanks left or right as I am trying to zero in on a target. This makes me miss of course! It is infuriating.

3. Jewelry you put on Antea for combat purposes, do not show onm her character. Nice touch if they did. Also the game is sorely lacking when it comes to armor and weapons for Red too. Mostly re-skins. Armour takes me right out of it. Honestly, the clothes he starts in, took my 3/4 tyhrough the game. I swapped to the DLC garb in the mountain region to mix it up. Not the biggest issue, but I was hoping for more. 

4. Combat could use way more combos. It feel's lacking. It's not the worst, but could use some additions to keep it fresh 30/40hrs in. 

5. About 10/20hrs in and the message is present. Some knew this by the cover, I did not want to assume.... To the ones that guessed / knew, touche. I tried to refund and was of course denied. Not surprised, but irritated. I might as well finish to see if it has an uplifting ending or will it bash the ""settlers"". ",1707801849,1708926232,True,0,0,0.469798654317855835,0,True,False,False

The opening sequence was fine but beyond that other hub areas have drastic fps drops for no reason. Traversing back and forth through areas starts to lead to RAM usage creeping up and up and traversal stutters start to crop up as repeated heavy amounts of data are loaded and unloaded at defined environmental divisions. Reducing settings or using upscaling doesn't get you much back in terms of performance. Frame generation produces flicker with foliage (like trees) sometimes and distortion on UI elements and subtitles occasionally. 

I feel like this game was more built around console limitations and by that I mean that 1) You would be fully GPU limited and 2) Your target framerate is around 60 because with those limitations any of the performance issues that I've detailed become less apparent. 

Dropping my framerate though to 60 is not ideal for my hardware/setup because my GPU would be under-utilized at that point and what's the significance of having higher framerate options if the game doesn't scale well beyond that?

The story, voice acting and motion capture are excellent.  Many NPC side storylines branch in interesting ways.

The combat is middling, and not as good as  Jedi Survivor, which seems to be the main inspiration for both traversal and combat/progression, but not as polished.  There seem to be major performance issues in the engine with the open world being hidden by many more arbitrary and annoying “slow down” barriers (where Jedi Survivor might have one every five minutes, this would have one every 20 seconds of traversal)  - twisty narrow passageways, logs to jump over, gaps to jump over, line of sight blocking hills etc.

The world/monster design is mediocre because of it.  No grand vistas. Can’t see mobs until they spawn on top of you in obvious mini arenas.  The same mobs over and over despite the interesting corpse possession riffs (there’s only one animal, wolf), and traversal is horrendous.  It has no stakes, no real platforming (all jumps are perfect when prompted, you cannot otherwise scale a low fence) and simply wastes your time.  Exploration is not rewarding at all.

As a smaller, linear game without side content and traversal it would have been an easy recommend but this has been bloated into Assassin Creed Valhalla levels of pointlessness, but without anything nice to look at while you’re running around or meaningful side activity like base building.

A tight sequel would be great without all the nonsense sprint/ slow /sprint/ slow traversal.

The combat is ok, 4 difficulty settings,  but story, world and quests are the real strength of the game. With the little PC qualifier below. 

There is vastly more depth and variety to the gameplay, quests and story telling than in Vampyr, which was mostly dialogues. This feels more like a bigger RPG. Sadly skills are exclusively combat focussed. Missed chance.

 Movement and control wise it's not great. You can't jump evn of minor ledges unless they are marked. Think Witcher 2 movement. Some (marked) barrels and stuff are destructable but most are not.    Techncially apart from the very good graphics (with good performance) , it's not horrible but it feels somewhat outdated.
Ultrawide works fine, only cutscenes letterbox switch to 16:9.

I don't mind that they tried to check every PC box they could possibly reach.  That's just how it is (still weird for late 1600's, which wasn't a great time for strong, independent woman, to put it extremely mildly). Treat it as a alternate Universe fantasy version of our world. 

 But what is actually irritating is a another crowbared in crafting/looting system. Will this crap ever stop?

PROS:
Unique, immersive, emotional story.
Hauntings give a fresh perspective on the human condition and how sometimes evil can be hidden behind a bonnet or a bowtie.
The interactions between Red and Antea are top notch, the dialogue, the voice acting, it's like a full-fledged movie
The graphics are some of the best you'll see. Whether it be slicing through specters to a lonely tear streaming down a character's face.

CONS:
The combat is by far the weakest aspect of the game. It's solid, it works, it's reactive but it just doesn't do anything new and exciting and for me personally it was a bit of a let down and repetitive.

Thankfully ""Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden"" is this game. Great visual, good face animation, interesting story and not a bad battle system. But, just not bad. Battle system has big potential, but wasn't realized. The biggest con for me, of course, is a huge lack of enemy variety and this ruins the second half of the game.

The Good

This game caught my attention since the first release trailer and it does not disappoint. From start to finish it delivers on being very narrative driven with such a fun and relaxing open world style game play. The abilities and styles you can play with both characters combined is really unique. Characters dialogue in this game is top tier and expands on a lot of the NPC's across the board. Game-play felt smooth and polished with a little bit of a challenge but nothing to crazy as I played on normal difficulty. Enemies and boss battles were also interesting and effective overall. 

The Bad

One thing about this game that I noticed right away was the lack of characters speaking matching what you saw them say. This was not a big issue but very noticeable and something that I fell will be fixed in the future. Whenever traversing from area to area sometimes characters would get caught, but was not a very common occurrence. Other than those issues did not have to many bugs or glitches appear during my time playing.

Overall Thoughts And Score

This game really has everything and more that you would want from an open world action adventure style game. I was very impressed by how much time and detail went into the story, side missions and other activities etc. Very well made game from top to bottom and beautiful landscapes and time period to be set in as well. The ending for me was very well done, promise no spoilers. At around probably 20-25 to be this game is definitely worth the money you wont be disappointed.

So I'll go with ""not recommended"" because I would literally not recommend it, though I would not try to dissuade you either if you're interested.

The game is mediocre in a lot of ways, there's a great many aspects that work just fine, but it's missing that final point to push it over the line into good or great territory. I'll give a few examples of what I mean.
Enemy variety - There's not a lot of enemy types, even if you include bosses and they are only 3 types really change up your gameplay. Every battle outside of big boss fights feel exactly the same because of this.
Combat controls - It works fine, but doesn't really flow well. Like dodging and attacking will result in a special dodge-attack, that doesn't chain into your regular attack chain, so you get an awkward half second where your character has to ""reset"" before beginning the new attack chain.
Fast travel - If you're a completionist like me, you'll be doing a lot of running back and forth, lots of climbing, shimmying and crawling. There are fast travel-points but you have to run back to them every time you want to use one and that makes for a lot of running back and forth, broken up by meaningless ambushes by specters.
Haunting cases - It really is the selling point of the game, solving the haunting cases and they are fine and good. They even change based on your choices in the main storyline. But the conclusions are not very satisfying, there's not much ambiguity to them. You essentially get 3 choices when you solve a case, ascend the ghost (good afterlife, heaven), banish the ghost (bad afterlife, hell) or blame the haunted person (rip out their soul and banish them). In the VAST majority of cases, there's really only one correct choice because the choice is so obvious and it's almost always Ascend, because how bloody cruel do you have to be to warrant an eternity in hell?
The main characters - Red I quite like, he's a good relatable man and his voice actor does an excellent job. But I really dislike Antea, she's arrogant and constantly doubts and belittle Reds ability. Not like she's overtly doing so, but it's a lot of small comments and the way she acts. Like ""I can't manifest, will you be fine on your own?"", ""I would've used a different ritual"" (after telling me there were specters, so i used a specter summoning ritual, but I needed to use a Scourge summoning ritual), ""Stop hogging all the fun"" the list goes on. It's even more grating when she speaks to Red during conversations, like Red will be speaking to Jacob and Antea will pause the conversation and comment to Red and you're just sitting there imagining the conversation from Jacobs perspective, because he can't see Antea. He's having a conversation and Red just occasionally spaces out for several seconds. And when an NPC can see ghosts, Antea takes center stage constantly, pushing Red to the back. I get that she's the master banisher and he's the apprentice, but they are also a couple and it really doesn't seem like she respects him in the field. It also doesn't help that her voice actor is flat as a board, no doubt she was instructed to be calm, cool and stoic, but she sounds very bland because of it. The polar opposite of Red who injects a lot of character and flavor into his delivery.
Themes - The game will occasionally tell you that racism was rife and prevalent at the time, being black was a horrible existence at the time. But there's only really 2 out and out racists, nobody hassle Red for being with a black woman and nobody who can see Antea seems to mind her being black. There is a disconnect between what the game is telling me and what it's showing me. I recognize that it'd be deeply annoying if racism was a constant throughout. The same holds true for misogyny, you'll be told that women aren't respected but see plenty of female leaders, shopkeepers and barely a soul actually bringing up gender.

It's not a bad game by any stretch and there certainly are plenty of positives. The setting is interesting, the equipment is very meaningful to your playstyle, the skill tree is quite good, the game looks and feels good, no loading screens outside of fast travel, a good variety of locations, the haunting cases are interesting (even if the moral choice at the end isn't really a choice), Red's voice acting.
There's just a lot of small things holding me back from recommending it. If you're in it for the story and don't mind the repetitive combat, you'll probably get your moneys worth from Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden.",1708856864,1708858338,False,2,0,0.548872172832489014,0,True,False,False

You play as Red who is basically told what to do by Antea the whole game like he is stupid and useless without her. He barely ever disagrees with her or speaks up for himself. People also often disrespect him and talk to him like a child. It is ridiculous. Also, a lot of the hauntings which are probably the most interesting part of the game also inject the men are inferior to women mindset. Completely ruined the game for me honestly. 

While the performance is decent, even on lower end hardware, there is often frame drops while traversing the world. The less powerful your processor, the worse they are. I tested this game with 4 different computers ranging from old low end to newer high end and experienced this issue. It isn't bad but it definitely the game could use better optimization which unfortunately isn't something Don't Nod tends to be good about.

The world is beautiful but it is like a maze. You are constantly forced to take obscure ways to get where you need to go. There is fast travel but the bonfires are so far apart that you often just have to spend a lot of time just running where you need to go. Plus if you get caught in a fight, the game will prevent you from running past it. You will have to kill all the enemies before you can proceed. If you decide to complete all the hauntings, after awhile you will get tired of dealing with the maze world over and over. Especially because the hauntings will have your character running back and forth over long distances.

The combat is decent but the lock on is pretty much useless. There is a good variety of ""builds"" you can do with your character but you will find that focusing on a certain build can make the challenge areas difficult because you will have to fight enemies a certain way to do real damage. Otherwise, you will be stuck doing trash damage until the enemies die. 

The game had potential to be something good but the developers decided to inject modern ideologies into it. I even made myself do a lot of the side stuff and finish all the hauntings to see if it would change my mind about the game but it didn't. At the end, I was just ready for it to be over.

The atmosphere is good, you're in this oppressive version of the New World that is haunted by ghosts and specters, the removal of which is your job as a banisher. I've only done a few haunting cases yet, but these stories are gripping, and at the end of each haunting case you have to bring closure, you have to make a decision how to end it. Dontnod is good at writing stories and it shows in these cases.

Don't go in looking for a souls-clone, the combat isn't the hook of this game. It's the atmosphere, haunting cases and the relationship between Red and Antea.

As for gameplay.
The combat reminds me somewhat of The Witcher 2. More refined and with it's own quirks but with less enemy types. So not super engaging but still fun. It can be challenging in the harder difficulties. In the world you either do the quests (where the strength of the game lies) or search for materials for upgrading. The map has loot gated until you unlock some powers, so you have to backtrack to get more rare materials to upgrade faster. I feel that's only needed if you play on the harder difficulties in case you don't like that, although it's dependent on skill.

The thing i dislike the most this game is how the ending of ""hunting cases"" are handle, we got simply 3 options, kill the living person, banish(somewhat send to hell) the ghost or ascend it, is too binary and i think more options should have been made,  more than 20 cases like this gets tiresome 

if you like games were the story is very good and don't mind average gameplay, go for it

Some dettails:
I experienced it as an extremely outdated game design and gameplay in general. 

The combats are hard but not interesting, and the worst you can't skip them because in combat mode the character can't jump over the barricage to escape the location. 

It is preetty much linear gameplay and map, but somehow the locations are designed in a way that you will be confused and overwhelmed where to go and how to get back.

Investigations (quests) are borring, because they are not an invistigations but a primitive quest system where you have to run from one place to another and listen to lots of dialogues without any sense of control.

On a personal note, I was raised in the public school system of the States and I really appreciate that this game tells the truth about the genocide and colonization that the country was founded on. I appreciate that it tells this story as horror instead of fetishizing the 17th and 18th centuries in New England like Statesian curriculum does.  I appreciate that it shows witch hunting for the bigotry that it was, instead of an opportunity for a tourist attraction (looking at you, Salem).

In this game the ghost is just a toggle for powers youve seen like a magic shield, if you're in ghost form, your normal guy doesn't take damage.. in the ghost form you can see hidden items.. in the ghost form you can unlock pathways forward.. one is a giant leap mechanic to cross large gaps or get up high cliffs but it's only available on the specific spot you're meant to do it from.. one allows you to explode things which block your path.. 

There isn't really any morality to this, you make a choice at the start to either ascend\banish every ghost or to ""blame"" which just means kill every person possible.. Ascending and banishing hasn't been properly explained to me so far, i think even the main characters don't really know what the difference is other then the ghosts reaction to it, they just have theories but it's pretty clear that ascending is always the right option unless you just want to punish a ghost you see as bad.

There are no grey choices here unless you chose to blame everyone at the start, this is a selfish route that allows you to resurrect your ghost character.. but you won't have much issue choosing blame, in my opinion, since you know that's the only way to get the right ending, it will tell you that as you're choosing at the start and remind you every time you make a choice, you must blame everyone possible to do this. 

It might have been a harder choice if it wasn't telling you it has to be every single one.. and you were left trying to balance it out so that you try to get the correct number of souls needed to resurrect.. while not knowing if the next person you could 'blame' was going to be a worse person or not, so you have to really think about if that person is worth blaming and has faults they should die for or is he worth sparing an hoping someone worse comes along.. and if you let the wrong person go, maybe you would have to sacrifice someone far nicer to make up for it later.",1708675261,1708675261,False,4,1,0.437888026237487793,0,True,False,False

While I really enjoy the game and think that it has a great story so far, I have one pretty significant gripe with the map design. In several places you can get yourself trapped in front of a boss with no heals remaining and no way to return to a campfire to rest.  There are only two ways to resolve this: One is to roll back to a previous save from before you entered the area, but that only works if you basically fill your save slots with separate saves to make sure you have one from far back enough. The only other way is to lower the difficulty far enough that you can get through the fight without dying, which completely takes away from the overall soulslike experience of learning to win against difficult bosses.

There should *never* be a boss fight that you can't rest before, even if it means you have to back track a bunch.",1708658861,1708658861,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Biggest issue with the game is there are these void traveling activities that are battle gauntlets. That's great, but the exit puts you somewhere far away where you went into it at, forcing you to go to the nearest campsite to fast travel back. Sometimes it slaps you nowhere near a campish. Highly infuriating. It's anti-exploration in that regard.

Turning down the combat to story mode doesn't seem to help very much as some enemies or special features (some fights have requirements where you hit like a wet noodle unless you attack in a specific manner) are still major tanks just to go through them and continue with what you're doing.

It has a great story. hard choises. And i am getting a so if the baker woman did kill the inspector general who did do her wrong twice a day, i have to kill the baker woman because she killed the inspector general? Serious! Not killing the baker woman, I applaud her for killing the inspector general. So my second character looks doomed to ever get back to life.

The game is hard in combat. I went form difficulty normal to easy to story back to easy. Do not know if it is because i am at the wrong path but I am trying to keep the weapons/armor/rings upgraded. when I hung in a tree and had to defeat 1 skinwalker and I did this, I went to yes well done u R awesome.... then another skinwalker and two little friends came who defeated me evet time and I had to go to set the game to easy. 

When fighting a scourge the camera gets stuck and i am fighting whatever enemy is in front of me.  I cant use mouse to turn, its stuck. Switching to the back looks to work a little. I'm trying the track target if this will help. Sometimes a scourge pushes me in a corner and i cant get out. Luckly find out this is an option to choose from it when your enemy is off screen you go to the next  enemy. by turning this option off the whole problem described about combat is solved!

When you hit 3 times with a ... then you hit with a heavy .... at the fourth...  SERIOUS.... this is to hard for me to remember.  We are doing mortal kombat now?

I've played all of their games since Remember Me, but this time things are a little different. My favorite Don't Nod game is undoubtedly the Life is Strange series (especially the first game, Before the Storm and True Colors).

The story and concept of the game had intrigued me since its first introduction and I couldn't wait to play it. I started the game on the first day and everything was very enjoyable, but as the time went on and I wanted to complete all the content, the game started to become more and more mediocre. Very bad fighting mechanics, a terrible maze-like map, a very bad guidance system (really, where is the minimap?), a lot of completely unnecessary game mechanics, and a game structure that becomes a complete loop after the first few hours... In fact, many mechanics are completely thrash. Why would someone add things to their game that players hate the most? Why am I always crawling between two walls? Why do I just watch for seconds during every door opening, why do I examine one object and then can't examine another object immediately while listening to the characters tell me what I have already seen? I can list many more of these...

I don't want to elaborate on the subject too much, but even Vampyr was a much better game than Banishers. It seems that a situation similar to Remember Me, which caused the collapse of Don't Nod years ago, has occurred again. Unfortunately, Don't Nod aimed for a AAA-like game without considering the AA level production, budget and team, and the result is truly mediocre. However, the fact that this game is AA cannot be a defense. It should not be forgotten that the games we have seen recently, such as Alan Wake II and Assassin's Creed: Mirage, are also AA productions, but the difference is incredible... This game is mediocre in every aspect and unfortunately, unless you like the studio very much, I would never recommend you to play it (at least unless it drops to at least around $5 or $10). Please stop trying to make such games, it means the team you have is not suitable for such things.

The voice acting and dialogue and choices in this game are excellent and actually seem meaningful (you want to be the bad guy, characters are going to make you feel like it). The graphics are very well done and the devs do a good job of pulling off realism, though the teeth are unsettling for some reason to me. I miss karma systems in games so it's nice to see some semblance of one appearing here with the mechanic of 'relationships' with NPCs.

Unfortunately, the combat is extremely dull and the progression of combat abilities is slow. Most combat boils down to button mashing while trying to appear souls-like. Sure, you have a fixed number of heals, but they'll replenish after the encounter. Sure, you have camps (bonfires), but if you die, you'll just start at the start of the encounter. The combat is good looking and fluid enough, but just boring. The movement feels weirdly blocky and don't stray too far from the path when exploring (because you literally can't walk into the bushes). The environmental puzzles are less GoW/Prince of Persia and more 'did you fall the path?'. The game seems to have some frame issues too. I'm able to run LotF at 120 on my rig, but Banishers struggles to maintain 45 and will sometimes bottom out for no apparent reason.

All in all, I'd recommend this game, but not at full price.

Overall, this game is fantastic and there is extraordinarily little I can critique about it. First impressions were average but…. 42 hours in and I finished my first play-through! (Given the game came out only 9 days ago I think you can tell I got quite hooked) The completionist in me really wanted to 100% everything...I got close, but I could not wait to find out how the story ended. 

If you enjoy story-driven games with some exploration and side quests that affect the world you are in, then get this game! The gameplay is fun with a map that is not stupidly huge...but is intricate enough to be enjoyable to navigate and combat was always fun to mix up. The graphics/music and style are stunning (though I would have enjoyed just a few more ghost variants). Character-wise I love Red and Antea, their chemistry/ banter was great and it was quite easy to get into their shoes. Their personal development seemed pretty steady even with a few what seemed like “out of character” moments which often were explained away. I enjoyed the story overall (not going to spoil anything) but I can say some of the haunting mysteries certainly put you through the emotional ringer. 

Overall if I could give this game a rating it’s a solid 9/10 for me personally. (Just wish the story had been a little longer and characters like Seeker/Siridean had more involvement in the story).

Bug time (Will keep as spoiler free as I can) :

42 hours and I only had 1 bug, 1 crash (probably my fault I had a lot of programs open) and 1 possible bug/quirk I’m not sure if was intentional or if I missed something in the dialog. 

Main bug I had near the end of the game - Lamentation Haskell enjoyed endlessly walking into the outside wall of his house and teleports you and himself inside if you talk to him. (Though honestly given his…”interests” this could just be him meddling with forces beyond his control which I wouldn’t put past him)

Weird quirk I had (could be down to my choices) but by the end of the game every settlement was near enough empty and I could only find about 5 NPC’s in the entire map (i didn't really need them but the world felt a little too dead). In some cases shop icons were visible but no one was there, but again this could have been down to world development rather than the entire area becoming an unintentional literal…ghost…town…(pun not intended).",1708545376,1708545376,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In area of combat, ""open"" world and graphics, the game is not worth mentioning compared to other games of that kind in the market, so I'll stick to commenting the story and setting - what was the strong point of Vampyr too.

If Vampyr had a great setting and you could ""feel"" the dark, gothic surroundings, I can not immerse into this game and setting. A game aims for a story set in 17th century New England haunted by ghosts. What it actually delivers are very predictable (and very not scary) ghost/haunting cases, which require zero brains and just running from A to B to pick up clues - again, more than 1 clue is redundant, since one figures out the ""who did it/what is happening"" really fast.

Dialogues are fit for a College Campus in 2024, not 17th century New England. For instance, you ask a random female settler of a settlement you've just arrived in how the settlement is faring (remember, the place is haunted) and she will tell you straight off the bat she doesn't need a man, because she is a strong, independent woman. Exactly how a 17th century settler of a cursed village would respond. Other dialogues are (mostly) less ""into your face"" but it seems the ghost haunting the town of New Eden is 21st century feminism.

Protagonist is strangely ""happy"" and positive (despite him, just recently, going through some terrible stuff) and a companion who is plain boring (and annoying). Further ruins immersion. 

The chemistry between MC and his companion is non existent. One should feel the urge to save his beloved (companion), thus making decisions about life and death tough. But there is really nothing that would make you care about them. A game which aims at making moral decisions tough should make you care about the characters.

In effect  completely robbing a closeted person of the struggles, longings and dreams that they or women of the period may have wanted for by simply enfranchising them with societies current  ""I am what I am, accept me and gimme attention for it""

Stick to the way it was and represent the people that really had to live through the difficulties that such a time and perspective imposed on those they may have been a little different.  Give women and those subjected to slavery and indentured servitude were due by representing them and their struggles.

and decided to get the steam version aswell, for a second playthrough

asfar as the game goes:
it's a wonderfull action-adventure, which feels quite competent in it's design and mechanics. almost like the some quite bigger products, something like The Witcher, just obviously with a smaller dev-team and funding.

the game looks pretty good, it ain't no Cyberpunk, but it's certainly nice to look at. if you played Greedfall you might kinda get a feeling for the visual approach. it's early settler-time, very early at that. you see a lot of nature and it's often quite charming. well lit caves and dense forest-areas, with small cottages or settlements in between. branches moves, leaves sway in the wind, small waterfalls and muddy paths included. the weather, for lore reasons, is mostly ""bad"", but there are quite pleasant sunny places to be found aswell. the more outlandish ""ghost-stuff"" is never overdone. effects have a point and areason; from small ghost-particels, to the more flashy in-combat effects. 
it's pleasant to look at.

what realy stands out right from the beginning is the OST. it's hard to describe. it's almost like the (very good) soundtrack to a horror-thriller mixed with backround ambience. sometimes it's just one or two instruments getting the tention slowly to rise. might be one of the best OSTs i heard the last couple of years. nothing you might listen to outside of the game, but that it's down to it's nature, almost always beeing a perfect support of what is going on onscreen.
the same can be said for the ambience. the soundscape, especialy in the more foresty areas is almost perfect. 

combat is solid. not great but solid. you got classical blocks, parries, combos and dodge attacks, everything can be upgraded and modified via the skill-tree-system. it starts out kinda very basic, but doesn't take to long to offer you a lot of different ""moves"" for every scenario. there are definitly build-options here.
same goes for the gear-system. there's lots of weapons, armor and trinkets to be found; each one having lore-describtions, often a unique texture-set and offering an upgrade path. you got your basic stats/attributes on gear and passive effects. almost like an affix/suffix-system. it's no looter-shooter, but for a game like this it's quite extensive.
there's lots of extra loot to find or materials to gather, like plants or rare minerals to upgrade your gear, to sell or to use in ""rituals"". 
since enemies and also materials do respawn, you never have to fear of realy missing out. later on you can go back to get some mats, which allows to use all sorts of different gear-sets. there are some very rare materials often tied to challenges (like combat nests), but there's plenty of those aswell.

the main focus of the game is definitly it's story. and here the game nails it. it's the way conversations play out (english VO), it's the way the camera behaves in dialogue and cutscenes. it's often almost like watching some horror-thriller-investigion/crime show. i'm usualy not down for adventure games anymore, don't have the patience left, but i liked this one so much that i'm starting my 2nd PC run right after having finished the console version once. 
the brilliance also lies in how they approached the ""moral""-topic. you will find very few outright bad or good characters here. not even the protagonists are strict heroes or anti-heroes. morality is very situational, which makes it just feel more real. the main focus is how to deal with a fate that has befallen one of the main characters (which shouldn't be a major spoiler), and even here: depending on your choices you can be somewhat very selfish in your goals...yet still for an understanable reason. 
your ""heroes"" are banishers, somewhat like witchers, but you will learn quite fast that while both might slay ""monsters"", banisher are very much moraly grey.

of note for me personaly is the couple you follow. i usualy always find love in games very cringy. even in Planescape Torment these interactions are often pretty artificial and strange to me. asmuch as people love BG3, asmuch as i love Cyberpunk, even here i often feel the love-topic just weird. 
but i bought Red and Antea. i never found their conversations cringy, often quite endearing and rarely overstayin their welcome. this might be the first game-couple i actualy enjoyed.

I wish i had known before i bought it that the game is more of a shooter and melee attacks are much weaker... im not good at aiming even on easiest difficulity some bosses are to strong and i iwsh there was the possibility of defeating them without perfect aiming.

Update: damn near 50 hours later. I love this game. The simple one sentence description is God of War level design and combat meets The Witcher 2 world design, mission structure, and story telling. It is a stellar story about loss and it weaves an intricate web of characters with what is essentially a collection if interconnected ghost stories where each one tells a compelling moral tale that peels away at the onion of the main story.

My only criticism is that fast travel becomes damn near essential as the back half of the game trades perfectly paced exploration with map wide fetch quests that literally send you back and forth (sometimes several times over). The game is at it's best when either (a) you are questing and traversing a never before seen section of the map or (b) when you are solving ghost stories that keep you in or around one location. When it eventually veers to (c) running all over the damn map to do one small objective at a time it really hurts the otherwise perfect pacing.

Small spoiler: I think the void would have been better utilized as an immersive fast travel akin to the god of war world tree instead of a gameplay experience that shoots you out at random places on the map.",1707798819,1708396110,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

 - Story is overall engaging, but there are some silly moments in dialogues, like when you are clearly looking at and talking to a ghost that nobody else can see or hear in the middle of conversations. 
- Mouth animations during dialogues could use some work.
- It is a bit slow to start, heavy on the setup, but gets rolling after the first boss.
- The world is beautifully designed and a pleasure to explore. I never felt like checking out hidden or out of the way locations wasted my time, there was always a reason for it to exist. 
- Sometimes the music seems to get wild like a boss fight for no reason when you are talking to random villagers.
- Combat is not as smooth as you may be expecting, but it is fresh and interesting, introducing new mechanics often, at least as far as I am in the game.
- The lore is great, drip fed through letters and journals you find littered throughout the world.
- Steamdeck: I tried running it with the settings from SteamdeckHQ, but I didn't find it playable. Maybe I'm just too picky.

Personally I recommend reading (the above reference) it all. 

Well, this game is quite cool. So. As the game progresses, it's full of scriptural references. I see, a few getting bored already as I speak of this. * yawn

The correct point of reference is that in the Bible there is a direct description to summoning of Spirits, with a proper response, no simple or 'stupid' WOOO effect. The other part of the spirit world that is inescapable is that of ''THE DEMONIC'', or ''EXORCISM'', which the game references, with historical points throughout.

A few notable things, the protagonists of this game is ""Red Mac Raith'', & 'Antea Duarte'. 
-lovers, really close friends, THAT'S THE IDEA,
-in the beginning of the game, they're busy with their ''JOB'' of Banishing, apparently a 'DEMON' or 'GHOST' 
that presented them a challenge,
-what we're visually looking at is that THIS FOE, kills, physical ''Antea'', & beats up ''Red'',
-I have a theory on one of the path's that the game offers you to take, where, ''RED'' may choose to 'bring Antea, back to reality', INSTEAD OF the opposite choice of allowing her Spirit to 'Ascend' OR go away, leaving Antea to die.
-WHAT IS MY THEORY (is that; reality check-SHE'S IN A COMA), if you decide the path to 'bring Antea, back to life'.

[h3]NOVEL REALLY[/h3]
So, during combat, you may switch between Red & Antea interchangeably.
Though at the beginning of this activity, without having levelled up much, I noticed Antea's ''COMBAT'', is initially,
a lot of ''FIST-FIGHTING'', she can actually beat another Ghost/Specter up, & totally delete/kill it.

It made me think further, of her battle style-FIST FIGHTING, one of the most primitive styles of fighting, she's without a
weapon, just fists, & she does that to everything.
It's Red, that has all sorts of, ''TRICKS'', & items up his sleeve.

Finally - you ask; ''SO-WHAT'', she uses her fists. Initially, I found her fighting boring, then, I found it effective.
Then I understood, being one of the most intuitive forms of fighting, & instinctual, this was a form of combat,
AGAINST BULLYING.

Antea is a girl. Using her fists. :)

I'm hiding a massive smile. This game has ''SOUL''; I'm encouraging you.
When possible. Give it a try.
The story is engaging & captivates you from the beginning.
I'm a believer in God; A christian, I understand at various times when speaking of religious themes,
a few people, FADE OUT, on THAT subject.

I tried here to give you a balanced view of what this game is really presenting to you.
I think it's exciting.
I think it's worth applying yourself to.
It's a subject that, in many aspects many people find VAGUE & difficult to understand the reality therof.

I wish to explain merely what is happening here. 
THE THEMES PRESENTED HERE ARE REAL, & stunningly translated to game format.

ABOUT THE GAME.

-it's linear, in such that it explores the destiny & life path of our 'Banishers', OTHERWISE, there's FAST TRAVEL & 
all mapped out,
-lot's to discover,
-crafting, weaponry,
-THE game isn't boring,
-the game is exciting, 
-the game is interesting

I greatly recommend to play it.

Interesting and enjoyable story. Early on you have to make a difficult decision without knowing the full ramifications of it, and the consequences haunt you throughout the gameplay as they should, without either punishing you too much for it or making it inconsequential. The villains you deal with feel like real people, rather than caricatures of evil. They've had hard lives, they're hurt and broken, and while they hurt other people, it's generally out of fear and ignorance and all of the other motivations that have always driven people to depraved and vile behavior. The way you go about investigating the source of hauntings doesn't break any new ground, but it makes the cases interesting and it's satisfying to complete a case.

The voice acting is good. The English version has enough awkward phrasing and grammatical errors that I assume it was written in some other language and translated by a non-native speaker, but it's not too distracting. It's mostly written in modern English, but they occasionally throw in some more archaic speech and that feels very awkward, especially when they misuse it. Writers: pick a linguistic setting and stick with it; it doesn't have to fit the story setting, but be consistent.

There's a large world, but it's not open; you're limited to a few paths through the world and your character can't even jump. The map design is a little frustrating at times, with limitations like branches lying on the ground that you have to walk 10 feet to get around because your character can't step over anything larger than a pebble. That's annoying when you're walking around, but it's infuriating when it gets you killed in combat. The environment looks good and is enjoyable to explore, other than the frustrations about having to walk a mile to get to a location twenty feet away even though there's an obviously climbable direct path between them.

Unfortunately, all of the good is wrapped up in a package with typical console action combat mechanics. You essentially need to figure out and then memorize the attacks and required dodges to defeat various enemies. The game does a fairly lousy job helping you figure it out. There's not enough variety in the enemies you fight. You can't control the direction your character attacks; you always attack camera-forward, and the camera rotates way too slowly for combat. If you dodge past someone attacking you, you can't turn around to attack them before they've recovered and hit you. The solution they provide for this is to lock your attacks to a single enemy, which makes the camera track them as you dodge. This helps a lot, but the locking system is finicky and some enemy types constantly break lock by warping to other locations.

At times you'll get mobbed by a half dozen different enemies at once, and (particularly in the void) when long, unblockable attack sequences overlap sometimes you have to do nothing but dodge for a minute or more until there's some sort of opening to attack. The game allows you to turn the difficulty of the game down to the point that it's not a challenge, but then you have to spend a lot of time in very boring combat. Either way, it's tedious, incredibly repetitive, and--at least for me--more of a job than a game.

That's a shame, because the one great aspect of the combat system--rapid switching and cooperative fighting between your living and ghost characters--would really shine if you could use it more creatively. You can respec your skills at any time, allowing you to experment with a variety of ways the two charcters can work together. There are automatic two-character combos, manually triggered two-character combos, abilities that allow one character to charge up the attacks of the other for later use, etc. Many of the skills improve one aspect of your combat abilities while worsening another. I really like how parts of this were designed.

With all of those options, it should be a lot of fun, but unfortunately 95% of what you end up doing is just dodge, dodge, fast attack, dodge, dodge, dodge, slow attack, repeat... over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. Adding a ""switch character"" here in there in the repeated action sequence isn't enough to make that kind of combat fun. Now and then you have to fight bosses, which work exactly the same except that you have to endure a good 5-10 minutes of it without making more than a few mistakes. Those mistakes are easy, because some actions--particularly healing, dodging, and switching characters--can be difficult to trigger at the right time without either having them ignored or interrupted or interrupting other combat actions, making the combat feel a little clunky.

That said, I know that this sort of combat system is incredibly popular with other gamers. You know whether or not you like it. I was intrigued enough by the story to give it a shot, and I'm slogging through the combat to get to the parts I like, although I've quit to go play something else quite a few times because I don't want to face the same boring fight yet again.",1708366297,1708366297,True,0,1,0.499439448118209839,0,True,False,False

Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden feels pretty shallow in most of the components. 
Tech part:
Visuals and graphics looks OK, but generic; I didn't experience any major problems with framerate and stutters, but some framedrops occure from time to time; facial animation is not really impressive and up-to-date but I can't say it's really that bad - it doesn't ruin the game, it's just OK. The combat mechanics are pretty dull and also generic - light attack, charge heavy, dodge, block, rinse&repeat. The combat isn't like ""snappy"", there is no weight in your hits, you can't really feel the hits that you land on the enemies or hits they land on you. Animations here are also pretty generic, and, one major flaw - the developer didn't add a button to WALK for keyboard users. It exists in the engine, and you can active it. probably, with Y/Z buttons, but you can't remap it. Maybe they added this already, but at the moment I played the game it wasn't there, and it ruined my immersion and experience a lot, because there is no style in running like an ape. 
Story part:
One part that ruined my experience the most was the certain part of the story. It really decided the refund. The game starts really grim and intriguing, until we discover who our enemy really is. The detective part is great, it's interesting, it's fun, even in the prologue, but it's impressive how easy ONE dumb plot move destroyes it all. You really feel like a MASTER of your job, almost like witcher, investigating the curse, but ...
SPOILERS AHEAD (It's prologue of the game, and you know it from trailers, but, just in case).



the way two main characters, MASTER-BANISHERS, completely ignore their experience and knowledge about tricky nature of ghosts when working with Nightmare (who is known to be very dangerous = requires extra caution) and just go full-suicide into it's lair - it's lame way to start the game. I don't even want to continue after that. It's lazy, lame and full of cliche. It' dirty, you can't do us that way - they are professionals, and the plot builds up around it, and when things like THAT happen, personally I can't believe in their whole story after those lame tricks. Maybe it gets better, and I am sure it does, but I got my punch I don't want to go on from this point.

DON'TNOD do some really interersting stuff with the story, but the gameplay is always lacking. A good example - Vampyr was horrible on the gameplay and tech sides, but very interesting as a concept and idea, and pretty decent in terms of story. Maybe this game is the same, but I don't want to check it out. I've fallen for it once with Vampyr, but this time I am aware of how this developer works, and suffering through the gameplay-loop this game provides for some chunks of story and dialog is not my cup.

My verdict: It would be a great game to buy on sale, a great game for those value the story over everything, not so good for just a casual player.",1708348275,1708348275,False,7,0,0.45711904764175415,0,True,False,False

My impression: Murder mystery detective game with combat that doesn't deserve the name.

1. Everything about this game feels floaty, especially the movement. 
2. Combat seems to be shoehorned in (smash R1 and rejoice).
3. Lip sync is off, which is weird, since dialogue seems to be such a huge focus of the game.

Review:
Banishers was pretty much made with me in mind, oddly. Likeable protagonists a supportive, friendship-rich romance? Check. Ghosts and spookiness? Check. Investigation and mystery? Check. Incredibly solid writing and voice acting? Check. Good engine and graphics without anything remotely approaching high-end tech requirements? Check. Love to see it.
As I played more, it seemed to me that one of the core themes in Banishers is this: 
""How selfish is love, and if you go too far to preserve it, are you still the same people who fell in love in the first place?"" I'm here for it. It's not the sort of question that I've seen explored in games a lot, and I think it's a question that has a TON of room for good exploration. Add to that the fact that some of the choices made are BRUTAL (but never in a way that I found too cheap-shot-y), and it really gets on thinking about just how much love it worth, especially when set against trauma, guilt, and horror.
Game-play wise, it's fun and solid, but not in any particularly ground-breaking ways. It's smooth and gets the job done, and there's a good amount of room for customization of builds in both equipment and power sets. But, at the end of the day, I would guess that people are going to be talking about the story of Banishers a LOT more than they will about game play.",1708321754,1708321754,True,2,0,0.523250222206115723,0,True,False,False

Good:
• The story is great, the hook is well done and incentivises you to discover more of this pretty, albeit haunted world.
• The combat is ok I guess, although I have only now unlocked a range weapon so maybe this aspect will improve as the game progresses (I'm counting on it)
• It looks good
• Voice acting is very good, especially the main duo.
• The supernatural detective aspect has been very well woven into the story and it makes sense for one of the heroes to have 'detective vision'.

Bad:
• The lip-syncing is atrocious.
• The dynamic of the main duo feels weird. On one hand, it's clearly a master-student relation, on the other they're clearly in love. This doesn't sit right with me, but it doesn't bother me greatly either.
• The dual sense support is shite. The deadzones of analog sticks are way too high, making it hard to control your movement speed.

I must admit that I've been waiting for this title since its announcement. I had no worries about the delivered quality; I knew the studio would rise to the occasion, giving us, players, a truly unique experience full of emotional and far-reaching consequences of our decisions.

Graphically, the game looks fantastic (Ultra). The music resonates very well with the narrative being told. As for the dialogue, I can't comment yet - I haven't experienced enough of it to form an opinion. I like the mechanics of solving haunting cases - it reminds me of a pared-down version of Sherlock. The only negative thing I could point out is the localization in Polish (it looks like it's generated by AI and is simply incorrect).

What I can say about it so far?

The game picks up the pace rather slowly. It's a story driven game and is more about talking to the people and listening to what they have to say. The investigation part is not specifically mention worth, you get guided a lot to the next clue one by one. You don't have to put any effort in solving a riddle or something like that. You enter an area of investigation and then look around, but mostly the quest markers guide you, to where you find the next clue. That's a little disappointing so far, but since those were only the first cases and they still seem to be a part of the tutorial, I hope they will become more of a challenge.

The fighting is simple, but fun. You can dodge, parry and riposte, but it's not like a souls game. You can heal by flasks mid fight and it's mostly about avoiding damage and choosing the right kind of attack at the right timing, but it's pretty forgiving. When there are enough enemies around you, you get indications when an attack is about to hit. If you are in the middle of a combo, it's hard to deal with an attack. So again, it's all about timing and best not to let the enemies circle you.

The levels are rather narrow but you can explore a little bit and gather ressources. It's not an open world game so far and I'm glad about that. But there is a quick travel system and a little bit of metroidvanian, since some paths will open up later, when you gained some new abilties. There is a skill tree that opens up when you keep playing and by levelling up you can decide where to spend your skill points. Currently it's mostly about improving your combat abilties.

The resources you gather are for rituals and improving your gear. No crafting involved yet, but that might also be coming into play.

What the game really excels in is the story and atmosphere. It's dark and mysterious, the story is intruiging. I'm really curious how the story will play out and what impact my choices will have. But there are choices you have to make that seem very impactful forced upon you very early in the game. I'm wondering if I can go against my choices later or not. Even if the choices do result in different stories, I probably won't see this as a game that I will be replaying.

So should you buy the game? If you're in for a story driven game in a dark setting full of despair and some emotional plot points, mixed with a little bit of fighting, then the game is for you.",1708202877,1708202877,True,6,0,0.539628982543945313,0,True,False,False

I have just completed ""Chapter 1"", the story is very interesting and keeps you intrigued to know more details of what's happening, plus it's - to my experience- new kind of story that are not typical but rather something more genuine makes you feel like reading a historical fairy-tale fiction book, written in the dark ages just like Harry Potter, that at the same time, doesn't feel like any story you have read or watched before.

 [h3][---Gameplay---] [/h3]
[B]8/10 [/b] [I](early impression)[/i]
Well-- too early to judge for me to be honest, yet as I'm only in chapter 1, it's not bad, it's okay and seems to be fair addition to enjoying a good storyline. You can, melee light attack, heavy melee attack, block, parry, dash, that is it-- so far, but apparently there are many -ranged/magical- ways of fighting yet to come.
Update:
-Exploration is fair and there are few places where you can wonder to find some items around the world.
-Fighting seems to be good and can get better as you progress, the ""first boss"" fight is really amazing - no spoilers here - but it did make me feel like I'm in the path of a very exciting game play - that can make me enjoy the journey as I enjoy games like GoW, HZD, and TLOU.


 [h3][---Settings---] [/h3]
--Gameplay:
-FOV option would be great, I feel the default FOV is too close to character
-I wish we can change the size of the compass bar, and/or make it dynamic with a push of a button to appear.
--Photo Mode:
- There's a glitch in when entering photomode, you can get wrong keybindings, exiting and re-entering would fix that.
- Hiding character in photo mode does not hide ghost character
- I wish the save settings can save all settings including filter settings
--Performance:
-I'm not so happy with Frames, I have mine set to 120 but it fluctuate around 50-70, it gets to 118-120 FPS when I'm opening text to read (see my uploaded captures of the game)

Hope this brief review is of good help and gives you some understanding of what to expect!

The storyline is engaging and each of the characters has a unique personality. There seem to be some different paths you can take. The voice acting, music, and other sounds are very good.

I was surprised at how good the controls are. You can run pretty fast; it never feels like a slog. Combat is pretty fun, like a beat 'em up with soulslike elements. 

The level design is cool so far. It's almost like a metroidvania where you see things that you need to come back to after gaining new abilities. Lots of hidden items and points of interest if you like exploring. Lots of lore and extra conversation options if you are into that. Good map and quest system. Fast travel is nice. The autosave system works wonderfully. There is no real worry about losing progress. You can manually save almost anywhere, as well.

It runs great for me without taxing my mid-tier gaming laptop from a couple years ago. I've had one crash. There were a couple times where my character's body got stuck to a person or object. Pressing the dodge button got me unstuck each time, so no big deal.

The only downsides are graphics are a bit weak and enemies aren't super varied. Overall, though, this is one of the most fun games I've played in a long time.

The emotional depth to the characters gives me flashbacks to games like TLOU and Firewatch. The combat starts off feeling very simple, but quickly becomes fairly complex and tactical, which has made combat a blast. Layer that in with the fact that combat isn't wildly blasted in your face and is instead peppered into exploration in a tasteful and exciting way makes for a situation where combat is exciting every time it comes up.

Combat isn't... 'bad,' but it's not great. It's pretty 'meh,' to be perfectly honest. There is so much going for this game in terms of narrative and lore that it feels off for the combat to feel so vanilla. Again, it's not bad combat, just don't expect to get all that engrossed into it. 

If you want a fantastic story, great writing, and performances, 'Banishers' delivers. If combat mechanics are a must then you may be disappointed. Try the game for yourself. Steam is really good about returns with in two hours of game-play. Set you an hour and forty-five timer on your phone and dive in. It won't take long to determine if this game is for you or not.

If you're in it for the atmosphere and theme, then yes. You take on the role of an exorcist who banishes evil spirits and investigates hauntings. Once you learn why someone is haunted, you get to choose how to resolve the haunting. Banish the ghost to oblivion, use the knowledge you learned to help it cross over, or outright kill the person the ghost is fixated on because they're usually some kind of a dick who's being haunted for a good reason.

If you're looking for solid gameplay, this doesn't really provide. The combat isn't anything special and most enemies are either a minor speed bump or a brick wall of hit points that take forever to kill. The gear progression is slow and requires you to reset areas and enemies if you want to grind it out faster. It ends up being a lot of running in circles.

I have a 4070 and I maxed out everything on 4k and was getting 60fps consistently, which is good right? It's optimized at least right? However, it looks like a game from 2010-2014. All be it a highly polished game from 2010-2014. The lighting dynamics indoors are so bad. Everything is either bright orange or too dark. The faces are super robotic, the skin textures didn't have anywhere near the fidelity I see reviews & trailers, the lip syncing is bad, they have no facial expressions, the combat is basic and repetitive, and there's so much pop-in/screen tearing/glitches. I kept having to revert to previous saves because the world would disappear, and I'd plummet to my death. 

The combat and traversal are so mind-numbing. The documents you can investigate are far too numerous and pointless. There will be 25 things to investigate in a room and 17 of them will be just two lines with the title and author of a book, or a piece of sheet music. There are multiple points of the game where you do a scripted conversation/cut scene, then it goes back to gameplay and you walk like 3 feet to a door and another conversation/cutscene starts. It could have all just been one cutscene. 

The UI is so badly designed. The tutorial hints will pop up on the side, but the game doesn't pause & they don't stay on screen long enough to read. I missed multiple dialougue interactions between Red and Antea while trying to read a tutorial hint. Ended up missing out on the hint & the conversation because of it.

Nothing is objectively good or bad, so-called ""masterpieces"" are nothing more than common consensus, love is just a chemical reaction, God is dead. Right? *Right?*

Wrong, and you're a fool for ever suggesting otherwise. *I* decide what art is, *I* am the arbiter of quality, and like a child expectantly awaits the will of the father, *you* are the audience to my judgment. 

Overall, 13 hours in, I give Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden a 8.5/10. I've seen a lot of people hedging and giving very safe, lukewarm assessments: 7/10s, 6.5/10s, ""great writing but bad combat"", etc.

The reality is, despite its imperfections, it is simply *incorrect* to place this game in the same tier as other 7/10s. What is on offer here, what the game does well, what it brings to the table far and away exceeds its ""slightly better than mediocre"" brethren. I want to set the record straight. The world-building, the narrative, the pacing, the prose, the voice performances--all of the *non-gameplay-specific elements* are, unbelievably, best-in-class. We're not talking Greedfall or Elex (no shade on either of these--i love eurojank) or Dying Light (still not throwing shade, just giving examples of 7/10s). We're talking The Witcher 3, God of War, A Plague Tale (Innocence or Requiem). No exaggeration. The story that is being told here and the panache and proficiency and heart with which it is told is The Real Deal^tm. 

Okay, so what about the gameplay? What about the mediocre combat? Sure, it has good talky-talky word bits, but how are we expected to care about things like ""plot"" and ""characters"" without that sweet vidya dopamine? Good questions. Combat IS a 7/10. It's good. It's serviceable. It's better than Nu-Assassin's Creed, it's worse than Sekiro and God of War. That's really all you have to know. It's good. It has decent animations, decent hitboxes, and overall doesn't commit any major sins. You'll be fine. 

But maybe you can see how the maths aren't mathing? The game executes SO many things at SUCH a high-level, and then its greatest flaw is that its combat isn't as good as some of the most genre-defining, most universally GOATed titles, and yet somehow that is enough to bring the sum of its parts down to a 7/10? That makes no sense. 

If Plague Tale was an 8/10, then this was an 8/10. If Plague Tale was an 8.5/10, then this was an 8.5/10. This is absolutely on the same level as that--whatever that level was.",1708025475,1708096971,True,4,0,0.515723288059234619,0,True,False,False

I like this trend of offering choices instead of just allowing you to get every single skill in the skill tree, in Banishers you have to choose one upgrade over the other in a path.

I know we are all tired of color coded loot and whatnot, but Banishers makes it fun and rewarding again... well, just like any GOOD action RPG not trying to be a live service nightmare. You can upgrade your equipment with various items you scavenge, and I like how there is a lore reason for why you do it: Because Banishers are also alchemists, survivalists, wanderers, and herbalists who use plants in rituals or fur/leather/metal/thread to reinforce equipment.

The combat is standard, but it's challenging and starts growing on you, there is a real sense of weight to the sword swings and the game steadily introduces new abilities for you to use in combat or while exploring. Combat starts getting more fresh and fun.

The world is semi-open, with just enough branching paths to explore and find secrets.

Then, after all of that awesomeness, the game introduces the central story-driven choice mechanics. You are going to make some DIFFICULT choices, and it's up to you to decide whether or not it's right or wrong.

In summary, Banishers is a game that gets better the more you play it, just be patient with the slow start and you'll love it IF you loved God of War.",1708080348,1708080386,True,1,0,0.501369893550872803,0,True,False,False

Combat is good to great. At first it seems shallow, but as you unlock more and more of the game it gets much better. Pretty good build customization and being able to swap characters seamlessly in battle to weave attacks and spells is actually quite a nice gimmick. Implemented well. Combat overall is more similar to God of War than any souls like. 

Story is, of course, great. And that's coming from someone who doesn't even like period settings. This game could make a great tv show a la The Last of Us

This is my early impressions of the game.  I came into this game with high expectations based upon what I had seen and heard regarding the game.
I have to say my expectations thus far have been exceeded in every way.
The main protagonists are so likable and the voice acting is top notch.  The game is absolutely gorgeous and a major step forward from the developers last game Vampyr, which I also loved.
The game has very unique combat and abilities, in which you can change between the characters in the middle of combat, and it works so well.  I love the choices and consequences type story games which this game very much is.
I find myself not wanting to stop playing because I really want to see what comes next in the story.  The story is so engaging that I have been invested right from the start.  There are some extremely tough choices even early in game and I cannot wait to see what happens in this story.
I will also replay to see other endings once I finish this first play through.
This game runs smooth as butter and that in itself is so rare in new games.  I am actually very pleasantly surprised to have graphics maxed out and have it run so good.
This absolutely is worth every penny paid and everyone should experience this gem.
Right now this game is best game I played in long time.
I will update once I finish the game but wanted to get this early impression out because I really feel this game is worth supporting the developer.
Update:
I am about 20 hours in the game at this point and wow the game is very huge.  The map opens up and there are unique areas and places to go and explore.  There are Elite enemies as well as repeatable bosses I have found so far.  The story also progresses as you discover new areas to explore.
I am still very engaged in the story and am having so much fun.  The combat also evolves as you gain more talents that not only open new areas but also can be used in combat for variation.
I absolutely recommend this game to anyone who loves action RPGs with choices  that are very difficult to make and I feel will ultimately have repercussions by the end of the game.
There are no microtransactions.   This is a complete game that is very engaging and I really feel that these developers should be supported for creating a great game and not trying to add in things to make extra money.  These rare developers should always be supported because if we do not support them, then we are only stuck with what we have been getting from the AAA gaming big developers lately which many are not worth supporting.
I will sum up this review once the game is finished but after 20 hrs I highly recommend this game.  10/10 for me so far.

I attempted to adjust the game's difficulty level after starting, only to be thwarted by a message that declared, ""You can't change difficulty while saving is prohibited."" This led to a frustrating cycle of trying to revert to an earlier save point, only to find each attempt blocked. It was a disappointing encounter, to say the least.

The game's soundtrack occasionally suffers from awkward silences as it loops, breaking the immersion and, at times, leads to an unintentionally amusing moment. It's a detail that feels overlooked and amateurish.

The character designs also leave much to be desired, lacking depth and failing to captivate. Their facial animations and motion capture are reminiscent of The Witcher 3, a game nearly a decade old, raising questions about their skill and progress with technology.

These are just a few of my initial criticisms. I have more but these stood out initially. My recommendation is to hold out on this one. It's not a bad game but that doesn't mean it's good; it merely exists.

You get wind of it the first minute you play the game with the mayor confusing the men as being the one in charge. Anyone could have made the same mistake since Red was the one that came in barging in the Inn like a Boss. Red and Duarte reacted with such insecurity. Any worse and they would've called him a bigot. Another instance that was obvious to spot was when Red was trapped on the robe by the leg and the huntress was trying to shoot the robe to free him. But, he was moving too much because he was nervous. She screamed at him and he simply said what would you have done if a lassie was trying to shoot your leg or something of the sort. She left him there and Duarte made fun of him too. Also the fact that they never say they are married, and there was another farmer girl saying shes never going to get married and spewing anti marriage propaganda. Which is another agenda being pushed by the feminist for a while now and funny because that has never worked in their favor.

This game is the most passive/aggressive woke game I have ever played. It's there and if you don't see it it's because you don't want to see it.

This game beautifully succeeds in challenging your moral compass on three different levels:

2) Your decision to either kill the human or ascend/banish the ghost
3) Your view of justice

Throughout the game, I sensed a great deal of discomfort to the choices I made as I knew each one would affect whether I could keep my oath. The world and characters were also consistent with their development and responses to my decisions.

Highly recommend picking this up, especially if you're a fan of Horizon, God of War, Plague Tale, etc. If you're looking for constant action, this probably isn't it. Ignore the negative reviews talking about ""wokeness"", they just don't like that Antea isn't a helpless damsel and is her own character. 

Overall I had high hopes for this game from when it was announced. I'm glad to say Don't Nod absolutely delivered on my hopes. I love story-rich games and Banishers really shines in its storytelling. The main story is great and really interesting. Ghost stories in colonial New England is a setting we haven't really had and it lends itself really well to the story the devs want to tell. Each individual haunting you investigate has it's own great writing you discover by finding clues to piece together to find out what is causing the haunting before deciding how to bring closure to the haunted/ghost. It's pretty simple ""find object, press A to investigate"" but the writing really makes up for it once you start finding clues. I appreciate that by the end of each haunting, the decision on how to bring closure (banish a violent/cruel ghost, give peace to a ghost that's been trapped in the mortal realm, or blame the living and sacrifice them) actually has nuance and I can absolutely see that each choice has a legitimate argument The art style, environments, and writing just perfectly blend to create an atmosphere where you're really living in this haunted colony. Few games have really drawn me into the setting the way Banishers has. 

Combat feels similar to God of War/Ragnarok while missing a little bit of the fluidity and polish. I do enjoy the mechanic of switching between Red and Antea to tackle different encounters. Certain enemies take more damage from Red vs. Antea so you're switching on the fly and the buildcrafting can synergize with that. Overall not bad, but could use some work to string the animation a bit smoother. There's a bit of buildcrafting/upgrades to try and tweak the combat to fit your preferred style. I'm enjoying it in the early-ish game so I imagine it will only get better as I level up.",1707995480,1707995753,True,2,0,0.514925360679626465,0,True,False,False

First and foremost, the writing is excellent on all fronts. The plot, the characters, dialogue, the worldbuilding, it's all top tier. The investigations in particular stand out as the sort of nuanced, high quality self-contained stories that I haven't really seen much of since the best side bits of Cyberpunk and PL. But everything's superb. Love the setting and the relatively subtle blending of Banishers with real world history.

Combat's great. I've been playing on Very Hard, and while it lacks the depth and complexity of something like God of War, it's a notch more engaging than the modern superhero stuff that gives you lots of tools and opportunities to look cool but doesn't really demand much beyond dodging and countering. It doesn't have a nine-figure budget's worth of animations, but I prefer the tempo of combat to GoW and the demands of the character-switching over superhero showiness.

A+ in the audio department. While the lipsync isn't AAAA, the voice acting is uniformly excellent, and the game doesn't fall into the trap of overstuffing itself with every villager you walk by whispering loudly about your Latest Greatest Deeds. The soundtrack is fantastic, and fantastically moody. The music that cues in during investigative choices is outright cathartic at times. More than anything else in the game, I think the soundscape has me imagining what this would be like as a TV show or movie.

And now, having given the game it's just due, I'll talk about the cheap, low-hanging fruit of comparison.

You, Kratos, get in a boat. It takes six seconds of animation. You paddle the appropriately cumbersome boat for 10 seconds before you see something dangling over the water. You stop, mash the controls a bit, trying to remember if there's a way for you to do something to knock the thing down. There isn't. You spend 15 seconds turning the boat around and getting back to shore, go through another on/off boat animation, then run around in circles for 40 seconds trying to find an angle on the dangler. There isn't one, so you get back on the boat. Animation again. Paddle out again. Stop and think. Maybe you missed something back on shore. Maybe you go back to shore and do it all over again. Maybe you paddle forward and repeat the process on the other side of the dangler. Maybe you figure it out and get some little widget that ultimately isn't that important. Maybe you don't and you add it to the ever-growing mental list of things that you might maybe possibly have to come back to at an uncertain time in the future. But in the meantime, you'll be thinking, ""Am I a dumbo for not figuring that out?""

This sort of stuff is fine in reasonable doses. But when you get stopped every 30 seconds by a dangling treasure, or a set of glowing nodes that you have to try to line up for an axe shot only to figure out that you can't line it up, or a one-way door that takes 3 tries of a crank turning animation and axe throw, it becomes crushingly pace-stuttering. Sometimes a one-way door is totally fine just being a one-way door.

Banishers forgoes all this for clean, smart level design and genuinely difficult narrative choices. 

I don't really love bringing that sort of direct comparison up because it can feel like some weird non sequitor to air some super weird terminally online grudge, but the comparison here is direct enough to warrant it as useful for potential buyers. And God of War's still a great game that's seen plenty of love and tons of success.

But Banishers, man.

The Main Characters are solid, with most side characters getting acceptable levels of background and development. Enemy designs do feel a tad lackluster after awhile, the environments can be a bit bland.

I think they made good use of having two playable characters, but I wish there were more attacks and abilities to be used. The open world aspect is fine in that you do have plenty to do, it is VERY much like the more recent GOW titles, from its gameplay to its map design with its dialogue leaning more towards The Witcher. Boss designs are okay, the fights themselves can be anywhere from very one note, to somewhat decent, same with the voice acting, some are done really well while others a merely acceptable.

After years, I can say that I have found a double-A game that manages to assert itself and demonstrate that you can also buy non-blockbuster games.

I have not played for long but what I have seen has been disappointing enough to try and refund it although I suspect Steam will say 'no'.

The good:

Voice acting.
Main protagonists.
The developing story.

The bad:
Graphics. Very poor for 2024. The cloaks don't move but hang rigidly. The space around things is badly done i.e. I run close to somebody but am held back by an invisible bubble.
The fighting. Some people might like it but it's just 'meh'. Really quite bland.
The wokeness. Yes it's everywhere, even in a game that gives a disclaimer at the start which warns people that 'people back then were not as 'enlightened' as now. I have seen glimpses in just an hour of real play time.
Boring. The greatest of sins in a game. It is, I've played for an hour and I'm already bored.

It is therefore, to me, a weak example of the genre with glimmers of joy in the things done well, covered over in filth by the things done badly.

Open World makes it busy work, chores like feeling in between the little action this game has.

Can't even progress for 10 mins before having lengthy talk or walls of text. I support Don't Nod, I liked Remember Me, and Life is Strange. Wish they stuck to their own style and not open world cliche.

The writing is super solid so far, the world and setting are cool and interesting, and, most importantly they don't punish you for not being a psychopath like they did in that game. The moral conundrum of deciding whether or not to kill is sooo much more compelling as it is actually  relevant to the game's story, and it also helps that you aren't forced into making the ""bad"" choices by the game's difficulty. 

A few cons worth noting though: the map is super hard to navigate; as hard as or harder than in Vampyr and it is downright infuriating sometimes. The camera is as much of an enemy in combat as any ghost. When you lock on it only tracks in one dimension, so if may pan towards the enemy, but still may point directly at the ground or sky unless you correct it manually. It is also just hard to control even outside of combat, at least on a controller. Another small thing is that the lip sync is really bad on the dialogue, but that's a minor complaint.

I don't normally buy games on day one, but Vampyr had me intrigued enough that I wanted to give this one a go, and I definitely don't regret it so far.

Edit: Additional note: it's sad that this is worth noting, but the game is pretty stable at launch. It crashed once when I first started and has had no issues since, which is what I had read in another review.",1707885919,1707886191,True,1,0,0.521968364715576172,0,True,False,False

Edit: 

Having spent three hours playing the game, I believe I can provide a more detailed review.

Firstly, the game runs exceptionally well and is highly efficient. There's no stuttering, and the shader compilation is swiftly completed upon initial start-up. The game performs admirably overall. Moreover, it already supports DLSS, FSR, and even DLSS3 with Framegeneration.

I'm playing the game on my system with 4K DLAA, and the graphics are impressive. My 4080 Super easily delivers more than 60 fps, which is where I've capped the frame rate.

Currently, there's no option to remove the film grain and chromatic aberration. Although these effects don't bother me as much in this game as they do in others, I would still prefer an option in the settings to disable these two effects.

In terms of visuals, the game didn't impress me in the first hour. You start in the dark at night, and I initially found it underwhelming, even questioning if it was an UE4 game. However, as you play longer and venture into brighter areas, the game's visuals improve significantly. The VFX is also nicely done.

Overall, I would rate the visuals a 7/10. The game could certainly benefit from some Lumen and Nanite. I was disappointed that these features weren't included in the game, and I hope they will be added later with a patch.",1707783424,1707854782,True,3,0,0.495221316814422607,0,True,False,False

The narrative is exceptional and is both engaging and profound. The attention to world-building is remarkable, providing a depth that captivates from the onset.

My primary critique centers around the game's combat mechanics, which feel somewhat disjointed and in need of further polishing. Specifically, the timing for parries is challenging to master, and there appears to be inconsistency with the activation of certain combo inputs, leading to moments of frustration. Additionally, I would have favored a gameplay design that focused on controlling a single protagonist, with the other character serving as an AI companion, reminiscent of the dynamic seen in ""God of War."" This, I believe, would have offered a more streamlined and focused gameplay experience.

Visually, the game ranges from satisfactory to stunning. The developers have clearly dedicated a great deal of effort into the presentation of cutscenes, which are both immersive and beautifully crafted, drawing the player deeper into the game's narrative. However, the sound design presents a mixed bag. While it can be exceptionally immersive, particularly in environmental storytelling and key narrative moments, it falls short in combat scenarios. This inconsistency occasionally detracts from the overall experience, leaving engagements feeling somewhat underwhelming. Additionally, the game's musical score shines brilliantly during certain scenes, such as the poignant moment the protagonist finds themselves awakening on a beach. Yet, outside these highlights, the soundtrack tends to fade into the background, marred further by a noticeable looping issue post-release, where at least one track abruptly stops and restarts at inappropriate times.

The Foley work, especially in terms of character movement and during cutscenes, stands out as a highlight for me, showcasing a meticulous attention to detail. Voice acting within the game is varied, with the majority delivering exceptional performances that enhance the narrative's impact.

It's evident that the development team drew inspiration from the ""Witcher"" series, as seen in the game's animations, user interface, and overall feel of the game. Despite these similarities, ""Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden"" secures its place among my favorite games, primarily due to its superb writing and atmospheric depth. I am eagerly looking forward to a sequel, hopeful that it will continue to build upon this strong foundation.",1707840745,1707840745,True,52,1,0.787176966667175293,0,True,False,False

- Voice acting is great
- Both main protagonists are awesome.  Highly likeable characters so far and as already mentioned very well voiced.  It's been a while since I liked game characters and I wasn't expecting much here, but they delivered.
- Story is really cool so far
- Combat is fun, I had read some people thought it was too basic, but it fits the game well and is quite enjoyable
- Performance is great.  Granted I'm running a 4070 and an i9 but not even a little hiccup in fps so far and that is without frame generation turned on.  This is pretty rare for today's game releases lol.

1) Way too many keyboard controls. Seems very unresponsive in places. Hey don't forget the E key LOL.
2) Climb or jump use the ""E"" key, come on man.
3) Sometimes E didn't even work for me. 
4) This is more like reading a book than playing a game, very slow game. 
5) Sorry but I will refund. Maybe after 10 patches, but I have a feeling these devs are very happy with their game, so I don't expect many worth while patches.",1707773966,1707773966,False,29,18,0.220247283577919006,0,True,False,False

Very solid voice acting, interesting characters and a good setup for the whole story. Lots of environmental storytelling, letters and books to find. Also, no technical issues so far, which is something to behold these days. Runs smooth as butter and has a lot of options to tweak. The world looks beautiful and exploring is always rewarded, which is a plus too. I hope Vampyr 2 will get the same treatment.",1707773484,1707773652,True,5,2,0.5252571702003479,0,True,False,False

Combat that is similar (but thankfully changeable difficulty at any time).  This game changes out the city of London for the open wilds of young America but the structure of both gameplay systems and exploration remain similar as well.

The visuals have taken a noticeable step up tho.  Overall, if you liked their last game, you'll probably like this.  I'm enjoying and very interested to see where it goes.",1707772084,1707772118,True,97,4,0.835135936737060547,0,True,False,False
