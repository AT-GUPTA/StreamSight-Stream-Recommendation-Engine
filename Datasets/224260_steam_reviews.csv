Pros -
1. Two modes - Survival and Objective completion
2. Good amount of player base and many servers to choose from
3. Gameplay will get you hooked if you're into zombie objective completion type games.
4. Many weapons to choose from
6. Players can get infected and turn into zombies
7. Some maps are really challenging.
8. In obective maps, you can respawn maximum 2 times( some have 3 ) at various stages of map. This may be a con to some but I like this.

Cons -
1. Some rare zombie and player getting stuck somewhere
2. Server music keeps on playing and I don't know how to stop it. Just like CS 1.6 if you have played it. It plays even after you've left the server
3. Some guns are weird to shoot and won't hit the target like in other games. Especially, the sniper rifles.

You can play chain objectives maps or defensive maps (where you can make barricades).

[b] PROS [/b]
This game has taken zombie survival into a new sort of way making it harder and the environment in the game is creepy and scary, I really enjoy playing this with friends and the ammo is so scarce that to a point that you fight with your bare hands or melee. I suggest this game even though its a few years old coming from the Half-Life 2 engine.

[b] CONS [/b]
There  are some missing 'features' but I can tolerate it since this game was developed as a mod for HL2, Those that are lacking are like proning, broken animations, more missions, probably a capability for a player to become a zombie like in Contagion. Hmmm, also different categories of zombies like for example, runner, raging zombie or a aggressive ghoul which is very fast. Plus we need more variety of weapons.

[b] OVERALL [/b]
This game is very unique in a way that people will love and enjoy playing over and over again, The replayability is endless especially with more friends in tthe picture. This game deservers a remake although I heard that they (Developers of NMRIH) are making NMRIH 2 running in Unreal Engine instead of Source Engine, That'll be cool since Unreal has nice graphics and features. I hope when they release NMRIH 2 I suggest that it will be purchasable since the developers created a amazing game same as the old one but even better!

You're welcome for an actual recipe, not a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ copy and paste pie recipe. Trust me nothing goes wrong with nutella.

INGREDIENTS:

1 c. unsalted butter
2 c. sugar
1/2 tsp. salt
1 c. flour
1 c. cocoa powder
4 eggs
1 (13-oz.) jar Nutella
5 Ferrero Rocher candies, unwrapped and crumbled


DIRECTIONS:

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
2. Melt butter in a medium-sized saucepan over medium heat. Add sugar, stirring until combined. 3. Remove from heat and add salt, flour, and cocoa powder, stirring to combine. Whisk in eggs, stirring just until the mixture is combined into a batter. Set aside.
4. Spray an 8""-x-8"" pan with cooking spray. Pour half of the batter into the pan. Spoon or lightly drizzle most of the Nutella on top of the batter, forming an even layer over the brownie batter. 5. 5. Use a spoon or silicone spatula to cover the Nutella with the remaining brownie batter. (If you pour the batter straight on top of the Nutella, it will sink into the Nutella and combine into one marbled—yet delicious—mess.)
6. Bake until the top layer of brownies has browned and set, 28 to 30 minutes. It shouldn’t jiggle when you remove it from the oven. (The toothpick test doesn’t work here, since the toothpick will hit the Nutella layer, making the brownies seem uncooked.)
7. Let cool for 15 to 20 minutes, then top with a drizzle of Nutella and crumbled Ferrero Rocher chocolates. Cut into squares and serve.

Okay, it basically just copies left for dead.
On a more serious note the game doesn't really change all that much but it is really good and entertaining to play just to watch a friend die and then pop their head open with a double barrel shotgun.

I mostly played with my brother but after that, after having put nine hours into the game , I dropped it because it became boring to me.

The game felt very unfinished, as if it hadn't actually left greenlight. Setting up servers proved to be a hassle, and I found you could only really play with friends who weren't local, was to play on a pre-existing server. Either I was doing something wrong, or this game's Gui wasn't properly implimented. Again, very unfinished and rushed. I'm hoping the sequel will be done better, that is assuming they're hoping to improve upon what they did last time.

That being said, the game was fun at the time. I fondly recall shooting myself without any rhyme or reason, leaving my brother to fend for himself, and, in cases I found most humorous, fight off a hord that has surrounded him with no hope of escape.

It's a game of survival, and survivability is pretty low with a two man squad so bring mate's for a good time. You'll need to work together, it's very unforgiving. Limited weapons, limited ammo, mostly melee weapons, aim for the head, classic Romero zombies.

To clarify, I haven't played enough of it to make a big enough review, this is just my initial impressions from the nine hours I gathered, I haven't even touched the game in over two years so if they've made improvements to the Gui, which I doubt, I wouldn't know.

My hopes for the sequel, is that they focus more on developing the server setup, map selection, gameplay. The realistic approach they've taken is perfect, what I mean is, character customization, that seems to be very lacking in this game, if not implimented badly from my experience. Better maps would be nice too. And a Steam workshop if at all possible. I wouldn't mind downloading a Raccoon City based map and playing with some buds with that.

I fully trust the Dev team and understand if they can't focus real big like that. We'll have to see but that's half my hopes for the sequel, which I pray will improve over this game.

I stand on neutural ground with this game, but I do approve it, only to people looking for a good co-op Zombie game that is as realistic as it can be.

The game uses a more realistical approach on the zombie survival genre while offering two game modes: survival and objective missions.
While the survival missions are quite simple, they are very enjoyable and fun, holding the zombies while you wait for extraction at wave 10.
The objective ones are more broad and offer variation within big maps, and while some are easier than others they are still a good adventure. Another fact is that such maps possess variation between rounds, so you will have another route of objectives to execute.
Most of the maps also contain secrets and special features.
You are not a superhero: you will bleed, you will be infected and you can also suicide yourself for the greater good of the group.

Overall review:

Pros:

- Free game.
- Extremely fun with friends (the more people you play, the better).
- Realistic gun mechanics and decent melee combat while keeping a good gameplay.
- Nice graphics (taking in account the fact that the game was made in 2011).
- Extremely well made animations of itens and weapons in first person.
- Very good optimization (very few bugs, and no performance issues at all).
- Good gun and attack sounds.
- Characters possess a varied soundbank of quick chat commands, giving you quick communication with your fellow survivors.
- The VOIP inside the game simulates real conversation, the far you are from another player, the lower is your voice (you can use an in game walkie talkie to communicate from afar without issues).
- Lots of maps with good level design.
- Two map types with lot of variation.
- Very good amount of guns and melee weapons (arround 20 firearms and a bow, and 20 melee weapons, there are also 3 throwable explosives).
- People still play this game to this day (so you will find people to play with you without a problem).

Cons:

- Few zombie models (you will kill the same zombies all over again).
- Some animations of ammo checking are wrong.
- Playing alone is difficult in most cases (not recommended to play alone, this is a cooperative game after all).
- Sometimes the zombie attack animation can be quite poor (depending on you position).
- The music is quite boring (my personal opinion, maybe you will like it).

While the game has minor flaws, it is a very enjoyable experience and will bring you and your friends lots of desperating moments and agony (the good kind of it).
A good adventure.

Pros: Play with friends and be like SF Team :P, you can kill yourself in the game by your hands etc Lol, Really Cool Graphic + Gameplay, its F2p and i guess they will make Part 2 of this game and i hope that, this game is really funny and there is some servers with Project missions and survivor missions, actually Words Can't change your Mind so all you had to do is Download the Game and test it.
.
.
.
Cons: lagging some times, if zombie stuck on you so you facked up, some times you can't win a survivor alone so if you think about that so its bad idea really :D, THE BLOODY Facking shit you will found in that game is Zombie Kids they like 5 years old zombie kids and they are faster but not strong i really hate them so much :\, you must take care some times its not Like L4D  if you got bite so you have or must to find bills well again words can't change your mind so all you had to do is download the game and try it.

Graphics are good for a 6 year old game
Fun
Simple

I have not seen many flaws in this game thus far :)

Shoot zombies and sometimes your teammates in the head! Instead of hoarding, why not share all that ammo you're carrying, because you're not really going to use 5.56 with 9mm pistols? Don't forget to bring a friend![/i]

No More Room in Hell is a neat little HL2 mod, that i'd honestly recommend over other zombie games for many, many reasons, such as having an unique atmosphere that really takes you into the game on a perspective where you'll have to work as a team instead of just being a mindless shooter that literally anyone could play.

That being said, NMRiH takes a more realistic approach on the zombie scheme; slow paced action, everything can be used to save your or someone elses ass, ammo is (fairly often) scarce and should be saved rather than just used on the first enemy on sight. It may not be as action driven as one may think but the slow paced gameplay fits really well to the impression of the apocalyptic world, where everyone is trying to survive till they get to safety.

So what about the techinal thingies?

Yes it has some bugs but most of the time you'll barely notice these minor things. Yes there could be some further fixing with the game but overall but in general the game works and functions really well.

It's a really good addition to anyones zombie game collection, no need to wait for sales or anything because it's for grabs at anytime for free!

It's much intense survival than we experienced in Left for Dead 1/2. People who love casual zombie shooter this is not thier game. You can't get guns as you wish or enough pills to save yourself, also your pal. Zombie experience is much more realistic here. You get bitten, You become zombie eventually. 

I would have recommended the game, but some factors took the fun away. I'm gonna specify those.
* You can't join a ongoing match until a round or wave ends or full team dies
* Even with stock maps game still downloads some files - which bothered me most
* Maps are too small for running or shooting from great distance.
* Inadequte weapons and very low ammount of ammo sures that you can't survive long.
* Zombies are hard to kill and they're great in number - like pile of gerbage thrown at you.
* Not fun at all.

Ingredients
- To Make the Dough
375 grams (3 cups) plain flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
1/4 cup (50 ml / 3½ tablespoons) olive oil
1/2 cup (120 ml / 8 tablespoons) water
Extra flour for dusting 


- To Make Cheese Filling
15 ounces (425 grams) container Ricotta cheese
5 ounces (142 g/about 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons) ""3 Cheese Italian Blend"" (Parmesan, Romano & Asiago)
Note: grate these cheeses yourself and create your own custom blend.
1/2 cup cheddar cheese
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper


- Extras
Your favorite sauce for the ravioli (i.e. marinara/ marijuana)
Parmesan cheese
Basil
Fried vegetables
Shrimp
Fish slices
Chicken pieces 
Make the Ravioli filling.

- In a small mixing bowl, add the ricotta and mash with a fork.
- Add in the 3-cheese blend, Cheddar cheese, eggs, salt, and pepper.
- Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth, paste-like consistency.
- Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. 

Make the Ravioli dough.

- Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.
- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.
- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.
- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.
- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.
- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).
- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. 

Fill the Ravioli shells.

- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.
- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.
- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.
- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.

Ingredients
- To Make the Dough
375 grams (3 cups) plain flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
1/4 cup (50 ml / 3½ tablespoons) olive oil
1/2 cup (120 ml / 8 tablespoons) water
Extra flour for dusting 


- To Make Cheese Filling
15 ounces (425 grams) container Ricotta cheese
5 ounces (142 g/about 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons) ""3 Cheese Italian Blend"" (Parmesan, Romano & Asiago)
Note: grate these cheeses yourself and create your own custom blend.
1/2 cup cheddar cheese
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper


- Extras
Your favorite sauce for the ravioli (i.e. marinara/ marijuana)
Parmesan cheese
Basil
Fried vegetables
Shrimp
Fish slices
Chicken pieces 
Make the Ravioli filling.

- In a small mixing bowl, add the ricotta and mash with a fork.
- Add in the 3-cheese blend, Cheddar cheese, eggs, salt, and pepper.
- Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth, paste-like consistency.
- Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. 

Make the Ravioli dough.

- Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.
- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.
- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.
- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.
- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.
- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).
- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. 

Fill the Ravioli shells.

- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.
- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.
- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.
- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.
- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. 

Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.

- Roll the dough into two sheets
- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.
- Fill with the ravioli mixture.
- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.
- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.
