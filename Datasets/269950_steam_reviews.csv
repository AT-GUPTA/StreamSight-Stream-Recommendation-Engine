I was looking for a flight simulator that was realistic, and had a good amount of planes to test fly, while also being able to use VR tech to enjoy the realism. Xplane 11 has a lot to offer. It is about 91 Gigs to download. So about 40ish gigs less than MFS. You don't need to make an account to play. Graphics for the inside of the plane 8/10. Graphics for the outside 6/10 with my entry level computer. If you have god tier comp, probably 8/10. It still looks really good, especially from high above. They did an excellent job with all the controls in the plane. You can hold the x button on the MQ3 Controller to zoom look at all the switches and buttons in the plane, as well as the view outside windows. I set my graphics and everything to max. The only thing I left at a normal setting was the Anti Aliasing. If you set it to Max or anything above what your comp can handle, there will be lagtime and stuttering as you look around. Not enjoyable to play that way. If you have a 5ghz Network on your router, connect your headset to that instead of the 2.4ghz standard one. It will make streaming to your headset much smoother. The game is a lot of fun. Lots of different craft to fly. Small planes, 747 commercial planes, military jets, helicopters, gliders, sea planes, ect. They even allow you to fly the planes from the older version of this game, which includes a nasa rocket. Haven't flown that one yet. The game allows you take lessons as well so you can get hands on realistic experience on how flying really is. You can do full flight paths and have communications with the flight control stations. They have almost every airport in the world on here to take off from. The initial cities and surrounding land mass is pretty realistic for these areas. But if you are trying to fly over, lets say, your house. In your home state. It isn't THAT realistic. Trust me, I tried. I believe the game is using some sort of map generator beyond the airports and cities. You will see random highways that don't exist, or the road ramping off into nothing sometimes. A lot of random generation beyond the airports and cities. I'm excited to see where this technology goes in the future with how realistic it is already. If they incorporated google earth maps with this game, it'd be a sight to behold. I recommend if you get this game, to find a few planes that you're comfortable flying. Get them up to a nice altitude, and then start using your controller to flip switches and dials and figure out what they do. It's very enjoyable. If you don't have a joystick, GET ONE. You can use the VR controllers to fly the planes, but it's annoying having to hold the triggers down the entire time and to lose your grip on stuff randomly. A Joystick will make it feel that much more realistic and make your gameplay more fun. I purchased one for 25 bucks. On the 747, you can even open the cockpit door to the passenger area and see rows of seats. You can't walk back there but it's pretty cool to see it, and feel like you could. You can parachute out of the planes as well which is pretty fun. I couldn't believe they even had an airport for Okinawa Japan for me to fly around and check out the area i used to live in. So cool. I definitely recommend getting this game if you're interested in flying. I looked around a lot before I got this one and it was a great purchase in my opinion. I already know a lot more about planes now and have the confidence that I could actually land a plane in an emergency situation already. With a MetaQuest3 headset, running this game. You will get about 3 hours of gameplay before your headset needs to be charged. Try it out!",1708751247,1708751247,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As of the time of this review, I currently hold a License for Private ASEL, and have a check ride schedule for my instrument rating.
X-plane 11 is great for simulating instrument flight and procedures. However I would recommend a beefy CPU. I have an i7-4790 that struggles to compute the sim fast enough to match the frame rate my GTX 1080 provides.
Easy support for 3 monitors, to be able to look left or right.
The new microsoft flight will have to be pretty good to top this.

I'm now type rated in the Airbus A320, and start flying for an airline next week. This sim I have used to stay current at my flight school.

Chuck Yeager definitely never knew me.

I know next to nothing about flying, but have always been curious. So I figured a sim would be a good start. From what I read, the X-Plane series is more accurate than the Microsoft Flight Simulator series, and that is what I prefer. Since this one was $10 at the time, and I read 12 needs a much better system to run...to be safe I went with 11. My biggest worry was if there would be tutorials to teach me the basics....which thankfully there are.

In my hour of playing, I have learned:

1. How to take off and remain steady in a small propeller plane.
2. How to take off in an old crop duster with a back wheel...by driving all over the grass and almost running into everything.
3. How to land......three runways to the left of where I should have stopped.
4. How to take off in a 737 with the whole panel beeping at me.
5. That I should never fly a 747 in my life. And...ironically....that a 747 can in fact do barrel rolls and fly inverted, even when the pilot doesn't mean to.

For anyone that is not a pilot or has never flown before, I give you this warning: the tasks in the game are difficult and easy to do at the same time. The flight school gives a good walkthrough how to handle landing, flying, and taking off.....but it is still going to be difficult to master. But it is worth it. Just put a little time into it each day or week, and it will be a rewarding experience.

I can't say the same for my passengers on the 747. They hung in there well as we spun and flipped for a good 10 minutes before running upside down along the ground. I just hope they got a refund for their ticket....

...and that we had enough barf bags during that 15 min ordeal of a flight.",1702411958,1702411958,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have not purchased any additional features, runs smooth 55 fps with 8GB Ram no problems there.

Do not expect too much out of it, just the basics. I would not recommend spending more than 10USD on it, just watch some online videos of actual landing if it is the night view or building or structures you want to see.

This outstanding simulation game is nothing short of a masterpiece, and I am excited to share my exhilarating journey through the skies with you.

From the moment you take your seat in the virtual cockpit, you'll be struck by the jaw-dropping attention to detail. The aircraft models are nothing short of remarkable, with their meticulously recreated instrument panels, functioning controls, and authentic physics. Whether you're piloting a small Cessna or a mighty Boeing 747, you'll feel as though you're truly in command of a real aircraft.

But what truly sets X-Plane 11 apart is its world-building prowess. The developers have harnessed the power of cutting-edge technology to create an awe-inspiring, realistic world that extends as far as the eye can see. The level of detail in the landscape is staggering, with faithfully modeled cities, rolling landscapes, and realistic weather conditions that can challenge even the most seasoned virtual pilots. Flying through a storm at sunset is an experience you won't soon forget.

X-Plane 11 goes to great lengths to ensure the accuracy of its global terrain. This means that you can take off and land at virtually any airport on the planet, and they'll all be represented with striking fidelity. If you've ever dreamt of flying over your hometown, or exploring the exotic landscapes of far-off destinations, X-Plane 11 will make those dreams come true.

The realism doesn't stop at the graphics and physics; the audio in X-Plane 11 is equally impressive. The roar of engines, the whistling wind, and the radio chatter of air traffic control all contribute to the immersive experience. It's a true symphony of sound that enhances the simulation's authenticity.

One of the game's standout features is the comprehensive selection of aircraft, which ranges from light, single-engine planes to heavy commercial jets. Whether you're a novice pilot or a seasoned aviator, you'll find a suitable challenge in the wide variety of aircraft available.

Additionally, the flight modeling in X-Plane 11 is nothing short of groundbreaking. The simulator's use of blade-element theory ensures that every flight feels unique, with factors like weight, balance, and environmental conditions accurately affecting the aircraft's performance. This attention to detail creates an incredibly satisfying sense of realism.

The community behind X-Plane 11 is passionate and engaged, and they have developed a vast library of add-ons and mods that further enhance the experience. You can customize your simulator with new aircraft, improved graphics, and even more accurate navigation data, ensuring that X-Plane 11 can evolve with your interests and skill level.

In conclusion, X-Plane 11 is a monumental achievement in the world of flight simulation. It doesn't merely allow you to play at flying; it enables you to experience the joys and challenges of aviation in an entirely authentic way. Whether you're a budding pilot, a dedicated enthusiast, or just someone looking for an extraordinary and immersive gaming experience, X-Plane 11 will take you to new heights. It's not just a game; it's a breathtaking adventure through the skies. Strap in, and prepare for takeoff - your journey with X-Plane 11 awaits.Highly Recommend!",1698570358,1700591337,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Simulator so good I had to go do the real thing. 10/10 do recommend X-Plane and real life flying. Get it for the physics, level of detail in systems, and select Payware producers (Flight Factor 757/767, Toliss A321/A320/A319/A346, Rotate MD-80/MD-11, SSG 747, and a few general aviation aircraft as well).

In the expansive sky of flight simulation games, X-Plane 11 stood out as a hallmark of realism, complexity, and technological prowess. Developed and published by Laminar Research, this simulator was more than a game; it was a comprehensive digital aviation experience. From hobbyists to professional pilots, X-Plane 11 offered something for everyone who has ever wanted to defy gravity. Here's a detailed look at what made X-Plane 11 a premier choice for aviation enthusiasts.

Visually, X-Plane 11 was a marvel. Upon launching, players were greeted with exquisitely detailed aircraft models set against dynamically stunning backdrops. The global scenery, which included meticulously crafted landscapes, roads, and city structures, was a testament to the game's commitment to realism. The simulator's lighting, reflections, and shadows pushed the graphical fidelity to impressive heights, although enjoying these at the highest settings required a powerful PC setup.

At its core, X-Plane 11 excelled due to its authentic flight dynamics. It employed a unique aerodynamic model known as blade element theory, which simulated the airflow over aircraft components in real-time. This attention to detail created an environment where aircraft responded to various conditions with an accuracy that mirrored real life. Whether players were controlling a light aircraft or a heavy commercial jet, the responsiveness and feel were nothing short of authentic.

The base game provided a substantial fleet of aircraft, spanning from simple single-engine planes to complex jets. Each craft was designed with incredible attention to detail, offering players a wide range of flight experiences. The modding community further enriched this diversity, with countless third-party add-ons available, though the most intricately detailed ones often were not free.

The dynamic weather system was another highlight of X-Plane 11. Players had the option to manipulate weather conditions, choosing from presets or customizing their own atmospheric setups. The weather's impact on flight, combined with visually striking storm effects, cloud formations, and accurate wind patterns, added multiple layers of challenge and immersion.

One critical consideration for potential users was X-Plane 11’s intensive system requirements. Running this simulator with all features and high graphical settings necessitated a high-end PC. Players needed to ensure their systems were adequately equipped - at least an Intel Core i7 6770 or AMD equivalent and a fairly beefy GPU with 4GB VRAM.

X-Plane 11 was an all-encompassing flight simulation platform. Its sophisticated flight model, top-tier graphics, and realistic features set it apart in the genre. While the learning curve was steep for beginners, and the system requirements were demanding, the rewards for aviation enthusiasts were unmatched. For those who were in pursuit of a pilot's licence or those who simply adored the complexities (and rewards!) of flight, X-Plane 11 was an unrivaled journey through the skies.",1697760601,1697760601,True,10,0,0.530313372611999512,0,True,False,False

You may be wondering how many hours I've actually FLOWN in X-Plane 11, and I can happily say it's only around 20 hours. The rest? The painful setup of addons, primarily the scenery where you have to manually set up layers because Laminar wasn't smart enough to code it correctly on their end. Many of the payware sceneries are also expensive, and good luck making sure all 20 libraries needed for one scenery are installed and layered correctly. Don't even get me started with Ortho4XP, and other ways to install scenery tiles. 

Speaking of add-ons, the out-of-the-box experience is so underwhelming and small that it's literally required to install third party add-ons such as the Zibo 737-800X (which is actually amazing - great job Zibo!), and 20 plug-ins (conservative estimate). When the first tips you get when asking for advice from seasoned X-Plane users involves installing a metric ton of add-ons, you know something went wrong at Laminar Research. On top of this, the majority of quality aircraft (even in the middle-of-the-market in complexity) are egregiously expensive. For example, the Boeing 737-300 from IXEG & X-Aviation, which cant (from my experience) even do a hold at a waypoint and is just converted from the ancient X-Plane 10, is $70. $70!!! While this isn't necessarily Laminar's fault, it is something to note if you wish to use X-Plane 11. 

Don't even get me started with the aforementioned plug-ins. Want live weather that isn't just local METARs taped together? Here, spend $40-$70 on a weather engine (that Laminar could have added as default during X-Plane 11's development cycle!)

Once all of these add-ons are installed, you'll have to pray that the coding equivalent of (now wet with all of the installations you just made) duct-tape that seemingly holds X-Plane 11 together (after 11 iterations worth of code (?)) works, and that your hard drive isn't more stuffed than you after a dinner at Grandma's. Sometimes it does. Sometimes it doesn't. Such is the motto of the grand scheme of life, I guess.

However, there are a few pros:
1. There is a massive selection of add-ons and third party aircraft to choose from
2. The aircraft feel great. Personally, not enough to create the cult following that Laminar's flight model gets, but they do feel great. 
3. UI is very easy to navigate, and controls are easy to set up.
4. Good performance
5. Pretty good graphics, however Laminar might have wanted to re-check how shadows worked before launching back in 2016 - only your aircraft has shadows!

Now, for my real X-Planers out there, you've probably noticed that I have nearly 1100 hours in Microsoft Flight Simulator, and are now working to doxx me, kidnap me, and sacrifice me to The Great Austin Meyer. Yes, I'm not lying when I say that a couple dozen of those were used to set up and whatnot, but it didn't make me feel like I was speedrunning a migraine, and it made me feel like I was using a piece of software that wasn't created during the Crustacean Era. 

X-Plane 12, you say? What's that? Oh yeah... that exists... I guess. Anyway! Main point being, X-Plane 11 is no longer the industry standard. Even though its $30 more (and it's own issues), MFS2020 is a much less frustrating experience, with much more to offer out-of-the-box. However, if you've already poured a decent fraction of the US Defense budget and your lifetime into getting X-Plane perfectly calibrated for your experience, all power to you.

------------------------------------------------

X-plane 11 has charm, some great planes and even combat but with the release of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, it's extremely difficult to recommend X-plane as a serious simulator---that is until the graphics and ATC catch up.
_____________________________________________________________________

Previous review updates

This review is based off of my steam purchase of X-plane 11 with a Steam sale.  Most of the details I have included are for new users to X-plane.   

REVIEW UPDATED FOR X-PLANE VER 11.30


SOME HIGHLIGHTS/POSITIVES ABOUT X-PLANE 11


User Interface (UI): 

Pleasing to the eyes.  The UI in X-plane 11 has been given a complete and welcome overhaul from past versions of the sim. Old and new users will find the settings easier to navigate and understand. Whether configuring a joystick, flight yoke or tweaking the sim’s graphics, the simple sliders, added search function and visuals make configuring X-plane 11 to your liking fun and intelligent. 

Lighting: 

Impressive, bright and vibrant. The lighting in X-plane 11 is simply amazing and in my opinion, more realistic than ever.  Lighting is vastly brighter (and more realistic IMO) than previous versions of X-Plane ever were.  There is a noticeable haze which is somewhat adjustable under weather visual settings and for me it enhances this sim.

Sound:

Generally good quality. Aside from the ATC audio, general environment and aircraft sounds are quite realistic and pleasing.  Audio for default X-plane 11 aircraft is generally acceptable.  Aircraft audio will depend on the original quality of aircraft you download or pay for.  (Payware aircraft tend to be more realistic both visually and sound-wise)

Clouds: 

Clouds appear to be softer and whiter in X-plane 11 but my FPS did take at least a 10 point frame rate drop when flying in heavier fog/cloud layers unless you use a FlyWithLua shadow/cloud plugin which can help to improve frame-rates.


Graphics/Autogen: 

Default textures for terrain, buildings, road-networks, airports etc. look fantastic in X-plane 11.    Days (and nights) are more realistic  than ever in X-plane 11.
 HDR lighting makes street lights, runways, and aircraft lighting look real.   With a decent graphics card (the more memory the better)  visual settings and lights will look great in your sim.  New partlicle system implemented in 11.30 helps improve clouds and exhaust effects.

Combat mode and Scenerios:
 
X-plane 11 includes a combat mode which allows your aircraft to engage in combat with other AI air traffic.  Pretty cool!  Various scenerios such as glider tow, mid-air refueling, carrier take-off/landing, and space shuttle re-entry and landing are included.

Addons, Plugins and Tweaking

If you like tweaking,  modding and using addons/plugins you will love X-plane 11 because adding custom content is a breeze in X-plane 11 and will enhance your sim.   (The FlyWithLua plugin is a good example)

 

SOME NOTE-WORTHY CONS ABOUT X-PLANE 11

 
User Interface (UI): 

If your are coming from X-plane 10 or even 9 you may miss the additional options for rendering that were available in those versions of X-plane.  X-plane 11 has simplified the User Interface which is great but I do wish there was an Advanced Option built-in for tweaking indiviual settings such as traffic levels, roads, boats, etc. 

Sounds: 

ATC in X-plane 11 has been apparently updated in ver 11.30 to be more realistic than in previous versions of X-plane but I wouldn’t know because I haven’t tried it yet.  I find the synthesized voices (also upgraded) that are used completely unbearable to listen to.  

Steering/ Controls: 

It might be just me, but I find the steering/rudder controls of the default Cessna 172 and helicopter erratic and somewhat difficult to control on take-off especially when using the Saitek flight yoke. The Cessna 172 continues to want to roll right even when trim is set.  New users,  especially users coming from FSX may have some difficulty at first getting things just right. 

Clouds:

While generally clouds and fog in X-plane 11 are good we know they could be improved visually in terms of their shape, definition and overall appearance.  Thunderheads and storm clouds should appear like tall menacing thunderheads (cumulus cloud) rather than layers of stratus.  Contrails appear to have been improved in ver 11.30. 

*Note about X-plane's default airports (for new users):

Some default airports in X-plane 11 will not include buildings but updated airports which do include buildings, hangers and terminals are always being added to X-plane via updates.   

CONCLUSION 

Try the X-plane 11 Demo first.  See how it runs on your computer system.  
If you enjoy flight simulators such as FSX or PrePar3d, I highly recommend X-plane 11 especially if you can get it on a steam sale.",1513215134,1696405916,True,5,0,0.556714117527008057,0,True,False,False

The only one that beats it in my eyes is Microsoft Flight Simulator (Yes I know X-Plane 12 is out but I can't get if for now). The sim has a very well made Boeing 737-800 as a base game plane! but the first 737 mod you should get is the Zibo 737. It's an amazing plane and should be downloaded at some point. My thoughts on the payware market is that they are all way over priced. $80 for a plane!? it better be damn good and from what I've seen they are not worth the high price. a better price would be about $20-$40.

When you purchase a game and the fanbase's next tip is to literally buy scenery, or install a convoluted (but FREE!!!) scenery mod that delves into the game's files and really makes you think the creators should've done it, something is very wrong.

'Play MFSF if you're in it for the scenery' - I'm sorry but no. What a lame attempt at defending the devs. I shouldn't have to sacrifice scenery, something QUITE LITERALLY imperative to flying, for the sake of 'oh, the Cessna flies just slightly better than Micropoop's model.'

The graphics quality of MSFS and accuracy of the terrain are unquestionably superior.  And, MSFS is much more ""playable"" as a game.  But, X-Plane is just much closer to real flight, in terms of the flight model and aircraft handling.

If you want an accurate simulation, X-Plane is the clear choice.  MSFS ""can"" be tuned to approach the realism in X-Plane, but even then is just a little bit off.  Not sure how to describe it - it's just maybe too game-like ... too forgiving?

But, this isn't an MSFS review.  It's just hard to talk about X-Plane without mentioning MSFS.

X-Plane is pretty much infinitely configurable, since you can make your own aircraft or terrain or get customized content from the community.  If that appeals to you, the community is very active and the sky's the limit.  As for me, I mostly fly stock aircraft over stock terrain.  I have found the handling pretty much spot-on for the aircraft I have flown.  It is not a replacement for actual flight time, but it definitely makes me a better pilot with skills and habits that translate to the cockpit.

Could you teach yourself to fly a real airplane by using X-Plane only?  No ... not with a desktop setup.  The software itself will not teach you what you need to know.  But, if you are learning to fly or are already a pilot, the practice you can gain is invaluable.  In some ways, it is better than actual cockpit experience, in that you can experiment a bit, pay more attention to instruments, etc.  In short, since you don't need to worry about endangering yourself or others, you can really hone specific skills in a way that is more difficult in real-world conditions.

There are really only a few disappointments, to me.

First, the terrain is technically accurate, but not terribly detailed.  That is, airports, navaids, etc. are where they should be, with runways, taxiways, towers, etc. all matching real life.  Likewise, major terrain features are as close to accurate as necessary to really matter.  The only deficit, though, is that the terrain is sort of roughed in, making it hard to navigate by specific landmarks.  For example, you can usually find and follow something like an interstate freeway, but don't expect anything smaller to be accurate or even present.  Similarly, rivers, streams, lakes, and shorelines are usually on the map, but with pretty low fidelity.

In short, it is difficult to use it for VFR navigation in an area you might be familiar with.  For example, I used to fly in Colorado Springs and used a school bus garage as a landmark for navigating the traffic pattern.  In X-Plane, there is an area that looks vaguely light-industrial, but no details that give any clue as to where that garage might be.

Second, radio communication is ... OK ... ish.  One thing I wish I could get from a simulator is good and accurate practice on the radio.  Communicating with ATC and other services, accurately recording and applying the information received, and managing frequency changes  - all while flying the airplane, potentially under difficult conditions - that takes some practice.  I would say that ATC communication in X-Plane is more of an annoyance than it is valuable practice.  As a feature in the software, it is slightly better than nothing.

Hand-in-hand with this, AI traffic is not realistic either.  There are other aircraft flying about.  You may occasionally see them, you will hear them on the radio, and you can see them on your map view.  But, they don't really fly in any way that makes sense.  They just sort of show up, fly for a little while, then disappear.  Not a big deal, but it would be valuable to, for example, encounter other aircraft in the traffic pattern and/or using the runway(s) that you are wanting to use.  I have flown several times into SeaTac airport (in X-Plane), and have never encountered another airplane.  (That just NEVER occurs in real life.  In reality, you not only have to contend with busy traffic, you need to pay attention to things like wake turbulence.)

Overall, I would say that X-Plane:
- Is a good way to get a pretty accurate simulation. Probably the best available to most consumers.
- Is not a game and probably won't appeal, as such, to someone looking for that.
- Is accurate where it matters, but lacks some refinement that might make it more visually appealing.
- Will make you a better pilot, in particular, in using your instruments effectively.",1688029361,1688029361,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Comes with a handy flight school mode to teach you the basics (so you don't crashe) and a plethora of different aircraft to fly (my personal faves being the general aviation stuff). Those dlc prices may deter you but if you are a true blue aussie (me) and are only looking to fly around in the oceanic/asian region than you will find that only some of the paid dlc might be nice-to-haves (though not necessary at all, I only have the base maps for all regions which are free and am getting along just fine).

p.s. if you have no clue on using plane gps systems than fear not, install the Avitab plugin to get a virtual tablet with a more familiar map system to guide you on your flights: https://github.com/fpw/avitab it's what I use and it gets the job done nicely.

p.p.s. while this game is way less resource intensive than xp12 or msfs2020, make sure you have a decent cpu, this game is heavily reliant upon it. For example, I get 45-75fps using a ryzen 5 2600 and a gtx 1650 super, whenin the graphics options I can crank up every gpu intensive visual effect but I have to set the reflection detail to low to make some more headroom for the cpu. 

Basically, don't be afraid to crank up those texture qaulity, visual effects and AA settings to the max if you have a gpu on par with mine or higher, but be weary of number of world objects and reflection detail settings on a cpu on par with mine.",1686652097,1686652097,True,8,0,0.614932894706726074,0,True,False,False

As a virtual pilot, I am thoroughly impressed with the attention to detail that has been put into every aspect of the game, from the aircraft models and cockpits to the weather and terrain.

The graphics in X-Plane 11 are stunning, and the scenery is incredibly lifelike, making it easy to lose yourself in the world of aviation. The planes are meticulously modeled, and the physics engine ensures that the flight experience is as realistic as possible. It's also great to have such a wide range of aircraft to choose from, allowing me to fly everything from a small single-engine propeller plane to a jumbo jet.

One of the standout features of X-Plane 11 is the level of customization available to players. The game's powerful SDK allows players to create and share their own aircraft, airports, and other features, which adds an incredible amount of depth and variety to the game.

Another fantastic aspect of X-Plane 11 is the community that surrounds it. There are countless resources available online, from tutorials to add-ons and mods, and the community is incredibly welcoming and helpful.

Overall, I would highly recommend X-Plane 11 to anyone who is interested in aviation, whether you're a seasoned pilot or just starting out. It's a fantastic game that offers an unparalleled level of realism and customization, and it's a joy to play every time I sit down at the controls.",1683139188,1683139188,True,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

Since then, a few things have changed:
For one, XP12 came out, which somehow made XP11 look better. 11 did end up getting some very helpful updates throughout its life though, including much better airport scenery (even if they're a lot overzealous on the static models). The G1000s got very smoothed out and almost operate like the real deal. 

Of course, several things are still (and will remain) broken.  Icing effects are pretty wild and the rules for icing are very aggressive.  I've literally come home from a great day of flying at my home airfield only to load X-Plane at the same airport using current weather and have my C172 so iced up it will barely taxi. Taildraggers are still just straight up broken.

You're also going to just not use any of the ATC or AI aircraft.  AI planes suck framerate as if you're loading multiple full scale models into the sim, because that's what you're doing. Stock ATC isn't even worth the effort, while the best of the third party ATC plugins is marginal at best and just loves vectoring you into downwind landings even when ASOS is reporting the opposite runway active. Bonus points if it routes you into a mountain while vectoring you through a nonexistent instrument approach. So get used to flying alone and only using the radios for navigation and weather. It's a more peaceful existence anyway.

Oh, and the game just LOVES to load copious amounts of randomly generated points of interest for you.  Be prepared to encounter sailing boats in the Arctic Ocean and 3000 different Nimitz class aircraft carriers along your route. If you get bored of shooting limitless carrier approaches on your transoceanic adventures, you can always set down on one of the 500,000 offshore oil platforms that can be found anywhere there is water. I mean, really, I appreciate adding things to do, but let's keep things somewhat accurate.

And of course, there are too few stock aircraft and they vary wildly in quality, as many of the models were developed for previous versions and have been updated only to varying degrees over the iterations of this sim.  Oh, and you want the ""nav data out of date"" warning to go away on your navigation systems? That's a third party subscription service.

But, all that said, X-Plane 11 still has pretty decent visuals, good flight models and has been a great tool for flight training. It's riddled with flaws, but it's still the version to have, at least as long as 12 keeps bogging down framerates.",1503206093,1679133124,True,0,0,0.591451048851013184,0,True,False,False

Unlike many who are relative newcomers to the flightsim world, I've been playing Microsoft flight since 1988 with it was a crappy 6 color game with only the Cessna or learjet 45 to choose from. I still have every ""original"" copy of every version of Microsoft flight sim I've bought since 88. To say that I'm a flightsim vet is the understatement of the decades. With that said, Microsoft should be ashamed to let anyone come in the market and outshine them in any way with flight simulator games and that is exactly what X Plane did. 

I don't know what happened with Microsoft Flightsim team, but there was a large gap between flight sim releases, and there was an even longer time when the ""new"" release didn't really bring anything new to the game. The developers of X Plane timing was exceptional and they dominated the market during that time. I've enjoyed playing the game and running sorties everywhere. The airplane details are excellent, the graphics on a whole is excellent, the availability of the game is exceptional being on Windows, Mac and Linux. Not many games can make that claim, but X Plane developers are on top of their game. I tip my hat in great respect to that achievement... All three major platforms!... WOW! Microsoft has only been available on Windows :-( 

Downside. There are two downside to X-Plane, and the only reason those downside now exist is because of FS2020. On the release of FS2020 we saw for the first time photo-realistic clouds, and real-world terrain generation. Those two groundbreaking achievements made me see X-Plane through a different lens. Don't get me wrong, I still play X-Plane once a while, but I'm awestruck with the terrain and weather system if FS2020. Also, the ATC communication feels a little more real than in previous generations. 

Seriously, it wasn't until release of FS2020 (and several subsequent bug fixes and updates) that Microsoft Flight sim got my attention again. As soon as X-Plane update to match or exceed FS2020 terrain and weather, myself and many other will like be onboard again more often.",1678892190,1678892190,True,9,0,0.60217517614364624,0,True,False,False

Then i bought X-Plane 11...
I have been so close to buying this game multiple times, but decided not to because of the price.
Got 34% off on Steam Winter Sale 2017 and oooh boy. If this game is not amazing, i dont know what is!

By far THE BEST flight sim on the market (without addons). Compared to FSX it wins almost everywhere. The only place this game lacks is the amount of aircrafts (and atc funcionality, but who uses that..), but then again, look at the detail! Almost every function in every aircraft included is simulated. The FSX Default planes dont even have an FMC/FMS.
With X-Plane you get a ton off free addons avalible and easy to install from www.forums.x-plane.org/
You get amazing default scenery.
You get a flight sim without the need for addons! (Which is unheard of in the flight sim community)
It has a bit of learning curve, but watch some tutorials on Youtube, and you will be good to go in no time.

If you think the game is a little expensive, i completely understand. Wait untill the next big sale. I got mine for 42 euros, which was an absolute steal!

I 110% recommend this game for every aviation enthusiast, ""veteran"" flight simmers ans those who are just getting started!

2023 UPDATE:
Even after the release of Microsoft Flight Simulator, this is still my choice of sim. While it doesn't quite look as good as MSFS, the flying is at least on par with it. If you, like myself, have bought a good handful of addons for X-Plane I would find it unreasonable to change to MSFS anytime soon. On my system MSFS doesn't run nearly as good as X-Plane. And from what I've heard, X-Plane physics are more realistic, but I'm no pilot so wouldn't know. Still a recommend!",1514591970,1677832995,True,30,6,0.755399584770202637,0,True,False,False

X-Plane 11 is a game that'll take you on a ride,
With stunning graphics and realistic gameplay,
This flight simulator will take your breath away.

From the smallest Cessna to the largest jumbo jet,
X-Plane 11 lets you fly them all, you can bet,
And with an enormous selection of aircraft to choose,
You'll never run out of new things to peruse.

The physics engine is top-notch, it's truly sublime,
With flight models that are accurate and divine,
From turbulence to wind shear, it's all simulated,
For an experience that's truly encapsulated.

The world is your playground, with vast landscapes to explore,
From mountains to oceans, and everything in store,
And with weather patterns that are truly dynamic,
You'll never run out of scenarios that are truly iconic.

But it's not just a game, it's a learning tool too,
For pilots in training, it's the perfect venue,
To practice procedures and emergency scenarios,
For a truly immersive experience that is truly farcical.

X-Plane 11, a game that's a cut above the rest,
With its realistic graphics and physics engine, it's the best,
For flight enthusiasts and pilots alike,
It's a game that'll take you on a flight, like you wouldn't strike.",1676437132,1676437132,True,15,4,0.620384693145751953,0,True,False,False

That last part is very important because while I may have an Xbox, I'm a Linux gamer and have been for years, so want to invest in games that can run natively on Linux. So far, I am very impressed. The performance on the Steam Deck is great, everything set to medium save for reflections, shadows, and world objects results in a solid 60FPS on that hardware.

So far as the user interface goes, it's very basic, like Laminar Research is saying ""We care more for the simulation than the user interface."" Then I hopped into the Cessna 172 Skyhawk with the ""X1000"" (Garmin G1000) avionics system and holy crap you can set up your entire flight plan within the cockpit without needing some fancy UI that doesn't present you with all of the options that system is actually capable of! I'm looking at you MSFS with your focus on additional UI elements rather than the tools the plane comes with. Laminar Research got it very right in this regard and what's more, just like with a real plane's avionics, they publish manuals so you can legit learn the way the various pilot handbooks available online will teach you to use the equipment. Now that's a sim!

I only have short amount of time in X-Plane 11 so far, but given that I can play it on my Steam Deck in hand-held mode (custom control schemes for the win!) or in Desktop mode with an extra monitor if I'm at my desk (thank you docking station!) it's quickly going to be my go-to time sink when I'm not in the mood for an RPG but want to ""play a game"".

I very much recommend this game for anyone wanting a credible flight sim that works in Linux and plays well on the Steam Deck, and is looking for the kind of immersion that doesn't require the fanciest of UIs to suck you in. X-Plane is unforgiving, but flying and messing with avionics feels like they should, and in a simulator, that's what matters.

Nothing was working in VR. Eventually I figured out it's because it requires you to clear out tutorial popups with the mouse or enter key, which you do not see in VR.
Overall it's buggy in VR. I couldn't get it working well with an Oculus Quest 2.
For example, Reset pilot view wouldn't center correctly.  Sometimes you can interact with things and sometimes you can't. it's not clear when you can & can't.
There also appears to be no way to ""restart flight"".    I got my plane stuck in water and there's no ""New Flight"" option in the main menu.

I'm running this on an Alienware Aurora R9 Core(TM) i7-9700 CPU @ 3.00GHz on an SSD drive with Win 10 Pro 64 bit and an NVIDIA RTX 2070. I'm on an HP Reverb G2 WMR headset which offers a really nice and stable VR experience!

The only issue for me is the small selection of aircraft's offered by default but that was an easy fix with all the free addons available on the Internet. I've since added multiple helicopters and planes to further expand my aircraft options greatly enhancing my experience.

Before buying X-Plane 11, I downloaded the demo for both X-Plane 11 and 12 directly from their website but version 12 ran a bit sluggish on my system and I simply wasn't happy with the overall performance. I opted to buy X-plane 11 because it offered the perfect balance between scenery, expansion and performance. The 3D building models are well done even though it's not very accurate in terms of actual buildings that exist at your set locations. It's more arcade like when it comes to that but the flying is really good! It's very responsive and fun to fly, especially if you calibrate your hotas before flying.

I know many mention and compare MSFS 2020, AEROFLY FS 2 & 4 and X-PLANE often and since I own all three I have a better idea of what each has to offer. They all have their strong suit but for me, flying in X-Plane 11 is really enjoyable! It sits perfectly between MSFS 2020 and AEROFLY FS 2 & 4 where you get a bit of everything a flight game has to offer. X-Plane 11 is really responsive on my system and I truly feel a sense of speed which I don't really get from the other two. 

I'm not a sim fanatic or anything like that, I'm simply a gamer whom enjoys escapism via casual gaming. With that said, upgrading my video card may greatly improve my experience with other titles so it's not so much that the other flight sims are not good, it's just that this one runs the best on my system for entertainment purposes.",1672193932,1672206923,True,3,0,0.558823525905609131,0,True,False,False

Like, just buy that game instead and you'll pretty much get the same experience with newer and improved graphics  (Though, there might be a lot more bugs in that game right now since it just released a few days ago). Or, buy Microsoft flight simulator 2020 instead, if your PC can run it. One thing that I dislike about this game is the lack of good air traffic control (ATC) in the game. Like, even in FSX there was ATC and that game is ancient. Most of the time you will just be relying on your FMC to do everything for you in autopilot, and programming the FMC is very time consuming. But, besides those complaints, I don't really have anything else to say. X-Plane 11 is great, but I personally wouldn't buy it in 2022 unless my PC couldnt run other flight sims.

I run a 3080 and with 4 addons (1 plane, ground handling, lula etc.) my fps is 5-20 (on max setting).  5fps is when I land at night.  20fps is when Im in cockpit zoomed into instrument panel.   Flight dynamics are great!  Stock planes are really bad (unfinished, lots features not working and def. No where near to real planes). You have to buy plane add-ons to learn the real thing ( around $100 per plane but they are awesome).     Graphics are not great at all, you will def not recognize where you are if you fly visually so immersion is meh.   But when you buy an add-on plane for around $100 from a 3rd party developer (don’t cheap out big difference)  awesome flight because everything works how it should.     Watch real pilot reviews online they compare x-plane to msfs and review different planes and how they work compared to the ones they fly in real life.      Also stay away from x-plane.org (check “trustpilot” reviews, sometimes x-plane.org claims they work with and help develop x-plane but they did not they just took the name and added .org.   They will not issue refunds or help and are very very rude site owners, but your add ons from different store.  They also tried to steal my personal info.    

I don’t recommend game but all that being said I started with a Cessna and now fly Airbus with full out flight plans and know the systems and it is fun, The only reason I don’t recommend is it’s gotten to a point where there is no immersion for me because of bad fps, add-ons eat more fps, x-plane.org ruined x-plane for me and I’m making a switch to MSFS after watching many pilot reviews about the Fenix and FBW A32NX (free add on). 

MSFS you can try for $1 on x-box live store for 30days.

Also many add ons for x-plane are free if u look hard enough

In reality, I'd give it a 4 out of 10.

Positive:
**********
- (seems to be) quite realistic (at least according to the ratings of people who like it)
- once you (theoretically) master it, it might actually give you a good overall feeling for flying in reality

But... the major drawbacks:
*******************************
- VERY difficult learning curve! After 2 hrs of trying, I haven't even managed ONE landing yet (not even an ugly one)
- tutorials (the ""Flight School"") are horribly unintuitive: Any instructions pop in suddenly as modal text popups, brutally pausing the game flow, thus bringing you out of concentration (trying to read, then steer, then read again and so on). Why the h.... couldn't they create some less intrusive AUDIO instructions, making this a bit more immersive??
- ran into a couple of obvious bugs (audio not initializing properly, spontaneous game crashes, erratic handling of keyboard input), which caused tons of unnecessary plane crashes
- changing game settings is completely confusing for me, as someone who doesn't have any knowledge about flight terminology (the latter not being explained at all). E.g., I haven't found out yet whether I can steer with keyboard keys instead of my mouse (hoping that this at last would give me a slightly more stable steering control)
- UI and overall handling of the game appear quite outdated (old-style UI elements, lots of technical junk, tedious loading times for comparably mid-level graphics)

My conclusion:
*****************
I tried to play this game as a ""flight newbie"", hoping to get some first feeling (assuming that this is what flight simulator GAMES should be offering). But it turns out that this is not the case. It rather seems some real-world simulator has been quickly transformed into a game (to make money from it). For advanced-level players, this might be exactly what they need.

I don't usually get motion sickness, in VR or IRL, but this game's VR support is so terrible I couldn't keep the headset on. Laminar reused the same camera animations from the desktop simulation, moving your viewpoint very quickly, tripping my brain up with unfelt but expected accelerations. But to make things much much worse, they also locked my viewpoint during these scenes! I've never felt vertigo like when I turned my head in this game and my view didn't change. I hope you like looking at your plane, because you literally can't look away!

I was able to tolerate this during the first tutorial flight, but when I loaded up the second, they spawned me in a taxiing Cesna with my view locked. The viewport was rocking back and forth with the Cesna, making it particularly bad. I should thank Laminar for this experience though, now I know what people have been complaining about when they talk about simulation sickness, so I'll be more empathetic to them.

Imagine going to flight school and your instructor doesn't show up but you're still expected to fly. Tutorial #1 you are thrown into the cockpit while in the air. No instructions are given but it doesn't take much to figure out how to control the plane and follow the flight guide. It's not the best tutorial but not a deal breaker...yet. Tutorial #2 is vomit inducing because its the only tutorial that makes your vr headset inverted. When you turn you head right the vr view goes left. I wasn't even in the air yet and wanted to puke. Tutorial# 3 once again throws you into the cockpit but you're grounded. No instructions and no text. If you've never flown a plane before good luck trying to figure out how to get it started. Only half the instruments that highlight green to indicate they're interactive actually work. Tutorial #4 you're in the air once again trying to learn how to land but the plane is frozen in time. There's a large green arrow on where to land but you're not moving. Once again no instructions and no text to guide you. Tutorial #5 is a mystery to me because I requested a refund before bothering. I know XPlane 12 is out but I'll spend that $ on MFS. If this game functioned I may have been interested in the sequel but I say good day XPlane.

Don't get me wrong, this game is OK, but there are some aspects that need improvement, considering its original price which around 60 dollars (RM169) (but now its cheaper RM51 since X-plane 12 about to be released). I also understand that this is more like a ""simulation"" than a ""game"", thus this is why I give it a thumbs down:

1- ATC
the atc sounds like robot, and its slow tempo. Its a shame that FSX, a flight sim thats released 10+ YEARS AGO, has better atc than this.

2- Ground Services and Jetway
for this price (RM169), I expected some working ground services and jetways. Guess what? there are only a few ""living airports"" that have ground service. Jetway are almost none, well I know you could buy dlc or even get freeware on the internet, but for this price i think they should add it into the game, no? And this is where FSX comes in, again. FSX is wayyy cheaper than this, and it has all of it.

3- DLCs and NavData
The dlcs are overpriced, and in order to have the FMCs working, you'll need to update the Navdata monthly, with websites like navigraph, in which you have to pay.

Its a shame that this game could be beaten by FSX, a flight sim that's released 10 years earlier than this. Other than what i listed, the sim is ok, the plane models are accurate, the sceneries.",1662443868,1662711969,False,2,2,0.480419844388961792,0,True,False,False

You can fly nearly anywhere on earth, because the game uses Open Street Map. But don't expect something like Google Earth. But for me it's enough.

I'm not an amateur pilot, but the grade of simulation is relatively high. Depending on the aircraft you fly, you need to understand at least the principles of electrics and avionics. But there are many Youtube videos to show you how it's done.

You definitely need a 4+ axis joystick. Best would be a HOTAS system.

I tried the VR mode, but that's nothing I could recommend. The game is not optimized for this functionality.

I want to leave this here as a testament in time, as a thank you to the software, the developers behind it, the pilots who flew and the amazing community with the myriad of freeware/payware add-ons from simple utilities to complex aircraft. All of you have contributed your bit to make my experience (and everyone's experience) a thing to remember.

You will not get the crispiest graphics, you will not get the most optimized performance, you will probably find default assets bland and uninspired but feel pride in having this sim installed in your hard drive, because once it was the best home flight simulator of all time, the king to reign them all.

The amount of freeware plugins, beautiful scenery such as ZeroDollarPayware makes the game worth it alone. When you buy this game, expect to spend more on plugins, aircraft and such. The aircraft that are available for XP might not be comparable to FSLabs, but some GA planes available such as the CL650 are out of this world detailed.

For some background, I am a private pilot and I have around 150 hours of flight time.   Almost all my hours have been in the Cessna 172.  I've also flown the Cessna 182.  I think this experience has given me a good amount of understanding on how a plane should handle in the air. 

Flight simulation was actually what got me into aviation and inspired me to fly in real life.  I played flight simulators all throughout my childhood but I really got into it in 2015.   I was in high school and I would save up money for hardware.  I found three old Ipads and set them up to make a virtual cockpit.  Soon, I had a full home cockpit.  I was putting hundreds of hours on FSX with planes like the PMDG 737.  I loved the thought of being an airline pilot and it became my life's goal. 

In 2016 X-Plane 11 released in public beta.  I had never tried any X-Plane title and I decided to pick it up.  At first I really didn't love it.  I thought the flight model was spongy and it didn't feel as stiff as FSX.  The graphics were also a downgrade and the game did not run well on my PC.  (This was only really a beta problem, the game runs fine now).  I ended up going back to FSX for the time being. 

In 2017 I began flight training.  I was doing it on top of high school and at first I was only going every two weeks.  As I learned how to fly in real life, X-Plane became an excellent tool for learning.  In FSX, the default Cessna was not nearly as good as the X-Plane one.  This is really what pushed me to switch to X-Plane.  Before every real flight, I would completely replicate what we were going to go over in X-Plane.  I would follow checklist procedures and had my kneeboard on to write fake taxi instructions.  As I flew in real life, I began to realize how organic the flight model in X-Plane 11 felt.  The sponginess I felt was because there was no air resistance on the yoke or rudder pedals.  (I've come to learn this is an issue in every flight simulator).  Other than this, the flight model is superb and surpasses most other simulators on the market. 
 including Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020.  X-Plane 11 was with me every step of the way until my checkride in 2020. 

Nowadays, I only ever use X-Plane for VR procedure flights in big airliners.  The VR support in this game is the best of the best in the flight sim world.  Flight simulation has become more of a casual thing rather than a serious hobby.  The huge home cockpit I built is mostly dismantled as I never really have the drive to use it all anymore.  College has really changed my goals in life and I am no longer pursuing aviation as a career.  I still stay deeply connected to the aviation world and have made many friends through flying. 

Here's the bottom line, as much as people say X-Plane is only for the serious flight simmer, it isn't.  You can have tons of fun with this game.  Sure it's not too flashy without some addons but there is a ton of free content provided by the community that can make this game beautiful.  Even with being nearly 6 years old, it is much better than it's competition.  MSFS 2020 has been a major disappointment to me and I barely ever use it but that's a story for another day.  I know this has been a bit of a rambling review, but here's to the future of X-Plane as a series.

Combined with Vatsim (or any other online platform - Ivao, etc.) you reach an environment as real as it gets to the real thing and from time to time you might find that real pilots will join you to maintain their good practice.
Don't try to compare it with other simulators, everyone of them has its highs and lows, and if someone tells you that this one or that one is best, they are biased. For me, if you want the best flight model and simulation, buy this one; if you are looking for the best visuals (aircraft and sceneries) buy MSFS.

The flight physics and cockpit detail are top-notch and and I love bargain deals for people who want to fly on IVAO without having to pay so much just to go with P3D. Laminar Research has come a long way and I can only wish the best for those guys, and I hope the guys from LR do not take this review personally as the negativity is not directed towards them.

The negativity is directed towards the add-on developers and the majority of the community members. Unfortunately, in order to make X-Plane viable for commercial flights, you'll need to install a lot of add-on's, and the one drawback of X-Plane is that it's not a stable platform that can support a lot of add-on's without crashing, and if an add-on plugin or aircraft fails? Well, good luck trying to get support on those, 'cause from my personal experience, I've only dealt with toxicity after toxicity from the X-Plane community. Those guys have a long-proud tradition of calling anyone they disagree with trolls, and then banning people from the Discord servers. Your mileage may vary of course, but from my standpoint, this is a major turnoff.

If that wasn't bad enough, unfortunately, aircraft choices are limited. Your only REAL choices in terms of aircraft are either the Zibo 737NG, ToLiss A320/A340 family or FlightFactor 767's. The 777 V2 and 787 are being developed by FlightFactor; however, considering the toxic community base, my advice to you is not to hold your breath as the community will refuse to help those who struggle with the aircraft addons even if they are caused by legitimate reasons.

So what alternatives are out there? Well, unfortunately, not much. P3D is overpriced and is extremely unstable in terms of the platform, and it's starting to lose support from its developers. MSFS2020 has poor aircraft physics (Like seriously, WHOSE IDEA WAS IT TO MAKE CHEESECAKES FLY IN MSFS2020?! DO THEY EVEN GET REALISM RIGHT?!) and it'll take months if not years before the available aircraft fleet in MSFS2020 will mature.

People once told me that ""these are great times to be flying on flight sims."" Well, at least in my case anyway, it turned out to be a load of BS. Don't give into that scam. I did, and wasted too much money in the process to the point where this year, that's already a disaster on its own, has been ruined further.

Yes, X-Plane 12 is coming out soon; however, if I were you, I'd have serious second thoughts about going into it considering the toxic community base.

I've used sims before and have my own stick and peddles, so this isn't my first rodeo. I got this installed and called my young daughter over to show her the joy of flying. After calibrating the controls we loaded our first flight and saw... a view of the front seat from 1 cm away. That we couldn't change.

Okay, its cool, lets reload the flight.

""You can't! There is no option to restart in any of the visible menus!""

Okay, fine, we'll restart the program. Now, new flight, load and...

""You're controls are unresponsive! Also, throttle is set to drive you off the runway and crash!""

Okay, so when the plane is on fire, then the option to reset shows up. Great. Now, I already calibrated the controls, so I'll do it again.

""You can't calibrate the controls! Because reasons!""

... Okay FINE, reset the program AGAIN. Now, load program, calibrate joystick, load a mission... 

""Throttle response is normal! You're not looking at the ass of the seat from 1 cm away! Aren't you proud of our amazing software??!""

Fine, can we please take off now?

""No, because the controls are unresponsive to pitch! Here comes that wall again!""

My daughter giggling in the background as I grind my teeth. 

Yeah. Having software that does All The Things ever with Amazing Graphics is cool and all, but if your flight sim turns into a go-cart simulator because the controls are ass backwards and you spend half your 'flights' with your head wedged between the seat cushions, maybe fix that first? This feels like an Alpha build, nevermind anything more polished. 

Other reviews generally proport good things, so I imagine I'll probably get the software to do the job it's built to EVENTUALLY,  but just understand that if you buy this you're on the hook to do much more configuration than is necessary for your average flight sim : /

You could always stick with the classics like Microsoft Flight Simulator X (FSX), but what if you want something that can fully take advantage of your new gaming rig or high-end graphics card?

This is where Laminar Research comes in with their next-gen X-Plane 11 Global Flight Simulator—a modern take on flight sims built for more current hardware. While many popular flight simulators are starting to show their age, X-Plane 11 is a breath of fresh air in the genre, and a breathtaking one at that. Read our review below to see how the latest X-Plane release stacks up against classics like FSX. "" 

As lifewire puts it this game is still one of the greatest simulators out there I would say although it doesn't have the best graphics compared to msfs 2020 it still has the best physcics after p3d but again the price difference is enough to justify the very subtle difference in physics modeling. If you do have a good system please wait for xplane 12 that should come out in a few days but if not with a couple of add-ons xplane 11 will do you wonders.",1658870616,1658870616,True,5,0,0.52880173921585083,0,True,False,False

If you want to get familiar with flying and the controls and learn what all the buttons in a cockpit do and mean, then I think this is a good program for that, I would not call it a game. The scenery is not good, So much paid dlc makes me think its a money mill. SF CA had like maybe 9 buildings, Santa Fe, none. Once you get the hang of it the planes control systems can do most of the work for you, so, whats left, look out the window at poor scenery. I spend hours sometimes looking at google earth, and If you want to site see I suggest you go look at google for free. This is about flying imo and not much else. If you want to spend hundreds of dollars on controls and feel like driving is not enough work for you then here ya go. I would rather look out the window instead of being behind the stick of a plane. This imo is not for fun, especially if your gonna mouse fly, imo it is very hard and not at all realistic using a mouse, so to make it feel more like work and not luck you can buy real controls, then you can be like a working pilot who makes no money and has no goals but to understand what buttons to use to make the plane do all the work. 

If I was going to learn to fly I would spend a ton of time on this and get as familiar as I could the the cockpit functions and what flying a plane is like. I do not plan on learning so this was a waste of money for me. Good learning tool. Buy it on sale if you have never played any flight games, pay full price if you want to learn about planes. If you dont mind spending money on games, I would gear up and get a nice set up and buy both this and MS. American truck is a ton more fun imo.

If you're new to sims, this may or may not be a casual experience for you. 
The world scenery isn't that too well-detailed, so this isn't much for VFR flying.
The ATC leaves a lot to be desired, understandably. Other sims do a decent job of implementing ATC.
Not all airports will be detailed, or updated... hence this is where freeware/payware addons come in.

Where it really shines (as with other flightsims) is how you want to modify your flightsim, whether freeware and/or payware aircraft/scenery/utility addons.

I recommend this for getting into the basics of flying.
I don't recommend this for VFR flying unless you have a lot of time and PC storage (downloading and storing Orthophotos, basically satellite images of the world).
I highly recommend it for procedures and basic IFR flying.

Is this flight sim worth it in 2022, graphic wise if you don't spend money on scenery's, fs2020 beats it by a mile. There are some freeware mods like ortho4xp but takes a lot of time and storage. The flying part of this game is really good, I feel that planes move more realistically then fs2020, coming from someone who flies a real plane (PA28-161). The Zibo 737 mod (freeware) puts the expectations of the PMDG 737 in fs2020 really high. but back to the part if you should buy this or not. Yes if its on sale, with the sim being 5 years old I don't think this game is worth $60 if it is on sale and your reading this the only reason I would say no is because X-plane 12 in coming up and should be out mid to late 2022 or might be out when you read this and  if that's the case then go buy X-plane 12 not 11.",1641635203,1655834219,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Physics: 5/5, the physics are study level, there is a physics model so you can see thermals, drag, etc. Even approved by the FAA for a simulation model.

Scenery: 3.5/5, if you get some good scenery packs and sky enhancements it's DEFINETLY 5/5

lag: 3/5 For Low-End devices it's very laggy, however on a gaming laptop/computer it doesn't lag on max graphics settings. Expect FPS drops!!!

Plane selection: 4/5, the planes are super nice and there is quite a selection, but you get Boeing only,gotta buy Airbus yourself.

Airport selection:5/5, There are all airports that you can think of,except for smaller regional ones,but you can download them. Sadly, most of them are copy and paste buildings and none of the default ones have working jetways.

Controls: 4/5, the game uses mouse controls and you gotta select buttons yourself, but of course it supports USB joysticks.
Price: 5/5 , it's worth the price, never gets boring. 



Problem for laptops or PC's that aren't made for games: If you have bad memory and Graphic cards etc. , you will have to wait a minimum of 5 MINUTES to load in a plane, as said, the framerate is bad if you put the graphics to like medium. I recommend to take a look at the requirements before downloading. 

Other: The game takes A LOT OF TIME TO DOWNLOAD, it took me 8 hours. You should let it download at night if you want to play it the next day. 



Rating: 4.5 / 5

Overall: I love the game so much! It is great physics wise, realistic plane models, awesome different settings and visuals, it's simply the buildings that are very lazy. However, with free plugins like Enhanced Cloudscapes, Gandalf Skycolors, HD trees, Ortho4Xp, X-Europe, X-America, etc. you can get awesome graphics that make it look somewhat better than MFS2020. 

Thanks so much for this great simulator.

As of right now, I have had it for just over a year and I can't think of one time where I uninstalled it. It is just overall great. The default graphics are not good though, and if you want your game to look decent it will require some mods. Although the default graphics are not good, the physics and system depth is great especially if you're like me not willing to pay the money for P3D. I will say you need some better planes than just using the default ones, but there are some good free ones like the Zibo 737-800 and a good payware one which I have is the ToLiss A319 or A321, and if you're into Boeing then I would suggest the Flight Factor 757 or 767, but not the 777. After you pick out some good payware planes, you're good. I would suggest doing some research before buying your planes as I would not want you to just go with the cheapest, because in the flight sim world it is rare for the cheaper plane to be the better one. The most expensive are usually the best ones.

My final conclusion is that if you are into IFR flying and flying airliners, X-Plane 11 is the simulator for you. If you value graphics and VFR General Aviation flying, Microsoft Flight Sim 2020 is the simulator for you.

Edit: after 300ish hour the games is great im gonna do some pros and cons
Pros:
-The flight physics are great and realistic
-Its not to heavy to run(depends on your setting)
-alot of realistic 3rd party planes
-it is more stable and have less to no bugs  than mfs 2020 
cons:
-scenery: the scenery  is autogen and kinda outdated  but i let this one slide because laminar is a small team than asobo who is  own by microsoft(which means they have their own satelite for streaming data and stuff) but yeah the only ways to fixed it is using ortho but that can take alot of your storage as well or you can use sim heaven scenery still good but sometimes the building is not identical to the real thing
-graphics: the graphics well.. yeah but this gonna get fixed when xplane 12 came out
-the weather: its great but it is annoying the weather got randomly loaded when your flying but this issue gonna get fixed when xplane 12 came out
-atc:the atc is kinda good but it sucks(gonna get fixed and added lot of feature as well  when xplane 12 came out)
-no animated jetways: yeah you hear me out but this gonna get fixed  in xplane 12 or if you buy sam jetways now which i think cost around  20 bucks idk i dont live in the us

I can't access my online screenshots.  Nor is there any option to store pics/videos locally (i.e. on my own computer).  Managing ""DLC"" all I get is more commercials instead of game settings and possible upgrades which are missing. They are available on the net but not through Steam apparently.  

Will they be supported and fixed automatically if I add free Ortho scenery from a 3rd party?  
Will the file ordering be automatically fixed by Steam?  
Because for the consumer that is the only major draw for becoming embedded into this network which controls all game play.   Where are the extra content links and setup menus for my games?  Why aren't all options presented in a logical fashion?  Why can't I even copy this review  text?  Why can't I access my desktop at any point using alt+esc?  This is a bug and not a feature. Steam.

I played the game for about 15 min, but Steam shows 76 min play time.

I already have a lot invested in 32-bit Microsoft FSX with extensive photo-real scenery, many aftermarket addons, REX, and EZ-Dok camera. It still is a lot of fun.  Memory balancing and optimization is a major problem though and the quality of various addons differs greatly.  While I still love that game I wanted so much more for my higher-end system and went with X-Plane. 

Playing X-Plane for the first time after downloading for two full days, one flaw is obvious: You can't access Settings Menu(graphics/aircraft/weather/etc) without quitting and re-starting the entire game.  WTF?  At $60+tax for an older game the price is a bit steep to begin with, but from online videos it has the potential to look absolutely incredible especially with Ortho photo-real scenery.  Steam doesn't show that option in the GUI.  All of the possible upgrades are localized and become very expensive quickly when it all adds up. That is to be expected from an a-la-carte business structure.  The starter aircraft selection is very limited.  Buy what you want or need for any given area.  Enjoy.  Purchase more as time goes by.  I get it.

Increasing my graphic settings to Max resulted in an environment only slightly better than default FSX scenery from way back in 2004.  Buildings are missing and roads looks like broken black spaghetti.  There was some rendering problem right off the bat and the dashboard for the OEM 172 turned into 'great green globs of greasy grimy gopher guts' (i.e. bumping up the graphics turned the dash controls into lumpy lime-green squares).  That is not a good indicator when the default game is used 'out of the box'. And it should never happen with a proven game.  I expected much more.
 
I'm not a lawyer, but a quick read of the EULA indicated at a glance the OEM says the distributor is responsible and they are under English law and limitations are a grand blah blah blah typical legalese stuff.  
So what happens when basic problems like this happen?  Download ""fixes"" from some 3rd party forums?  

I don't mean to knock the game entirely.  The X-Plane OEM default environment is consistent and very acceptable for any basic flight sim who at least want  basic coverage for the entire world.  But it should have been a whole lot more to start off with for the lofty purchase price.  
It did not run at full capacity without modifications...and it should have.

The game only runs at 30-40 fps on my computer. 
I have a Rysen7, GTX 2080 Super, 48GB RAM, Gigabyte MB, liquid cooling, etc. 

Q:  Where are the advanced settings options so I can fully tweek the game?  
A:  They are missing. Both in-game and on Steam.",1653491266,1653528577,False,1,0,0.485842108726501465,22,True,False,False

Awesome mechanics, awesome VR integration, and it runs at decent fps levels in VR!!!  MS Flight Sim is too rough to play in VR unless you have a 3080 or something beefy.  But Xplane was decent enough on my 1660ti.  On my 3070ti, it's really good.  And the cocpit is AMAZING,  Like 99% of everything you see, works like it should!!!!

Don't get me wrong, it has it's flaws like all other flight simulators and everyone has their favorite, mine is now XP11.  There's several reasons but I will list the main one.
-Flight physics are far superior and more realistic than any other flight sim out there.  Even taxing is more realistic.  This is the main reason I bought it, and not for just airplanes but also helicopters.  I've always wanted to fly realistic feeling helicopters and there are some very good ones for XP11.  It's a thrilling challenge.  All aircraft in XP11 have their own unique feel and personality, something other flight simulators have sometimes struggled with.  For me better physics makes flying so much more fun and interesting.

Yes the graphics of the X-Plane 11 world are not impressive to say the least but there's some really great add-ons you can buy (there's also a free worldwide mesh) to make everything from the autogen buildings, to the trees to the airports and everything else outside your cockpit window look a lot better.  The default aircraft look ok visually but there are some very beautifully done 3rd party aircraft that look spectacular inside and out.

Overall, it's a great simulator, especially if you're willing to put some money into it.  Unfortunately that is the case with all flight simulators though.",1651958464,1651958464,True,2,0,0.537454009056091309,0,True,False,False

X-Plane 11 is (still) the best plattform for flightsimulation
that ships with limited default content.

PRO:
+ realism
+ realistic & probably the best flightmodel
+ nice graphics & nice clouds
+ great interface & gameplay
+ lots of free community add-on content with easy copy & paste installation,
   some of it in payware quality, like the ""Zibo Mod""
+ it never gets boring
+ helpful and competent Community
+ flued performance thanks to *NEW* Vulkan rendering!!

CONTRA:

- unfinished native planes (""Columbia 400""...)
- no coop multiplayer (like  shared cockpit)
- poor dedault (offline) ATC
- Native FMC is unsatisfying (important pages missing...).
- King Air C90B, bad handling
  Autopilot-Panel can't be brought up as a separate window.
- G1000 offers NDB (morse-code) monitoring but no possibility to tune in the frequency.

- no shortcut to set local QnH
- no shortcut to readback last transmissiono (ATC)

- small in-game map excerpts
- no in-game word map
- no ingame web-browser

- not propper jetways
- no seasons

Suggestions:

- implement Ortho4XP
- finish Columbia 400, bring the Baron with a G1000
- release Cessna in 3 versions: Bendix AP, new & G1000
- improve handling of good native planes like King Air C90
- add shortcuts (readback last transmission, set local QnH...)
- add Option to end current flight
- add Indication of mainpages on right display of G1000
- add Option to tune in NDB in G1000
- map-up button (on G1000 in ""map track up"") should move map up, not north!
- always keep aspect ratio when rezisizing G1000

COMPARISON:Probably some of the best heli dynamics in a sim! I have IRL experience and 2 siblings that fly heli's for a living also gave their feedback. It could save thousands in basic training with proper, linear, full sim controls. The only thing found lacking was auto rotations as they felt more like a plane, but that could be down to the model I was using (MD 500e...my dad used to be a 500d pilot so seeing if they got the model accurate for it is the next test when i see him and will update accordingly. It feels like I remember but he will know for sure). 
Unlike DCS, the controls don't have that few milliseconds of delay, which makes flying linear full sim controls in X-Plane a lot more real. 
Some amazing paid heli add on, scenery/mesh, as well as a mission generator are available. Honestly a great Sim experience that focus' on flying skill rather than blasting enemies out of the sky with heat seeking missiles....although there's an add on for that too, if you fancy a fiery ball of PPL and CPL pilots off the runway or out of your airspace !!!
GRAPHICS REQUIREMENTS: If you're doing VR you will need a beast of a machine to make it look any good. just so you have some reference- 1 Suprim x 3090 with overclocks isn't enough. 2 GPU's would be required to make *everything* maxed out. CPU side of graphics is fine maxed out with OC'd 5950x, plenty headroom.

A year after FS2020's launch, it still doesn't have basic VR functionality for all default aircraft and where is does work-ish, it turns the experience into more of 3D rendering of a mouse-clicking game and still requires you to interact with immersion-killing menu overlays. XP11 handles all of this on the actual controller hands and when activated, they go wherever the controllers go, which is rarely right in front of your face out the windscreen.

XP11's VR also let's you teleport, which is a feature worth discussing all on its own. I can literally walk outside some of my aircraft (with click-toggle tags) and preflight the aircraft in VR before moving back inside. It's also very easy to set up preset teleport locations relative to an aircraft, so on those long haul flights, it's very easy to slip back to the cabin and look out any window you want. In the included 747, you can actually even walk around the lower level. Unreal. So much fun. Nothing remotely close to this in FS2020, where console seems to be the focus and why not ($$$).

Performance is no contest. XP11 couldn't be further ahead in this area. Vulkan make it much smoother in and out of VR. FS2020 crashes routinely and if you're in VR, you better have borrowed a machine from NASA even to have a shot at completing a flight. I'm running an i9-9900K, EVGA RTX 3090 FTW3 Ultra, 32GB of speedy ram, 1TB m.2 SSD and many other goodies and they aren't close to enough to wrestle through a flight in FS2020 on the absolute lowest graphics settings without severe stuttering, tearing and, well, since the graphics are bottomed-out, terrible images.

When it comes to extras, such as live traffic, XP11 has a couple solid lightweight free plugins that accomplish exactly what FS2020 is touting and I think the XP11 plugins actually work better (they provide some customization of this feature as well).

Neither has universal shared cockpit, although some specific XP11 aircraft do support that on their own, and multiplayer is achievable in both, but this is the one place that really makes FS2020 worth trying. It's built-in and that streamlines the process, which XP11 has yet to do.

As for the graphics on the ground, yes, the Bing mapping does take some of the grunt work out of getting detail on the ground in FS2020, although it's still possible to get pretty close to the same thing for those willing to learn how to do it and be patient enough to follow through the process in XP11. It's worth noting FS2020 is enormous in size and without a solid internet connection, the experience is really diminished. XP11 wins here too.

The third-party mods are starting to come around, slowly, for FS2020, although there are just bugs up and down and all over the place, where X-plane's healthy hangar of mods is much more stable and the higher-priced payware is pretty rock solid.

I still have FS2020 installed, but I'll be making my flights in XP11 and hopefully soon, XP12.",1647463474,1647463474,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm a casual flight simmer, have been for years. My first was Microsoft Flight Simulator 3.0, and I had every FS up to FSX. I loved the feeling of immersion you got with FSX, especially, what with all the AI traffic and a halfway decent out-of-the-box ATC. You didn't need to mod it to get a great sim experience.

XP11 is the exact opposite of that. If you are using it for anything other than flying in and out of uncontrolled airports, you're going to feel like you're missing something. Without extensive modding (most of which are paid mods), you will be lacking in any meaningful air traffic, and hampered by a lacking ATC with what little traffic there is. 

Sure, the flight models are pretty great (except for the helicopter model, which is just broken), and graphically it's better-than-decent. But the complete lack of any other life in the air just completely breaks the illusion.

Additionally, the DLC is all outrageously expensive. If one were to buy all the pay airports and aircraft, you'd be spending hundreds of dollars piecing together the complete package.

If any devs/producers are reading this: I'll not be buying any more Laminar Research products until you focus a little on a better world-building experience with air traffic and an acceptable ATC, otherwise you're only releasing half a simulator. I'll just stick with FS for now.

Update: I gave the sim a few months, tried (and ditched) some free add-ons, and did more playing with the Vulkan rendering engine. It somehow has gotten worse... texture management is broken, ATC is still broken, the visual rendering is still silly (massive power lines, extremely unrealistic trees, broken road and water systems). The flight model of the simpler aircraft is pretty decent, but not great. Still absolutely cannot recommend it...I really hope XP12 offers something better so that MSFS has some real competition.",1583079876,1645637489,False,82,12,0.6333962082862854,9,True,False,False

By that I mean, installing the correct mods, reshade, ortho for yourself. This sim is no eye candy like MSFS, but it's physics are beyond amazing and will never be beaten by MSFS. Cannot wait for X-Plane 12, it'll dominate MSFS. X-Plane 11 freeware is amazing, it's a simulator you can buy and play! Install Zibo/Level up, livery, ortho, freeware airport, reshade and boom you're more than ready to be able to sim everyday. It's all free. MSFS has got a lot to improve to compare to X-Plane 11, especially the way X-Plane 12 is coming faster than you think. 

Vanilla X-Plane :

Graphics - 5/10
Physics - 10/10
Aircrafts - 7/10
Airports - 4/10
Optimization - 10/10

-

Modded X-Plane 11 :

Graphics - 8/10
Physics - 20/10
Aircrafts - 9/10, missing a few modern long haulers that are study level.
Airports - 9/10, can be high quality
Optimization - 10/10, usually can be 5 FPS difference only

most of the planes are terrible at texture , 3D cockpit not available and button texts are unreadable , some of the keys are not simulated .

trying to download new planes and also improving simulation experience by installing plugins , wouldn't help as most of the planes are designed to work only with joystick and etc ...

i think there are better flight simulators than this , such as DCS or MFS ( haven't tried neither of them )

also there aren't some real life things, like alive airport & passengers and also there is no collision defined  , you can pass through buildings and other planes

there is no plane destruction simulation and the planes have unreal physics ...

in general , if you have a very good system and a joystick and you are the person of searching and installing different plugins , which takes several hours , you might like this simulator .

Simply put, the cost of getting a realistic 737 model for FSX (like PMDG) is the same as the cost of this sim, which has the added benefit of having an excellent realistic base 737 and a free ""zibo mod"" for added realism and all the other stuff I cited.

This simulator is brilliant for many reasons, one reason is the ability to fly to any airport you want on this planet with default airports being up to an acceptable level of detail which is more than enough to fly into. Another reason this simulator is so great is because of the fact of how much you can mod it to work pretty much like real life. There is a whole forum for X-Plane 11 where you can download custom sceneries for airports to fly into that are more accurate on building and taxiways than the default airports which are still very accurate. You can also buy study level aircraft from the X-Plane forum store, Threshold store and X-Aviation. And installing all these addons is extremely easy. You can also modify the way the simulator looks with all skycolours from night to dusk to midday to dawn and the cloud texture to. You can also create satellite imagery for the ground, using Ortho4XP, to make it look identical to real life on the ground.

Overall, I recommend this sim 110% over the likes of MSFS and Prepar3D which are still sims with flaws and being very expensive to not even get on the same level as X-Plane 11",1641083128,1641083128,True,22,1,0.718372523784637451,0,True,False,False

Overall the game is quite good with few hiccups. When first getting the game I was planning on visiting landmarks however, I was quite shocked by was the fact that some landmarks were missing from X Plane 11's scenery, for example the CN Tower in Toronto is missing. Another issue is that major cities only have a few skyscrapers. I guess all isn't that bad on the scenery side after all major landmarks like the Statue of Liberty and Eiffel Tower are present. Besides scenery the game works well and I would refer to it as a high-end simulator. Me being new to flight sims I would recommend this game to you but, would definitely suggest checking out the new Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 that is being released on August 18, 2020, it's Standard package is only 7 CAD more than the cost of this game - X Plane 11.

Edit: I haven't experienced anymore crashes. Although now with MSFS 2020 out I sometimes struggle to come back to it. I would hesitate to recommend picking it up, especially because X-Plane 12 is going to be released soon.

PROS:
Flight model as accurate or more so than other sims as far as can be told
Default content (planes, scenery) is quite decent, no complaints from me, though you may find otherwise depending on your desires
Tons of 3rd party content is available for free or pay from high quality sources
Active Discord server available, for the most part, fast responses when help or advise is needed.

CONS:
Default ATC is NEEDS to be drug tested. On numerous occasions, I've been guided in low visibility to fly directly into mountains. 
After crashing due to bad ATC instruction, the ATC actually BANS you from their airspace, which I find hilarious. Advice given by the community is to not use the default ATC. Just double check your maps on your own.
Default ATC LOVES to repeat themselves, each time requiring a read-back of the last transmission. VERY UNFORTUNATELY the only way to do this is to click the mouse on a button in a small window that has nothing to do with the plane control interface, and completely breaks the immersion. Also, this causes you to have to either get good with your opposite hand at clicking the mouse or just turn it off. THERE IS NO WAY TO RESPOND TO ATC VIA HOTKEY!
Not much default content, only a few planes available with the default installation.
Flight manuals available for the planes are sparse and contain incomplete startup procedures. You will have to try to find independent aircraft flight manuals, or you will probably have some problems during the flight. One that immediately comes to mind is the King Air C90 fuel system. It requires tanks transfers to the nacelle, but the operators manual does not tell you how to do this and it seems to work a little funny.

Don't let the longer list of CONS be an indicator of the quality of the simulator. Most of the cons are simply tweaks that need to be made to default ATC instructions and the ability to communicate with them via hotkey, so that you can respond without using the mouse. See DCS A10 simulator for a good working example of this.

Overall: I do recommend this as a great simulator and I will use it when not flying combat missions in Georgia.",1639675016,1639675016,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Overall physics are great for training. New clouds and shaders are looking amazing, weather simulation feels good as well.
The terrain could benefit greatly from aerial images, the land class system looks very repetitive and flat. Buildings and streets with animated vehicles make up for it though.

The sound of the 737 is outstanding and a joy to listen to. The other aircraft should also get updated to this new sound model.

The autopilot and flight management should be made more realistic. Especially VNAV in the 737 shouldn't engage thrust on the ground and should never change selected altitude or vertical speed.

I know that I have very little hours at the time of this review, but feel that I have enough time to make a good review of this product. This is without a doubt the flight simulator to buy if you want the most realistic flight dynamics and models currently out in my opinion. MSFS feels to arcade-like and that was the reason for buying X-Plane 11. The graphics are nothing to write home about, but they will do. If you want the best graphics some money is going to be dropped on this simulator, but I suggest MSFS if you like VFR flying. The default aircraft are better than MSFS and the FREE 737 Zibo mod that you can download for X-Plane feels like it should be payware. The Payware aircraft that you can get from Toliss, FlightFactor, InIBuild and so many more beat anything that MSFS has hands down.

TLDR: If you want the best flight simulator and can give up the bing maps scenery that MSFS 2020 has, this game is for sure worth a buy!",1638300517,1638300517,True,30,0,0.698233962059020996,0,True,False,False

This is the best flight *SIMULATOR* on the market currently with so much aircraft to choose from and some amazing developers and airplanes. The night lighting really sticks out and you can get a bunch of freeware to make this game look amazing. (Ex. Enhanced cloudscapes, Zibo 737, 737-700 and 900U, mSparks 747, etc.) There is so much to do in this game and it really pumps me up for X-Plane 12. Just had my first crash out of about 61 hours of flight time in this game, so unless you're running on a really low end computer, then you should be fine in terms of crashing. 

Optimization: The optimization in this game is ok. I'm running on a R7-3700x and an RTX 3070 with 16GB of RAM (Note there are background tasks that you do have to keep in mind of when playing). This game takes a good chunk out of my RAM usage. However, I do get good frames when using ReShade RTX and max graphics. Although, if you're running on a low end PC, I highly recommend saving up and getting a new, more powerful PC before buying if you're planning on it. Or, if you want to try, this game offers a free demo that you can use via their website. Just search on Google: ""XP11 demo version"", and you can still add mods but you will only get to play for like 30 minutes at a time. 

Overall: I'd give this game an 8/10, it is an amazing simulator which I hopefully plan on using for flight training and has an amazing community with lots of developers and integration of multiplayer (Ex. VATSIM or Pilotedge). It may not have the best optimization in the world however it really sticks out in the flight sim community so if you're debating on a SIMULATOR to buy between XP11 and FS2020, choose XP11.",1638138089,1638138089,True,9,0,0.570226788520812988,0,True,False,False

X-Plane (with Vulkan enabled) performs SO much better.  It also takes less time to load and frame rates stay consistent.

However, this game is really for people who are into flight sim.  If you're a casual player and trying to decide which one, then get MSFS.  It is better out of the box.  If you are hardcore flight sim addict and/or love modding games, then this is your choice.

For mods, I suggest: Ortho4XP, Enhanced Skyscapes, Active Sky Weather and A Better Camera.  For planes, I highly suggest the Toliss A340 (payware) and the Zibo Mod 737-800 (free).",1637089255,1637089255,True,49,1,0.823541045188903809,0,True,False,False

I strongly recommend this product both for the completeness of the flight model and for the community that you have around it.
As most of the flight simulators currently on the market, with this product you are not purchasing a game but a way to simulate aircraft flight in the most complete way. You will therefore have to study real aircraft manuals just to turn on the engine and to perform your first take off and touch and go which will make the learning curve quite steep for a casual user.

It is therefore recommended to all people who have a passion for flight and are looking for a way to have a complete simulated experience.
Being a simulator means that all the actions are in real time, with real flight durations and real reactions. In order to get the best it is therefore recommended to have at least a joypad or a flight stick and foresee some long playing sessions.

I switched to X-Plane a few weeks ago from being a die hard MS flight simmer since the last 20 years! All was going well with FS2020, till Update 5, after which there were CTD's every time on loading....which led me to be grounded.

So! I decided to try out X-Plane and get back to the skies :)

After spending a good amount of time getting to ""know the X-Plane product"", I am now enjoying many ""CTD free"" flights with an experience in a realistic aircraft, having a detailed Cold & dark start + the checklists + FMC etc, etc.

Yes! Nobody can dispute the difference in the graphics ...ground imaging, clouds and aircraft external appearance with FS2020, as X-Plane really has to catch up in those areas. The ATC is also way behind FS2020.

But on the other hand....the aircraft (cockpit functionality) is better in X-Plane and the feel is more realistic.....not considering the graphics as mentioned earlier. 

If X-Plane could improve on the Land Graphics, Clouds and external aircraft looks (like FS2020), this would be the Simulator to have for the Serious Flight Simmers who like to treat it as a Flight Simulator and ""NOT"" a game to play.

I'm still new to X-Plane and I'm sure there's a lot to learn, but for a person like me who loves serious flight simulation, I would strongly recommend this product. Yes! FS2020 was great....till it stopped working after the 27th JUL update, and nobody seems to know how to fix it. For people who want to spend time flying rather than time on trying to fix the numerous CTD's......X-Plane is it :)

As Leonardo Da Vinci said....""For once you have tasted flight you will walk the earth with your eyes turned skywards, for there you have been and there you will long to return"".

Looking forward to improvements in X-plane to make it the ultimate Flight Simulator :)",1636390738,1636390738,True,13,0,0.679082870483398438,0,True,False,False

X-Plane, like many other flight sims, and flightsimming as a hobby in general, is quite expensive.

Since the Vulkan update in XP, the VR performance experience is simply the best you can get in a civilian sim.  You do, however, need to be willing to spend time modding--especially with Ortho textures--to get this sim up to its best.   I've taken enough flying lessons IRL to land a plane with instructor hands off; so I have a decent sense of what it feels like.  Currently, in A/B tests with MSFS, using a combination of physical Yoke (Honeycomb), pedals, Knobster, and virtual control of thrust, switches, and buttons, XP feels much closer to what I experienced in the cockpit than MSFS.  MSFS does excel at providing more photorealistic visuals out the window, but IMO is less convincing than XP when it comes to actual flight feel and control.  Basically, XP is much more of a flight simulator (what if feels like to fly a plane), while MSFS is more of a flying simulator (what it feels like to fly *in* a plane).  XP also provides me with much better performance in VR, giving me a minimum of 15 fps better performance than MSFS's default VR settings (and which only spreads wider at higher settings).  I still like MSFS when I'm up for a more casual experience at low altitudes where its trademark photogrammetry matters most; but for duplicating real-life flying, flight planning, and at altitude I find XP much preferable--feeling more professional and well tuned in this regard, especially in terms of navigation, take-offs, and landings.  Both continue to evolve so any flight simulator enthusiast should treat themselves to both, but XP is the one I currently use the most.",1635628334,1635628526,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The world map is nice. With objects set to max one can recognize major roads, major landmarks, and some terrain. The rest has to be added. Also it comes with many cool scenarios, but they fell like I'm running on Windows 98, not 10.

[b]Pros[/b]
1) As stated in the store page of the game, it is a flight simulator aimed to simulate how aircrafts are operated and flown in real life.  Cooperated with VATSIM, it's really good for those who wish to strengthen their communications with ATC and other pilots.
2) Amount of add-ons that can be added into the base game. (Tons of free add-ons around)

[b]Cons[/b]
1) Lack of aircraft variety- limited variety of aircraft in the base game. (Add-ons can fix it)
2) Graphics is pale in comparison to MFS 2020 (but who needs good graphics when you can sacrifice it for better performance)

XP11 is way way better than XP10 - flight models are excellent and the base scenery is very good indeed.  Plenty of expansion opportunities, official or third party.  Add some serious scenery from the likes of ORBX and you have a terrific looking simulator that is now working well.  Note - rudder pedals strongly advised for both XP10 and 11 - unlike FSX where there is a built in compensator for no rudder pedal hardware, XP11 really needs rudder pedals to control aircraft on take-off - particularly piston engined aircraft.

The games Air Traffic Control used to be dreadful - I'm pleased to say that XP11 has improved that aspect of the game.  It's still not perfect, but is much improved.  The only really serious fault with the game that needs adjusting is the behaviour of other AI aircraft in game.  This is probably the only area where FSX still wins - aircraft in XP11 fly off in one direction, and then suddenly appear out of the blue on finals in front of you!!  

The game demands a half decent graphics card to run smoothly, so watch out for the graphic specs.  And hereby lies the real thorn with this sim.  My PC is not a high end machine, but it has been working fine until the powers that be created the Vulcan open GL update.  Since then, my load times have trebled, and sometimes the sim just freezes on loadup.  The Vulcan update has, in my opinion totally ruined the flight sim experience for normal folk like me who do not want to reinvest hard earned cash - and lots of it - on a new PC just to make a flight sim work.
I used to get a lot out of this sim - once loaded it may have run a little slow, but it was still more than acceptable.  Since Vulcan, it's the devil's own job to get it to load.  Have tried alll sorts - making sure up to date drivers are present etc etc, and I've been trying for a long time to get things sorted, but to no avail.  There are some really helpful folk out there that have been making lots of really good suggestions to make my sim load up more consistently - sadly none have worked.

Overall - I'd therefore have to very reluctantly not recommend unless you have a high end PC that can handle the graphic output and can handle the Vulcan upgrade.
Having recently purchased MSFS202, I stand by this review - MSFS on the same PC loads reasonably quickly and works.  Purists will say that the flight models in XP11 are better, and they are probably right.  But half the time, I can't get it to load - when I do it's taken two or three freezes, and then an insanely long load up time that eventually works means that after around 40 minutes of frustration, I might just get a flight going.

In short - a really good flight sim ruined for low-end PC users.",1573650991,1633990417,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

At first it was different than simulators mentioned above and no sceneries I installed worked but then he told me that I need to download libraries required for each scenery. At first this was a bit painfull but as this was my first fresh install of X-Plane I took some time and once everything was done I started having fun exploring addons, sceneries and I am amazed by it. From that time I only fly X-Plane and I am enjoying every bit of it. Great thing about X-Plane is if you ever need to do fresh install simply copy Custom Scenery folder somewhere and when reinstall is done place it back and all your sceneries are there and working.

I was all ready to post a decent review, but NO, I just had to go discover the official X-Plane forums, and all the hundred of gigabytes of addons, scenery, mods, and aircraft they're hosting, all (mostly) free and made by the community.

Speaking of community, for whatever reason, the X-Plane/Flight Sim community was spared the pain of being assimilated into the Steam Workshop/Mod community, and it shows. I haven't had this much fun hunting down cool mods and addons since before Steam built the railroad.

Last but certainly not least, is the ease of use. I ACCIDENTALLY setup a 3 monitor view while tinkering around with the settings. I was fully expecting it to be an ordeal like with every other software I've ever tried, but however they did it, 
Laminar Research did it right. Configuring my HOTAS was a breeze, I did it on the fly during the intro flight.

My only nit to pick is the ATC has no keyboard hotkeys, and you must respond by clicking in a dialog window. Since my mouse hand is the same as my joystick hand, I have to take my hand off the stick to respond to ATC. But that doesn't matter anyway when there's a mod called LiveTraffic that populates your sim with actual flights from actual flight tracking networks)

It includes a large amount of tools to help simulate so many different aspects such as the Instrument Operating System giving you so many options. The control inputs I found are more direct and precise. The third party catalog is huge with an incredible amount of developers continuing to add-on despite the newer FS2020.

As for those talking about flight models, I'm just playing with a controller and will sometimes break out the flight yoke, but i'm not a pilot and personally don't notice the difference that much. MSFS seems overly stable, yet during last weeks hurricane I turned on live weather, flew out of NO and the plane was bouncing around almost uncontrollably, like I'd guess a real plane would. But X-Plane has been around for a while and it shows when it comes to visuals, and the performance isn't even all that great, so even on a lowered powered system you're likely not going to get a much of a benefit with X-Plane. Overall X-Plane was the best flight sim for a while and it has a ton of add-ons you can buy for it (and a ton of free ones too), but if you're just casually playing, it's not even close to competing with MSFS.

Look at all the complaints from PC pilots  when they added the XBox version. You cannot fly a plane with an XBox controller. If you like pretty pictures (and I think MSFS 2020 is super pretty)  fly MSFS 2020. If you are a pilot or you want to be a pilot, fly X-Plane. I am a pilot. I play both. For visual appeal, MSFS 2020 wins hands down. For a real flying experience, it has to be X-Plane. Now, when MSFS 2020 offers Sky4crew shared cockpit, I will think seriously about what I've said here. Until then, it's a crappy answer, but buy X-Plane.

Taildraggers are especially realistic - It's the only sim in which you need to constantly correct with the rudder to keep the plane straight. P-Factor is much more apparent in X-Plane than in my previous sim, FSX. Planes in FSX feel too stable and are almost impossible to stall. Stalling in X-Plane (in GA aircraft) Will make the left wing drop and will put you in a spin. Overall I highly recommend it if you're looking for a realistic sim.

Each iteration of the 'game' required me to buy a new PC and it was always the only software that pushed the hardware to its limits. At the time FS2020 was launched, the process started again. I bought a new machine and run the sim. The first expedition was a VFR flight in a Cessna along the river Nile from Aegypt to Lake Victoria. What a great experience! Then I did some more smaller journeys and ended up in the Airbus A321 neo. Again, the plane is great, but somehow it didn't feel right. I tried the freeware FlybyWire, which is a great improvement, but still, it didn't feel right. After a few weeks I invested in XPlane. The standard scenery was (compared to FS2020) bad, but the flight experience is on another level. First, you struggle managing the airplane. You have to learn about the airplane, radio communication, flight procedures and the like. After a while you get the basics and a seemingly easy task flying a plane from A to B becomes a very fulfilling activity. I am currently at the point that the ATC gibberish starts to make sense to me and I try to follow all procedures to my best ability. I am currently piloting an A321 and am building a cockpit with real buttons to play with. Finally a project that requires me to solder and make use of my beloved Arduino :) To improve the scenery I used plugins to get sateIlite images of Europe on my harddisk (no streaming!). I bought the Toliss A321 and am really happy with this marvel. I have about 200 hours of playtime on Xplane and about the same time on FS2020 (Although most time was downloading upgrades). FS2020 is just stunning and a great fun to fly around and learn about our planet. However, Xplane is more rewarding to me, because I feel that I gradually learn to master virtual aviation and each step on this journey opens another aspect that catches my interest.",1629124006,1629124058,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I would frequently use Flight simulator 2004 a century of flight and later FSX but hadn't played a flight simulator in some years. I first tried Aerofly FS2 because it was in a steam sale a while back and feel this is an ok Sim with a nice selection of planes but has limitations on where you can fly, lack of weather and despite them using some nice scenery visuals the world within feels a bit dull. I Wanted to try MSFS 2020 because lets be honest it looks nice but for me I couldn't even get it downloaded.

I'm glad I bought X plane though as this is the best flight simulator I have played by far. The visuals wont beat the competition I'm sure but they're still really good from default ""out of the box"" so to speak and there are some free downloads available to improve the scenery, unfortunately (but to be expected) with an FPS hit.  The sounds and the feeling of flying (well best you can get from a PC sim anyway) are just amazing in X plane. The included default planes are enough for me and what's important is they're nicely detailed.  I also purchased and installed a separate real time weather add on that I felt was worth it to add immersion.

Another negative is that though you can change the weather conditions, if you fly IFR the controler will guide you to the runway that you have a tail wind. Impossible in real world.

Get X-Plane if you want:
- better feeling aircraft
- smoother simulation and better FPS 
- to get nerdy with aircraft operation
- mod the game to your taste
- a lot of *purchasable* quality content

Get MSFS 2020 if you want:
- delicious and realistic scenery out of the box
- assisted flying
- modern glass cockpits that operate similar to a car GPS
- letting the plane autopilot do the work while you enjoy the scenery

I think no choice is wrong, but I would warn you that the novelty of nice graphics wears off after some time, while the learning on how to fly and navigate all sorts of planes properly seems to be an endless rabbit hole.

For the average airline simmer, this sim is going to rub off on your positive side; it's 737 is great for beginners and is ready for flight right out of the box. For the average VFR and Cessna hopper, I have good news and some bad news. Good news is this sim looks incredible and it's slew of small aircraft are highly detailed, bad news is it lacks a lot of airport and various VFR scenery. 

In terms of enjoyment, X-Plane 11 is a bit hard to learn. You are given cheap vanilla tools to fly with mouse+keyboard, and the sensitivity scale is not fun to play with. Essentially, if you're looking to pick up this game, look forward to around 10 or so hours figuring out how the controls work, their sensitivity, and various other factors that are going to help your flying experience run smoothly. Compared to Microsoft Flight Simulator X, X-Plane 11 takes a lot more time to get set up for flying.

Additionally, the only real way to get 100% enjoyment out of the sim is either through the use of plugins, (which are incredibly easy to install, just drag and drop and you're good to go) or use of joystick/yoke. Mouse and Keyboard functionality are extremely limited, and when you're first starting out it feels like the devs intentionally made your life very hard. Luckily, there is a plugin to fix this, find it here: [url=https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/51810-bettermouseyoke/] Better Mouse Yoke for X-Plane 11 [/url]

[b] At the end of the day, if you're coming from FSX or PMDG, you will be asking yourself the all-too-familiar question: Is this sim worth my hard earned $60? [/b]

[i] Yes! No... well, MAYBE. [/i]

If you plan to run the sim on a high-end or high specs computer, GO FOR IT. This sim is incredible at it's max settings, and if you have a powerful system, you can fly your heart out seamlessly.

However, for the majority of young and aspiring pilots.. your mid-low specs laptop may not be completely compaitble with this simulator. If you're running on very low specs, forget it. The truth of the matter is you're going to have to either stick to VFR and small airports in the middle of nowhere, or stay on FSX. 
If you're on a mid-range computer, changing the internal graphics settings may be enough for you. However, if it is not, there are plugins out there that obscure rendering distance, and improve performance dramatically. Still though, expect to be running 20-30 fps at best in cities.

In conclusion, I love X-Plane 11. Even though I run on a mid-range laptop that I got in 2015, the sim still amazes me. It's an absolute must for people looking to enhance their airline knowledge, or even get into high-lever simming.",1561096475,1626990019,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

MSFS20 is not old enough to have accumulated many community made mods. The graphics is where MSFS20 is way above X-Plane 11 or any other flight sim.

There are shortcomings, but it is quite good.

Shortcomings: if you start the game in VR mode, you'll be thrown into a tutorial. However, the tutorial is not made for VR. It is keyboard centric, plus messages it presents to you do not show up in your HMD and you have to interact with them on your desktop. Oh, and also rudder controls aren't bound to anything on your motion controllers.
It also takes quite a bit of disk space - you'll need about 60 gigabyte of space to install it without any addons. And you ideally would want to install this onto a ssd.

Now.... If you ignore the tutorial, bind yaw/rudder control to something (left stick works). amd also install free X-europe addon and then set world object count to at least ""Medium""(in graphic settings)... then everything suddenly becomes great. The scenery is believable enough, especially when you try to fly as low as possible without crashing, and the simulation aspect is done very thoroughly. At least some In-game aircraft comes with manual and there's additional manual for autopilot, GPS system etc. 

Speaking of VR, flying right above rooftops in VR is fairly excitring, plus you'll be able to press almost every knob use actual handles, as pretty much everything is interactive.

So, I recommend this one if you have some interest in flight sims and if you have a VR helmet. There are some shortcomings and minor glitches, but otherwise the game is great.",1625543072,1625543072,True,2,0,0.514285683631896973,0,True,False,False

You can find airport enhancement mods for free but then some of the required graphics libraries are no longer available so as a result the airport wont display properly or the ground surface is warped and then you have to learn how to use Bflat to smooth out the mesh. 

I downloaded the brilliant  King Air C90B Jonge Pionier mod. Can't even get the plane off the ground without it catching on fire, haha. On Xplane.org a few actual pilots made posts directed to the modder  but then couldnt be bothered when I and others asked questions regarding how to apply throttle, prop RPM etc to prevent damage the engines.  Mod author made an hour long video yet didn't make a single tutorial regarding basic operation of the aircraft.  

I asked several questions regarding issues I was having with Xplane in their discord and I get no response after several times. The question I asked on xplane.org forum is still awaiting review by a moderator after 3 days. 

Its all absurd beyond belief. Far too many skills and time are required to get this sim up and running smoothly and looking good.  

Now if you want to jump into the sim as is and fly the C172 or the Baron 58, there are geat video tutorials by users that will get you up to speed. I learned a lot from Xplane regarding VOR stations, NDB, CDI, HSI , basic navigation, etc.  

Its great for that although the moment you attempt to install mods and improve the look of this sim you will jump down a bottomless pit of confusion with very little help from the community. 

If you just want good IFR out of the box choose Xplane  although if you want good visuals and a great VFR experience choose MSFS 2020 or get both and use each for what they are good at. 

I spend more time installing and sorting out visual  mods in Xplane than I do flying which is ridiculous. Perhaps at sometime in the future Xplane will get revamped and installing visual mods wont be so painful and frustrating.  Or better yet Xplane will look good out of the box. At this point I might just get a refund and buy MSFS if I could although I have put 50hrs into this game to come to this realization.  

Xplane has its good points for sure although its a headache unless you have a good connect to experienced Xplane users/modders.

Spend literally hundreds of dollars or hundreds of hours getting Xplane to look great or just buy MSFS 2020 for the same base price although it has some issues as well.",1624589786,1624590056,False,12,3,0.485366255044937134,0,True,False,False

The second thing is the graphics, they are excellent, the night is dark and the lighting in this game just takes it to another level, the reflection are spot on.
ATC this is the weak point of X-plane but with the recent 11.30 they are making improvements 

Addons: recent 2 years were very exciting, a lot of p3d and FSX devs are making addons for XP and you can't forgot IXEG, TBM 900 hot start FF320, and soon MD-11 by rotate 
And a side note, XP is a very open software it's almost open source you can do whatever you want if you are a programmer, play with the textures make plugins and also scenery this last doesn't require any coding skills

Not only are graphics and preformance better (Running in Vulcan) but it is a 64 bit, meaning it does not have the limited 4 gig of ram that caused constant OOM errors on fsx. Xplane also has a couple of great free aircraft that make the sim awesome: The zibo 737, and the sparky 747 which are just overhauls of the default aircraft. In conclusion Xplane-11 if much better than fsx, and I was skeptical of switching from fsx to x-plane, but when I did, it was worth it. 

Now, while Xplane is a way better sim, that comes at a cost. Normally on fsx, you could get a full pack of good airplanes for around $60 dollars, but just for the base model of the 757-200 from flight factor is $72! That is a lot of money! Almost everything for xplane is going to cost money, and a lot of it. This is because it is a 64 bit game, the graphics are better, and the performance is much better too. If you are looking for a good sim, and have the money, time, and patience to do so, xplane is the way to go.

I edit my reviews every now and then so here is one, I have now had xplane for almost half a year and it is my primary simulator and gives me no issues what so ever. With xplane 11 it is such a well made and developed sim, pretty much any issue that occurs within the sim is usually pilot error haha.

All these elements combined create an experience unlike any other in the market right now. On the payware side of things, you can make the sim really shine. There are many great developers out there making everything from planes to weather enhancers. If your pockets allow I would definitely recommend you have a look at a few.  The Sim has great external hardware support for all your flight peripherals ( joysticks, yokes, rudders, throttles etc) and even controller support if that's more your speed.

Buy this instead of Flight simulator 2020
I have both and X-Plane 11 is way better, there are more planes and more addons, the flight models are amazing,
the physics are very accurate and there are a lot of great plugins. The FPS is awesome and is much less demanding then MFS2020. If you want amazing graphics but a buggy game then buy MFS2020 but if you want mediocre graphics but highly detailed planes and flight models buy X-plane. 
Keep in mind, XP11 is a more hardcore sim compared to MFS2020, if you want to fly a 737 from cold and dark then you need to know how to start up the plane and use the FMC, luckily there are 1000s of tutorials on youtube and in the XP forums for pretty much every aircraft in the sim. 
If you do decide to buy X-plane 11 BUY THESE PLANES FIRST : Flight Factor 757, Zibo 737 (freeware), Aerobask Phenom 300, ini builds A300, Toliss A321, Toliss A319, and the Flight Factor A320 ultimate.

Judging by reviews made by other actual real life pilots, the flight physics are pretty good and i certainly agree as they feel smooth and solid. Even though the simulator comes with some decent planes and functions, i highly recommend you download some third-party mods. One such example is the zibo 737-800, it's a huge improvement over the stock 737-800. Also, before you buy keep in mind that this game is a SIMULATOR so don't expect everything to go smooth sailing.

269950,69058534,76561199014812808,0,8,8426,0,2246,1699204599,"Update as of April 20, 2021: Now that I'm flying the Cessna 172 more in real life, I've come to appreciate the flight dynamics of the XP11 172. It is much more accurate in terms of performance (climb, glide, pitch attitude for a given airspeed) than MSFS2020. The latter still makes XP11 look like it was drawn with sidewalk chalk, but for usable practice in the 172, XP11 is the clear winner. I'm using the Facebook Quest 2, and though I'm still not a fan of Facebook, I just can't deny the quality of the product; and it gives a more stable experience than the Quest 1. XP11 is also much smoother in VR than MSFS2020 but that could be due to graphics settings. I just don't have the time to work it all out right now. For now it's XP11 for practice and MSFS2020 for sight seeing.

Update as of Dec 27th, 2020: With the release of XP11.50 with Vulkan as well as Oculus Link FINALLY coming out of beta this is now a good experience in the Oculus Quest 1 + Link. With a very solid gaming PC ($2500 total investment about a year ago) I can get 45FPS with just above average settings in XP. One really important piece is to make sure SteamVR has the correct resolution. What it call 100% is way too high for the Oculus Quest. It's not uncommon to need a reboot to get maximum FPS. I've seen a 3x improvement after rebooting the computer and headset. As of right now, this is MASSIVELY better than MSFS2020 in VR.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: This review is specific to using X-Plane 11 with Oculus Quest + Link in mid-2020 (which is not supported by either company). Until Oculus improves compressing/decompressing large frames over Link, X-Plane 11 is a non-starter. Even with everything dialed down to the minimum setting, the number of application dropped frames continuously increases at a quick pace. My guess is that Quest isn't able to decompress the frames fast enough so X-Plane just has to drop the frames as the pipeline gets bogged down. Prepar3d has the same problem. FlyInside sim seemed to be much better and MS-FSX is actually livable, but with much poorer graphics. Condor 2, strictly for sail planes, is very smooth, but also with pretty poor graphics. The one place X-Plane clearly outshines the competitors, even with Quest + Link, is in flight dynamics. The better flight model is the closest to real GA airplanes of any sim I've found. The behavior of the glider is extremely close to the real thing.

Aside from the Quest+Link problem, it's clear that VR is still a second class citizen in X-Plane. Using the controllers in the cockpit is unimaginably frustrating. Teleporting is so readily available that many times I've accidentally bumped the thumbstick and suddenly found  myself standing on the ground, watching my plane fly off in the distance. Trying to turn most of the knobs in the cockpit is extremely difficult. The trick is to pause the sim, put your face right in front of the knob and patiently, slowly twist back and forth until you finally land on the frequency or setting you need. Even more frustrating since MS-FSX doesn't have that problem. Another option (oddly the best one for me) is to pause the sim (or turn on the autopilot) lift the headset, click on the radio, then adjust it in 2D on the monitor. You will also need to fix the VR cockpit settings file for each airplane to put your head in a reasonable place in the cockpit. There are no avatars in X-Plane, so why is it so hard to position the head?

A note to all would be VR flight simmers: It seems that for any kind of reasonable experience in any VR flight sim, you need a joystick/yoke with as many buttons to map as possible. I've tried to use on the controllers in VR and it's only good for short, scenic flights. Holding a heading or vertical speed while doing something else in the cockpit doesn't work well at all.",1589366580,1618928270,True,0,0,0.413793116807937622,0,True,False,False

Lots of free addons to download from the community website, and LOTS of payware you can buy from Laminar Research themselves, and the community. This goes for planes, mods, and scenery addons. However i dont really reccomend buying anything unless you will really stick with it. Addons get expensive, especially the planes. Most of the ones made by the community start at 30-40 dollars and only go up in price drastically. That is not to say that they aren't excellently made however, just something to watch out for. A free plane I would recommend for beginners is the Zibo 737-800X. Its completely free and has the quality of most payware aircraft you would buy for 40 dollars and up. 

Enough about the content though. Its a bit of a learning curve, like most simulators. They have training lessons for flying a Cessna 172 Skyhawk. Basic things like controls and how to read the gauges. Highly reccomend playing through them and paying attention if you are new to flying. However for the other planes its gonna be a little research to figure out how to g et them up and going, especially the airliners like the boeing 737, 747 etc. For me, learning about how they work is half the fun. Actually getting the plane started from a cold and dark state and taking off successfully is the other half. Trust me, its extremely satisfying. Definitely an acquired taste, however.

In comparison to other flight sims i have played, its a big upgrade from Microsoft Flight Simulator X. and Honestly? i still enjoy it better than the new Microsoft Flight Sim 2020. I own it on the microsoft store, and at its best its more like eye candy to me. The graphics are real fancy but it doesn't run all that well, and the controls are extremely wonky. I have tried calibrating my yoke and controls devices several times through windows, and the game cannot have a smooth moving axis with it. Its terrible. In X-Plane 11, the controls are absolutely excellent, the best i have experienced in any flight sim. It has an in game calibration menu, unlike MSFS 2020. The UI is just way more intuitive in X-Plane.

Overall a 9/10 for the whole experience. I choose this game over MSFS 2020 any day. This game really shines with access to free community addons and your own intuition to learn. :)",1617434762,1617435212,True,19,1,0.700301587581634521,0,True,False,False

I played Microsoft's offerings since FS98. As a child, those titles inspired me to take on the challenge for real as a young adult. This led directly to a career in aviation in the US Armed Forces, where I applied that passion for nearly 10 years. It's fair to say that I owe a great deal of my life's passion to the Microsoft titles.

THAT BEING SAID...

As I matured as a gamer and as a real world pilot, I have come to appreciate X-Plane for what it is; a tool for the connoisseur. It feels better, plays smoother, puts polish where it counts. Its more well rounded, even if it lacks some of the in-your-face spit shine of its competitor. A quick verification of this fact can be done simply be popping onto YouTube and seeing how many of the real-world pilot ""lets plays"" use X-Plane as the basis of their content. It always works as intended, and generally feels the ""realest"" to those acquainted with the nuances of civil aviation methodologies and procedures. While I can't help but take a moment here or there to jump back into MSFS and luxuriate in its latest and greatest, there always seems to be a gut feeling of something missing for me. 

That feeling is gone 25 minutes after starting cold and dark in a B738 on a ramp, FINALLY having made it to the apron and ready for departure. Every switch and knob correctly set (by me). The ND lit up with all my constraints and flight path. EICAS says everything I want it to, autopilot set and ready to engage TOGA.

Then I take off and totally bork the SID, not because the sim is flawed and I'm having to RP a workaround for missing systems, but because after 15 years of flying IRL and 20 in sims, I'm still the worlds okayest pilot.

Often lose the ability to control the plane with a mouse, being unable to open up the steering box again. I know this game isn't meant to be played with a mouse so this is probably low priority but, still.

The heading gauge glitches out constantly, don't even try to click on it.

When booting up the game initially, I'll get this screen that pops up for about 4 seconds where it looks like you're in the cessna 172 about to takeoff and the game is making a horrible loud audio sound that's basically just an erroneous alarm. Then it continues to your game. Stop this!

This game might actually need batman to fix it. Devs seem far more concerned with drawing new airports than fixing functionality, unfortunately.

Beyond the hair tearing bugs I'm learning a lot about flying and landing as a brand new pilot. Probably could accomplish the exact same in any simulator though.

I have not made it far enough to dig into the ""around the world"" stuff nor do I even have a usb yoke. Learning to fly with mouse is hard but at least I'm only $60 committed atm, not $300

Did spin out an SR-71 blackbird and recovered which I'm sure isn't possible at 600 knots but, hey what do I know. Also, game gives you an SR-71 out the gate. Very cool! However, it's a lip sync service as the piece of garbage can't break 600 knots diving into the ground from 70k ft. But, it does go to 70k ft at 400 knots or so on a slow climb. Can probably speed this up with some more knowledge but.... no thanks. If this thing can't break 600 knots in level flight wtf is the point? Hey devs you know this plane does mach 3+ w/o trying, right? FIX IT FIX IT FIX IT FIX IT FIX IT FIX IT FIX IT FIX IT FIX IT FIX IT FIX IT FIX IT FIX IT FIX IT FIX IT FIX IT!!!!

Game also threw me for an engine failure on a landing which was really awesome to gain emergency experience. I think this was intentional and not a bug. Otherwise, another bug.

So, it's not all negative but, enough of it is for a bad review since there isn't neutral review and I wouldn't recommend a game with more bugs then a stray dog has fleas.

The 737 is the flagship product of the Boeing company, after the 787, 777, 767, 757 and 747 models, designed to compete against Airbus’s A320neo. As a civilian airliner it strives to be the safest and most efficient model yet. In 2018 and 2019, two 737 MAXs, a fourth generation aircraft, crashed in two different flights, severing the company’s stark reputation and grounding more than 300 aircraft around the world. The underlying problem primarily at its core was the MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System) system, which was provided as a safety feature on the flights of Lion Air 610 and Ethiopian Airline 302. The MCAS system used a fragile system which put the passengers of all 737 MAX flights at risk, by tricking the system into thinking the plane was diving or stalling, which altered the yoke input leading to a wrestle of control between the pilots and the aircraft.

The 737 series was conceived in 1964, when Boeing was looking to replace its ageing 727s currently in service. The lineup began as the 737-100, which utilised JT8D low-bypass ratio turbofans, which began service with Lufthansa in 1968. Known as the “Original” series, this included the 737-100 and 737-200. The second generation “Classic” consisted of the 737-300, 400 and 500, launched in 1979 with increased length and capacity. The third generation “NG” (New Generation) gave birth to the 737-600, 700, 800 and 900 series with the fourth and most recent generation of 737s, the “MAX” series was developed to compete against Airbus’s A320neo series. With the ability to hold 138 to 204 passengers, it comes equipped with high-bypass ratio turbofans, CFM International LEAP engines which provide 160kN of thrust with 16% increased efficiency over older models, as well as an engine nacelle with chevrons built in to reduce noise. The first 737 MAX fuselage was finished in mid 2015, with flight testing beginning in early 2016. The first order was delivered to a subsidiary of Lion Air in May 2017. Going for $121.6 million each aircraft, the 737 MAX ferried 6.5 million people in 41,000 flights for 1118,000 hours in its first year of service. On October 29th, 2018, a Lion Air’s 737 MAX 8 crashed into the Java sea, and a year later on March 10th, 2019, an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX crashed near the town of Bishoftu in Ethiopia.

Lion Air’s Flight 610 took off at 6:20am on 29 October 2018 from Jakarta’s runway 25L, heading for Pangkal Pinang, scheduled to arrive at 7:20am. Heading west from the initial takeoff, it circled around until it leveled off and continued climbing in a northeasterly direction. Contact with the aircraft was lost at 6:33am, and air traffic control contacted authorities. After three ships and a helicopter were dispatched to the predicted crash zone, authorities reported that Flight 610 had crashed into the Java sea with 189 fatalities. Workers on a nearby offshore oil rig reported seeing the plane nosedive into the 35m deep waters at a steep angle. Boats dispatched from the oil rig later reported debris floating in the waters. A similar turn of events happened to Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, when ATC lost contact with the aircraft 6 minutes after takeoff from Addis Ababa and found its wreckage close to the town of Bishoftu. The cause of both crashes was determined to be the MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System) by investigating authorities. MCAS is a flight control law or software embedded in Boeing 737 MAXs, and deals with the automatic controls of the aircraft’s pitch. The system was included in the 737 to assist with the aerodynamics of the new leap engines, where it would need to pitch the aircraft up or down according to readings from the AoA (angle of attack) sensor. As an automated corrective measure for the safety of the aircraft, it could not be overridden by the pilots, so any faulty readings by the AoA sensor could result in the system forcing the aircraft in a nosedive, as was the case on both 737 MAX flights. Both sensors on both aircraft fed misinformation to the system resulting in the plane being visualised as pitching too high by the system. The motor unit in the tail of the aircraft as well as the yoke kept on pitching the aircraft’s trim down to account for the fake AoA resulting in a nosedive. Since the system was running off a single AoA sensor, the entire unit was susceptible to SPOF (Single Point Of Failure), where if one component fails, the entire system would too.

The requirement of MCAS came from the larger LEAP engine Boeing opted for the 737 MAX. The larger radius of the engines made it so that aircraft would pitch up very steeply if the AoA reached a certain amount. Instead of an aerodynamic option, Boeing selected to use the MCAS system, as it would not need to retrain pilots. Initial testing of the AoA sensor gathered that it could result in it not working, although it was not catastrophic and the pilots could respond to it. This was overlooked by the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) when the system was deemed as approved for earlier models of the MCAS. As a result of the two crashes, aviation authorities around the globe have grounded all 737 MAX flights, costing Boeing $18.6 billion USD by March with further costs predicted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the FAA revoking airworthiness for each individual 737 MAX. Boeing suspended all production of the 737 MAXs, estimating that an ungrounding of aircraft could happen in mid 2020. 

Airbus, Boeing’s main competitor, was unwilling to put the blame on Boeing’s engineering, as the certification of products by aircraft manufacturers was considered tough. Around 200 aircraft leases have been canceled, with many undelivered aircraft now residing in Boeing Park, Seattle, Washington. As an engineering failure overlooked in the design and testing phase, the MCAS system could have been given a backup system or failsafe to give the flawed system some redundancy, in case a component fails. It could have also been given the aerodynamic refit, which was not chosen for costs, and this undermined the safety of the aircraft. Overall, the MCAS system was given full authority of the aircraft which made the pilots unable to control their aircraft in case of flawed sensor inputs. This resulted in two 737 MAX crashes claiming 347 lives, from the simple decision to overlook a design flaw.

I have played XPlane for a long time (as well as the Microsoft Flight Simulator franchise) and recently migrated from XPlane 9 to XPlane 11.

This is a great simulator typical of XPlane. The game has good graphics for the era it was released in.

As always one of the major strengths of XPlane is the flight modelling which one notices right away versus Microsoft Flight Simulator.

XPlane aircraft are more realistic in look, feel, operation, and workflow versus those in Microsoft Flight Simulator.

There are some areas I would love to see expanded in the next rendition of XPlane (not criticisms rather requests for enhancements): more expressive and functional ATC, more realistic/vibrant color palette, more land marks, more stock aircraft, and better mapping and flight planning capabilities.

It is not the graphical masterpiece that Microsoft Flight Simulator is (that is about all Microsoft Flight Simulator does well currently), after all it is from a different generation of graphics cards and capabilities, but still look phenomenal.

I have experienced one bug, in full screen mode the simulator hangs indefinitely on loads. I have not had this happen in windowed mode.

Buy XPlane even if you have Microsoft Flight Simulator, buy XPlane even if you do not have Microsoft Flight Simulator...

With X-Plane, the physics are not only functional but they're even somewhat accurate. Aircraft systems are functional, even with the stock models. That includes avionics - the stock G1000 works better than any patch mod for MSFS available. The sim doesn't take 4 hours to load up, and frame rates are high. You don't have to worry about devs that have never seen an airplane before breaking some random mechanic in the latest scenery update because the game has been out forever. It's a game focused on the airplane and operating the airplane. 

Summary:
Graphics - scenery is trash. Aircraft are decent and not unpleasant to be inside during a flight.
Physics - high-quality. When I was in college there were some researchers that used X-Plane 11 to develop autopilots for novel flight concept demonstrator UAS's. Ground physics are bad though.
Controller support - excellent. The game recognized my X-52 stick/throttle and rudder pedals right away and calibration/remap was easy. Plenty of button bindings available, but I haven't found a bind for Parking Brake yet which is kind of annoying. I just tap the brakes to release if the cockpit object doesn't work or is hidden.
Simulation - very good. Icing is exaggerated greatly, landing gear model isn't bad but isn't good. Flight model is great. Aircraft systems work well. Avionics work correctly but NAV databases aren't kept current by the stock game (not a huge deal).
Overall - is it a better flight simulator than MSFS? Yes, MSFS isn't a flight sim and this is very much a flight sim. Is it a better game than MSFS? yep. Better value? Absolutely. It's not graphically stunning like MSFS and you don't get a headlamp for a dark cockpit, but in every other way X-Plane wins hands-down.
EDIT - You actually get a way better flashlight in X-Plane.

269950,82156422,76561199011789616,0,8,41611,0,16675,1652009652,"It should be a positive review since it is a great simulator but Laminar are relying too much on 3rd party paid addons (or free but very time consuming) for me to give this product a positive review. I will review X-Plane 11 alongside Microsoft Simulator 2020 so you can make a sound choice at the end. I own both product and I am not biased in any way.

After $500 investing into X-Plane 11 now I would give it a positive review but the stock version simply isn't there. You must absolutely buy third-party planes (or download the 737-800 Zibo and only fly this plane since it's free and competitive with the most expansive addons).

I guess what I am trying to say is the amount of money invested that will be obsolete when X-Plane 12 launch is simply not allowing me to post a good review. But in term of pure physics and systems simulation and what can be achieved with the  SDK it currently beats Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. The open airports edits to push changes by the community when X-Plane launch an update is a very nice addition that at least makes all default major airports pretty realistic with correct number of gates, ground marking for them, correct taxiway indications. If you install Airport Environment HD it is even better with the sort of parking lines (with by-airplane stop indications) and beautiful taxiway signs and better runways textures (navigational aids, taxiway signs, aprons, runways all redone) but again, it is a addon. Free but Laminar could have done an equally good job.

So to resume, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, out of the box, beats X-Plane 11, less need to be invested in addons but the physics is not as good, no airliners can fly properly unless you download the free FlyByWire Airbus A320neo addons that basically replace the original neo withan almost study level plane. The live weather, airacs, traffics, amazingly detailed topography, cities and the magic is that the game use data streaming to give you astonishing graphics while keeping the game size relatively small so they can expand with each updates without passing the 300 GB mark at update 1.

 Downsides of MSFS2020 are the upsides of X-Plane 11. MSFS Need for a public airports database for people to do edits the currently extremely not accurately depicted airports that can be reviewed and pushed in updates like X-Plane. Better physics and systems sim, better airports ground markings. Right now all the default airport all have only a yellow line for taxiway so no taxiway markings part from the yellow line, only two markings and it's for the ramps such as the stop line for glideslope and the other a little bit further as the last stop before getting clearance to enter the runway and perform takeoff.  For the moment the MSFS2020 SDK is not completed and it is a major reason why there are no 3rd-party quality planes. By 2022 the Asobo's simulator published by Microsoft should have a decent payware and freeware ecosystem, much like X-Plane 11.

If you want a simulator that is beautiful out-of-the box and bet on the future (X-Plane 11 has stagnated). get Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020.",1607761586,1614528462,False,0,1,0.433333337306976318,0,True,True,False

Almost all functions/switches work

To really get the most enjoyment out of this game, you're going to need to spend time, money, or both. If you spend the time hunting down freeware addons, plugins, etc., you can have a great experience without spending a cent. Planes like the Zibo 737-800, graphics meshes, cloud plugins, so much to consider and places like /r/xplane are your friend.

If you have deep pockets, the world is yours and the sky is literally the limit. Excellent payware planes that offer challenging study-level accuracy like the FlyJSim 727, detailed pay terrain, weather engines, and the list goes on. MSFS may be better out of the box for sheer visual beauty, but XP11 is still king of the kingdom when it comes to power, wealth of third-party support, and flexibility.

And if you're considering choosing one of the two, on a very simplified level look at it this way: MSFS20 is your iPhone, and XP11 is your Android. One is really slick, simplified, and easy to dive into out of the box at the expense of third party support (for now) and accuracy.

[b]If you're trying to find out which sim is better than the other, MSFS or X-Plane the answer is neither. Both sims are fundamentally different.[/b]


There are lot of differences between the X-Plane series and Microsoft Flight simulator. I have been using both since X-Plane 9 and MSFS-X, and generally speaking the differences that follow remain the same across all versions of both simulators. Personally I feel that one is not better than the other, rather what are you trying to get out of it? 

There are pros and cons to both of them. X-Plane features full cockpit functionality to all of the aircraft in the vanilla game, as well as a lot of realistic features that MSFS doesn't even come close to. It's much less casual and unforgiving, and pressing the wrong button or over stressing the aircraft can have catastrophic consequences, if that's what you're looking for. Microsoft flight simulator even on the maximum realism settings is still pretty forgiving as far as the flight models for the aircraft are concerned. MSFS 2020 put more of their priorities into optimizing a game that's basically eye candy, so a lot of other features were skimped out.

Unfortunately X-Plane doesn't have an updated FMC database of all the NAV way points and airports, MSFS 2020 does. In order to get updated NAV aids for X-Plane you need to install Payware. (I'm sure there's free options but I've found that those are usually restricted to one region, or very hard to find from a reliable source in general.) Similarly to MSFS, there is no multi-crew feature, however X-Plane on its own with no plugins has NO MULTIPLAYER whatsoever. However both sims do support Add-on economy/tycoon software that adds a lot of replay-ability. If you have the money for it, I would recommend just getting both.",1611789316,1611789392,True,59,2,0.840080797672271729,0,True,False,False

I do own the other big ones, however, this one is still the best and most realistic in terms of flight model compared to flying in real life; in my experience. I have presently over 600 hours clocked in this sim. Many hours before that in X-Plane 10 and thousands of hours flying in general.

Fairly recently we have seen a new big sim enter the market. It’s much much prettier than X-Plane and it does look very promising already. However, it’s not an X-Plane killer by any means. They both have strengths and weaknesses and the audiences may not be the same. X-Plane is not about eye candy even though you can make it fairly pretty using add-ons, but the real strength of X-Plane is its realistic flight model.

When it comes to flight simming it really doesn’t have to be one or the other. Personally, I use three for different purposes. Luckily, we have seen quite a few strong study level sims coming to X-Plane. So you’re not stuck with whatever sim PMDG and/or A2A produce aircraft for. There are alternative players for the X-Plane market that are absolutely on par when talking about system depth and simulation.

As said, X-Plane is not the prettiest out of the box for sure but there is an enormous catalogue of add-ons and a huge portion of them are free add-ons made by the community.

Also, the creator of X-Plane has very exciting plans for the future development of this sim, so it shall remain strong and attractive for serious simmers. The things you may dislike about it or stuff that only bothers you somewhat are also already on the minds of the developers and the creator and are already things they want to change, optimise, and just make better.

I could go on but I’ll end it here by saying that I can wholeheartedly recommend X-plane to anyone; experienced pilots and newcomers alike.",1611646625,1611646625,True,2,1,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

I wanted to make this review to tell you guys about this amazing flight simulator, Let me start off by saying that Graphics and the scenery of the world are not the best as MSFS has taken that crown BUT and there's a big T H I C C  B U T, X-Plane has a fantastic simulation to physics of the aircraft and this is what does it for me, don't get me wrong I genuinely enjoy flying in MSFS with all its navigation bugs and issues it has but X-Plane takes the crown in Flight physics and this is really important to me, just the fact I can set my autopilot and expect it to do what it's being told to just does it for me, MSFS makes it easy for people to set everything up but it's not truly Cold and Dark, This is what X-Plane does really well. you get in the aircraft do your checks follow procedures and all works as expected. 

don't get me started on the amazing Zibo 737 that upgrades the default 737, I highly recommend anyone who buys XP11 to try Zibo 737 even if you are an Airbus fanboy like me you will enjoy flying the Zibo 737. 

You can make X-Plane 11 Look amazing by using reshade and downloading many great graphical addons that can be found for free on the X-Plane forum for FREE! yes FREE, the X-Plane community is amazing!

Listen I will be honest here, only buy this Flight Simulator if you really are someone who likes Study level aircraft and if you are someone who has the time and can go through the effort to make it look eye candy and if you are looking for a flight simulator that has good physics. 

if not then stick to MSFS as that's easier to deal with and you will enjoy your self while flying around the world :) 

X-Plane 11 will stay on my hard drive even if I have and use MSFS.



After someone added me to ask what mods I was talking about, I will list them.

X-Plane 11 is awesome and I highly recommend it. If you get it then be sure to watch some videos and learn what great free plugins to get and some free planes etc. as well as where to get free scenery for airports around the world and keep them updated etc.

Previously I had tried the Steam version with keyboard and mouse. That sucked. Videos I have watched of folks that stream sessions one of them uses the Steam version without problems. Most get it straight from the makers. I have seen a few cons about from Steam. The main ones are apparently it causes problems with updates at times and many simply want all the money to go to the creators rather than Steam getting a cut.

I tried Microsoft Flight and think it's horrible. Overall Microsoft is about the worst thing out there but is visually appealing if you don't mind no realism.",1572272603,1611122649,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I've rated it negative before because i have had massive problems with using my Windows Mixed Reality Controllers in VR-mode of X-Plane 11. Every Time i have started the sim an error message was shown (""Error reading joystick configuration (.joy) file"" and the controllers did not work. Sometimes X-Plane 11 crashed after confirming this error message.

Thsnks to an user in X-Plane.org forum i was able to fix (or better to avoid) this error by loading X-Plane 11 directly from ""Windows Desktop"" in the ""Cliffhouse"" (WMR VR start environment) by choosing ""Play X-Plane in VR"" instead of launching it from ""Steam Home"".

This seems to be the same, but doing so is avoiding the error message and the controllers are working fine.

And i can finally fly again after nearly one whole sad year of ""non flying"".

In the meantime i've hoped that switching to FS2020 is an option, but they have only VR light (no support of VR controllers, you have to use keyboard, mouse and joystick, realy really embarrassing), 

But no matter, now, X-Plane 11 is my baby again and i will use it with joy.  FS2020 with it's crappy vr can go to hell :-)

Maybe Laminar Research read this sometimes and put some efford in fixing this error, so users can start the game like it should be. And maybe my review helps somebody who have the same problems like me.

This version with VR on the Oculus is almost impossible to describe. The best way is to just think that YOU are sitting in a real cockpit of a variety of aircraft. Your eyes and brain is tricked into thinking all is REAL!!! I just got the Oculus this week and now after trying X-Plane I will NEVER got back to playing any flight sim in 2D, it stinks! Tonight I tried out the fighter jet and was just so blown away. Fortunately, I am not scared of heights nor do get motion sickness. Someone that has these two things, forget about doing VR it will make you sick as can be! But if you are up to it, X-Plane is the one to get. The graphics are smooth on my computer, I can set almost to the highest of all settings, the world looks so real, I wish to thank the developers of this program and all of the past versions. Its no telling how many hours I've spent on it. I am NOT a pilot, but when I was in the Air Force, I was in a Tactical Air Control Party (TACP), we are the ones who conduct airstrikes. I think I have at least 4,000 hours of flight time. As a passenger our pilots taught us how to fly so just in case something happens to them, we would be able to safely return to base without crashing! Now with the Oculus and X-Plane I get to relive my flying days although I am fully retired after 44 years of service! This is beyond exciting!

As far as training equipment goes for students learning to be pilots it's quite a good investment. The controls can feel a bit wonky sometimes and the simulation itself can only go so far to simulate the real deal, but overall its a realistic experience. It really shines if you are practicing instrument flying, emergency scenarios that you'd best not try in real life, and pattern work to get used to certain procedures. It also has maps of just about every airport around the world so if you are planning a trip it can help to try it a couple of times in the sim before flying there for real. I should also point out that you will need a moderately powerful graphics card to run the sim on higher settings. It is still decent on the lower settings but it can make certain airports and areas harder so aim to be able to run it on the higher settings to get the most out of it.

I originally went with Microsoft because I wanted the better graphics. Basically MS2020 had so many problems I uninstalled it and got Xplane instead. Xplane has all the detail from navigation aid and aircraft controls as a good simulator should. The graphics are pretty good too considering the terrain graphics are not add on software. There are less aircraft than in MSFS, but they all work and look good, the buttons actually do things and Xplane works with my cheap face tracking software. Definitely recommended. See below for my MSFS2020 review: 

((((((( MSFS2020 COMPLETELY UNUSABLE NOW AFTER UPDATING, CRASHES UPON LOADING EVERY TIME! this started after a forced UPDATE! Ran OK before. Internet searches show many others have had this problem but Microsoft have not sorted this out since the end of October and multiple complaints. It loads the adverts, then asks for me to set up an Xbox live account but wont let me click on anything, and will sit like that for hours if I leave it. I uninstalled it and reinstalled it but it's exactly the same. I've tried various fixes from internet sources but so far nothing has worked. TWO MONTHS of fault finding. I give up! I requested a refund but Steam WON'T refund as I've played it for over two hours, even though the first 12 hours were the installation program running, (I spent £79 on this game by the way)! The updates and loading time show as play time on Steam which is completely pointless. I'm not going to stop fighting to get my money back even though I'm already feeling the might of such a large company pushing me back, £79 down the flipping drain. To say I'm not happy is an understatement. This is the first Microsoft game I've bought in a few years, and I WON'T be buying any more. This game has regular updates that seem to bugger up installations with absolutely no comeback on Microsoft. There are multiple examples on the internet of people with game issues. I would like Steam to send more feedback to Microsoft or even stop hosting this game all together. I've been waiting 14 years for the remake of FSX and I thought this was it! Sadly not. I'm so disappointed in this product. Even when it was working it had multiple flaws, like it isn't finished. The loading times are a joke, (and I've got a £1200 Gaming PC less than a year old). 5 to 10 minutes to load, then if you want to change world location or aircraft you have to do that 5-10 mins all over again. At maximum graphics settings it looks great and pushes my PC to the limit but sadly it does not run smoothly, it stutters/pauses randomly. I've lowered the graphics to the lowest settings but it still pauses. I have other more demanding games that do run smoothly, it doesn't make sense. Some aircraft could have more buttons that actually do something. There seems to be less actionable buttons in this version than FSX. The playability is good by how you look around the cockpit, but I never had much of a problem with that before. The world terrain photo scenery is good but FSX had add on scenery that was good 14 years ago. Sorry, but I've just had far too many problems in FS2020 and the fact that now it doesn't work at all, that I cant recommend MSFS2020. I'm going to try Virtual Pilot or X-Plane, if I can still afford it! )))))))))))))))))))))))",1608969483,1610207028,True,0,0,0.496613979339599609,0,True,False,False

The AI aircraft doesn't seem to really go anywere and just swarm around you. When I reload a saved flight, I start with all my engines and batteries off, mid flight - X Plane doesn't seem to save the state of aircraft properly. I had random crashes.. Sound doesn't work after these crashes and requires a re-install..

All in all I'm surprised that people compare this to MFS. This feels like an open-ended product that gives you barely enough. Sure the physics and simulation itself seems good, but this is a simulator that heavily relies on 3rd party plugins to function properly. If you get this game, you'll probably enjoy it, but prepare yourself to google a lot and use plenty of 3rd party plugins and aircraft. For a paid game, you just don't get enough.

I'm going back to MFS. Sure, MS is known for giving issues after updates, but at least they get the basics right. Buying X-Plane, I was expecting a product like MFS in terms of value for money. I mean they are compared like they are almost the same thing. In my opinion, MFS is years ahead.

TLDR:
- If you want a simulator that will work out of the box and include more than you need, go for MFS.
- If you want a simulator that offers enough to get started, you don't mind using plenty of plugins and perhaps want to create your own, go for X Plane.",1609930654,1609930654,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The plane looks good, the land looks ok.  You can pick from alot of airports, so that was nice.  Performance is the main issue in this game plus no ingame vr support for tutorials.

The game has a tutorial level but not in VR.  You have to take off your headset to see what the screen says then go back in game to try operate the plane, this is not VR friendly.  If you know buttons on a plane and know how to fly you will be able to operate the plane easy.  For beginners like me its not easy in VR.

Overall i think the game is okay but the performance for VR is bad, so you need a better graphics card, maybe 1070 or 1080.  The recommended graphics are for regular pc only.

Hope this helps people in VR.

I recommend this game only if you have hardware to run it, i would say something like a 1080 is min.
Will buy again once i upgrade one day.

- bugs bugs bugs. i think in 1 in 5 landings the airplane gets stuck on the speed it was at touchdown, no brakes, no slow down, no nothing. and the plane keeps goin over the RW, over the hills and seas, and probably will never stop if i don't quit. imagine you do a 4 hours fly just to see this at landing.
- no traffic on air, airports and no where, all alone. because this is how real world works: a huge airport for one plane.
- many other bugs (e.g. auto-speed can't be set anymore or the plane accelerates from 175 to 250 in 5 seconds when you are about to land).
- flight planning... nothing to do with reality. you spend 30 seconds to generate the flight plan and 20 minutes to find out how to integrate it in this game. and of course, while flying the lnav is really screwed up.

Has some pros and cons."" - Me at 164hrs

Revisiting this review after an additional 220hrs, and 60-something hours on MSFS2020 (about ~30hrs actual, not including download etc.)

What I noticed immediately on firing up X-Plane after an extended amount of time away following the release of MSFS2020, is the crispness of the displays, the resolution and definition of the landscape.

There's also something about the flight characteristics of the aircraft.  I can't put my finger on it, but flight feels a little more satisfying than the newer sim.

What about the landscape? Well, there's no getting away from it. X Plane's scenery can appear bland, with sometimes repetitive textures. But at times it shines, with beautiful mountain vista's fading into the distance. I also feel a degree of, dare I say it, nostalgia  for the way the landscape is generated. Digital elevation maps combined with land class data and open street map information are blended together to recreate the globe. Is it perfect? No. But it is an amazing technological feat. And it is stored locally on your own PC. Is that important? Only if your online scenery servers become unavailable...which I experienced a few days ago with the other sim. Coming back after flying around the VFR marvel of MSFS2020 is like coming back to a low-poly world, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.

X Plane 11 is a fine simulator, but it is not going to be everyone's cup of tea. I feel like I've spent as much time tweaking it for performance and improvements as I have spent flying it. There's a strong community dedicated to creating plugins, add-ons, aircraft, and environments. I've made a few airports myself and uploaded them to the X Plane Scenery Gateway. If they're accepted they will likely be included in future releases. It's easy to get involved.

I have had a great time with X Plane 11, and it's still got life left in it.

After playing 65 hours with X-plane 11 I can state that I have no regrets what so ever. Yes, the autogenerated buildings could be better. Yes, the weather engine of MS FS2020 looks better. But I had 65 hours of real simulationtime, no severe bugs, no unreal looking oversaturated-colors like MS FS2020 has and no missing airports which should have been included (like Eindhoven in MS FS2020). With the addition of Ortho4XP scenery and ORBX Terraflora I can even state that many times the world in X-plane 11 looks even better than the one in MS FS2020. But even without Ortho4XP the scenery is convincing. I even make pictures during the flight and post it on a photography site and get good comments. What I also like is the fact that the Cessna 172 looks a bit dirty round the windows and even has scratches in the glass. So I probably will stick with X-Plane 11 until MS FS2020 is fully matured or when X-Plane 12 is introduced.

I own every plane in its marketplace, have over 150 logged hours in it, and am genuinely impressed by it every time I open it.

I still wound up reinstalling X-Plane, and I enjoy flying in it more. Right now, the aircraft available, although pricey, are better. There's nothing even close to the quality that Aerobask provides in MSFS. Flying in X-Plane feels challenging, exciting, and much better. The planes have weight. The process of starting up and managing the planes in flight is more fiddly, and requires you to really understand the planes and their systems.

Maybe one day MSFS will be there. It's not now. While I love to explore the MSFS map, I cannot deny that flying in X-Plane is the most satisfying (even for VFR) and it won't be leaving my hard drive any time soon.

I know it's weird to review this by simply comparing it to something else, but MSFS is a giant in a space that's largely been niche software for av nerds.

You could always stick with the classics like FlightGear or the recently released Aerofly FS 2 Flight Simulator, but what if you want the ultimate flight sim experience?

This is where Laminar Research comes in with their X-Plane 11 flight simulator a modern take on flight sims built for more current hardware. The original version of X-Plane 8.20 for Linux came out in 2005. Since then, the X-Plane series has become the gold standard for flight simulators not only on the Linux desktop but also on Mac and Windows.

What makes X-Plane 11 so unique?

Unlike it's biggest competitor FS2020 (which is only available for Windows), X-Plane is a true flight simulator and not a pick up your game pad and land with 280 knots type of game. It's unmatched in terms of realism, aircraft detail, flight model, customizability and controls. While FS2020 does indeed have a vast selection of available aircraft along with impressive eye-candy scenery (only when you are connected to the MS server); the flight models and instrument responses to control inputs (compared to X-Plane) seem arcade-like at best.

I have approx. 430 flying hours (private aviation) and roughly 1218 hours in X-Plane since version 8.20. Comparing my real world experience to FSX, FS2020, FlightGear, Aerofly FS 2 Flight Simulator and X-Plane 11, I have to say that X-Plane is by far the most realistic and complex flight sim on the market; it will have even the most seasoned flight stick-jockeys in awe of its precision.

Let me elaborate why:
Most flight simulators have based their flight models on a combination of empirical data and computational arrays of data (also known as lookup tables). This can save a lot of time (and therefore money), but it doesn’t get at the individual feel of flying an aircraft.

What sets X-Plane apart from other flight simulators is its use of blade element theory, which actually forms the basis for those data arrays I mentioned earlier. This method involves the breaking down of a propeller blade into smaller parts. From there, the effects of the forces enacted upon the sections of the blade are determined. Once this has been done, the forces are merged along the entire length of the blade and one rotor revolution. By the end of this process, the forces and moments produced by the whole propeller and/or rotor have been obtained.

These forces include but are not limited to:

•Thrust
•Lift
•Force
•Torque/radius
•Drag
•Blade tip speed
•Induced speed
•Angle of attack
•And much more..

X-Plane devs take this process used for propellers and apply it to the entire aircraft. This more intensive form of data gathering creates a truer flight simulator experience. It helps devs & designers create a more “real world” experience than other forms of data gathering used in flight simulators like FlightGear, FS2020, Aerofly FS 2 Flight Simulator and so on.

In addition, X-Plane 11 includes a Plane Maker application to make your own airplanes and helicopters, Airfoil Maker to make airfoils for custom aircraft. This is designed from the ground-up to be an experience you craft for yourself, and others. Also new to X-Plane 11 is Flight School, so now you can go through the basics and complexities of flight to get acquainted with the physics and handling of a single engine airplane or helicopter. With patience and practice, you will be able to figure it out, and it will be well worth it!

Also novice and veteran pilots use X-Plane for training, there are plenty of videos on the internet where you can watch them train and share their experiences.

I can't praise this flight simulator enough. This is a must buy for any aviation enthusiast and Linux flight simmer!

Pros:
Great aerodynamics
Many different planes, 737, 747, cessna 172 etc
Time and weather are well simulated

Cons:
Graphics are a bad, for a late 2016 game
Custom planes and airports are way too expensive

Pricing of custom planes and airports example:
A320: 90 euro
Alicante airport: 20 euro
Berlin airport 30 euro
(WAY TO EXPENSIVE)

Verdict: Don't buy X-plane 11, instead buy Mictorsoft Flight Simulator it has way better graphics.

Further note: The newest Microsoft Fight Simulator wasn't out when i bought X-plane 11, so im stuck with it :)

It is not, however, especially well documented.  Provided aircraft manuals are basic, and teaching myself to fly aircraft I have flown for years in other simulators is frustrated by inadequate checklists and incomplete instructions.  Even ""starting with engines running and electrical systems up"" is insufficient.  It took dozens of hours of trial and error, and searching community advice to work out startup procedures for the King Air 90 which did not exhaust the battery or overload the generators / inverter.  Cabin pressurisation instructions completely neglected to mention turning on bleed-air, for example, or the merits of monitoring cabin temperatures.

I like an active community of supportive enthusiasts, some of whom fly these aircraft professionally, but when a simulator is this detailed and modelled so well, some extra time and effort might be spent on providing equally detailed materials or at least downloadable libraries of checklists for default aircraft.  I came close to giving up on this simulator before I chanced to find videos and casual references in forums which helped me connect the dots.  I expect to keep doing so as I fly and learn to fly new aircraft for this simulator.

""Quite simply the flight dynamics make this a worthy upgrade to FSX or P3D. Add in some great scenery in the way of the free Ortho addon and you've got a great sim!""

HOWEVER, after many months of battling, I have to change my mind entirely.

While I have something like 1000 hours in-game, I'd guess that a good 30% of that was spent in troubleshooting, re-installing, re-configuring, and re-loading after crashes. 

I have spent endless hours trying to get X-plane to run smoothly and predictably with or without plugins, with or without addon scenery, and with or without external programs. I have reached my end and now loading this dated and VERY poorly optimized sim becomes instantly frustrating. 

I have been trying, primarily, to deal with out-of-memory errors wherein memory use spikes and causes a HARD system lock up. I just can't do it anymore and have given up entirely, moving onto MSFS as it is ultra stable and smooth-running for me. 

I know I'm not alone in these issues but we're in the minority. For what it's worth, I've had these same issues on two different desktops and two different laptops, all of which exceed the 'requirements' of the game.

What a lot of people should keep in mind is that X Plane is very mature with nearly infinite amount of resources online AND given it's not extremely recent you have a shot at flying with good frame rates over London or Zurich.

You don't need an expensive cockpit, or controllers, just your touch controllers will do. The graphics are dated, but the game plays well in VR and the cockpits look amazing. If you have scenery files for your desired flight area, it'll make it that much more immersive. 

Be aware though this is a mid to high level gaming experience. Having knowledge of aircraft and air traffic flow is very much needed. This game will not hand hold a novice pilot. 

It def has a steep learning curve so be ready to do research and learn how to control your aircraft. These things are modeled in ""easy mode"" for users, simplifying the controls for a novice pilot. If you're looking for a fully realistic plane, you'll need to buy ones from 3rd party developers. The only down side to this game is if you want the best experience, with the most realistic simulation be ready to fork over money for those plugins. Some are worth it, others are just garbage. 

So far this is the only VR simulation software I've found that doesn't require expensive controllers. I already have the touch controllers so this makes using the virtual cockpit controls perfect. You can interact with every button and knob in the cockpit that is available. Sensitivity is pretty high as well so you'll have to adjust. Once I got the hang of the controls the game was very easy to use.

With all that being said I've spent the first 14 hours of my game play trying to tweak the settings well enough to be able to have decent visuals in VR. The code for the game is highly unoptimized for VR play. I have a beast of a system and can play the game fine on max graphics on flat screen but attempting to do that in VR is impossible. I get 6 FPS on max in VR while flat screen I can lock 185fps which is the max my monitor can do. I'm hoping but not optimistic about VR getting some love later on.

XP11 is the perfect simulator for learning to fly on a Cessna 172.
I use XP11, Gliem XP11 flight training software, Honeycomb Yoke, CH Pedals, custom built throttle and mixture control push rods and Saitek X52 for extra buttons. This is setup to work with Oculus Rift CV1 & Quest 2 with link for simulation in VR.
This makes XP11 the cheapest option to learn to fly & build competency before actually spending money for flight training.

I have 50fps and created 4TB Orthos that cover a bit of Europe and North Africa. I also have installed about 150 mods and made them all work together.

Updated  

half my time on X-play is spent trying to get things to work!
I hate it! 

Forget buying that new plane thats looks great! Why!  Because they are so poorly documented! Devs rely on the public to figure it out!

3rd party planes often use different mechanisms to control plane than default x-plane planes, the result of this is:

1 cant map hardware controls
2 if you save a situation ( like a snapshot of the plane control settings etc) to practice landings, when the plane loads the engines arent running and abruptly crashes! This is because the way that 3rd party planes control the plane.

Unless you fly the real plane, you will struggle looking for info!

Hardware setting keep changing from plane to plane and everytime you start XP up! 

After uninstalling Navigraph SIMLINK, X-Plane closes like it should.

Pros
-The graphics are great, 
-the selection of payware and freeware planes and mods are great, the Zibo mod is great!
-flight simulation seems reasonable, although Ive never flown, heavy metal.

Cons

Hardware support, my CH Pro Pedals very of very limited functionality, I have spent hours trying to get them to work properly searching forums, contacting CH support. Hardware to work properly must be set through X-Plane, which is more problematic than you can imagine. Controlling nosewheel steering, vs rudder. CH claim its plug and play...but it doesnt in X-Plane, does in DCS.
 
Bugs -Aircraft I use are buggy FF B777 et al requires java which is not listed as a requirement, but is required.
Ive had alot of data corruption (often) with my installation and have to verify file integrity before I use it. No other software has this issue, and my disk cant find any disk errors. 

My hardware allows for 60 fps, with 16gb ram, and 100 gb of free space, Ryzen 1600,  so while not a high end box, its above bare minimum spec.

My usb got briefly disconnected while flying while attempting to plug something into the hub, many of my custom settings were lost, took more than an hour to get joystick back. When initially came back on default setting were applied that were in conflict. So much time wasting figuring out silly things.

Couldnt step thru my FMS flight plan because the map wasnt oriented with North at the top. Not documented, search the forum, so time consuming.

Many issues can be solved, but waste enormous amounts of time searching!
Be prepared to spend time searching for solutions why things dont behave, but the X-Plane forum has been helpful.

All software has its bugs, the aircraft bugs are not X-Planes, issues, but associated with the product and that detract from positve experience.

Many of the issues I have had, dont stop me from flying in X-Plane, but they break the immersion.

People with other hardware and payware aircraft may have different experience than me. I must admit I spend more time trying to get my payware to work properly than flying the planes in the vanilla version of X-Plane 11. Some of the default X-Plane 11 planes are quite good, but suffer from less functionality and eye candy than payware.

Here is a link to an online flight simulation game called “Geo Flight Simulator” which looks and controls identically to X-plane 11. It brings the same level of realism in terms of the movement and control of the plane, whilst also providing a large variety of air craft for you to try out and fly. The only difference is that Geo-fs is free, where as X-plane 11 costs $80.00
What I am basically saying is this game is a huge, steaming pile of garbage.
The games price is inexcusable high for the amount of content that it provides. Buying this game is like buying a meal at a five star restaurant, but instead of getting your wagyu beef meal, the waiter just comes up to you and starts punching you in the face whilst insulting your mother. I haven't made this bad of an investment since I sent that Nigerian prince 5 thousand dollars. This game doesn’t redeem its price in any way, shape or form.
It especially sucked playing this game after I had played the online version previously because they are pretty much the exact same game. In fact, I actually got a more positive experience out of the online version than I did out of this game.
I cannot stress this enough. Do not buy this game, what ever you do. If I had to choose between saving my house from burning down in a fire and buying this game again, I would think twice about my decision. This game is offensively over priced. Do yourself a favour and go play the free online version via the link I provided, rather than wasting your money on this heaping pile of feces.
Do not buy this game.

Have you ever wanted to try to land a Boeing 737 on an Aircraft Carrier? If so, this is the game for you! You can practice landings, learn about the basics of control and physics using a variety of general aviation and airliner aircraft that are included by default. There are also a few really, REALLY good free downloads like the Robin DR401, the Yak 18, and the Zlin 142 in case you get bored with the Cessna 172. It also includes jet aircraft, such as the SR-71 Blackbird (which goes very, very, VERY fast).

There is also a lot of payware aircraft available. I purchased the Beechcraft Model 76 Duchess from JustFlight, and it is extremely accurate. Steam gauges, complex engines, and a long checklist with systems that all work properly.

The Bad:

I am using the Thrustmaster Flight Control pack for a control setup. The game integrates relatively well with the controls, though I have encountered a few bugs where my airplane just falls from the sky until I reset the application because of my flight controls.

This is a simulator, and it's not meant to be a ""fun"" game if you are not interested in aviation. You can literally set the auto-pilot on your 737 and go AFK for 2 hours and then come back for the approach and landing. I enjoy General Aviation more than the airliners.

The graphics are kind of bad. This is unfortunate, because it requires hunting around for free content, texture packs, and other modifications if you want to look really nice. Contrast this to the aircraft that are included, which are good enough to stand on their own without requiring free content.

Installing new content requires downloading the content and then manually copying it into the proper file structure. It's a bit annoying and requires some commitment from the user. In one case I had to fiddle with some files and copy/paste between folders to get a Livery to work properly. The Livery in question was the Norwegian Airlines livery for the default 737. It required copying some normal maps from the Quantas Livery into the Norwegian Livery folder to remove an annoying American Airlines logo on the default 737 livery normal map.

Conclusion:

A great simulator for aviation. Though a bit dated, the systems are more accurate than those in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. Microsoft Flight Simulator also has fewer payware aircraft, more aircraft with Garmin G1000 suites vs more steam gauges available in X-Plane 11. I have both games and I play MSFS 2020 for the eye candy and I play X-Plane to practice flying the Duchess.",1597552274,1600838014,True,1,0,0.498074620962142944,0,True,False,False

Great that you guys added Vulkan to greatly improve performance. Win 7 is however left out of this and Win 8.1 support for Vulkan is iffy at best. If you are going to drop support for these operating systems I feel that it should be advertised as such (I understand 11.50 still supports OpenGL on Win7 but this is frankly disappointing), you should have updated your RECOMMENDED specs to show only Win 10 as being the ""preferred"" OS. Every single one of your devs have stated that Win 7 is a ""dead"" OS and as such they will not being spending any extra time to support new features for it which I understand but that needs to be communicated ON THE STORE PAGE.

I have a private pilot certificate and bought a Vive Pro, new computer, and x-plane 11 to help train for an instrument rating.
First, even if your computer is VR ready, this game will bring it to it's knees.  It's extremely resource intensive.  It takes almost 5 minutes to boot up from cold, and sometimes I have to restart the computer before attempting to play.  Yes, you can turn down the resolution and it will improve the frame rate and it will load faster, but at that point the graphics become far too primitive in my opinion.
As to the actual gameplay, all aircraft are FAR TOO FORGIVING on the landings.  Not very realistic at all.  Try that in a real 172 and you'll be buying airplane parts.  
The interiors look good.  Too good - I've never been in a NEW plane, it was interesting!
As far as the intended purpose for me, it was fine.  I can fly all I want and not pay 140 per hour plus safety pilot so I can get hood time.  I can adjust the weather and go to places I'm not familiar with.
I believe there is an online community with ATC, but I don't know how to make this work.  There is plenty of users and active forum so the answers are out there.
Well worth $60, but I'd pay 10 times that for something BETTER.",1599314183,1599314183,True,1,0,0.505928874015808105,0,True,False,False

It is one of two major PC flight simulators that have dominated the civil flight sim market for so many years. However, I have never liked some aspects of it very much and have therefore spent very little time flying X-Plane over the years. In fact, I have only owned two versions: 8 and 11.

To be fair, I am primarily a combat flight simmer and right now DCS World is the simulator I fly for several hours almost every night. But FSX/Prepar3d has been the better civil sim for me because of the 3rd party aircraft and systems addons: I can fly F-4 Phantoms whose flight and systems modeling are almost equal to DCS World, especially with VRS TacPack installed. Whereas the default F-4 Phantom in X-Plane has a laughable flight model and I have never bothered to try any X-Plane payware aircraft.

Other than the area of military aircraft, X-Plane can rival or beat FSX/P3d with free addons and/or payware. It is a matter of personal preference and experience balancing the detail and realism versus system performance. In either flight sim series, you can turn up the graphics so high that even the most expensive gaming PCs will slow to a crawl. For VR, X-Plane has an edge in performance, especially with the new Vulkan support.

If you are like me, then you love PC flight simulation, have adequate funds, and don't worry about which sim is better, you just buy them all and fly them as you see fit. Which brings me full circle: how could I not vote ""yes"" for one of the biggest and best flight simulators available even if I don't prefer it over my other sims and don't fly it very often.",1599307661,1599307661,True,1,0,0.505928874015808105,0,True,False,False

Nothing is accurate. Cities, towns, I know of in my home area are either not there, or are represented by a single road texture, and like, 5 houses. For a city of 40,000+ people. 

It's just.. really weak.

I don't like that to get a good experience, a realistic experience, especially with commercial flights - you need to BUY addons, mods, content the game really, really, should have built in.

1) The menu system - is a... it's not awesome. It's some kind of a custom controls scheme that's just hard to master. 
2) Bring your own ""everything"". In order to make this sim look good, you need to download your own world mesh, process photo-textures from Bing on your own and download planes on your own... The default stuff is just... bad.
3) It's a resource hog - once you do get the textures and everything it need insane amount of RAM just to display your initial surroundings. 
4) It supposedly has superior to FSX physics simulation of plane surfaces (i.e. it uses simulated surfaces instead of tabular data). But then real pilots always say that planes don't really handle like they do in X-Plane so... I guess it's a bit off.

Microsoft's venerable Flight Simulator X required massive help from 3rd-party developers and genius hackers in order to get it to work properly, and for the past 5-6 years, after MS gave up on flight sims, X-Plane went on to surpass it in almost every way. Sure, Prepar3D has done an amazing job keeping the bare bones of FSX alive, but the general public will never embrace the cost of their model. X-Plane is the cream of the crop...for one more week as of this posting.

On August 18, 2020 Microsoft's newest flight sim will be released and it looks unbelievably amazing. If it's all that and more, X-Plane 11 will appear to be on it's last legs. But, it's not dead yet. It will be within a couple of years, but it's got some life left in it, particularly if MS blows the launch of it's new juggernaut.

I am fully on board Microsoft's train of flight-sim greatness, but will absolutely not be deleting X-Plane 11. I've simply invested too much money and time into building that world. Laminar may soon be scrambling to keep up with the new king of sims, but they have nothing to be ashamed of.

I've had a love/hate relationship with this game since I first played it.  The physics and controls were WAY different than FSX (not a surprise, of course).  Matter of fact, I actually refunded X-P about a day after I first downloaded it, then reconsidered and was glad I did.

Overall it's been fun and a decent product that has provided many hours of enjoyment.  However, I've had a lot of issues with it.  Installing some DLC, such as planes or airports, is pretty simple, but due to the order in which the DLC is loaded when X-P starts, you may want a special utility that assists in putting the load into the correct order.  Downloading and using scenery can be another issue altogether - that's not simple at all.  And X-P's load times are a real problem (although admittedly I obviously have no idea what FS's load times will be.)  Sometimes I'll start X-P and go get something to drink, check my email, see if it's raining outside, then head back to the PC to find that it just finished loading - and I have a decent near-high end system.  And then there's the endless pursuit of that elusive high FPS.  Sometimes my FPS has been good, and my flights fine.  Sometimes (especially in VR) my flights have been unbearable due to the low FPS.  I have tried several of endless combinations of graphics settings and NVidia settings and finally get it right, only to find that with the next beta release, I was back to square one.

X-P's scenery is average at best, which pretty much forces you to download 3rd party products.  I'll be the first to say I'm not sure if I'll see the detail you see in the FS trailers, but even if it's close, it'll be light-years ahead of X-P.  Admittedly, I have no idea if FS and its DLC and load times will be easier/better.  But I knew one thing through all of this -- if there had been a better product than X-P available over the last two years, I would have bought it and played it instead.  So we'll see.  If FS is all it's been hyped to be, then it's so long X-P.  If not, then I guess I'll be back.

Edit - I wanted to add one other point about X-P, and unfortunately it is not a good one.  The ATC in this game is absolutely awful.  One big complaint is that the ATC will advise descent to, say, 9K feet.  Uh, what about that mountain that has now appeared in front of me?  You want me to also change my heading too, right?  Nope.  I wait for the hole to appear in the mountain, but I haven't seen it yet.  The second problem is that for some reason, ATC will tell you to alter your course or descend, then a few SECONDS later, tell you to resume your own navigation.  This happens on EVERY flight, so I end up ignoring ATC and landing blind.  These and other ATC complaints are well-documented on the X-P forums, and the response from the X-P junkies is to download a 3rd party product and all will be well with the world.  Well I shouldn't have to download 3rd party products to FIX what Larimar should have already fixed years ago.

Ugh... so you see my love/hate relationship with it, which lately has been more hate.",1596215907,1596655837,False,145,8,0.661227226257324219,0,True,False,False

My respect goes out to all the content creators - special mention to Zibo and their B737, which for a freeware add-on is simply phenomenal. I can also recommend Toliss' A319/321, who also show great detail and realism. 

For reference, I run a Ryzen 7 3800X, 32GB 3200 MHz RAM, and an RTX 2070 Super - frames are easily over 60fps at QHD resolution, with the Zibo and Toliss aircraft sitting at around 40-50, so for any payware/detailed add-ons, I might recommend a fairly powerful rig, but for playable frames at a lower resolution, nothing too fancy is required. I'm also running pre-Vulkan Xplane, so expect to see fps improvements when Vulkan becomes available soon.

Every time I fly the Cessna 172, whose identifier is N172SP, there is always ANOTHER airplane with the same identifier (AI) coming out, coincidentally, from my same airport. The worst part is that the air traffic controller gives indications to me which the other airplane responds, or sometimes gives indications to the other airplane, which I am asked by the UI to read back. It's incredibly frustrating, and something you would never see in Flight Simulator X happening.
Another bug is that when using VR, the game will sometimes randomly crash. I can't pinpoint the root cause. VR was the main reason why I bought this game.
I have also noticed that the taxi glowing line sometimes won't show up, or sometimes will flicker. I have tried to find a fix on the internet, but haven't found anything that works.
I find the lack of Graphics configuration options disappointing. I had to download plugins to allow me to control that. It's nice that plugins exist, but I have been wasting time doing things that should be available in the factory version.
I like the integration with the Saitek/Logitech yoke and pedals. The buttons are automatically assigned to the most adequate function, which is something FSX does not do.
I also have to accept that the realism is a bit better here than in FSX, but then again, FSX is from 2006, so a long time has passed to allow XP11 to do things better.

Really surprised to find people still commenting on my original review from 2017, so I thought it is time to post an update and to answer some of the more recent questions posted in the comments.

Since my original review was written, the experimental flight model has started to bring some much needed improvements to the flight dynamics.  In terms of graphic performance, Vulkan has the ability to vastly improve the overall performance once the bugs are ironed out. 

The LES SF340A and the X-Rotors AW139 are the only mods that keep me returning to X-Plane.  I analyse flight data for a living and the X-Rotors AW139 is as close as it gets on a desktop sim right now.  

It seems my flying background is of interest to some.  So for context, I've a private pilots licence and I've been flying for the last 20 years.  I've flown a number of different aircraft, C150, C152, C172, PA28 Warrior, Europa, Jabiru J400 and X-Air.  I've also been fortunate, over the last 30 years, to have some time in full flight simulators such as the B757, B737-200, BAC1-11, Eurocopter AS332L2, EC225 and H175.  My current aircraft is an X-Air.  

On a more lighthearted aspect, my kids absolutely love X-Plane and for that reason alone I'm changing this from a thumbs down to a thumbs up.  They use X-Plane far more than I do, which partly explains why the use time continues to rise.

I've left my original review below, as is.

******************Original 2017 Review******************************

I write this as someone who is a qualified pilot and am fortunate to have my own real aircraft.  I've also owned and used previous versions of X-Plane since 2004.

I bit the bullet and purchased X-Plane 11 as getting back into flight sims after getting an oculus rift.  First impressions is that X-Plane continues to be resource intensive - needs one heck of a pc to get decent frame rate (I7 6700, 32GB, GTX 980 Ti and it struggles to maintain 30fps unless graphic options are reduced. 

In terms of flight model - still as quirky as ever.  Torque effect is too extreme on the C172 during take-off for example.  On entering a straight and level stall (C172)- it starts ok but then the aircraft loses a significant amount of height during recovery.  Real aircraft - height loss should be around 50 to 100ft if standard recovery actions taken.  Side slipping does not appear to be modelled - somehow managed to maintain and even gain height on the C172 whilst carrying out this manoeuvre.  Other weird effects is the rapid pitch change when going supersonic in the F4 and SR71.  Granted there will be some change, its seems over-exagerated.

On to helicopters - disappointed to see the 'rotation' issue still apparent during start-up (as per previous X-Plane versions).   Was hoping to try the DMO S92 since it was updated for XP11, but that does not work properly in versions 11.1 and 11.2 (main pfd/mfd screens are blank).  Also the DMO S92 rotates very rapidly during engine start - completely unrealistic.

Sounds -very poor.

Scenery - actually the best part of X-Plane, in terms of standard of scenery straight out of the box.  Aberdeen (EGPD) - my home airport,  is pretty well represented - easy to visually navigate the local area.  

VR - recently downloaded the 11.2 beta and have had constant app crashes when using the Oculus rift.  When it does work, it looks quite good.  As with other simulators - instruments are not crisp, but to be fair they are better than other sims.  Being able to use the touch controllers to interact with the aircraft, without buying yet more 3rd party software, is good.  

In fact its a shame as with VR support X-Plane has the foundations of a fantastic sim.  For me the biggest let down is the flight model - its still too quirky, and the default sounds.  Whilst the graphics have progressed over the years, the same cannot be said for the flight model or sounds.  The final surprise is the cost of add-ons - 3rd party X-Plane aircraft seem to have a premium attached to them.",1514520942,1595276439,True,1,0,0.516129076480865479,28,True,False,False

Vulcan Update Review:
Anti aliasing not working. Jaggy textures even after 16x anti aliasing and 8x MSAA + SSAO. 

Gameplay Review:
Everything that comes with the simulator by default sucks. I had to install ~180gb of additional freeware plugins and sceneries to make it feel more immersive and life like. 
Lacks multiplayer. But I use IVAO and VATSIM. So thats not an issue.
ATC is really bad. We cannot request runway change or request to follow SID while exiting airspace. I almost everytime end up reprogramming my FMS while I'm on the taxiway because of different runway being assigned everytime.
And the tower controller won't respond when we hold short off runway. They would only respond only when I enter the runway even though the ground controller asks me to Hold short runway and switch to tower.
No menu for ground services.
There should also be type rating tutorials for each aircraft. That would make life so easy when switching to different aircraft. 
Turbulences are not simulated well and there are very limited captain speeches.

Unlike FSX (either heritage or SE) it runs on modern hardware and Windows 10 without any hassle. Out of the box, the default graphics look much better and crisper than any of the MSFS versions and the supplied aircraft are also nicely put together, particularly the sounds - unlike MS' default jet spool which sounds like it was sampled from a vacuum cleaner.

However my enthusiasm was short lived. Most of the key commands are unassigned, leaving the user to choose the input - usually at a critical time in flight. The list of tutorials is very short and specifically there is nothing to transition you into the jet liners once you get used to the hedge clippers. There's no flight planner so you either choose an airport and take off to fly randomly, or rely on third party software or sites to compile a flight plan which can be imported to the GPS or FMC system on your chosen aircraft. However Laminar appear not to have chosen to update the location database and the FMC generates dire warnings about your nav data being out of date. Hey guys, I'm buying this brand new.

Once airborne, if you save and resume a flight later, you may find if you chose the cold and dark start option, your engines are shut down in mid air. Even without that, you will likely find the autopilot and autothrottle has switched off leaving you to cycle through the disengage sequence before it works again. Crash detection is also virtually non existent. A couple of times I crashed by accident, not only was there no damage r a game over message, but the aircraft just continued merrily along the ground passing through buildings and trees at 140 knots with no collision detection whatsoever. Utter rubbish!

Amateur, sloppy and if I had to be honest it's more of an arcade plane game than a simulator. I would say it is to flight simming what Trainz is to train simming against MSTS or the Dovetail TS, but that would be insulting to Trainz. I can't help notice that post summer sale, this game (sorry it's not a sim) has gone back up to the full price of £55... What?! No way it's worth that, in fact i don't even consider it worth the £36 I actually paid for it. Unfortunately the 2 hour window to refund has long come and gone, so guess I'm stuck with this lemon in my Steam collection. In all honesty I cannot recommend it.

My Initial Impressions:
I started VR 3 years ago and always wanted a decent VR flying sim game, now I'm sporting an RTX 2070 Super, I final found one with X-Plane 11.
The immersion factor of flying in this game with VR is AMAZING!
The game took me about 2 hours to figure out how to set up the controls for the Rift S controllers, in my video above I show you how to get up and running in 10 mins!",1594399195,1594399195,True,4,0,0.555846869945526123,0,True,False,False

I strongly recommend this game to people that have a passion for simming, however be prepared to take some time to get everything setup as the sensitivity and controls require some tweaking to get the best outcome. If i could rate this game out of 10 i would probably give it 11 as its just absolutely stunning considering there are so many freeware addons that can enhance the game so much. You will need a decent PC to run this game, I am currently using a i7-7700k and a 1070 FTW to run this game and i get around 40-50 FPS with my addons so before purchasing just make sure you can run it as it has quite a steep price tag. The game standard comes at £54.99 which is not bad considering how good it is, but in the sale I managed to pick it up for around £31.99 so if it is on sale then I highly recommend picking it up however if it isn't then maybe hold off until it is as £54.99 is quite a lot of money. Overall this game is a very big upgrade from the previous XPlane 10 (which I also own), the game it self is just so much more refined than XPlane 10 and Laminar Research have really done a great job with this sim. I am sure ill have 1000 hours in no time ;) 

Hopefully this review helped you out deciding whether to buy this game.

Pros -
Nice Graphics (Definitely better than FSX.)
Great Flight Physics.
The developers are putting out different updates to the airports and the environment which evolves the world according to the real word data.
Base planes are realistic and are simulated almost fully.
Great Community that provide modding which helps to expand the whole game to a great extend.
You can also dogfight in this game with military jets if you turn the option ""Enable Combat"" in the AI Menu on.

Cons -
If you are a FSX player and you are changing to XPlane you will find the controls are a bit different than FSX
(There is also an option to change the layout of the key binds according to FSX but some stuff can provide some difficulty to play the game smoothly.)
Requires a Joystick. The game requires a joystick and if you like me that flies planes with a mouse and keyboard just like FSX then this game can become challenging as the game will provide you the mouse yoke which is challenging (and there is no option to turn it off until you add a joystick to the game.)
Lastly I don't like the fact that you have to assign the AI traffic aircrafts individually.
And also the in game ATC sucks because you need to file an IFR route you can't use to fly VFR. In my opinion FSX has a way better ATC than X Plane.

Sure you could hold out for Microsoft's new 2020 simulator, or you could play a great sim today.  I'm a fan of FSX and I've sunk a lot of money in to that simulator, but I wasn't getting what I was looking for from the environmental realism.  X-plane 11 give you a 64-bit application that leverages the latest hardware, has plenty of add-ons, both payware and MANY free (quality) add-ons, this is worth your investment.  Beyond the quality flight simulation, it brings more realism to the environment that you just can't achieve in FSX.  However, it's not perfect.  My biggest complaint is ground services.  Admittedly, it's a flight simulator and not a ground services simulator, because FSX and the GSX addon are superior in the ground services category.  I'm a jetliner simmer so I want as much realism as possible from the jetliners.  The aircraft are not at the level of PMDG simulations, but the Zibo 737-800 is very close and offers additional immersion realism than I was achieving in FSX.  I put off buying x-plane for a while.  Now, I wish I had bought it sooner.  I'm only 53 hours in and I'm loving this simulator and the enhanced world realism I've achieved.  It's time.

One of the many pluses of X-Plane 11 is it's stunning visuals (this needs a very powerful PC to run smoothly, but Vulcan API Optimisation is coming this year which will make the simulator run loads better on standard machines). Even the default game is very good looking and with pure freeware you can make the game look stunning. However this covers one of the disappointing aspects of X-Plane, which is the default bitmaps like clouds and skycolours, which can at times, take away from the overall immersion sometimes. If this really annoys you the first payware addon I would recommend buying is UltraWeatherXP, which adds better clouds, skycolours, water depiction and sky effects. This one addon takes care of the sky as a whole and all for the fairly modest price of £30 (this might seem a lot but it is one of the cheapest addons of this nature and in my opinion, the best).  The best tool for enhancing X-Plane's default ground textures is with Forkboy's Ortho4xp, which introduces powerful software to generate real satellite imagery for anywhere in the world and can be downloaded for free. This can make a Freeware airport, paired with Ortho4xp look very authentic for no money, even better when it's paired with payware airports and UltraWeatherXP.

To match the freeware scenery quality in a free aircraft you can get the Zibo Mod 737-800, which is a modified default aircraft (which are by the way pretty good). The detail on this free addon is on par with the PMDG 737 (an £80 addon) and is being updated all the time, not only to iron out bugs, but also to add new features. These freeware plugins in itself make the simulator worth a buy for anyone out there looking for a very real simulation of the boeing 737-700,-800 or -900.

But perhaps the sector where X-Plane 11 beats Prepar3d decisively is the flight model, which is a mile ahead of anything offered by Lockheed or Microsoft. This is especially noteable in light aircraft like the cessna 172, the default c172 is done very well and it's  flight characteristics can really be felt through the controls and according to real world pilots, portrays realistic airflow over surfaces. It achieves this by running a completely independent airfoil maker programme which simulates airflow over wing and control surfaces, giving the most accurate flight model simulation in the consumer industry.

The only thing in this simulator that I am disappointed with is the ATC, it is unintuitive and really doesn't do the game justice, there is however Vatsim servers for this sim if you are interested in ATC with real people controlling.

Also it is worth mentioning that the New Microsoft Flight Simulator is coming out this year, so if you are short on money or just want to spend more on the new MS Flight Simulator when it comes out, it might be worth holding back on purchasing X Plane.

One thing I can't stress enough is that this is not a game, for any people out there just looking to have some fun on flight sim multiplayer, buy FSX, it's cheaper and better suited for your needs. This is a simulator and as always in these types of programmes, the learning curve is very steep for a new player. And again for somebody just starting out, who is unsure weather they really want to get into flight simulation. I once again recommend FSX and a cheap HOTAS (Hands On Throttle And Stick) setup for the same price as X-Plane 11 on its own. However if you already know you will invest hundreds of hours into this genre, or perhaps have in an old programme like FSX, this simulator is definitely for you, and with more and more addons coming out for X-Plane as it becomes more of a mainstream product, I can't recommend this simulator enough.",1567939544,1593867211,True,37,2,0.794333338737487793,2,True,False,False

I have been playing FSXSE since 2017. I have 80+ hours in that game. I see a lot of people talking about how X plane 11 is better. It looks better than FSX but I wouldn't say it's a big difference. The planes look nice. Some of the graphical effects look nice. 

The problem for me is the game just felt so bare bones. There isn't much there. It's nice that they have flight school with tutorials in it cause you will need them. It's not as simple as FSX can be. 

But there really isn't much there. There is only a few planes, though the few I used looked good. There aren't even any missions you can do. In FSX they have a whole bunch of missions or whatever you want to call them. So when you get bored with the free flight you can go do something with some objectives and a reason for playing the game. Free flight is fun but only for a while. It gets boring in FSX as well. I can only fly around and look at the game world for so long. 

With FSX you get more planes to fly and if you look around you can find some really nice freeware planes that are even better than some payware planes. Like the F-14 you can get for free. The amount of planes in this game is limited. Though it does give you an F-4 Phantom with the game. I had to buy one for FSX. 

It's also a bit too realistic for me. Like I said above I am not looking to become a pilot.

FSXSE is cheaper, has more planes, it has the missions you can do. You can get some really nice free planes for it. Sure it doesn't look quite as good as Xplane 11 but FSX was released in 2006. 

Xplane 11 isn't a bad flight sim. It's just a bit lacking. It's also not really the sim for me. 

But because I find it lacking I am going to give it a thumbs down.

-CONS-
- If you want ""better"" planes than the vanilla planes, it WILL cost more money. 
- If you want better scenery for airports .. This will most likely cost money. 
- Planes that comes with XP11 is so-so at best. 
- If you want your sim to look beautiful, you gotta research for quiet a bit. Tho, there is ofc forums etc that can help you. 

-PROS/ should do-
- Download the ZIBO mod. They got B737, B738 and B739, totally free and is study level. 
- There are plenty of free scenery that is good. Don't have to use money on that. 
- You can get better scenery overall with orthophotos, you can download from others or get Ortho4XP and generate yourself.

Pros:

- You can fly anywhere in the world unlike some other simulators where you get portions of the world
- Super realistic in terms of physics
- A huge selection of add-ons you can get (both free and payware)
- Works well with VR headset (Oculus Rift S)

Cons:

- It can get expensive once you get add ons
- Lack of default plane selections
- Wish the weather apperence was a bit more realistic, I ended up paying $35 for better looking clouds lol
- The ATC is way too complicated unlike FSX
- No built in flight planning (You would need a 3rd party software)

Overall

If you're a pilot irl or wanting to fly irl then this is the perfect simulator for you but if you're like me that just wants to play casually and fly around freely then it might take some time to learn and get used to. I fully recommend getting a joystick or yoke if you don't have one already.

If you're planning to buy a yoke I recommend getting the Honeycomb as it is well made and sturdy unlike the cheap plastic looking Logitech yoke

For making a flight plan I recommend using Little Navmap as it's very straight foward, easy to use, and can be tracked where you are on the map ingame

The weather and the flight models are highly immersive. The ATC for VFR flights is on the weak side, but using VATSIM, it is no factor for my use. If you know how to program, you can easily access the data generated by the sim, to power your own applications (map, gps, etc). I only flew Microsoft Flight Sim X besides this one, and it is just not playing in the same league, although way older. For those who are real professional pilots, waiting for FS 2020 to release: considering that the marketing around it is mostly focused on visuals (which look absolutely fantastic), and not really on what makes or break a realistic flight simulator, I'd say go for X-Plane meanwhile! It can only be a great experience! If you are a casual FS user, I'd recommend sticking to Microsoft products, as they have always been less realistic, but more accessible (and still great to practice procedures).",1593120668,1593120668,True,27,1,0.739846646785736084,1,True,False,False

- X-Plane 11 is an excellent software full of API and documentation
- Passionate community of developers who provide plugins, scenery and airplanes for the game. Most of them frequently update their plugins.
- Lots of commercial developers who improve every aspect of the game but obviously at a cost
- Many YouTubers like flightdeck2sim are more than happy to support others like my self to learn how to fly the more realistic community made airplanes.
- Integrated with third party payware Navigraph which help you to actually have updated airracs and flight graphs but obviously at a cost.
- You can buy lots of DLC directly from the steam store of X-Plane 11. So you don't need to follow any complicated installation instructions some plugins/mods require.

CONS:
- Developers seem demotivated when receiving negative feedback about features of the game or new update; look at the developers blog, they always take a passive aggressive tone with those leaving comments.
- Also when the developers are aware a feature in the game is so obviously bad, they seek feedback from the users and say ""Don't just say it simply sucks"". In my opinion they should be contracting out industry experts to tell them how ATC could work in the game.
- The ATC sucks
- AI planes fly with no logic, randomly popping up around you during flight and also consumes loads of FPS.
- The scenery is auto generated and really just flat, boring, unrealistic.
- There is a popular community made software to generate realistic scenery for the game but the output from the software requires a lot of time and HDD space.
- The community developers have patched everything missing in this game requiring a great deal of patience to deal with installing everything require; for example, you might download your favourite airport but the developer used scenery libraries from several other sources thus requiring you to download all of those.
- The real time world weather inside the game is horrible, so unrealistic and not matching real world weather, let alone the dynamics of weathers on this earth.
- You need to purchase a third party subscription to have up to date airracs making navigation in the world realistic.
- No multiplayer support by the developers. You need to use community multiplayer plugins/networks.
- To be honest, I just can't get my head around the 3 or 4 seperate plugins required to go on these multiplayer networks
- Then the actual flying experience on those networks can be laughable, graphics of other users are rediculous. For example, usually you cant see the gears of the other planes... and some users treat the game like GTA5.

So the game doesn't really match the product description. It's sold as some realistic flight sim but you need to spend 200 hours to jump all the hurdles to make it passable and if you have a deep wallet you can buy the weather, airplanes, scenery which actually make the game become a truly realistic flight sim.

A bit of an initial learning curve to manage if you’re unfamiliar with aviation, but there is still flexibility between simple to fly aircraft that get you going quickly versus more complex aircraft that require deeper systems knowledge.  Peripherals are easy to configure if you have them. My only knock would be that plugins/scenery (which are nearly a requirement for the best experience) can be a bit tedious to set up, as they require editing in the file system instead of an in-game interface. Once you understand how these add-ons fit in the game files, the process is straightforward, and generally it is only a one time install. There is also a thriving forum community for help with troubleshooting or discovering new add-ons.

I have purchased earlier versions of X-plane over the years, and not experienced much luck with them.   I'm still not sure why.   Somehow, my gaming hardware just didn't work well with the earlier versions.

But then I found, quite some time ago, that X-plane 11 ran well enough on my gaming laptop to please at least me.  And I ran it on that gaming laptop for a time.

But recently I purchased a strong gaming desktop and an HTC Vive to enable virtual reality.   And from that point forward this game began to astonish.

It took a few tries to get the hang of using VR with X-Plane 11.  Indeed, initially I was a little frustrated.  But I'm glad I stuck with it.   Learning that I could still use the mouse cursor to control the switches, while I used a joystick to control, began to make everything easier.  The virtual reality experience began to be amazing, and with the Vive headset on if felt remarkably  like I was actually inside and flying the plane.

A few minutes ago I landed a float plane in (virtual) Alaska.  I recognized the area from the air (I've been to the area I flew over), and marveled at how real everything seemed to me.

There is now a growing number of decent programs for VR, but X-plane does, at least for me, ""take the cake.""  I've never been happier with a piece of software in my life.  The difficulties that I initially experienced were the result only of my own temporary inexperience with the software, and they all were solved with continued practice and thought. 

Your own experience might be different from mine -- after all, everybody has different equipment and amounts of patience, and my own experience got markedly better when I changed rigs.  But X-Plane 11 will remain on my computer until there is an X-Plane 12.  I award this software 5 out of 5 perfect landings.

UPDATE 040919:  Just landed my little Cessna at the airstrip in Gibraltar.  Got out of the plane and climbed up the rock of Gibraltar and sat at the top of it, looking down at the town below.  The graphics aren't perfect, but they are certainly sufficient.  With this game and virtual reality, and a bit of practice figuring out how to make it all work (have patience), this game becomes a window on the world.   I won't live long enough to actually travel the entire world.  But in virtual reality, I can go just about anywhere I would want to go, and it feels remarkably lifelike.  Google Earth street view, it's not.   But, on the other hand, I can fly in and land with the Cessna, and get a pretty good sense of the geography.   It's worth far more than the price of admission, and it's both educational and interesting.   Technology is going far beyond what I would have envisioned as a child, long ago.

UPDATE 092919.  Reading some other reviews today, I noted that a few did not like the VR experience.  I find that genuinely surprising.   I hope enough patience is being used to figure out how to make this work, before coming to a negative conclusion.  I enabled the mouse cursor to work while in VR, and I use the mouse to flip switches, and a joystick to control the planes control surfaces.   I also use a Vive controller to ""move around"" outside of the plane.

I was initially frustrated trying to sit myself well in the virtual cockpit.   But I eventually figured it out: I click the small button (with three lines upon it) above the round control disc on the Vive Controller, then select views and then cockpit view.   I end up sitting in the cockpit, well positioned.

To get out of the plane and move around, I use the controller too -- in the normal way one moves around in many virtual reality titles.  

Today I took off from La Guardia (using the simulator, of course) and flew around New York.  The scenery has apparently been greatly improved.  Landing in Central Park allowed me to then ""walk around"" the city.   Again, of course, with the simulator, since one cannot land in Central Park, I assume, without making many, many policemen and other officials quite unhappy.   :)

This program seems to get better and better, from an already good start.

UPDATE 6/6/20.  Staying at home.   Don't much care for television.  Can only play so much chess and read so many books.  What to do?  A few days ago I started an attempt to fly around the world in a (virtual) Cessna 172, using Xplane-11 and a Vive VR set up.  Yeah, it's Walter Mitty on steroids.  But how many people still know who Walter Mitty is?

Landed at night in a small field in Kansas.   Eastward bound.  I'll deal with the Atlantic when I come to it.

269950,65649833,76561198977480000,0,19,1788,0,640,1705252664,"Having flown and trained on the Cessna 152 in reality, I can say that the VR capabilities of the X-Plane 11 have gone beyond my expectations.

1) When in the virtual cockpit it feels as though in the real one. You can look in all directions and see the appearance of difference in distance when you look out the windows etc. It is amazing, it is as though VR has been designed for the ultimate flight simulation training.

2) In the virtual cockpit ideally you can utilise the VR controller to be used as your hand to press switches and knobs and to trim the pitch etc. This is essential to train muscle memory and training in X-Plane VR muscle memory will give you the ability to keep current when one cannot fly in real for longer periods for whatever reason.

3) Using the VR controller is not the best way to control the yoke, as you do not have any feedback of resistance. A joystick without resistance feedback is better as it does offer some resistance. A special yoke that has full on resistance feedback were you have to trim the aircraft to relieve the tension is highly recommended for more realistic training.

4) The movement of the aircraft as perceived with the eyes is nearly identical to the real machine. This really knocked me off the seat, as in my perception it felt the aircraft moved nearly exactly the same as the real machine, despite I flew on the less powerful 152, whereas X-Plane 11 has the 172 version. In my experience the two versions of the Cessna are nearly identical in the actual movement, the 172 has that extra power, it seems as though you can be more aggressive with it.

To conclude, giving that you have a realistic yoke and a relatively high resolution VR headset (I use the Samsung Odyssey and it is sufficient with an overall good quality. I would say that is the minimum for a headset) and pedals would be handy, you can use the X-Plane 11 as a form of training to fly a Cessna when you cannot fly in real. For that purpose it is AMAZING! If you have not flown a real aircraft for a sufficient number of hours to start getting the gist behind flying an aircraft with the different procedures and the overall feeling, then it might be more difficult for you to use this simulation to what it has been designed for, but still it will prepare you to some extent for the real thing. For those who already have some ability to fly aircraft this is your baby to keep on progressing in flight training. The only difference I would say is the fact that you do not feel the actual aircraft move through the air with all the G-forces and forces that are part of it. Other than that it is the best flight simulation VR training tool I have come about and I have been using flight simulation since I was a 7 year old kid, starting with the very primitive flight simulator for my Amstrad CPC-464, moving unto various military aircraft simulations (F-16 Falcon; F/A-18 Hornet; A6 Intruder & F4 Phantom) and Airbus 320 for my Amiga 500, then when eventually I got into the PC realm I started off with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002, 2004 & X. Out of the Microsoft Flight Simulators I found 2004 the best of them all. There is something about MSFS 2004, the graphics and physics and the realism of the clouds and also MSFS 2004 has some of the most realistic expansions, such as the Boeing 727 Professional & Airbus 340 Professional. Basically these expansions are 100% replicas of the real machines with all the buttons and knobs 100% functional in the 3D cockpit and the controls and physics of the airliners are as closely imitated to the real machines. It has even been tested by real airliner pilots and engineers. Anyone interested to become an airliner pilot, I recommend you buy yourself a second hand copy (CEX sells them) of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004 and buy yourself some of the Professional Expansions (CEX has them on sale sometimes also).

Eventually on my journey in flight simulations, I have discovered the existence of X-Plane and my first version that I bought was X-Plane 10 which is really good. X-Plane was certainly superior in realism to MS Flight Sim, except for the professional expansions for MSFS 2002/2004. I used to use both simulators interchangeably as they would both offer something to learn from. Nonetheless, since I started to train to fly the real thing, I noticed how flying in the flight simulation was much more difficult, because I was unable to feel the aircraft and until I got this new version of X-Plane 11 I was unable to use the flight simulators as I used to in the past as it didn't feel the same anymore. Now, with X-Plane 11 VR capability and the actual realism of controls and all the points I have mentioned above, it is a truly valuable tool for real pilots in training. Thank you for such an amazing simulator and anyone that would not recommend this simulator, simply never really trained on the real aircraft, it's just a fact. If you are interested more in the fanciest graphics or scenery and many aircraft to choose from and not the realism, then maybe this is not the simulator for you. From me this simulator is 10/10.

Make sure you have a powerful enough computer. I have a i5-8600k, Asus ROG Strix GTX 1070, 16GB RAM (3200MHz) and a gaming motherboard.

The true purpose of this sim is to give you as accurate a flight sim model as possible.  I think they have done a very good job of that.  The software is very powerful and you are able to replicate many things that will make the experience very enjoyable.  

My complaints though are still as follows:

I have a 2080ti, Intel 9700k, 32GB DDR4 and an SSD.  I run the game in 2k with eye candy turned on and the frames can be  really bad around cities even with the brand new Vulkan patch.   Flying over Toronto in 2k with higher graphic settings and I'm at 31 fps in Vulkan and even less when sitting on the runway.  The same when flying over London or other cities.  In fairness, I enjoy heli's so I fly below 2500 feet.  If you are flying up at 20,000 or higher or over sparse landscape I jump up into the 80's but it's not why I purchased two paid helicopter modules.

I'm also very disappointed in the way the scenery is generated.  Again, if you are at 20 or 30,000 feet everything looks fine but get down near the ground and wow.  The roads all look like they were laid out by a dev on a bad acid trip.  The roads have no order to them.  they're just  generated in a willy- nilly fashion or go absolutely nowhere.  Railway lines can just end like cliffs even in areas of paid content and you will see roads on 45 degree angles like a Nascar track or just nonsense elevations.  You need to pay hundreds of dollars to get this game resembling what an area really looks like and the satellite data you can download looks really bad down low in a helicopter and takes up TONS of space on your HD.

I downloaded the free Orbx southern England scenery and it certainly helps but you will still find really strange roads and railways.  The trees are still cardboard cutouts and water is just painted on the landscape with no actual waves or moving boats.  

I don't know how bad things look in other civilian simulators as this was my first but this is not up to the level of military sims like Digital Combat Simulations.   I know this is a civilian simulator as opposed to military but running so poorly with mediocre at best scenery makes is dissappointing.  As I said, you can download improved scenery both for free and paid but it will take up hundreds of gigs on your hard drive to improve anything to a slightly better level.  

I can fly anything from an F18 to a Huey in DCS with graphics at max in 2k with proper looking scenery, animated water that I can fly right down between moving waves in huricane winds and moving boats that pitch etc. etc. etc. all at 100 frames per second.  They  even have fully animated ground crew on the aircraft carriers.   There is just no comparison as far as immersion goes.

Microsoft's new 2020 flight sim so will be the deciding factor of whether I spend any more money on Xplane 11.  I want to actually fly over my own house or anywhere else in the world accurately mapped with realistic  visuals and hopefully much better performance.  I give XPlane 11 a big thumbs up in the flight department but not so much in the immersion and eye candy department.  Maybe they will up their game with some new healthy competition.",1587818421,1590585666,True,0,0,0.480058968067169189,0,True,False,False

[h1]Some positive points[/h1]
  - Product seems to be built up from scratch with complete passion. Something that is, unfortunately, severely lacking in the overall software market (I guess outside of that as well).
  - (Almost) [b]fully-clickable 6DOF cockpits[/b] much like in DCS World, [i]including TrackIR support[/i] (protocol-wise, opentrack works wonders).
  - Performance [i]was[/i] a problem before Vulkan (11.50+, currently beta), I couldn't get above 20 FPS with medium settings but now I can run the sim at the full 50+ FPS with everything on max.
  - Sounds. [b]The sounds seem to be [i]spot[/i] on.[/b] Haven't gotten any aircraft other than the ones present in the base of XP11, but the 737 sounds 100% like the real thing (likely actual recordings).
  - [b]In the settings, controllers have full descriptions and visual indications[/b] of where each button/axis is on the actual controller, which makes it easy to (re-)assign buttons/axes.
  - [b]Multi-monitor support[/b], beautifully represented in the settings. Meaning you can, for example, have one monitor setup for situational awareness (map + params) and another for the actual sim.

[h1]Some meh/interesting points (YMMV)[/h1]
  - UI navigation after having loaded up the sim is unconventional and slightly confusing, but one gets used to this after a while. It all still makes sense, it really is just unconventional.
  - Carrier-landing support for the 737. At least, when it comes to comms. Landing itself was partially successful (my own words), touched down nicely but [i]slightly[/i] (no sarcasm) overshot the runway.
  - Ground vehicles make interesting maneuvers every now and again (immersion-breaking, slightly).

[h1]Some negative points[/h1]
  - [b]Unable to link one throttle axis to multiple throttle axes.[/b] This is a PITA, a true PITA, if you're flying anything with more than two engines. A plugin is available (X-Multi-Throttle) that does the job, but it is cumbersome in my experience since it requires some reconfiguration every time you switch between >2 and <=2 engine aircraft. IMHO this should be part of the base of XP11, since one would absolutely expect customers to run into the issue of having to control a 4-engine aircraft using a 2-axis throttle.
  - [b]Damage is not modeled visually[/b] (at least not on the 737, on 11.41). Which means that if you rip your flaps off because you're not overspeeding at all because you'd never do such a thing ever, it'll affect your flight model but visual inspection will reveal that nothing actually seems to have happened (because you'd never overspeed) and that your flaps are still perfectly functional (visually they remain [i]completely[/i] unchanged). Now, I know this is a flight simulator and not a ""crash simulator"", but I still hold my opinion that this comes off a little cheap as this should be a relatively easy to implement feature, as it doesn't need to be perfect. [i]If I rip my flaps off, I don't want to see my flaps anymore. I think that's fair, and realistic.[/i]
  - [b]Collision is not modeled with static objects.[/b] If you so desire you are fully capable of taking off [i]through[/i] a residential area, houses included. Buildings are but visual obstructions, and sometimes you/AI entities get spawned on gates where there is already a static aircraft parked (once again moving perfectly through it). [i]If I fly into a building, I want to crash and burn. If I fly into a forest because I overloaded my plane to double the maximum weight and overshot the runway, I want to crash and burn. I don't want to spawn on a place occupied by a static aircraft. I think that's fair, and realistic.[/i]
  - [b]No first-party/retailer addon store, only third party stores.[/b] I'd feel a whole lot more comfortable purchasing from either Steam or an official store. Mostly since one would need to create yet another account and that most stores are geographically targeted and as such have limited payment methods, as is the case with the ones I'm familiar with. Because of this I'm limited (due to my own principles) to purchasing from Steam only, and the addons I'd like to purchase are not available.

Nevertheless, this is an amazing product with a level of detail that I truly wish we would see more often.",1590457950,1590458081,True,10,4,0.621081650257110596,0,True,False,False

If you would like a well designed airfield you will need to pay extra for that ($30-$50) for one airport. The physics are bad. I try to brake the aircraft with the flight pedals but the moment I tap the pedal is screeches and pulls the aircraft way left or right as if I used maximum braking. The comms are a SLIGHT improvement since you can file a flight plan (without SIDs and STARs so half asses it), switch to clearance/ ground/ dep/ center in a logical way. However when you get to your field of attend landing atc will vector you in circles until you run out of gas. They are unable to effectively vector you into an approach like an ILS. It's pretty much required to cancel IFR and proceed VFR to land. There is no multiplayer, no shared cockpit unless you download third party hardware. The planes are VERY limited, maybe 10 aircraft? However you can download mods to add more but they are user made so the quality is typically a shell of an aircraft. You would think a flight sim with todays technology could do a bit better. 
What I would have liked to see as a bare minimum for a game of this age is a robust ATC system, aircraft physics, and proper looking weather.

I have been installing plugin after plugin almost free. the only thing i have been spending my money in is The magknight 787 Aviators edition. As i said many of the things in xp11 is free. Take the Zibo 737-800 for example. I have been enjoying teh Zibo for quite some time. first of all. its free, and it is as realistic as it gets. You cannot beat that.

I would say it is not a bad price. it beats P3D with the $2200 Pro license!?!?!??!

In P3D and FSX you have to spend alot of money on scenery and addon aircrafts. I belive that XP11 is better at that. XP11 have this amazing community and this is the best entry level simulator for you to start with. Don't even bother with P3D and FSX for your first Simulator.

First of all, this is a SIMULATOR, not an arcade game where you press a key and you're up in the air. Unless you are an aviation enthusiast, stay away from this because you will not like it. 

Let's also do a quick Pro/Con thing to see what you should expect from X-Plane 11.

Pros:
-Great flight modelling.
-Currently, the best looking simulator you can get out of the box.
-Amazing addon support and a vast amount of freeware and payware addons
-VR support

Cons:
-Low performance (this is currently being solved with the new 11.50 Vulkan update. So if you are reading this in the future, it's probably already solved)
-There is a built-in ATC, but it's not that good at its job. 
-Billboard(2D) clouds, even though that can be easily fixed with payware addons.

I probably missed something good/bad about the simulator but the ones I wrote should answer some questions you have in mind. 

Now back to ""should you buy this simulator?"". Do you like planes? Do you want to spend many hours learning systems and reading/watching tutorials or manuals? Are you planning to be a pilot or just want to live the life of one? 

If you answered at least 1 or 2 of those questions with ""yes"" then you should consider this simulator. It won't disappoint you. But if you haven't, then simply close this page; this simulator isn't for you. 

TL;DR: This is a simulator, not an arcade game. Buy it if you know/want to learn to fly a plane properly.",1589878472,1590167700,True,74,2,0.828709244728088379,0,True,False,False

It is realism and accessibility at its finest. The only real question you have to ask yourself is how invested will you become? 
We are talking about more mods, add-on aircraft (pay and freeware), extra downloadable utilities (again, pay and free) and tools, weather upgrades... the list is exhausting. And just like modding anything to squeeze out that extra inch of realism or to master that next business jet, problems can and will arise. The more you mod and tinker the more likely it is you will eventually break something within the game. 

With all that said, the community for X-Plane 11 is endless. Help is always around the corner. Again, I do not know what each and every potential user is looking to get out of this flight sim so it's hard to fully describe the experience as it will be custom tailored towards the individual. If you are looking to fly this right out of the box then I would throw an easy 75% rating at X-Plane. There's just so much you can add to this sim to make it that much more immersive and realistic that x-plane out the box versus x-plane with mods and additions isn't quite the same experience.
 
Quick and easy advise; if you aren't in X-plane 11 fully or tend to jump from game to game, sim to sim then move on as X-Plane 11 is definitely an investment in time, education (if you aren't a real world pilot or have little flying experience), and possibly cold cash.

General aviation aircraft, fighter jets, Airliners, business jets, helicopters, it's all available free online. There is something for everyone that enjoys aviation. There is a learning curve and it took me a lot of youtube videos to figure out things like using the nav radio for ILS and creating a flight plan in the FMS for long haul flights but I'm glad. Running ILS approaches in bad weather, offshore oil rig heli landings (or on a moving frigate), aircraft carriers and thousands and thousands of airports, there's so many aviation challenges you can make for yourself. I played on a simple joystick with twist yaw and had a blast but with a throttle, yoke, and rudder pedals it becomes even more immersive and precise. I'm happy with the standard scenery, although some cities are lacking such as Dallas but flying over Manhattan or Washington DC at night looks superb and the street traffic looks great.

If you are a fan of aviation and willing to put in a little time to learn the systems of the aircraft (with youtube it really isn't hard), I highly recommend you check this game out. If you're more casual and looking for a more arcade experience where you hop in a plane and takeoff and don't worry about things like bird strikes, engine failures, or wind shear, weight and balance, fuel usage, then this game probably isn't for you. 

One last thing. There is multiplayer. VATSIM has ATC controllers and real traffic if you're looking for an even more immersive flying session. There are rules however, it's not like GTA5 (again, this is a simulator, GTA5 is arcade). You'll need to be able to follow taxi instructions, gain landing/take-off clearance, and communicate like a real pilot but this game is great for learning real world procedures.

While there is global, most airports are bare-bones and lack some key details. In places with unique runways such as Lukla, it lacks the sloped runway and other key details that make it special. The runways all have one thing in common; they are low res, and are very rough. 
While there is a fairly large selection of base-game aircraft, most have lacking audio and low resolution textures. If you have a look at the game's 747-400, you will find that the aircraft has horrible textures, non-fmod sounds, landing gear clipping through the floor when retracted, and unrealistic handling. 
The 737-800 on the other hand is a beautiful aircraft. It has nice textures, fmod sound, and more-or-less accurate handling. 
Most of the GA aircraft are nice, but there is a small selection of them.

If you are in the market for a flight sim, wait for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. You'll be waiting for a few months, but you'll get so much more than X-Plane, for a similar price.

But most importantly, it's a simulator. One where you don't just add full power and takeoff, a proper simulator.
The bad reviews are most likely from people who thought you just hit a throttle and takeoff.
A recommendation is that you use a yoke or sidestick, rudder pedals and a throttle quadrant.
Add all global scenery packs and if you can add autopilot instruments to your cockpit setup.
If you can't afford this, use a sidestick with a small throttle attached.

Good graphics

Crashes are not too realistic

To start off X-plane 11 includes awesome realism settings that just haven't been achieved by another previous simulator in the industry in my opinion. The graphics (for those that have the appropriate hardware - graphic card) are very realistic but a very good CPU and GPU are needed to accomplish this. Comparing this to other simulators I've used in the past FS2004, FSX, Prepar3D, XP10, I wish that X-plane developers made it more stable for most users and not have a specific type of GPU to have it function to its full capabilities. Making a comparison with it's competitor Microsoft Flight Simulator X, which is a lot more stable and even more widely used because of its stability which I wish X-plane 11 had brought would've made it much more popular.

So much that it counts towards some of your required hours in real world flight training. The stock xplane11 install while including the world and most airports and a few planes does feel very bare - Firstly get (free!) the module known as Zibos 737. Tons of people fly this because it is probably better than any payware aircraft. Next watch a recent upload date video that highlights ""Top10 must-have xplane modules"" or something similar. There's many good free plugins that add features, such as gate pushback mod, choice of vatsim intergrations etc, scenery packs, and other planes.... My HUGE advice here (learnt the hard way) is to read/watch reviews of any products you wish to buy - there's often no refund for these digital addons, and some aircraft are made really badly (a certain payware 747, shan't name it! eg) while others are totally different ball game (another payware 747 for example).
Many people will want to jump in the cockpit and get flying ASAP which is understandable, but to get the most out of this simulator, you will need to put aside a few hours to get your controls setup just how you like, tinker with the graphics to get the best quality/frame rate for your system and taste, find which scenery packs you might like, airports, weather/cloud modifications, lighting/colour enhancements and so forth, and these few boring hours spent researching and tinkering will pay massive dividends in the end.
Must have free modules to get started:
* zibo 737  (professional grade / study level 737 - every switch....)
* X-RAAS (runway awareness advisory - (""approaching runway 0-5-Left"" etc)
* BetterPushback (preplan your gatepush backs from top-down planner, and watch the tow truck do it)
* X-MultiThrottle (Allows your 2 throttle HOTAS to control 3-8 engines, using some clever logic)

This game is also fully VR supporting, personally I find the switch from HOTAS (hands on throttle and stick) back to the VR controllers (your ""hands"" in game to press the switches or spin the dials) too much of a hassle and immersion breaking, so never use it for any ""proper"" airliner flying.. HOWEVER if I go VFR for fun, I will forget tuning ILS's, leave the FMC behind, and go HOTAS only, which in VR is the best way.

Anyone who likes flying and wants a realistic flight models - this is it. turbulence, crosswind landings, wings icing up, massively multiplayer over online VATSIM network - it's all there. RATE 9.5/10

[b]recenzja po polsku poniżej[/b]

I've bought it as my first serious contact with flight simulators and one of my first contacts with knowledge on flight operations in general. I enjoy it and don't regret spent money (about 45 euros).

[b]Advantages:[/b]

- It has a very good reputation on graphics and quality of simulation (many sources list it as the best flight simulator on the market for now) — I'm unable to deny any of that.
- I didn't encounter any kind of problem with stability, performance and bugs in the flying simulation itself (i7-4720HQ 4 cores, 8GB RAM, GeForce GTX950M).
- The airliner I've been playing with so far (737-800) has most of functions in cockpit operational and really used during flying.
- Possibility of flying all around the world.
- Broad functionality (in passenger operations) — ATC, tower, ground control, essential ground service, navigation points all around the world, STARs, SIDs, functional navigation system in an airplane. Small bot-controlled air traffic.
- Ability to watch and save replays from flights.
- Advanced support of game controllers and possibility of broad configuration of keyboard buttons functions.

[b]Disadvantages:[/b]

- Serious problems with navigation during taxiing  — maps dont include taxiway marks so it's needed to follow yellow arrows displayed on the ground which are being drawn by bad working algorithm that doesn't know what's going on and sometimes guides through grass or fences (in addition of looking terrible). Beside that sometimes control doesn't detect that the plane made it to a destination point and doesn't provide takeoff clearance. The pathfinding on airports sometimes forces our plane to crash into other aircraft.
- From whatever reason an access to a map is limited to several dozen km from our position. It's impossible to prepare desired flightplan on an departure airport.
- Saving and loading simulation states doesn't work properly — some aspects (for example ATC flightplans, but I think more than that) doesn't save at all.
- There are bugs in simulation of some cockpit instruments, for example FMS (simulator spew an error and and the device stopped working, other time the simulation crashed in similar situation).
- Only three passenger airliners included (there are much more other aircraft, that's a remark only for people intrested mainly in big civil aviation) — I don't know what is the quality of free addon aircraft.
- Very strange system of toggling between flight controls by mouse and pressing buttons in cockpit. It is incredibly easy to accidently crash the plane when trying to switch something on or off, especially in situation that demand quick reaction or doing many things at once. It's very frustrating (having in mind save/load problems) and it's impossible to calibrate as wanted or turn to a diffrent toggling mode.
- Included instructions (at least some of them) are written laconicly and are insufficient to properly control onboard devices especially for someone who is learning to do it. It's gonna be needed to look for additional information and use ""trial and error"" method.

Kupiłem jako pierwszy poważny kontakt z symulatorami lotu oraz jeden z pierwszych poważnych kontaktów z wiedzą o operacjach lotniczych w ogóle. Jestem zadowolony i nie żałuję wydanych pieniędzy (dałem nieco ponad 200zł).

[b]Zalety:[/b]

- Ma bardzo dobrą reputację pod względem grafiki i jakości symulacji (wiele źródeł uważa X-Plane za najlepszy symulator pod tym względem w tej chwili na rynku) — faktycznie nie potrafię się do tych rzeczy przyczepić.
- Nie natrafiłem dotąd na problemy ze stabilnością, wydajnością ani błędami w samej symulacji lotu (i7-4720HQ 4 rdzenie, 8GB RAM, GeForce GTX950M).
- Statek powietrzny którym jak dotąd się bawiłem (737-800) ma zdecydowaną większość funkcji w kokpicie sprawnych i faktycznie używanych.
- Możliwość latania po całym świecie.
- Szeroka funkcjonalność (jeśli chodzi o operacje pasażerskie) — kontrola lotów, wieża, kontrola naziemna, podstawowa obsługa samolotu na lotniskach, punkty nawigacyjne na całym świecie, STARy, SIDy, funkcjonalny system nawigacyjny w samolocie. Drobny ruch lotniczy prowadzony przez boty.
- Możliwość oglądania i zapisywania powtórek z lotu.
- Zaawansowana obsługa kontrolerów gier i konfiguracji funkcji przycisków na klawiaturze.

- Poważne problemy z nawigacją po lotniskach (przy kołowaniu) — na mapach brak zaznaczonych punktów więc instrukcje kołowania należy wykonywać po strzałkach wyświetlanych na drogach kołowania które są rysowane przez źle działający algorytm — same nie wiedzą do końca o co chodzi i każą czasem jeździć po trawie (a oprócz tego wyglądają okropnie i psują immersję). Oprócz tego czasem nie zaliczają dojazdu do celu co skutkuje brakiem możliwości otrzymania pozwolenia na start. Czasem każą zderzać się z innymi samolotami na lotnisku.
- Z jakiegoś powodu mapę można przeglądać tylko w zasięgu kilkudziesięciu kilometrów wokół nas — nie da się przygotować zamierzanego planu lotu na lotnisku początkowym.
- Niepoprawnie działa zapis stanu symulacji — pewne aspekty (np. plan lotu u ATC, ale odnoszę wrażenie że parę innych rzeczy też) nie zapisują się.
- Występują błędy w symulacji działania pewnych rzeczy w kokpicie, np. FMS (symulator zgłosił że wystąpił błąd i komputer ten przestał działać, coś innego raz doprowadziło do crashu symulacji).
- Tylko trzy duże samoloty pasażerskie w zestawie (jest kilkanaście innych samolotów, to uwaga dla osób które są zainteresowane głównie ""Airlinerami"") — nie wiem jakiej jakości są darmowe dodatki społeczności.
- Dość dziwny system przełączania się między sterowaniem samolotem za pomocą myszy a naciskaniem przycisków w kokpicie — bardzo łatwo jest przez przypadek rozwalić samolot próbując użyć przełącznika w kokpicie, szczególnie w sytuacji wymagającej szybkiej reakcji lub zrobienia wielu rzeczy na raz. Jest to niesamowicie frustrujące (szczególnie że zapis i wczytywanie działa tak sobie) i nie da się tego w żaden sposób dokonfigurować dostosowując do swoich potrzeb.
- Instrukcje (przynajmniej niektóre) są napisane lakonicznie i nie wystarczą do poprawnej obsługi niektórych funkcji w kokpicie, szczególnie jeśli dopiero uczy się działania tych sprzętów. Będzie konieczne szukanie dodatkowych informacji w internecie i posługiwania się metodą ""prób i błędów"".",1588852856,1588857746,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game has improved a lot since my last review, of which I had forgot about, so here is a short revise of my review from the perspective of a once favored FSX user.

I'm not gonna list every little detail so I will just review what stood out the most.

X-plane 11 has more realistic terrain mapping and scenery. 
Good performance and a good game engine.
Detailed physics with air-frame stress visuals.
Many useful features that enhance sim experience.
VR ready, an awesome must try feature.

I also would not recommend this to people who have no interest in planes or flying because the amount of time you have to put in to learn the aircraft and the systems is just going to be a hurdle. 

Xplane11 is still currently the best option for flightsim on the market.",1588354102,1588354102,True,75,4,0.803290307521820068,0,True,False,False

 if you try to get support. do not bother.  no one well help you in this game.  they do not even reply to your help comments. 
and it is not just in steam but also in fb forms oculus forms and so on.  there not going to bother with helping you.

cons
so here is what you well be asking for help
playing online with other pilots. < as you see on youtube >  no opitons 
the controls reset every time you shut down the game.  you got to  calibrate them  before take off.  it does not save it
vr controller well conflict with x52.   
and best part.  you need to learn everything your self. or read a pdf file on it.  very long.  but worth reading .

pro
what you get that is worth the game.

not paying for every state like airofly 
having a wide rang of planes to fly
flying to usa and germany and so on.
realy life weather systems and problems with plane
yes your plane can have problems flying it. and you need to land.
gps real time.
wide range of controls 
vr support.  you can use your vr controllers and x52 but you really need to set it up right.  and like i said  it resets every time you shut down.  
x plane has a more real life feel then all others have.
cause of this its worth the money

I run the program with a Valve Index with high settings and don't have any issues.  I utilize the saitek pro flight yoke, with double throttles and pedals.  It's great to actually fly IMC (instrument meteorological conditions) and fail an engine or fail the pitot-static system.  Since in real world, when you simulate an engine or instrument failure, you brief it so much with your safety pilot or instructor, you loose the sense of surprise (you see them reaching for the throttle or reach to cover an instrument).  In sim, I can set up emergencies to happen randomly to help me hone identifying the emergency too.  

That being said, it is also a fun simulator to just game around in.  Even if you don't have any flight experience, it can still be enjoyable.  (I got my start in aviation with flight simulators when I was a teenager and its a fun way to scratch the aviation itch and much less expensive.)

269950,67916142,76561198029779922,0,1,1321,0,428,1696539540,"Let me preface this review with the fact that I am not a pilot, and I don't know a lot about being a pilot, but i'm trying to learn, which is why the realism of the game caught my attention.  If you're like me, and you've been playing FSX for your whole life, this game is a considerable step up from that.  The graphics are insane, the scenery is profound, and you end up learning a lot about flying.  I had to learn how to program my own flight plan and how to fly with the autopilot using the FMC.  I learned how to start the aircraft from a cold start as well.  

However, in the first 7 hours that I owned this game, I spent most of them googling issues and trying to solve them.  I spent an hour trying to figure out why the APU wouldn't start, I spent an hour trying to figure out how to bind the yaw and the nosewheel tiller to the same control on my joystick (I gave up on this).

My summation of the above is that the game is fantastic but very advanced. Novices beware.

However, now let's get to the elephants in the room: the bugs and the gameplay.  For $60 I expected a very polished and extensive game.  In these respects, the game left me disappointed.  For example, in FSX there are missions in which you conquer different scenarios, all featuring pre-recorded ATC and sometimes even a storyline.  In X-Plane 11, it's basically like flying in free-flight all the time.  Every single other review mentions the poor vanilla ATC quality so I will give that a rest, but if you're curious, check out another review, they'll talk about it.

Secondly, I am frustrated with the bugs in this game.  There were bugs with installing plugins, and the FMC functions after pausing to click out to the desktop or start menu on my computer.  The big problem was after 6 hours of time played, none of the planes would respond to my joystick's Pitch and Roll axis.  The yaw, throttle, and all the buttons worked perfectly, but the pitch and roll didn't work.  I tried everything from resetting the controller, re-installing the controller, restarting the game, restarting my computer, but still I couldn't even taxi off the ramp because the controls didn't work.  That was the last straw for me with this game.  When Googling the problems extends beyond me learning how to fly and into me learning why the game isn't working, that's where I start losing interest in playing.  Especially because I'm new to this hyper-realistic simulator and sometimes it's hard to tell if it's a bug or if I made a mistake in the cockpit.

Feel free to comment all the plugins that I can download below, but the fact of the matter is I paid $60 for this game, I want it to work without add-ons and plugins.",1587709251,1587709251,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The only thing that keeps me here is the better pushback mod. This game does have some real high quality mods, and the graphics can be insane at times. Its a great game out of the the box, but noit the long haul study simtype. For that some DLC will be needed and mods, but this game supports VR fantasticley and is made for scenic flights in a small little Cessna. the one big complaint I have though is the y dont keep  a consistent level of simulation, sometimes a whole chain of commands can be one button or you need to have the manual and training to statrt the FMC (autopilot). I do plan to keep Xp11as my primary flight sim when fS20 comes out, and make fS20 another part of my flight sim collection ( as I started off as an FSX player.)

You gotta disconnect your xbox controller if you want to use the thrustmaster joystick. I would think a game like this would not have such a easy fix bug. The map is size is off in VR if you pull it up, the in game pad can't recognize the mouse pointer and gets closer with every click, and a bunch of other stuff. For such an expensive game, I expect more. Stick with DCS world, if you want your money's worth. It's an already finished product, that plays like an early access game.

DO NOT BUY THE GAME!!! The amount of bugs you will encounter in VR is not worth the money. By time you get things set up to work, you end up jumping in to a game that looks like it cost you 15.00.
