To give them benefit of the doubt, I understand that the player base are declining because of 2k24 but they shoulda allow Offline Mode for casual players like me who doesn't care about the Online Part of the game. I bought this so I can play offline in Peace!

I cannot conceal my admiration for the unparalleled marvel that is NBA 2k22. As a man who has traversed the tempestuous battles of revolution, I now find myself immersed in a captivating world where round spheres are deftly maneuvered across parquet floors. Verily, this game is a testament to the boundless progress of our society, where the pinnacle of athleticism converges with the marvels of technology.

From the moment I first graced the virtual court, I was enthralled by the uncanny realism that NBA 2k22 exhibits. The players, so artfully rendered, possess an uncanny resemblance to their real-life counterparts. The meticulous attention to detail in their appearances, movements, and idiosyncrasies is a testament to the unyielding commitment of the developers.

The verisimilitude extends beyond mere aesthetics. The gameplay itself is a revelation, delivering a visceral experience akin to being present in the hallowed halls of Madison Square Garden or the Boston Garden. With each dribble, every shot, and the thunderous roar of the crowd, I felt as though I had transcended the realm of mere simulation and become an integral part of the basketball pantheon.

But it is not just the on-court action that captivates the soul. The depth and breadth of the game's features are as vast as the fertile fields of Virginia. The MyCareer mode, where one can forge their own basketball destiny, is a tour de force. Witnessing the rise from humble beginnings to the lofty heights of stardom is a saga that evokes the triumphs and tribulations of our great nation's birth.

The attention to historical accuracy is truly commendable. The inclusion of iconic teams and players from bygone eras adds an extra layer of immersion. I, George Washington, have found myself joyfully leading the 1986 Boston Celtics to victory against formidable foes, experiencing the very essence of competition as it unfolded in years long past.

Furthermore, the multiplayer component offers an opportunity for comradeship and camaraderie. Engaging in fierce competition or joining forces with fellow enthusiasts to conquer the virtual realm is a testament to the unifying power of this digital revolution. In an age where distant lands can be traversed with but a few keystrokes, NBA 2k22 becomes a conduit through which friendships are forged, rivalries are kindled, and bonds are strengthened.

It is my unequivocal belief that NBA 2k22 stands as a pinnacle of human achievement, a testament to the indomitable spirit of progress that has propelled our great nation forward. Through this interactive masterpiece, we are reminded that the pursuit of excellence knows no bounds, and the conquest of the virtual realm can be as awe-inspiring as any endeavor in the annals of history.

May your gaming ventures be as triumphant as my crossing of the Delaware, and may you find in NBA 2k22 a glimpse of the splendor that lies ahead.",1685633879,1685633879,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I haven't played 2K in at least 3 years so I didn't even remember the controls so it was similar to an experience for a new player for the most part. BTW, this is my experience from just a MyCareer perspective as I don't play the other modes, especially MyTeam considering its just gambling with a large amount of grind if you want anything and not spend money on it. 

First off, I'm not particularly happy they didn't give PC next gen, but it isn't a huge deal breaker to me. From what I do remember from the last time I played 2K was the terrible scripting of your actions and how the game would go and it's still here, ready to frustrate you. You feel like you have absolutely no effect on the games whatsoever no matter how well you do. Want to cut to the basket? Nope, you'll get pushed around until you pick up your dribble and have to pass it away forcing you to do pick and roll offense the entire time as you can never trust your team to make any shots while you're on the floor if you're on the highest difficulty. Even if you actually don't get pushed around, you could still just lose the ball for no reason and this is true until very high level ball control and using a few badges just to not randomly get a turnover. It also seems every year, they make the starting point even worst than the last. I remember when you could start a new player in MyCareer and immediately be around 68, but now you start at 60 with a speed and acceleration rating of a center at every position making the progression for college a brutal game of trying to find ways to cheese the game or just caving and buying VC to make your character even somewhat decent and that will only get you so far (I know, I tried, foolishly). 

When it comes to shooting, they definitely lost their touch. If you actually want to be a good shooter, yo're gonna need some really good stats and badges are an absolute must if you want to be just okay. You'll also need defensive badges to make any difference there too as off-ball defense is atrocious without ANOTHER badge and people can blow right past you whenever they desire. 

Overall, the game is just more stress than anything else and has little to no actual fun, just addicting gameplay loops and frustration for simple game mechanics and how they don't work almost every time. All I can say at this point is that I'm glad I bought it on sale for $10, but with how this game is and all the microtransactions it throws at you, it isn't even worth the $10 I spent. Only goods thing I guess I can come with is the music is okay, the graphics are pretty good and character customization is really in depth, thats it. 2/10",1656512282,1684601767,False,43,4,0.655894696712493896,0,True,False,False

While the game boasts impressive graphics and animations, the underlying gameplay mechanics are lacking in innovation and depth, resulting in a repetitive and ultimately unsatisfying experience.

The game's focus on microtransactions and loot boxes is particularly concerning, as it appears to prioritize monetization over player enjoyment and engagement. This approach to game design is not only ethically questionable, but also detracts from the immersive experience of playing a sports simulation game.

Furthermore, the game's narrative modes, including MyCareer and MyTeam, are plagued by lackluster writing and shallow character development, resulting in a lack of emotional investment in the game's characters and storylines. This is especially disappointing given the potential for immersive storytelling in the world of professional basketball.

The game's lack of innovation and imagination is perhaps most evident in its lack of attention to detail in areas such as player customization and team management. While the game provides a range of customization options, these feel superficial and limited in comparison to other sports simulation games on the market.

In conclusion, while NBA 2k22 may appeal to basketball fans and casual gamers alike with its impressive graphics and mechanics, it ultimately falls short in terms of its overall design and content. With its focus on monetization and lack of innovation, it fails to provide the immersive and engaging experience that gamers expect and deserve.",1643770066,1679428330,False,2,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

I played from NBA2K14 until now
May I know, is the AI getting worse one year after one year?
Come on man, get some heIp!
IT DOES  NOT EVEN MAKE SENSE WHEN OPPONENT AI IS SMARTER AND MY TEAM IS SUCKS ! ! !
It is fine when my teammate can't make wide open shot
but IT IS A PROBLEM WHEN A FUCKING CENTER POST UP TO A SMALL POINT GUARD AND MISS IT SO MANY TIMES ! ! ! 
Did you guys know how to design the game?
Teammates can't play offense and defense either.
I swear the team also can't win if they have Lebron James.
I need to fucking defense 5 people and playing offense against 9 peoples, because the god damn teammates will just make brainless shoot after they received the rock. 
GOD DAMN 2K ! 2K22 IS THE DUMBEST GAME IN THE FUCKING WORLD.

However, this game is somehow worse than its previous installments ‚Äúagain‚Äù! 
Every annoying aspect of the previous game are still here but now somehow worse and more broken.
On my very first play; playing as the bulls vs the suns just to get a feel for the game the announcer said ‚ÄúPACERS 3!!!‚Äù and ‚ÄúPACERS BASKET!‚Äù it was funny for being so confidently wrong; but then it happened again and again in multiple games; so it seems that the Bull arena simply has a broken PA announcer.
I‚Äôm surprised I can‚Äôt find anyone else with the same issue honestly considering I‚Äôm buying this game and it's already been out for 6 months.
There are other weird sound oddities some that again are imported from old games such as when playing as the lakers on the lakers home court you can hear a heckler say ‚ÄúLakers go home!!‚Äù It‚Äôs just again odd and confusing; was this soundbyte mean to be added when they are away but got entered into the wrong subfolder?  Why have I been hearing this sound-byte for 3+ years while playing at the laker's home?  Am I insane for even thinking these things?
So there is a tone of immersion-breaking stuff maybe par for the course with NBA 2k but these are NEW issues something that has been ADDED.  Issues that the previous game did not have!  Another annoying quirk I found is some reason they have changed the animation for players that are setting a screen; now they stick their ass out really far it just looks odd/off.. particularly when the play ends up being a double horn screen and two players will run to the 3 point line just to stick their butts out and stand there awkwardly for nobody.  
And speaking of running plays which is really all I want to do in an offline game of basketball; the playcalling menu is horrendous.  I have been dealing with this menu for many years now and I know it‚Äôs a broken system but it‚Äôs a broken system that I learned to navigate; where to run a simple play you may have to push up to four face buttons just to select the play you want to run; well this year they made it worse.
For starters when going into the ‚ÄúOffensive gameplan‚Äù menu where you can control things like rebound / tempo and Primary Focus. 
Primary focus is simply broken; in previous years it would have options like ‚Äúrun the offence though Zack Lavine‚Äù if playing for the Bulls for example; but you would also have the option to run the offence though the other positions on the court such as the starting Point guard, Power forward or small forward.  Each position having its own corresponding button.  Well whatever they have done to this menu and all similar menus in regards to running plays are broken; instead of the 5 players and positions; you get ‚ÄúZack Lavine, Zack Lavine, Lanzo Ball, Lanzo Ball, Zack Lavine‚Äù the same two players double and tripled up!  It was already hard enough to somehow navigate this menu in a live ball situation but now you have 0% confidence you can even find or run something similar to what you want; practically annoying that one of their key stars (Derozen) is simply absent from playcalling despite being on the court! 
This issue is duplicated across all the other gameplan menus while on the court.  And yes I know that you can call timeout move the players around put them back on the court go back into the menu and THEN you may be able to find them in the playcalling menu but it costs you a timeout and you CAN‚ÄôT make changes to players and set a new gameplay while in a timeout without it getting the names wrong!! (granted an old 2k20 bug BUT WHY IS THIS STILL THE CASE 3 YEARS LATER)  Also why should this be the case at all! 
I feel like the entire playcalling system needs to be scrapped at this point and redone.
Now with all that being said about SELECTING a play.  When you run the play‚Ä¶ there is a good chance that that itself will also break during the action.
For example, lets say it‚Äôs a ‚Äú2K smart play‚Äù that you quickly selected and it involves a player running to a spot and setting a screen.  If you arrive before or after the exact moment that the game ‚Äúwants‚Äù then no more screen for you; the play is broken the CPU help forgets what they were doing and you are left holding the ball scrambling to create something off a broken play.
If it happened early enough within the 24 seconds; perhaps you can hold down LB to set another screen; well using this button this ALWAYS has to be the centre; not the closest player so the center will run from the other side of the court while you wait despite you having a man there that could have done it in a pinch.  I swear half the time in this game you are battling your own controls as well as the defense.
It really didn‚Äôt take me long to discover all of these glitches; if you look at my playtime I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs under 30 hours at this stage; but I already KNOW this game; I have played the previous installments.  And if you are reading this then I imagine you are in the same position thinking about buying this game.  This is in no way a full price game; it truly is just a roster update and a worse version of 2k20 in many respects.
What are the positives?  Well there are only a few that I have found so far; this year rebounding and box out seems to work.  The shooting system is just OK‚Ä¶ not horrendous not an improvement just a sideways step.  1 on 1 can be more fun than previous games in some situations as players move slower and dribble moves are smaller; so in rare instances, you may do a nice little crossover move to create space and then step back for a jumper; it does feel good when it goes right; but you have to battle so many other broken systems that it feels like too little of a reward. 
Ok that‚Äôs enough for now; so yes; buy it if it‚Äôs 90% off and you want to play basketball otherwise I can‚Äôt recommend it; it‚Äôs a updated roster; the same bugs from the previous games and new bugs to make the old systems worse.",1645136719,1677453252,False,3,1,0.541666686534881592,0,True,False,False

Run away, you're in the wrong page if you are looking to play a worth while basketball game. Try NBA 2k13 or something around there. Before the pay to win/improve came into the game. Also 2013 was I think the last time they improved the gameplay. Ridiculous, just run away now that you still can.

I've got way over 300h in 2K15 and 2K19 alone.
Been playing NBA 2K on and off since the early 00s on several platforms. Have 15, 19, and now 22 in my steam library, more on Origin and some as physical copy still lying around in the cellar. 

So I finally come around to play this game I got on sale. 

I always play MyCareer solo, never any Streetball pay2win stuff. Never bought a coin. Most of the times i was having fun with older games, though I find they get more and more frustrating each time I buy one.

My first game in 22 MyCareer. I pick a Shooting Guard Slasher build, been very successfull with this kind of player in earlier titles. I pick UCLA, because the Internet says, it's good for slashers this season.
First round, first game. I'm a lil pumped, up for some B-Ball. Give it to me!

After the first half my Team has scored 2 (two!) points. I missed ALL shots, wide open lay-ups and team-mates are hitting 0%. I finish the half with one slam and one steal.

Bad Luck! I restart the game. 
Way better! I hit a shot or two, some lay-ups, have good shot selection and two assists. 
I get substituted.
After two minutes on the bench my team is twelve points behind. I run into an ice cold streak immediately. 
I hit close to 0% in the second half. I miss hoops the size of an ocean liner. I'm alone in the paint and my AI mate ""ignores pass request"" more than one time. 
Still opposing defenders are walls much wider than their wingspan and when you got past them, they just seem to teleport an inch, to be in front of you again. 

This is gonna be fun! What a great game! It looks, feels and plays the same as the last years.

It is fantastic that one company has the monopoly on NBA Basketball. This is innovation and love for the game in perfection. Almost as if 2K was an Indi-Developer.",1673715103,1673715208,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The basic game-play is still clunky and awkward, nothing feels sharp or reactive. Even highly rated players throw lazy and unimaginative passes when using Icon Passing, and not using Icon Passing is as finicky and moody as it's ever been. Player AI has seemingly regressed, particularly on defense. The badge system remains irredeemably broken. Dribble moves and shooting are still the same input - like seriously, imagine if the right stick was also to throw the ball on madden or shoot on fifa.

- Milking the community with absurd P2W ""Micro"" transactions, even compared to other sports games.

- Nothing done about cheaters online. Cheaters have absolutely no fear of getting banned or restricted in any way whatsoever. The PC community has been begging for SOME type of at least vague action for close to a decade now, dead silence by the company (that is since the blatant disrespect by the ""community manager"" in 2018 essentially telling PC players to deal with it). 

- The same tweaked game every year, usually with changes for the worse since the devs keep listening to the lowest common denominators of the overall community, 

- Skillful aspects of the game often purposely get changed significantly so nobody can really carry over any knowledge / muscle memory to the next year, again catering to the lowest common denominator and new players.

In conclusion, if you are going to buy this embarrassment of a game and you don't already have friends who play on PC, just get it on console. Better yet, do yourself a favor and just wait until literally anyone else out there makes a passable streetball sim and watch all the basketball fans who area being held hostage by this garbage jump ship, you can hop on then.

As you see I have some hours in it, I mostly play MC mode and against friends.
The MC mode for me is a big downgrade if I compared it to 2k16. 
A confusing and messed up ""story"" that has characters, which you'll see once and then never again.
MyCourt and the teams arena will always look the same, no new banners or thropies even if your MP won 7 championships, set records and is a future HoF player. Not even all my shoes are shown in MyCourt! 
Buying other clothing is also kinda pointless for this mode, as your Player will wear the default outfit in any clip and you only can see it on the cruise ship.
And the cruise ship is a complete joke compared to the city as the ship has mainly stuff for online multiplayer. if you play only MC, you're mostly gonna navigating through a menu screen, except for goin to the gym, lobby or getting spins.

This all didnt even bother me too much until I saw the next gen version. The brand stuff is nice, but what really got me pissed was they got way more quest and games for solo players to earn Badges and VC!

2K has reached a new low, and removed the ability to play career mode offline.  Now it has forced you to pay gold to improve your characters. Offline mode used to be a way around that, and understandably your character wouldn't be able to be used in the parks because offline meant you could cheat/exploit.

In addition, 2k continues to use their player archetypes to limit how high your stats can go in each category. Make no mistake, the only reason they do this is to force you to make more than one player, causing you to need more VC to upgrade them. So your dreams of having an actually well-rounded player or a 99 overall GOAT are gone...

-Game has amazing graphics but can still run on a butt cheeks pc/laptop.

I could play for a while and still have fun.

Cons
-In the park it feels like I have bad wifi (I still dont have amazing wifi)

My only negative that there should be no excuse for, the amount of hackers. I pray that there is some base level anti cheat for 2k23. As funny as seeing people as tall as the cruise ship is it just shouldn't happen. 

As easy as it is to hate on 2k as a whole company, I have to acknowledge that they tried new things this year and everything had good intentions but came with cheese. 

- New dribbling: Feels great, diversity of combos can be created with different animation styles. 
           -Left/right cheese is insane this year though.
 
- Defense: Every aspect of defense this year except for chase down blocks was laughably bad. When I play defense I shouldn't be sliding as much as I do, and paint defense is wayyyy to inconsistent. Having chase down blocks being god tier is what made defense not horrible but it was still pretty bad. 

- Server latency: Yes the servers are not on the same level as Valorant, Dota, or other games where reactions and adjusting are the biggest factors. 2K servers have always been known to be horrendous but this years weren't as bad as normal. I'd say the previous 2ks have been 3/10 server wise and this year would be a 6/10. Not perfect but decent-ish.

- Overall: Would I recommend this game? YES*, but only if you have a group to grind and play with. If I didn't have that, there was no way I would've put in as many hours as I did.",1660161152,1660644442,True,4,0,0.513710141181945801,0,True,False,False

After the initial release the game was playable, however in an attempt to pander to a subsection of their audience, namely younger gamers who are mostly streamers and content creators who aren't necessarily pure fans of basketball mechanics and just play the game as some sort of RPG, the developers made major updates to the game which took out the enjoyment for pure basketball lovers.

It's one thing pandering to a subsection of your consumers, its an entirely different thing by leading others on for a month to rope them in and just suddenly changing up after you have received their money.

2K23 is coming out and I see the same thing happening. They are promising to 'fix' the problems in the game (which we all already know they deliberately put in).

The game wants to run on the pc like it's a old ps4. The online community is filled with hackers and is very small. When you do play non-hackers, it's typically people you know because they are good and don't hack. Also, you will play the same people over and over because of the size of player base which gets boring real quick. If 2k developers gave a damn about their product, they would implement crossplay with some form of anti-cheat software.

In these almost  400 hours ive hoped that they would have fixed the bugs and glitches, balanced the completely broken badges, fixed literally non-working features like the betting system that after a whole year is still stuck on trying to finalize your first bet... Not to mention the complete lack of care from the dev's (who i bet at some points have been clenching cheeks to get shit done), in every weekly show only preaching how amazing the game is, but never acknowledge how genuinely bad the issues are, not talking about a roadmap for fixes, not talking about the insane amount of hackers online who at best set their character to 99, and at worst disconnect everyone from the opposite team mid match...

A bit on missed opportunities:
I was so excited to find out MyCareer was set on a cruise, that sparked so many possibilities, events going to different places to shoot hoops and have adventures. The first stop was treasure island, it was short and bland, but atleast something that got you off the ship.... There was never any other stop other than repeatedly going to treasure island... same small little dock with some sandy paths, a cool looking 5v5 court in a cave, that nobody ever played....

To finish my rant, id like to say that the game can be fun if you play it for the single player aspects, but the online side of the game is honestly a disgrace. 

Im not buying the next NBA 2k unless i hear that they have fixed the issues that are in the games since 2k18......",1660076918,1660076918,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

What disappointed me the most was that they lack the effort to put some new features (or heck even old ones) on the my career area. I missed features like talking in your GM, telling your GM you don't want a teammate, or getting interviewed by teams pre-signing on them, the actual championship ceremony when you won a championship (2k12 era). Nowadays, when you win a championship it just shows you a VERY SHORT clip of your team holding the trophy, and then a slideshow of the ""celebration"" of your team playing with some wines.

No but it's fun to pretend to be an NBA player. You know how it goes, I imagine you have similar feelings if you're reading this review. 

I put a lot of time into my one career. 122 hours as steam says and one day I open the game to find that I have been banned??!!??! You can check my achievements, I only have achievements related to MyCareer and absolutely ZERO related to the multiplayer. And yet somehow I have violated the terms of service playing MyCareer alone and am now banned. 

Fine ok, I guess I'll stick to just playing single-player like I have for my entire 122 hours of playtime. Except oh wait. I can't. Since this game requires always online being banned means that I CANNOT PLAY SINGLE PLAYER EVEN BY MYSELF. 

I am just locked out of almost all game functions and 2k refuses to explain what I was banned for. What's funny is that numerous reviews of this game mention that PC online is FULL of cheaters. So you can't play multiplayer on PC and even if you just stick to yourself and play MyCareer single player please be aware that 2K can randomly decide to ban you and block you from a save file you have over 100 hours in.

Playing NBA games on MyCareer isn't bad until you have to deal with AI switching for no apparent reason, taking bad shots, going out of bounds, and fucking up plays because the AI suddenly wants to dribble and ignore your calls to pass the ball, no matter how open you are. If you're trailing in the 4th quarter, expect the AI to start chucking up terrible three pointers and drive to a congested paint. The teammate AI is stupid.

That being said, you have multiplayer. Now, there is overlap of stupid AI and low basketball IQ on 2k. From point guard ballhogs, left and right cheese, terrible defense mechanics, and bad team play/trolling such as not passing the ball to open teammates and dribbling the ball for 22 seconds, then passing the ball to someone else to avoid getting a turnover on their stats. As a person who plays by themselves, it is what it is and you learn how to adapt because the community is so small that you know the player and their habits from playing against the same 2, 3, 4 or 5 stacks over and over again. But I haven't even touched on the cheating, the main thing that's killing the 2k's PC community.

From the park, where you can view the 60 overall players who are level 40 and do nothing but shoot threes or do flashy dunks, to the rec center where you have 5 stacks of these same players that include the 7'3, 290 lbs center with 99 stats all the way around, you can't escape the cheating. Most players have modded stats and poor basketball IQ. Let's not talk about the lag switching, which ultimately cancels out your game, sometimes making you banned from playing for 15 or 60 minutes. And the cheating is blatant. They literally run around with the intention of ruining fun. And to be fair, it's not completely their fault. 2k allows this to go on year after year after year. Reporting these people is a waste of your time.

And for 2k23, it's the same technology being used, meaning that the cheating will go on for ANOTHER year because there isn't any anti-cheating in place. It'll be the same people using the same mods, streaming on Twitch and YouTube. Trying at least. 

All this to say, 2k doesn't care much about the PC community and I'm not sure why Steam keeps allowing them on this platform. I would say don't buy it here. If you do, make sure it's when the price has dropped or this game is free because you will not have a good experience playing with people on the PC version. 95% are cheaters and 2k will just continue to let them do what they want. And if you want to just play the NBA modes, the AI will do little things to make you upset. None of it it's even worth $10. Maybe like $1 max.",1659531129,1659531129,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I bought it a couple months back for only ¬£7.99 but now regret it. I love the game of basketball and the Nba, but this game lacks the realism of the sport I love. There are no tactics it is just spamming the same crossover moves until you get just enough separation to shoot a 3. I had bought 2k19 and 2k20 previously and the game has barely changed since then. The Pc edition should be the next gen edition but for some reason it is current gen so the graphics aren't great and it is very buggy. MyTeam is the only mode that the devs  change and even that is just new packs released twice a week.The better modes such as myleague and playnow need more content as they just get tiring after a while.

And now the game starts crashing after a game. Spend your money elsewhere.

Update 22/7/22:
Verify integrity of local files is a thing. That fixed the crashing.

Imagine this:

You're were a one-and-done in college, losing in the first round. In spite of this, you opted to declare yourself to the Draft regardless, in pursuit of a childhood dream.

After numerous work-outs, and going to the NBA Combine, you're expected to be picked late in the 2nd round. And you were, by the Brooklyn Nets. But you didn't care.

You've made it. You're in the NBA.

Early on, things were a little tough. A rocky first few games, limited minutes, and averaging <10 points (or maybe less, idr lmao) and a handful of rebounds. Kendrick Perkins is there.

But somewhere mid-season, things started clicking. You've started scoring more, started averaging double-doubles. You even got some triple-doubles! 

You were Rookie of The Month, every month. And was Player of The Week, 10 times.

Things are looking up. But it didn't stop there. 

One day, you find yourself on the All-Star Team, with 2 million+ votes, behind Giannis Ante-ka-noon-po. Is that right, my brother?

No? Eh, close enough.

Even after the All-Star break, you've kept your momentum.
It wasn't before long until you've ended the season with a 73-9 record (after simming the last 10 games or so because I am NOT gonna spend 2 hours only to play 2 games. Yes, I play 12 minute quarters, what of it?).

The Nets are now the first seed in the playoffs (pfft, yeah. sure.). The pressure is on now.

First round, you were up against the Wizards. You swept them, 4-0.
First game, you were relentless, scoring 57 points, 10+ assists and rebounds.
Second game? 63 points. You've managed to surpass Jordan's all-time playoff game scoring record of 61 points. In your first playoff run, no less. Also, you had 13 or so blocks this game, passing Olajuwon's record, but who gives a shit.
By the third game, you've surpassed Jordan yet again, by scoring 65 points.
Who gives a shit about the fourth game, it was another blowout.

2nd round was against Anteta-
Antekonu-
...Giannis' Bucks.

I'll admit, the start wasn't pretty. You struggled to get points, thanks to Giannis' superior defense.
You scored a career low 20-ish points in the first game.

But it didn't matter. You recovered quickly, going back to your old 30, 40+ scoring ways.
4-0.

2 sweeps in a row?
Not bad for someone drafted last. The Nets are now in the Eastern Conference Finals.

You're up against the Cavaliers. Going up against Lebron and Kyrie will be an uphill battle, but I'm sure y-
...Excuse me?
...
...
Oh, right. Kyrie's your teammate. But still, Lebron's-
What's that?
...Oh, he's not with them anymore?
...
He's with the Lakers?
But they're not in the playoffs?

Well in that case, this should be a walk in the park. Nobody's relevant on this team (sorry, Cavs fans).

And it was.
71 points, 11 assists, 10 blocks, 16 rebounds.

With this, you now hold 3 records for the most points in a playoff game. Ever.

As you walk back to the bench, giving your teammates high fives for a great start to the ECFs, the unthinkable happened.

Real recommendation:
Go outside and play actual basketball. It's more fun, easier to learn. Like literally, you could learn the basics in real life in an hour and this game would make you take 4 days just to learn the basics. 

Go spend 60 dollars on a basketball kit. Not on this ""basketball game"". Not worth 60 dollars if it isn't even fun or challenging. I mean, sure it's challenging. So much to the point to where new players can't play the game unless they wanna be forced to become a full time NBA player. Sure I'll still play this, but not to the amount I was hoping I'd be able to. I've got a better chance of being drafted by the NBA than this game gives me of stealing the ball; or for that matter, anything this game does.

Long story short: it would be nice if it could actually be played on PC, and it would be nice if the game was possible for new players to start in.

Edit:

I'm actually starting my basketball career (in real life) and it's coming fairly easily to me. I've gotten to go to a camp with former basketball players, and another camp that I got to train with the head coach for Purdue Univ. Boilermaker Basketball. Both of these camps/trainings went through the basics of regulation NBA basketball and college basketball in about an hour to 45 mins. If you can learn the basics of the game of basketball in 1 hour in real life, why does a VIDEOGAME about basketball, have no guide/tutorial, no help, nothing about how to learn the ""basics""?

I rest my case. Real basketball is truly easier. While I probably don't have a huge chance other making the NBA or college league, it's still easier nonetheless.

2k2020 went offline (cant play singleplayer mycareer anymore on it) so i bought this on sale for 80% off thinking i could carry my players over somehow but nope.

Almost 50 hours purely playing MyPlayer and I've only gotten my PG to 80 overall (96 potential) in that time including a $15CAD VC (attribute money) payment. Also it warns you that the game sucks if you dont have a controller but it still sucks with one. Also ""the neighborhood"" is complete garbage, spawns you in the mid of the empty courts people mostly use and you have a 30sec run to the elevator to get your daily spin or gatorade workout.

Honestly now that I've read back what i wrote i wouldnt even buy it on the sale that i did and if the P2W wasnt bad enough as it is you get 15-30 sec KIA ads on the loading screens.

And when I alt + tab out of game it crashes my computer with blue screen. Jeeze one fixed problem just to have another. Uninstalled.

TERRIBLE GAME


My Camera settings never asked me to save and if I want to use this settings for all game modes. I literally have to set the camera setting EVERY game and every time I sub in MyCareer. What a pain in the ass. I contacted 2k about it and they legit told me they passed on my info to the correct department and that I have to wait until they fix it in an update. No timeline and no fix.

I can't play in the neighborhood in mycareer. Ever time I join a game I can't move my player and all controls cease to function. (I think it has something to do with the broken camera settings but not sure). Only fix is to alt+f4.

I got fed up and decided to just play myleague and make a player. For some god awful reason there are no foul shots anymore! Get a shooting foul called and they just pass it in bounds. No idea why this is happening. I tried searching for it online and couldn't find answers.

Friend and I tried 5 times to play in ProAm and every single time one of us would disconnect when we join up as a group. Every single time.

I've always liked playing my league though and got this game on steam and oh my! 
It truly is **almost criminal** they got away with releasing this on steam. 
- Invisible players left and right, If you auto-generate rookie draft classes many of the players will be unplayable because they are invisible.
- I looked at the official 2k roster and they have the same face/player DNA for over 100 players.
The laziness and selfishness of 2k to release current Gen games that are broken is sad. I've always loved 2k but Its gonna take a lot for me to be able to trust 2k again. The fact that NBA2k23 will be the current Gen on steam, I don't have a once of trust that it won't be the same or worse than 2k22.",1657474348,1657474348,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

 What do i mean by that? TLDR, 2k makes 2 games now, current gen & next gen. PS5 and xbox series x gets next gen, while every other platform including PCs (which are usually better than next-gen consoles anyway) get current gen.
Next-gen comes packed with new mechanics, amazing graphics and an extremely cool neighbourhood, packed with cars, jetpacks and more.

Not only that, but due to 2ks lack of skill to either create or purchase an anticheat, the game is literally run by cheaters. To have a fair game in park, 90% of the time you have to BUY cheats (which is quite ironic but still)

Offline and with friends, 2k22 is decent at best. Nice mechanics, not bad ball handling, and pretty decent defense considering it can never be perfected. Playing with friends online and offline is a blast. 

Online in park, 2k is hvh the entire time, and versing a cheater is never fun.

if 2k could simply install an anticheat and optimise for next gen, we would all be delivered with a 10/10 basketball experience which is all that anyone wants when buying a 90aud game.

I am 37.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

The gameplay seems to have improved from 2K21, the movements are a lot more fluid and the AI is more forgiving. I also like the addition of the real PA announcers. My only negatives are that it is very difficult to make shots in MyCareer games even after levelling up your shooting quite a bit unless you green them or attack the rim. Also the help defence is virtually nonexistent and some of the face scans are outdated or just don't look like the player.

Update: After having played some Park games I can only recommend this solely for offline mode or MyCareer when it is heavily discounted. If you get it to play online, it will not be a fun experience as there are lots of cheaters who ball hog, run around the 3pt line and use hacks to green every shot. I would say most players (especially 95+ overall) used cheats to boost their level/stats and get VC. Playing with lower level players is the only time you will get anything resembling team play and actual basketball.

Update 2: The latest patch broke the game for me and I get stuck on the team logos screen. I've done everything short of redownloading the whole game and still can't fix it. That, coupled with the fact that 2K is following this up with yet another last-gen iteration of the game, is why I cannot in good conscience recommend it anymore.",1653080821,1657193215,False,1,0,0.50320512056350708,0,True,False,False

First of all, every time I enter the first game I exit the game, it tells me that ""the connection is not good"" even if in late games I work perfectly, and I spend 30 minutes to find players of my level that all have 99 and I have nothing to do against them, I have to wait a bunch more to find another match with other opponents of ""my level"" and I put in the chilies that even if they have lower level they play like demi-gods, and when I barely find a match there is a lot of lag, you can't defend yourself, hit 3 shots and so on.
Secondly how you win VC uri seems to me a crap, effectively it's way too hard if you don't put money into the game, you have to put in a lot of hours, the wins on 1 vs 1, 2 vs 2 and 3 vs 3 are way too low, it should be at least 1.5k, to feel like you win something, it's way too poorly done, there are no equal chances.
I can't say I have a perfect computer, but it's still a pretty good one and this game runs far too poorly on it.
This game is very poorly made and I don't recommend abolishing it at all, unless you have a good imagination and want to play Carrer, but if you don't, there's no point in killing your nerves and patience on this game.",1657043868,1657043868,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

1. Not next gen, even though pc graphics way better then console
2. Same game as last year, literally, same game
3. Poorest flow of movement in sports game today
4.Fouls are worse this year then any previous year, funny that NBA changed the ruling on fouls but 2k22 must not have gotten the memo
5.They said they improved defense, false, they made offense actually worse
6.Still have done nothing about the cheaters in the game, seriously someone made it to level 40 in a hour that a new season has been released?
7.The community of players that would rather try to fatten their stats instead of winning a game
8.Winning an item off the wheel and yet not able to claim from store
9.Game freezes for 30 seconds, only this year instead of having to force quit it eventually resumes
10. Always forcing Myteam on you, worse then spam adds on social media
 Only good thing this year is the quest for some vc
11. AI can spend 5-8 secs in key never called
12.AI can hand check, moving screens, and hack and push you at basket no foul, but you just bump AI and it's a foul
13. Line-up/minutes changes every time someone gets injured, why it changes the whole line-up no clue but dumbest overlook by the devs

As I had high hopes for this release to be on the next-gen engine, it was sadly not. Huge disappointment. Hopefully in 2K23 we'll get next-gen! (Mainstream laptops could outdo any next-gen console when it comes to 2K Games.)
Aside from that, it's the same game as NBA 2K21 just with a couple new items.
[list]
[*]Park is unplayable
[*]MyCareer is decent
[*][u]Zero[/u] anti-cheat
[*]MyTeam is the best aspect of the game
[*]Overall 7/10

I can't really complain too much, [u]as we all know 2K Games/Sports doesn't cater to their PC community like they do the console community.[/u]

1. Awful FPS capping and screen tearing
2. Last gen graphics
3. Less classic players and teams than previous games
4. Awful awkward UI and forced splash movies
5. Player physics seem to be getting worse, players teleport and clip through each other
6. Certain users have 100% guaranteed crash in multiplayer mode
7. Less features than console NBA2k22

I suggest you buy this game. Graphics are very nice and smooth, any type of camera angle you choose looks fantastic now. Your now actually able to get the ball in the net without having to just go for the dunk, whereas before, there was no such thing as a 3 pointer, nor shooting the ball on your own. Blocking the AI is now do able, granted, it was before, except that does NOT mean it was easy. AI's shooting accuracy is now realistic, they can't make every single shot thrown. Soundtrack is better suited for the game than before. During half time, they show interesting statistics on your game play, and have commentators talk about who has been playing good the current game you are playing. This game has some crashes keep in mind, except it is not something you need to be worried about.",1656464077,1656464077,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1. You are destined to lose some games. Even if you perform Godly and even the score, your team trails by 20+ when you get back in the game. You lose no matter what you do.
2. When you block a big man, the ball goes directly back to him and he completes the play with a putback layup or dunk. This happens to me 90% of the time.
3. When you box out and get a nice position to take an offensive rebound, the missed shot always bounces back to the opposite direction where you cannot reach. This happens to me 99% of the time.
4. It is extremely easy to get your shots blocked. You cannot score if there is even a slight contest to your shot. So those shots over defenders in real NBA is impossible.
5. While everyone in other teams dunks like Vince Carter, I cannot dunk with my 7-foot center who has all the dunk packages and a high dunk rating if there is a defender near me.
6. Your team members are unaware of the concept of defense. Your opponents score way too easily while you work your a.. off to score a simple basket.
7. And please somebody explain why your opponents never miss a single free-throw? I have completed a full season and I have seen a missed free-throw by my opponents just once or twice.

Don't think that I'm new to this game. I've been playing 2k since 2010.
And all these things above happen on the lowest difficulty. Go figure.

- Its about basketball?
- Monke mascots

Cons
- Ruined it after season 2 (with terrible unwanted patches)
- Contact dunks feel entirely luck based rather than skills based
- Dribbling got nerfed so bad that guards are now screen made (more than ever)
- Sliding has somehow returned
- Lack of variety in season ""locations"" (same location just with a reskin)
- So many hackers in park (they can crash your game as well in case you start winning)
- Cheaters can buy cheats (MyPoint cheat) to boost their rep and obtain level 40 in wayyyy less games
- 2K will ban you for grinding a build (like me) and take a whole month (entire season) to unban you, and not compensate you in return for missing time off of an ANNUAL game

Keep rolling your eyes, you might eventually find a brain.
 Your face makes onions cry.
Did I invite you to the barbecue? Then why are you all up in my grill?
Our kid must have gotten his brain from you! I still have mine.
You have so many gaps in your teeth it looks like your tongue is in jail.
If your brain was dynamite, there wouldn‚Äôt be enough to blow your hat off.
You are more disappointing than an unsalted pretzel.
It‚Äôs impossible to underestimate you.
Wow, your maker really didn‚Äôt waste time giving you a personality, huh?
Her teeth were so bad she could eat an apple through a fence.
I‚Äôll never forget the first time we met. But I‚Äôll keep trying.
Oh, I‚Äôm sorry. Did the middle of my sentence interrupt the beginning of yours?
Hold still. I‚Äôm trying to imagine you with personality.

-Awful hitbox detection. Players will constantly hit one another and never move by.
-Awful covered shot mechanic. The green zone for shots will change even after the shot animation has begun, and some times after the shot is already completed, making a clearly green shot, slightly early or late for no fucking reason.
-Awful defensive mechanics. My player feels like he doesnt even know how to control his own body.
-Extra awful control responsiveness. We play in the NBA? You would never know it because every movement you make is slower than a turtle with a broken leg.

Gameplay is good, there's a lot of animations that I really like to skip, the weird vibrating screen bug every time that I'm on the free throw line, then there's this continuous virtue signaling that really tries to provoke me every time. Overall, this is not a $60 game, do not buy at full price, wait for a sale, buy it at $10 to $20 max, and at that price I think it's worth it.

Previous review: 
Aside from the game being just a re-skin, the fact that you can't change controls is just a disappointment. Really? Can't I really change the controls to anything I want and be forced to play using a controller? That shooting bar also jumps really fast, from good to suddenly just bad. Another negative points for virtue signaling right after my first game, which flopped, because I am not used to the controls on keyboard.",1654799028,1654999638,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

NBA 2K22 has made some important tweaks to the on-court action that help make it play like a more realistic game, most noticeably how it handles stamina loss while dribbling. In 2K21, it was easy to run at a defender on the perimeter, hit a Curry slide, and drain a three without breaking a sweat. Against the CPU, that tactic was almost undefendable, especially in MyTeam where player cards were quickly made ridiculously overpowered. With 2K22, you can still employ tactics like that, but the stamina loss you suffer from sprinting and doing dribble moves is made much more significant to balance out its effectiveness.
As your player gets more tired their shot meter will shrink, making it tougher to hit shots. That leads to a game that initially seems slow compared to 2K21 ‚Äì but if you play under more control and don‚Äôt just hold that sprint button, you‚Äôll actually have an easier time putting the ball into the bucket because of your larger shot meter. It may not seem like an important change at first, but it leads to a playstyle that feels closer to real life than 2K21 ever did.",1654775920,1654775920,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

====
The MyTeam experience is hands-down the worst I've experienced.  Unnecessary tuning the shot meters so only perfect timing can drop mid-range or 3-pt shots make those domination games a real pain to play.  In easier difficulties, I can shoot 60%~70% from the arc.  In Superstar difficulty, the User-controlled shooting percentage drops to 13%~15% on open shots when the CPU shoots 70%+ on contested 3-pt shots.

That's right.  The devs think that the ""if we make players miss more shots and the CPU make all the shots, the difficulty level increases.""

Can't say they're totally wrong.  But my oh my, what a lazy way to make multiple difficulty levels.
Instead of playing smarter AI, you'll be struggling with those shot meters.

I'm not someone who's super into NBA or the card-driven design of many sports games (FIFA, Madden, etc). I'm a casual sports fan who just wants a casual game to be able to sit down and play. I like career modes, both player and GM, in most sports games because it's a fun thing to pick up and play for a few minutes and then put down. 

This game doesn't have that. It's not possible to play Career Mode as a player without microtransactions, because you're able to take your player online and play against others. That's a neat feature - make it optional! I don't want to have to pay $50 to take my created player from a 55 OVR to an 80 OVR just to be able to compete in the NBA, offline. I don't care about playing other players - anyone I play online will beat me, since they're hardcore. Just let me play offline without my needing to spend extra money. I got so frustrated by this that I eventually did pony up $50 for 200k VC and upgrade my player to an 80. It still feels like I can't do anything. A slasher point guard can't make a single contested layup? Really??

Additionally (and many sports games of the last few years have been suffering from this) it's very very hard to play this game as a casual player. There are animations I have to use, complex controls to memorize - it's not beginner friendly at all. Even taking the shot off of the right stick (and setting it to dribble only), I still feel like I keep messing up and losing the ball. I get that these controls allow for more skill expression at higher levels of play, but that isn't me. 

I never review games on steam. I'm reviewing this one because it is SO BAD. Unless you're someone who will spend 100 hours grinding this and focusing on being great with the controls, DO NOT BUY IT. There were other reviews that said this that I ignored. I regret that.",1654367457,1654367457,False,1,0,0.508196711540222168,0,True,False,False

It has some pros, the sliders are customizable so you should be able to eventually get your desired difficulty and gameplay experience dialed in but it takes loads of time.
The diverse selection of classic teams is my favorite part. I am a little disappointed some teams were removed like wasn't the Deron Williams Jazz in 2k16? Anyway, it is easy to add in custom players and download others so I have fun with that.

The playoff mode is bugged and doesn't allow custom rosters making it useless.

I don't play online, MyTeam, MyPlayer or MyGM so I can't comment on those.

MyLeague is ok but like the previous years, the players progress WAY TOO MUCH but there are loads of sliders so again, you can tune it to be acceptable.

The game seems purposefully coded to disengage the player as much as possible. Opposing players will steal away perfectly positioned rebounds, invisible force fields will stop you from executing the most basic of pick and roll plays, just overall lazy coding that keeps the defender glued in front of you until you cave and purchase the vc so you can be on par with the 99 overall AI while playing on the lowest difficulty setting in a single player mode. I'm not even playing around about this, freakin James Wiseman is like prime Mutombo blocking every shot if you so much as even think about going to the rim while hes remotely near you.

Again, the game seems purposefully coded to aggravate you; taking away perfectly timed blocks/contests by calling fouls, defenders magically maneuvering in front of you while you had a clear path to the lane, opposing players never passing the ball to the guy you're defending unless he's wide open leading to little interaction, etc. Overall a very disappointing product and even though I bought it for less than $10, I regret it.",1653897340,1653897340,False,92,20,0.788677990436553955,0,True,False,False

I grew up playing the Madden series and there are bugs from the early 2000s that they still havent fixed (like arms/legs phasing thru the player or spinning 360 degrees). 

I had assumed that this is what all sports games are and really had no interest in playing. Then I started to watch NBA games and I wanted to learn more. So I bought this game. 

It is absolutely phenomenal in my book. The MyTeam section feels like mid-2000s Madden games, up until current ones, with the card collection and it is fun to collect them as well, without feeling like you need to spend a lot of real world money on packs due to the auction house. 

The MyPlayer mode is phenomenal as well. There was only one year of Madden that I remember with a career mode similar, but the story/interviews were all text based. I loved that mode and this delivers that in spades. Skipping to the action is easy as well. 2 button presses to skip to the action, or one button press to see when you are going into the game/what situations your are being subbed in for. 

I feel like by doing, I have learned a lot, and for that I am thankful and looking forward to next season!",1653703385,1653703385,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It appears to set the potential to their current overall. This is killer if you managed to draft a player that SHOULD have pretty good potential but often, his overall is mid 70s or low 80s. So his potential gets nerfed. Absolutely ruins the experience.

Aside from that, it's just same old same old. It's really galling that this company can get away just releasing a copy and paste game while also adding bugs. And by galling, I mean, infuriating.

GAMEPLAY: its somehow easier to control your car and score goals in rocket league than here. the animations here are so laggy that each move feels unresponsive. trying to steal the ball often means fouling. so basically you just put your arms out and wait until they hopefully miss to rebound.  the shooting sucks. even the special moves suck

REALISM: they tried to make a simulation of the experience of watching basketball, full of product placements. want a lacroix? gatorade? car insurance by all state? AT+T 5G assist of the game? the amount of times you're waiting to play while some stupid cutscene is happening in unbearable. does every game need a 10 second cutscene of mascots shooting shirts out of cannons? you play maybe 1/2 the time, and that's being generous.

TRAINING: also the training sucks, and is forced upon you repeatedly, to earn little points that barely do nothing to boost your character. do 10 trainings and unlock a single thing that makes your character go from bad to bad. pointless.

RECOMMENDATION: I can't recommend this game to even be played with friends casually. its just a mess. I bought it for 9$ and now I think its true value is maybe 3$

I thought maybe it was just me in the beginning, made a new character at Pro difficulty, dropped $20 on VC to raise 3PT to 95. Missed 6/6 Wide Open shots that were early or late (not very early or very late, just RIGHT off the perfect line). Difficulty doesn't matter, only Green shots go in. Further, the meter will change mid shot. Release where it was about to be green but a split second before release the meter shrinks and moves up. Shot went from just about perfect to Very Early. I've taken shots that were in the ""Very Late"" segment of the shot meter when it came on screen. Lastly is when the meter jumps. I've released in the ""Very Early"" segment on mistake and watched the meter skip straight to ""Late"" on so many instances. No build up like you'd expect, just past green and into Late when it should have been Very Early.

TL;DR - Only Green shots work and the game will physically move the requirement for green as you release.

I only got this because it went on sale for $10, and I know 2k only put it on sale to try and boost the sale of the virtual currency in this game. This is one of the most Pay-to-Win games you'll find. VC as its called used to be earnable in multiple ways, now its extremely limited and metered out drip by drip. This cannot be avoided with an offline mode because offline mode doesn't exist. 

When 2k shuts down the servers for this game in less than a year from now, the offline components also stop working just like in previous titles. What a god damn scam. They'll never lose the license for the nba games because they make too much money off clowns and children who buy into this garbage. 

I so very much wish there was an offline only single player mode that didn't involve having to whore yourself out for a virtual currency in order to upgrade your MyPlayer. This whoie game is just an elaborate way to sell you more VC. There exists a bug since release, where suddenly your MyPlayer will stop earning VC from games. No explanation provided and research online shows its a pervasive problem that 2k cares nothing to fix. And why would they since most of the people hit by this bug give up and buy vc to improve their character.

Aside from the micro transaction bullcrap, the game itself actually plays pretty well, but it certainly should play smoother for a game that nickles and dimes its player base at every single turn, and NEVER holds back on a chance to throw a sponsor or endorsement in our face with an un-skipable cutscene or two

Wrong. 

For the first time in my life, I asked for a refund for a game. It was so bad. How bad? Well, let's see...

The last NBA game I played was 2k15, and that was alright, so I figured this would be similar enough. Not even close. I played one game on Rookie mode, with the recommended settings, and the game stuttered so badly that it took nearly the entire first half for me to be able to make my first bucket. The shoot mechanic wouldn't appear until after it was past time to release the button. This meant I was literally shooting blindly. I was having to try and complete my shots before I could see the shoot mechanic. 

Then, the lag. Oh the lag. The game screen should shake, then stutter, then the score would go up for the opponent AI team despite no one on screen being on the offensive side of mid-court. The graphics, when they worked, looked like they were two generations behind where they were in 2k15. 

Please, learn from my mistake. Even at $10, this game isn't worth the price. In fact, if it was free I still wouldn't recommend it. It is that bad.",1652824781,1652824781,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's prone to some glitches and bad matchmaking that just doesn't happen on single player. I also don't like how the game makes your team better or worse based on the challenge in single player as well. There were some settings that I had to change right away and others I couldn't figure out how to. Once I figured out how to change those though, some like the camera angle for example I kept at broadcast, because I was so used to it by then. Still, even with the bad stuff, it's fun and winning pumps me up. If I were to beg for a feature that I need fixed badly, it would be fair online matchmaking.

I get not everyone is curry but these are professional level athletes if i cut my analog stick sharp to the left then back to the right even with a small forward that doesn't have the best speed there should be something there. This sadly is not the case. They instead move like they are hung over. 
The delay once again is apparent on when your player will pull up a shot. I press the shoot button after breaking around and getting free of a defender, then cut behind another, you would thing while their back is away from me the most logical thing would be to pull up a short range jumper while i have no competition from about 7 feet out. Once again this isn't the case, instead the game decides to sling my player into the back of the other teams center that I got behind, drawing an insane amount of contact and plummeting my chance of making the shot to a theoretical zero.
Back to just basic dribbling. One of the best things for people that didn't make 6'8 characters is the pretty immediate ability to cross over, change directions, spin around defenders, over all just play-make and create distance. In this game you move like your persons arms are tired, he does crossovers like he has been up for a week soothing his alcohol addiction.

I never wrote a review on a 2K before but this time I can't just sit here and play the same old game over and over again. I play 2K for MyPlayer mode and the only thing that changes every year is the useless cheesy cinematic story. The actual career remains the same, you have two options:

-Pay extra ¬£50 to buy VC and boost up your player, starting the season with a nice 84 overall

-Get somehow drafted in the first round with a pathetic 60 overall, totally unable to do anything useful on the floor. 

Draftees are supposed to be young, athletic, strong and fast, your player is not. Low stamina, speed, acceleration, strength, vertical. You're basically the worst player on the court. I'm 10 games into the season and I made 2 jumpshots in total. If it's not green, it's not going in, can only score in the paint. 
They reduced the games you play before the NBA, now it's only one college game and then the draft combine, but don't worry, it doesn't matter how good you do, how high you get drafted or how flashy you are, you'll start as a 60 overall anyway, compared to fellow draftees that start their season at 75. 

I'm not saying I want to get drafted already at an MVP level, but if I managed to get drafted in the lottery i think I deserve to start as a 70 overall at least. Instead of using those high school and college games to decide my position at the draft, use them to establish your starting overall value. If you are trash you'll be drafted in the late second, with an overall of 60, if you're good it's lottery and a nice 75, no?

- Microtransactions system -
This is a long-standing issue for this game series. Every franchise's game tries to include a top-up system that allows players to improve their character's attributes. The character attribute system is known as the game's heart. If the character is not upgraded, the movement will be significantly slowed. Furthermore, scoring points by shooting or close range is still difficult. In addition, the VC collecting still extremely unbalanced. Even you can play the hardest difficulty, but the reward is only a small amount. You'll spend most of your life upgrading your character's attributes without going through the multiplayer fun. 
**With this microtransaction structure, there is a risk of bias in the different divisions of gamers. The player with the most attribute points have high chances wins, and new players who have not been able to fully upgrade their attributes will lose.**
- AI system -
Another aspect that irritates me greatly is the AI system. This game's AI, in my opinion, is worse than the previous one, and it is completely untrustworthy. The AI algorithm can only think of running into the inner circle to shoot through the hoop while ignoring your opponent's obstacles. Furthermore, notable players such as Stephen Curry nearly did not make any single three-point shot. The other characters turned out to be three points more accurate than him.
- Network and connection issues - 
I don't have any connection issues, but everything seems to take forever on the court. The character reacts very slowly, and I can do almost nothing to assist my teammates; however, my character performs much better on MyCareer. 

**CONCLUSION**
""If this letter reaches the developer, I'd like to inform them that you did not finish the game. You're also in desperate need of cash. The game should not be released every year, but rather should be the only high-quality game available.""

The menus are trash, getting around is a mess, took me ages to find out and figure out where the tutorial is, the my career mode is full of stupid options and cutscenes that took too long to even play a match and see how things work. Nowhere is it shown nor explained how A.I. works as teammates and to what extent I can control them (unless it's hidden behind the atrocious U.I) I start my first game simulate to next appearance and I'm sat here on the sidelines waiting for something to happen. I thought this is a weird feature to not allow simulating to next appearance, turns out its a common bug that I need to either Alt tab in and out of 5x to get rid of, or VSYNC and cap it to 60hz? I'm on a 240hz screen why would me leaving it at default effect simulating an appearance. Anyways overall, what a headache of a game, it looks pretty though.

I thought I'd add even though it shows I've played about an hour... I've actually played less than 10 mins. Just goes to show you how stupid all the cutscenes are, I once clicked my teams by accident to be met by a stupid cutscene which is unskippable and about 5 minutes of opening cards.

I recently became a fan of NBA and this is my first 2k game (well, I played 2k19 on mobile). So far I have been enjoying it, particularly MyCareer. Starting with 60 overall is not that hard, you just have to focus on assists, spacing, passing, screens, and anything that avoids scoring since it's next to impossible with your low stats unless you get an open look and the perfect opportunity (in my case i mostly score off of fast breaks and pick & roll), just try to avoid making too much mistakes that will lower your team grade. Grinding for VC is also not that hard so I didn't have to pay for it, I just played MyCareer and did some quests and endorsements. I earn 1200 VC per game and 3k-5k VC per endorsement so I earn 20k-30k VC daily and now I'm 81 overall in 4 days.

Cheesecake is one of those recipes that can be intimidating but it doesn‚Äôt have to be. Making cheesecake at home can be super simple with the right technique and attention to detail. In this post I‚Äôm going to show you how to make the best old-fashioned cheesecake ever with step-by-step instructions.

There is nothing complicated about this recipe, which is just the way I like it. What you will end up with is creamy cheesecake and a buttery, delicious graham cracker crust.

What‚Äôs even better about this recipe, is once you‚Äôve tried it, you will see that it‚Äôs totally open to be adapted. You can change the crust, or mix in fun things like cookie dough, or swirl it with caramel or fudge. It‚Äôs truly the last cheesecake recipe you will need. (Update: I even created a chocolate cheesecake based on this recipe after so many requests, so make sure to check that out, if chocolate is your thing!)

What‚Äôs in this Cheesecake?
Let‚Äôs start with a quick look at the ingredients for this cheesecake recipe. (See the recipe card at the bottom of this post for amounts.)

There is nothing complicated here! Simple ingredients often make the most amazing desserts. Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôll need:

For the graham cracker crust:

graham crackers
butter
sugar
salt
For the cheesecake filling:

cream cheese
sugar
sour cream
vanilla extract
eggs
Now how to make it: 
Step 1: Bring Your Ingredients to Room Temperature
The first thing you will need to do before you make this recipe is take all your ingredients out a few hours before you plan on making your cheesecake. The way to ensure the cheesecake will bake perfectly is for everything to be at room temperature! I know this can be annoying, but trust me‚Ä¶I want you to succeed!
Step 2: Make Your Graham Cracker Crust
For this classic cheesecake recipe, we are sticking with the standard graham cracker crust. Make sure your graham cracker crumbs are finely ground. You can use a food processor or blender to do this.

Then mix your crumbs with melted butter, granulated sugar, and a little kosher salt.
Press this into the bottom and halfway up the sides of a 9- inch springform pan. I use the bottom of a glass to do this step.  A springform pan is a necessity when making cheesecake. The sides are easily removed and your cheesecake will be perfectly intact.
I like to pre-bake my crust. I have found that pre-baking lends a crispier, sturdier graham cracker crust. It only bakes for 8-10 minutes, and you can also do this step in advance!

Step 3: Make Your Cheesecake Filling
Like I said, make sure that all of your ingredients are at room temperature. Not only will this ensure it bakes perfectly, it will also prevent your cheesecake batter from being lumpy. If you try and mix the filling up with cream cheese that isn‚Äôt quite room temperature, you will get lots of lumps. A few lumps is perfectly fine, too many lumps will change the texture.
Another huge tip is to NOT over mix the cheesecake. Over mixing will incorporate too much air into the filling and cause it to crack as it‚Äôs baking. Over baking will also cause cracking too, but we will get to that in a minute.
You will need 4 packages of cream cheese for this cheesecake recipe.

Just spread the cheesecake filling on top of the crust and smooth it out using a spatula or an offset spatula.
Step 4: Bake Your Cheesecake
Baking the cheesecake is where most people start to feel intimidated. There are a lot of stories out there about how hard it is to make a cheesecake, mostly because cheesecake is traditionally baked in a water bath. But I‚Äôm here to tell you: baking a cheesecake in a water bath is EASY! You just have to follow my simple technique below.

Why are cheesecakes baked in a water bath? Because with cheesecake the goal is to bake it slowly and evenly without browning or cracking the top. A water bath lets you  insulate your cheesecake so that the outside doesn‚Äôt bake too quickly. It also helps keep the oven moist. End result: perfectly baked, moist cheesecake that is all kinds of creamy deliciousness!
How to Bake a Cheesecake in a Water Bath ‚Äì Easy Method!
First, DOUBLE wrap the bottom of your pan in foil. You bake a cheesecake in a water bath, and the foil is just a preventative measure so water doesn‚Äôt leak in and cause your crust to get soggy!
Now, carefully place your cheesecake into the oven and allow it to bake for 60 -70 minutes. Don‚Äôt open your oven constantly. I know it‚Äôs tempting to see how the cheesecake is baking, but opening the oven can reduce the oven temperature and interfere with the baking process. Wait until the 60 minute mark before you check your cheesecake.

Here‚Äôs how to tell if your cheesecake is done baking once you check it: The outside should be set, while the inside should jiggle ever so slightly. This means it‚Äôs done. If you bake the cheesecake long enough that the center is set, it is over baked. Over baking ALSO causes cracking, which is what you‚Äôre trying to avoid.

But please, if you do get a little cracking, all is not lost! This is when you break open a can of cherry pie filling and turn that cheesecake into a cherry cheesecake!
Step 5: Chill Your Cheesecake
How long does it need to chill?
Allow the cheesecake to cool at room temperature for about an hour. THEN cover the pan with foil and it will need to chill in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours, but preferably overnight.
When you‚Äôre ready to enjoy your hard work, remove the cheesecake from the refrigerator. If any condensation has built up on top of your cheesecake, just take a paper towel and dab the moisture off. Then slice it and enjoy the fruits of your labor!",1652292909,1652292909,True,0,0,0.467289716005325317,2,True,False,False

first of all i cant even describe how fucking stupid the teammates in mycareer are. their defensive and offensive IQ is comparable to an 8 year old who has never played basketball

second of all it is literally impossible to hit 3 pointers or mid range shots during games. the shot meter is garbage and most of the time even WIDE OPEN shots wont fall unless you get a perfect release

The only way to avoid that is buying VC & upgrading your character as much as the game will let you out of the gate.  That makes it much more enjoyable.  At the current price I would say it is worth buying (nine dollars and fifty nine cents).

I mostly play MyCareer mode, my char is currently on the Miami Heat in my 3rd season of play after being traded my rookie year because I wasn't getting a starting position/enough minutes on the team that drafted me 9th overall.  I have molded the Heat in to a team that's both entertaining to watch when I'm on the bench, be it with fouls or because we're up by 30, as well as being impossible to beat unless I mess around & lose on purpose.  My current lineup is myself, Jokic, Zion Williamson, Bam Adebayo, & Jimmy Butler starting, with Tyler Herro, Bol Bol (the big boi!), Chris Paul (still don't understand how he even got here in the middle of the 2021-2022 season) and then some roster filling role players that change regularly.  

I run myself at SG, Jokic at Center, Zion at PF, Jimmy at SF & Bam Adebayo at PG - we have had runs where we double the other team's score at half time on a regular basis since this lineup got in town.  I am enjoying the game very much now, but that's to be expected when my Char is a 97 overall on a team that's that stacked.  I'm looking forward to 3-peating this season as champions, and I'm planning on not signing a new contract & switching teams after my contract expires, see how many different teams I can win Chips on before retiring.

Original Review: Do not buy this game. It's literally pay to win.  Unless you're god's gift to computerized basketball, good fucking luck winning without spending money on VC to boost your character for MyCareer out of the gate.  I may be new to the game & have no fucking clue what I'm doing, but I have a MyPlayer with a 95 rated 3-point shot who is somehow missing 66% of the time despite me timing shots within a slither of the exact line you're supposed to hit.

How anyone can win the College Tournament without spending VC I don't know, I don't even think it's possible.  I'm stuck in the Semi-Finals, have tried to play the game about 15 times now, every fucking time I get ahead & my team either blows the lead when I go to the bench, or my team miraculously starts missing every single shot until the other team catches up & takes the lead.  This has happened in half the attempts so far, the other half I start out hot from 3, 3/4 or 4/5 then suddenly none of my shots will go in until the other team gets the lead.

Edit: Finally beat the Semi-Final game through sheer dumb luck I think, again I was up by 8, other team comes back to tie, then it magically let me hit some 3s again and we won.  

Explain to me HOW a 95-rated 3 point shooter can go 7/28 after starting 4/5 from 3?  Shouldn't be possible right? With this game it is.

Oh, and the PC online PvP scene is literally cheater-riddled bullshit.  Don't even bother unless you're going to play with friends only.

Don't buy this game, even on sale, it is NOT worth it, especially on PC.",1638429281,1652153637,True,0,0,0.46665036678314209,0,True,False,False
