375450,145960883,76561198052432500,0,2,1787,0,1787,1694236874,"SoI Ascension kinda summarizes my experience with other Nobunaga's Ambition games, and the words I would describe it with are: lackluster, half-baked, disappointing. Playing both SoI Ascension and Awakening, I can confidently say that these games are positively inferior compared to the RoTK series in terms of user interface, mechanics and all-round player experience.

To get straight to the point, SoI Ascension does not follow through with its intended purpose of providing all-round officer gameplay experience. The interface is not too friendly. Staring at small icons and text bars make your eyes tired pretty quick. The only way you have a chance to appreciate officer portraits and similar artwork is via events and movies. Overall graphics are very subpar, on both settlement and province-level view, and even worse than that - on the battlefield. I know that Ascension is a rendition of a much older SoI that was released in 2013, but to see such drastic degradation in user interface and graphics from RoTK 13, a game that was released a year before Ascension, is disappointing.

Mechanics and overall player experience are probably the weakest point of this game. Compare it to the aforementioned RoTK 13 to see the difference. Ascension does not allow your character to actually interact with other officers the way other historical simulation games from KOEI allow you to do. You are very limited in your interactions anywhere outside your settlement or home base. Every action you perform, be it diplomatic mission, visit to a friendly officer, bandit chase, etc. happens on the background, and you don't have much control over how exactly these interactions take course. Marriage mechanism is also very undeveloped compared to RoTK series.

My greatest personal disappointment, however, is the way custom officers are treated in this game (and this is symptomatic of the entire Nobunaga's Ambition series). From small things like not allowing Ctrl+C Ctrl+V in the character edit text, very limited space in the character bio section etc., to somewhat more serious issues like inability to select a spouse/concubine or total absence of custom characters in the event editor tool. Why would they want to feature two customization tools that absolutely do not compliment each other? Why would I be encouraged to create my custom officers if I cannot even build my own story around them? The only way I could use my officers in the event editor is by implementing wildcards (i.e. Player Officer, Daimyo, Visiting Officer, etc.), which are completely useless when it comes to creating even remotely detailed and non-generic events.

Given these shortcomings, I would nonetheless like to end my review on a positive note. The story of the Siege of Osaka is amazingly detailed and well-written. This is where this game and the entire series actually excel. To create a ~3 hr interactive story around a single event is an impressive feat, and I have to commend KOEI for that.

tl;dr
Graphics and interface are not very good, gameplay is very curtailed, don't buy if you want to have a decent custom officer experience. The storytelling is excellent though.",1694239840,1694239840,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
- New mode
- Officer mode gives you an estate to build with, can become very OP/broken if you spend a large amount of time on it
- good at going through the historical events of the period
Half/Halfs:
= some bugs fixed, and some new ones. Biggest one i've run into is CTD after about 6-7 hours of gameplay.
= if you have SOI, it's hard to justify full price for this game. If you don't have SOI, Ascension is definitely the right pick
Cons:
- Events can sometimes be confusing, and if you fail them or do them too quickly you will lock yourself out of the rest of the chain of events. this is only dealable because you have so many start dates to get to different events
- not a con so much as a gripe, i wish there were less popups about wanting to abandon you daimyo and start your own clan, after saying no three times, or deciding you wanted to support someone to unify japan it should be an option you can turn off.
- Buildings Clip through mountains or raised terrain.
- AI isn't the smartest. i've played on all the difficulties and it feels the only challenge is the AI puts more focus on troops on the harder difficulties while increasing their bonuses. Medium is premium here.

Coming off of having had enjoyed both RTK10 and Taikou Risshiden 5 greatly, I wanted to like this game...but after playing this, then Sphere of Influence again, I really can't recommend this over the base game. If you can only get one or the other and can't (won't) buy Taishi/Taishi PK, get base SoI instead.

Firstly, I didn't like how convoluted and overly complex the Development System has become as a Castle Lord. Before, development was for entire castles, and maximum development is affected by the facilities you put onto them. It was still a little complicated thinking about how best to optimize your facility placement to get the most out of your development, whether you need a castle to have more troops as an HQ of operations or to generate more income as a logistics base, but it worked, and you got the hang of it relatively quickly. Here, though, _every single facility_ has six developmental fields, each requiring one person to develop at a time at a tediously slow pace. This in addition to throwing out six stats you didn't need, also bogs things down immensely compared to SoI, especially when you start having a lot of cities under your direct control and you're finding yourself managing every single facility by hand (at least in SoI you can auto-order your cities in bulk to develop something all at once, which you can't here). I get that this is likely put in place to appeal to players who are more used to overly complex Paradox and CA strategy games like Total War: Three Kingdoms or Hearts of Iron 4, but this complexity has gone way overboard here. Taishi or Taishi PK wasn't much better, but it's still a bit less convoluted than this.

Where do I even start with Officer Play? This was the supposed main gimmick over Sphere of Influence but if you're expecting the same degree of freedom to roam around the land, interact with other officers and characters, and get yourself involved smack in your Daimyo's historical events like Taikou Risshiden 5 gave you, you *will* be disappointed. In this game, being a Custom Officer means you're confined to your own Closed Space Colony where you're stuck developing your land, answering calls from other colleagues and, unless called to battle, do little else except wait month by month and trying to scrounge up enough resources to hope to be allowed to leave your Space Colony and become a castle lord soonish. You're not allowed to leave your castle or visit other cities, and are anchored to wherever you're assigned to until you die of old age or somehow manage to have the patience to help your Daimyo win the game. I lost interest a couple of hours in precisely once I realized this.

Also, being a Custom Officer in this game is essentially pointless anyway, as the fatal flaw IMO about that...is that if you're a Custom Officer for a Daimyo, all historical events for that Daimyo TURN OFF ENTIRELY. So if you assigned your Custom Officer to the Toyotomi in 1615, for example, you don't even get the Siege of Osaka events at all. It automatically gets turned off, and you're stuck in the above described scenario ad nauseum (let this set the tone for what this game is really like). At least in Taishi PK you *can* actually choose to bring your Custom Officers to most historical battles if there's space for them (though in that game you have to actually supply your own troops to a historical event fight, rather than have them fixed for you), so that game mitigates this issue somewhat. Here, though, it's just not worth it.

That said, I did like the slight rework they've done to this game's Real-Time Battle System, mainly the fact that now all of your officers have their own individual Ability Gauges and Cooldowns, rather than sharing one big command bar between all of your units and generals (regardless of how many generals are assigned to a unit). So whereas in SoI you're only going to find yourself using 1-2 abilities at a time at best (and most likely spamming only the most powerful ability on 1-2 of your generals over and over) in a real-time battle before you're begging for a command gauge that builds ever so slowly, here every single one of your generals can contribute their abilities to a fight, making things more frantic and allowing for crazier combos of tactics/abilities in a fight. This is also one of the only things I liked about this game over Taishi PK, which reverted to SoI's real-time combat system of allowing only one ability per unit on a shared Command Gauge for some reason (but mitigates the issue by having options to allow your Command Gauge to charge faster in battle, so you can still use abilities a few more times than in base SoI).

Also, I found the 'Create your own events' function pretty novel (though I doubt anyone actually used it), and this game has the Siege of Osaka Scenario as its main focus (and a post-Osaka Fictional Scenario where Ieyasu and Hidetada were killed by Yukimura as a DLC for the Japanese version, following the Toyotomi-side Historical Event Outcome), which SoI doesn't.

There's also some bugs that has already been gone over far too many times so I won't list them here, in particular Bow and Gun stats being reversed since the Japanese version that to this day still hasn't been patched. But overall, I can't recommend this game over base SoI, or Taishi, and if you must get only one of the three as a NA player, I highly recommend getting base SoI. It would've been much better in fact, IMO, if we took the base SoI and gave it Ascension's RT battle system rework, the Siege of Osaka scenario and events, and Taishi/Taishi PK's updated portraits and ability to have your Custom Characters actually join Historical Event battles somehow. But since we get what we get, base SoI is what I'll be sticking with myself.",1478096781,1630646991,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You can even take control in historical battles that took place during this time period. My personal favorite is playing as the Ishida during the Battle of Sekigahara, or playing as Yukimura Sanada during the Siege of Osaka.

You'll find yourself spending hours upon hours with this game, eventually finding out that the sun has already set or risen after devoting your entire day with this game.

It isn't complicated like a Paradox game, but it still has many fun features and can be quite challenging in harder difficulties. Trying to invade Kyushu has always been the hardest part for me in games, luckily you can complete the game by either destroying every clan, or banning war as the shogun.

The game also has a beautiful aesthetic, every character has a beautiful portrait (plus a bunch of unused ones for created characters. or portraits from past Nobunaga's Ambition games).

Now, I have BOTH games, Ascension and the regular SOI game, and I played SOI a lot before, and that game has very positive reviews. Now... Are both games similar? Pretty much so... It's basically the same game with the exception for a few things, making this as many say, a DLC rather than a stand alone game.

But take note! What most negative reviews here are regarding broken AI behaviour... The AI doesn't gather resources, so they can't upgrade and evolve... The AI doesn't create Houses if you have one, and this would break the game for many.

Now, I took notice of this and could confirm that the AI was a bit lackluster than on SOI, so I spend a good few days looking through the forums and other sites and most people are of this opinion... NOW, I did see someone making a comment on how to fox this, so I gave it a go, and I can confirm, that the fix actually does work! 

Simply put, when you start a new game, you have to crank up the AI difficulty to the max! You may even give them some resource boosts, but I didn't see the need for it. The AI is perfectly capable to expanding and upgrading if you let everything stay on the default setting, BUT crank up the AI difficulty to the max. Problem solved for the most part. I've read there is a bug regarding muskets, but I'm not using those units yet, so I couldn't tell you.

So, what's the big difference between this game and SOI? Well you can play as a retainer here instead of the big boss himself, it gives the game a bit more depth if you are into that sort of thing, and also, I love city planing games, and the city building is a bit more complicated in this game, rather than in SOI.

Now, which game to pick if you have neither? If you just wanna raise an army and go conquer, then get SOI as many would recommend you, but if you want a bit more city development themed game in addition to conquest, give this a go. As noted earlier, it's basically the same two games with a little twist.

The only drawback I can mention is that KOEI Temco don't follow the trend and lower the price of ageing games so the price might be a bit steep to some, I get that. But I got the game at full price and I'm getting hours of enjoyment out of it.

Also, if you're new to the series, read the manual. I was so confused when I first got SoI, but that was because I never read the manual.

All the fuss about the bugs is overblown. Yes, there are bugs, but no, they don't really affect the gameplay experience at all. Many others point out the issue of AI not developing lands--this has been easily fixed, in my experience, by setting the AI incomes to high in the difficulty section. I prefer this one to SoI (Sphere of Influence) because of the more in-depth siege and naval battles, which is a massive change for the better, as well as other cool features such as an Inner Circle that really makes it seem more historical. Additionally, the economy system is much better in Ascension than in SoI, as it encourages specialization of castle towns and requires thoughtful economic planning. Being able to play as a retainer is obviously game-changing.  If you only want to play as an eastern daimyo (no naval battles), there might be reason to buy SoI, but even then the loss of siege battles and the frankly better economic system is disappointing.

Is it worth that much?  Well, these days the likes of gacha games and what not really muddle just how costly a game ought to be, but in all seriousness...  It's probably better to wait for a sale.

Still, this game does indeed feel like a refinement of what Koei tried to do in ROTK 13 (and later polished extensively for the Fame and Strategy Expansion Pack).  You can indeed play as someone in the Sengoku era, working your way up to becoming a high ranking retainer, if not a Daimyo yourself, and thus make your mark on the land.

Sphere of Influence was already a great game, and Ascension just made it better in various ways.  It feels a bit more streamlined if you're playing as a Daimyo, especially in terms of informing/reminding you just how developed your city is.  That was the one thing that annoyed me about SOI and they fixed it here.

Now, if you crave a standard 4X experience, the original Sphere of Influence and not this game is what you should pick up.  There is a much less direct, much less individual focused take than what you'd find here in Ascension.  If you crave to be someone in a historical era on a more personal footing, you should probably get ROTK 13 with the Expansion Pack instead.  However, if developing closer bonds to various officers yet still gradually rising through the ranks as someone in the Sengoku Era is what you desire, consider picking Ascension up.

It's really great and even better than the original SOI if you like to roleplay or enjoy Samurai/Dynasty Warriors. However, at the price point of $60 and with it's technical issues, I can not recommend this game.
So I've put a fair amount of time into this game, which obviously tells I really enjoy it. This might make you wonder why I'm not recommending it. It's simple, the game is a buggy mess with a great many design flaws.
First of all I should talk about the basic gameplay. (Something I forgot to do in my original writing of this review.) You play as an officer within a clan throughout the various time years provided during the Sengoku period, all the way from the birth of Oda Nobunaga to the Siege of Osaka that ended the Azuchi-Mimoriya period and began the Edo period.  The officer you play as can vary from a substitute samurai all the way up to a daimyo.
Depending on what rank you are you'll have various rights and responsibilities within your clan. From just a village if you're a lowly samurai all the way up to multiple provinces if you're a daimyo. This is why I'd follow the recommended scenarios and go with a decently powerful non-daimyo officer for your first playthrough. I.e Rairun Shimotsuma or Ujisato Gamo or Kojuro Katakura (An officer from Samurai Warriors!) There's a new style of castle managing in this version of the game where you work with tiles and the buildings within them. This new style of castle management promotes adjacency bonuses like Civ 6, though not quite as complicated IMO.
Long story short however is this game is much less about tactics than it is about being prepared for war and battle in the first place. No matter how strong of an officer you are or your army is, if you're outnumbered 10 to 1 you just won't be able to win. There's also a lot of waiting for your troops to come back in your castles in between conquests which is supposed to give you time to focus on the castle management. It's a loop that lasts around 50-100 hours per playthrough that can be pretty addicting, but also relaxing. Luckily you don't have to conquer all of Japan to win the game and unify it, you just have to conquer 30 regions and control Nijo Palace to enact the war ban policy and win.
Another note before I get into the annoyances of this game. If you prefer legitimate tactics to raw numbers, I recommend playing scenarios with event battles, where you're given a select number of units with specific officers to fight another group of soldiers. These can be very challenging, but also really fun. To do them you have to play as a specific clan during a specific time period. They're all recommended scenarios and officers by the game itself to my knowledge, but if you're interested in trying those out, there's probably a list online for them.
Finally what's wrong with the game that prompted this Not Recommended? First of all the Ai will not upgrade it's castles consistently or at all or just really badly. For example the Takeda will ruin their capital base by placing many head temples next to each other just for the negative innovation instead of next to temple quarters or paddies/farms where they'd really benefit.  The Hojo won't even place buildings in the tiles of their capital castle of Odawara! This can be really annoying when you go on a long conquest, especially as a regent, and you'll have to develop all these castles yourself long after they should've already been built up. 
Another issue with the Ai is in battle. Your army units that aren't controlled by your specific officer will issue commands to themselves if left alone for long enough. They will often run outside of gates they're supposed to be defending and kill themselves on your opponents spears, throwing away your only chance at defeating a much larger force and ruining your run. It can get very tiring telling a unit to sit in place over and over again just to lose control of them while you're on max speed and lose a huge chunk of guys before you can even react.
Another major issue with this game is technical. I'm not sure what causes it but there are some pretty bad crashes that can occur during long playsessions in this game. Sometimes the game will just outright close, which is annoying for obvious reasons, but especially so if you did a bunch of things at the beginning of that month and you'll have to do them all over again upon rebooting the game. Super bad if you don't have Auto Save turned on, so make sure you do that in the options menu! There's another glitch where the game will just turn white, and I had to alt+tab several times just to make the game come back without a cursor and fumble around until I can manage to save the game blindly.
 THE GOOD:
-They've added a new retainer mode, which is fantastic for roleplaying or getting a grips on a complicated game series. This includes an Officer view during battle which can really help you turn difficult battles in your favor.
-They've added Castle battles, which is a fun way to help expand your empire and can make a grueling siege end much faster. It's also a double edged sword on defense, as it can help you defeat a much larger force utilizing your defenses, but they wear down as your opponents keep attacking, which does effect that castle in the world map, adding some tension and tough choices in a large battle.
-All the DLC scenarios are included in this game.
-With the retainer mode, there is a staggering 2300+ Officers to play as, including created officers, as well as extra officers earned through the achievement system in the game. This offers a staggering amount of playability, hence why I and others have a lot of play hours. Keep in mind though that most officers in the game aren't really worth playing, since low stats usually makes it a slog to do anything.
THE BAD:
-There are a great many crashes in this game. Make sure to turn on auto save since it's not automatically on.
-The new defection rate of the officers is really high. This makes achieving historical events nearly impossible over a long period as key retainers required within certain clans will often bounce before the right time.
-They've removed the gallery system of the previous version of this game, so if you're interested in the historical aspect of this game, it'll be tough to actually find out much without playing as the officers you're interested in.
-Many of the castles the AI will ignore, and managing them all yourself gets really annoying after awhile. This also makes leaving the castles to your lords before you fully take care of them yourself a risky venture, as they'll neglect repairing walls or building forts on their own for a suspiciously long time.
OVERALL:
I actually really love this game. My playtime should indicate that. I would also actually recommend this to fans of the series or people who like Samurai Warriors and want to play a Strategy version that's far better than Empires since this one allows you to play as individual officers instead of just a clan. However, I cannot recommend this game to outsiders and would instead turn them to the original SOI. Especially since the price will not drop on this title outside of sales. I can only hope they take the good of this entry and apply it to the sequel after the abysmal Taishi. Playing as an officer is an experience I'll sorely miss.

Gameplay
Normally I suggest watching videos before you buy anything, but most of the vids of this game are straight up uninteresting. Most people complain about the micromanaging, which is much higher than other games of the series, but it is superficial compared to other games once you understand how it works, and most can be skipped, not that I would recommend that. The castle expansion mechanic really just exists to improve your officers, and is totally worthwhile in the beginning of the game. Later, just set it to auto, or do it from the beginning if you can't be bothered. Battles themselves are usually a waste of time. They take up your time, and are strategically unrewarding since your casualties are much higher in a battle than if you fight from the strategic map. Diplomacy and domestics rate higher in my opinion, especially since both improve your officers. Overall advancement follows a pretty linear path in that you have a local rival, a regional rival, and then you need to take over everything. Thankfully, you can cut it out at 30 provinces, as the game will let you punch out here. This eases the endgame slog considerably. However, I still say you have to play it to get a feel for it. Personally, the characters I choose to play as and their starting situations, as well as keeping myself within historical bounds keeps me more interested than outright conquering. 

AI
Unfortunately the AI gets on the warpath with a few clans and history is quickly shivved and dumped in an canal somewhere. It doesn't help that the clans that are supposed to lose the game actively cheats against. For example, I played as Yoshikiyo Murakami, a great general in Shinano that eventually loses to Shingen Takeda. Despite having one of his less capable generals surrounded, outnumbered, and with Yoshikiyo himself leading my largest army, I still lost. However, through the power of diplomacy, I was able to get Kenshin Uesugi to engage the Takeda army when came knocking, and then counterattack and eventually knock the Takeda out. That was one example - I typically play as the clans that either can't advance well or get taken down. Want a fun campaign? I recommend Yoshikiyo, or the Satomi, the Murakami Pirates at Noshima, the Ashikaga, the Azai, or the Yagyu. Overall I say the AI isn't bad, I've played against worse. It can be overly docile or overly aggressive. Doesn't seem to be a middle ground. However, when you take over a castle and your first impression is WTF were they trying to do? You'll know what was propping them up.

Sound
The music is quite good, even if the large soundtrack goes underutilized by small factions. I usually listen awhile and then switch off to my own. Voice acting is good, with many VA's I was able to identify without effort. This seems to be the last KT game made with bigger names in the industry.

Graphics
The base game was released in 2013 - It's 7 years old as of this. Plus, who plays strategy games for graphics? We're never getting that AAA effort.

Overall
I've had great times with the game. Wikipedia can help flesh out the characters more than the ingame bios, as they are woefully inadeguate. I'm no weeaboo, but I found my way to the series awhile ago and I can honestly attest that the gameplay and characters are what caused me to put the time in that I have. And if you're weighing this vs. Taishi, skip that crap. It's horribly watered down.

+战国传的加入大大增加了代入感，完成任务来解锁剧情和动画。给没有目标也不知道下一步干什么的玩家一个方向，也能看看故事。
+类似三国志的内政设定，人事，开发，建设城下町。
+半即时的战斗，随时可以暂停再指挥。比较像三国志9。
+比起战斗更注重战略，在大地图上部队可以卡位，可以绕后攻城和偷袭敌方部队。几百个城，一个一个自己操作战斗得打到天昏地暗，有效的利用资源比合战打得6更重要。
+可以拉拢野生的人众势力支援战斗。
+美工真的好看。

缺点：
-光荣模拟系列的一贯的缺点，前期肝后期挂机。后面基本不用管，全部委托军团长就好了。
-合战拉近时候的部队模型又丑又平面。

总体来说个人还是十分喜欢的。轻轻松松打一般难度，愉快地看看剧情，还能学一些战国史。网上都会有各种战国传的出现条件。如果想卡时间在统一之前出战国传，可以把整体难度调高，就能慢慢打战国传。

其实我最喜欢的是太阁立志传，最早接触是2代，一直玩到五代，光荣快点出六代啊。

It is also one of my favourite games in terms of strategy
Pros:
- Lots of creative freedom, you can make your own clan, officers, and determine the outcome of the era to be to your liking
- You can focus completely on the strategy aspect, building your bases, armies, getting officers without having to do the battles
- Vassal system is simple but works well, alliances, coaliation

Cons:
- Some aspects of the strategy can be a bit too simple for some people like the vassal system or the relations
- Your own officer career can become a bit monotone after you did it a few times
- The battles are nothing too interesting either but they serve their purpose

Overall:
I would always recommend the game if you love strategy games and are interested in the Warring States period of Japan.

Comparing the first one with this version, the AI at this version can get annoying - in a sense that they're sometimes unreasonable and can tilt you in more ways than one. The portraits here are better though, and 'officer play' is a rather interesting take on the game.

Naval Battles are probably my favorite addition to this game, it just made an immerse game much more immerse.

I recommend this game if you like to create your own character, or clan, and do ""roleplay"" stuff.

+ Play as your selected character instead of the whole clan. If your clan is 'destroyed', you can still continue playing, serving the clan that destroyed yours. If your character dies, you can continue the game by selecting one of his/her relatives to play as next.
+ Improved combat. Some event battle are also 'improved', The most noticable one being the Battle of Nagashino (playing as the Oda).
+ Siege Battle. Unlike in SoI, the siege battle here is more detailed, to capture a castle you have to break in by force or you can also try to be 'sneaky', and finally surround the Tenshu (the fancy looking building).
+ You can upgrade any castle to a max level. Yes, ANY castles.
+ Friendship system. If you're friendly enough with someone, they will 'help' you in various ways.  They will offer you some resources, gift, assist you in clan business such as constructions, reinforcements, and even offers you to marry their daugther.
+ Event Creator. If you like to mess around and create alternate history or something then this is for you.
+ All DLC scenario (From Sphere of Influence) are available.

Now, the 'not good' things :
- No Event Gallery.
- Some BGMs and Extra Characters from SOI are not available.
- You can't create events involving custom characters (besides the one you're playing as). Come on man...
- A certain fictional scenario is not available in the EN version.
- The AI is. . .lame, I guess? specificaly in resource management, they barely even upgrade their castles! Because of this most siege battles are kinda boring. I know there's an In-Game Editor but come on. . .

*Note that if you want to do Historical Events/Quests prior to Siege of Osaka (1614), I recommend getting the [url=store.steampowered.com/app/392470/]The Sphere of Influence version[/url]. Because in this version, the 'Betrayal/Defection' system is so overpowered that it often makes the conditions for the Events messed up, making you unable to do the Events/Quests.

As I am someone who has over 600+ hours on this game it’s pretty safe to say I have played this game  and I know what I am talking about. I’m going to be honest. I am no expert at this game, Only defeating 4 scenarios so far out 18 scenarios, I have not completed every scenario and defeated every stage of this game, because quite frankly, it is too much fun challenging myself playing as weaker  daimyos (lords or warlords) in the early scenarios  with less powerful clans running around, and fighting against impossible odds later in the same scenario if I did not build up fast enough. So check out my review first before you go with other reviews that are less than 40 hours, because chances are they started playing this game thinking they were gonna get a Dynasty Warriors (hack and slash) game and were like, “WTF is this?” and then they quit after 10 hours of scratching their heads and not understanding a thing about strategy games or KOEI games for that matter. If you’re looking for a mindless beat  them up fighting adventure game move along and stop giving bad reviews to a game company that  has been around for over 3 decades now producing strategy games. Go buy Dynasty Warriors 45 or whatever hack and slash game KOEI has produced lately, so maybe KOEI will continue to produce such classics games as these for their true AMERICAN fans. 

That said, “Let’s get to the review!”

Ratings:
Graphics: 8 out of 10. It’s a strategy game.
Difficulty: 10 out of 10. You can ramp everything  up and get slaughtered quite easily as a daimyo in the first month as a weaker ruler and even stronger ones, get double triple teamed by the computer.
Gameplay Domestic: 9 out of 10. Playing as a retainer doing your domestics for your village gets you recognized by your daimyo and he/she will grant you a territory as a Chamberlain. Continue doing missions to become a Lord. Continue doing that to become a Regent, or switch sides to another ruler. (Don’t reccomend doing that all the time.) Usually, some of the dumbest request to switch sides, makes no sense.  I wish enemy daimyo’s would promise you more land, or their daughter if you marry them. Something in return instead of, or just switch to our side kind of deal. Though sometimes it’s a good idea if your daimyo is getting butchered, switching sides will save your lordship title. The idea is to become a lord or daimyo. 
Gameplay Combat: 5 out 10. This is where things could be much improved, especially on rifles. In previous Nobunaga games, rifle units were slow moving, but devastatingly powerful units at range. This game makes combat seem too linear and predictable. If you don’t have a higher number of troops you lose, regardless if you have rifles and your enemy doesn’t.  A lot of times I find myself automating the combat. I thought maybe if I increase my castle military proficiency I would do better in combat. That or may not be the case, but is just seems like if I have 23,000 troops I will destroy a bunch of 4,000 troops units unless they have over 23,000 troops in units altogether.
Replay Value: 10 for 10. I’ve played over 1000+ relaxing hours of downtime making my own clans of vocaloids  and other anime type characters in the officer creation menu. Plus, I play as different officers & such. The only gripe I have is I’m a girl. Why can’t the girl characters have children? Only the men can have successors. Doesn’t make any sense. I know in history women were probably treated very poorly back in the 1500s, but it’s 2018. Let’s add a little of history breaking elements and let females have children even if they aren’t married or not. 

Overall Summary:
Game opening: Excellent piece of cinematic cutscenes of music and sound; focused in on the daimyo who changed history, Oda Nobunaga and various clan flags circling about him during the Warring States period of Japan; Sengoku Jidai 1467-1615.  Next, Ishida Mitsunari versus Ieyasu Tokugawa cutscene of Ishida a hand full of cavalry charging through enemy lines on horseback with guns drawn aimed at Ieyasu, while Ieyasu knocks over his seat angry drawing a  katana at the defiant Ishida (which never happens in the game and probably never in history as depected.) Then, to a cutscene of Oda Nobunaga standing in space flipping his red cloak around and making eye contact with the viewer breaking the fourth wall in all his glory wearring western type plate armor before his unfortunate downfall to general Akechi Mitsuhide in the “1582 Like a Dream” scenario at the height of Nobunaga’s power, gone in a blink of an eye to traitorious rebellion. If you can get past that part, you’re probably hyped  and thinking, “Wow, cannons and flintlock rifles being used in this game! I can’t wait to get rifles and use  them on Takeda’s cavalry like in history, where the Nobunaga clan used rifles to end the most powerful cavalry of that time. WELL, let me stop you right here to gripe about this. The rifles in this game are practically worthless. Maybe I’m wrong, but I don’t see how they have an effect what-so-ever in combat, because combat is based on one overall thing. Who has the most number of troops, which shouldn’t be the case. In history, smaller numbers of troops defeated vast and overwhelming odds based on leadership, ambush, surprise, and knowing your enemy, like it says in Sun Tzu’s Art of War Manuel. Also, in previous Nobunaga Ambition games, rifles were absolutely deadly and overpowered. As, they should be if used correctly. Humans even with full decked out Samurai armor on cannot survive small pieces of metal flying at hundreds of miles an hour and entering their body at high speeds of velocity without any ramifications. You die. Even in modern warfare military tanks get shredded by RPGs and tank buster guns. Metal armor doesn’t stop projectiles all the time. I digress.

Menu Screen: After you get past the cut-scene in the beginning which you can bypass anytime by pressing a key, you get a menu screen, during these times, load screens often prompt different characters who may or may not of existed back in the Feudal Warring States Period. You can select new game, load game, edit officers and such from here. You can also look at the officer directory too on officers you come in contact with in different scenarios you play. There’s also an option to post to Facebook, which I did not use. 

New Game: Do the tutorial first. If you have never played this sort of game before, do the tutorial. Even if you are a veteran, KOEI is adept at revamping every strategy game they make. I’m not sure why they do this. But, just about all their strategy games no matter how similar in graphics, features, and/or the game’s progression is different in many ways.
Starting scenario games let’s you do a multiple amount of things before you even start playing depending on your time and ambition to change things in the game. No pun intended, but you can realistically change every scenario around and never play the same game twice in any given scenario by selecting “Edit Locations.” I rarely do this, because in one scenario alone, for instance the first scenario 1534 A.D. Birth of Nobunaga I counted 98 different clans you can play as. In each one of these clans average anywhere from 1 to 50+ officers depending on the clan. Bigger clans have more officers making it easier in some respects for you to be in that clan. But, there are weaker clans like the Mariyatsu clan which is located right next to Hojo clan. With this many clans and officers allows you to play the same scenario as different Daimyo, Lords, Chamberlains, and Retainers. You can even choose to make your clan provided you got creative before you started a new game and created your own characters and placed them correctly in the timeline of each scenario you may want to play.

Have fun. Hope this review helps you.",1529641671,1529642920,True,45,1,0.789313733577728271,6,True,False,False

Not recommended for those who don't enjoy strategy and rpg game with feudal Japan historical setting. 

You control individual officer, historical or custom officer. You can play as ruler of your own clan or a low rank officer. The game ends when your clan becomes the most powerful clan in Japan and your clan controls Kyoto when you can declare ban of warfare (or suggest your clan's ruler if you play as an officer). There is a mode where you have to take over all parts of Japan by military conquest if you  want but be careful about making too many enemies because all clans will form a coalition against your clan if you become too powerful. Small clans can surrender to your clan automatically when your clan becomes big enough.

I know the name of the game is Nobunaga's Ambition but the game favors heavily to Oda Nobunaga. He has the highest quantity of high quality officers such as Hideyoshi, Toshiie, Mitsuhide, etc. If this is your first time playing the game, your safe bet is to play as an officer under Oda Nobunaga and prevent Mitsuhide's betrayal event which is not really that hard in my opinion. I tried to put high quality officers in neighbouring clans such as Takeda, Uesugi, Hojo, etc to provide balance against Nobunaga but he still eventually steamroll against everyone so if you seriously want to take down Nobunaga, you have to control your own clan and when you are big enough, throw everything you have against Nobunaga. When I play as Takeda or Uesugi officers, my ruler AI makes stupid decision such as sending smaller units against much larger Oda units resulting in heavy losses. Nobunaga later invades my clan's territory and when he offered me to surrender, I did so when I am a castle lord resulting an achievement. 10 out of 10 for simulating a backstabbing officer.",1523945511,1523945511,True,2,1,0.525720536708831787,1,True,False,False

I would call NOBUNAGA'S AMBITION: Sphere of Influence - Ascension a education sowftware rather than a game. You can actually learn a lot history knowledge if you follow the scenarios. 

Compared to NOBUNAGA'S AMBITION: Sphere of Influence, Ascension is a huge improvement. Heres the every reason I prefer Ascension over SOI.
1: Enemy and Ally AI improved notably, especially on max diffuculty,  For example, smaller Daimyos would actually form alligence to protect each other, so it is hard to invade them without much strategy like in SOI. 
2: You can play as a Daimyo just like you did in SOI. But in ascension, you can also play as an individual samurai to climb your way up. You can even claim your independence after you controll enough land and start war with your former boss. This is so fun playing this way.
3: You can now level up your castle, and make it unbreakable like Odawara. In SOI, crap castles will just stay crappy and you can't do much about it.
4: Ascension includes all the scenaio DLC (~$3 each)which you have to buy individually in SOI. This is a big plus for me.
5: More Characters, and some of the characters' protraits are more stylish. (Murakami Yoshikiyo's new look is so freaking cool.)
6: Big overhaul on city management system. You now need to actually think what you should build to maximize the gain. No matter it is food, soldier, money or other civil structures and policies, they are all chained up. And sometimes doing the management feels like doing math, and I somehow both hate and like it.

The Cons:
1: The micro battle isn't improved too much. Soldiers still don't look 3D enough, kinda like Papercut figures.
2: When you play as individual samurai, marrige system doesn't seem too useful, or..meaningful? Because even if you did not marry someone's daughter, somehow you still get a baby. It doesn't make sense. Also, there's no divorce option, if you marry someone, you stuck with her. This is let down to me.

Overall, I personally think this is the best Samurai themed grandstrategy game on market. The history and the people at that time period feels so vivid and detailed in Ascension. This game totally satisfied my hunger for Sengoku history. Absolutely recommended.",1512454165,1512455610,True,6,0,0.588934779167175293,3,True,False,False

It has more features than SOI + you don't have to buy extra dlc's, they are included in this game. You could say this game is a mix of Civilization and Total War in the Sengoku period. 

If you are really into the ""Time of the Warring States"" (sengoku jidai), you should totally buy this game. (Just get it in a sale for 50% or even less)

If you expect a game like TW: Shogun 2 you are wrong.

This game has a lot of in-depth strategy when it comes to building, council your city, bringing prosperity to your domain, keeping your officers at bay with gifts, fiefs or just victorious battles, preparing for war, diplomacy and colluding/enticing with officers from other factions, where you can go from just pacifying for some months to defecting with their whole castle/s. I really liked the video sequences and the ingame scenes, because they give you a short view on many of the historical characters involved in this game, if you already know them or don't like them, you can either skip the video or fast forward the scene. You can also add your own officers and create your own events or, if you like to, you can become an independent clan leader. What's new to this game is, the ""Officers Play"" which is actually interesting and fun, but can be quite repetitive after some time. I actually liked to be just a substitute to a chamberlain/lord, where you have your own ""playing field"" to build on while accomplishing goals for the missions your Lord gave you. This game has a lot of historical information you can obtain, which is great, but it is also easy to block you out on a lot of events, because you expand your territory too fast or marry one of your children to some retainer or lord. I played multiple clans in different times/scenarios and always learned some new things I missed out before, because of my gameplay or the AI doing uncalculated moves, which i actually liked, because it never got boring.
 
It falls kind of flat when it comes to combat, not comparable to a total war game, but i would say it's average and if you really play the battles like they are meant to be, also challenging on higher AI levels. The game becomes a bit boring later on when you rule like half of the map, because it's literally just sending armies to the castles you want to conquer, while you have more than enough ressources. 

All in all it's more than an average game when you are interested in this time period, if you are not interested at all, i don't think you should play it, but you should keep an eye on this game series in the future. With some optimizations to the series in the coming years, it could turn into a game like TW Shogun 2 or probably better and I would highly welcome that.",1512354882,1512354882,True,23,0,0.724896013736724854,0,True,False,False

The first couple of ""Most Helpful Reviews"" must have played either an old version of the game, or their copies were just bad, because I have experienced none of what they seem to have problems with. My fellow retainers ask me for resources, my daimyo offered me my own castles once I took out a few enemies in his/her name, and while I can create discontent in officers of other daimyos, I can't just grab them up immediately. I have noticed that, if you play as a retainer, your lord does tend to do basically nothing except give you commands and send themselves out if you battle close enough, but in my experience, that's because I kinda steal all the retainers he/she has.

If it's a competition between this one and the original, it really just comes down to whether or not you want to insert yourself in history. You can make yourself in this, and whatever officer you play is the one that's the most important, so the game focuses on you almost entirely, while running little simulations for everyone else. It's not a bad way to play; it feels more like a tactical, large scale version of Samurai Warriors: Empires. Take over Japan, whether as yourself or someone else!

there's plenty of positives, but manual combat is probably the weakest aspect of the game. if you're hoping for a japan-centered tactical battles like total war shogun. then y ou might be disappointed. it has them, just not as good as TW series.

game's diplomacy is decent, though the AI can be wonky at times in terms of deciding alliances. AI is decent in battles, but the game doesn't have much to go on, in terms of battles, so if you find out one or two ways to exploit the AI, you will have an easy time beating the enemy, unless you get unlucky with tactics and the enemy outnumbers you.

the music isn't bad, but it tends to be too loud for me so after 70 hours, i just muted it and put whatever else i want in the background.

game has a custom-character option which not only lets you use the in-game pictures for your characters, but you can use your own custom pictures as well. the limit for said characters is pretty high, so you can go crazy and create 
somewhat elaborate family lines.

and the game has a random location generator, where it lets you scramble the starting locations of each faction, with the ability to lock in a certain clan [or all] in certain locations, if you want them to start in it, and randomize the rest. so it adds to replayability

i'd rate the game a 7.5/10. points going down from music, combat [which honestly is not a big deal for me, but i still think its a negative, if you consider how decent of a job koei did with older games such as rotk 7, kessen 1 and 3, dynasty tactics] and the lack of a proper simulation since that was the big selling point of the game.

+ Is there a scenario about Siege of Odawara too or something like that? Well I got the event that ""might be "" led to it but then somehow they suddenly changed daimyo so the main event didn't even trigger at all.

+ Tried the 2nd times and I found Sanada clan was completely beaten by Uesugi, alongside Ashina, Mogami, and Date (almost). And the event trigger.

Its not. However the improvements in AI, revamped battles adding siege and naval, and the ""start as an officer"" play mode option makes this by far a better option to purchase. Especially considering original SOI and Ascension were the same price at the time i purchased. I played every other KOEI game on console (playstation1-3) and was concerned that on the computer controls would be janky or just not as easy to manuever. No worries. Still easily accessed menus and overall control of the interface. I would suggest KOEI include controller compatibility in future games considering they already have the games mapped for that on console. I mean why not include controller function if its the code is already there? IDK maybe there is a legitimate reason but i cant figure out why.

combat is smooth and quick.

You can start huge rebellions midgame and watch the Oda clan or hojo clan fall apart from infighting :^)

If you're looking for a game that will give even the best strategic and tactical minds a workout, this is it.

A few things to consider:
1) This game, even if you're playing an officer in a large force like the Hojo, Takeda, Uesugi, etc.. revolves heavily around diplomacy and proper fief/force administration.  

2) Using strategy is a key component to surviving and force expansion (enticing officers, appeasing tribes, forming strategic alliances)

3) Even small forces can compete in this game if you choose an officer from that force.  You just have to have patience and take your time to develop your territory and controlling officer.

4) The story progression (historical) is great and I highly recommend playing all the scenarios just to see the historical cut-scenes, especially if you play a famous historical officer (example: Oda Nobunaga).

The only drawback to the game, speaking from a feminine point of view, is the lack of being able to marry yourself off playing a female character and not being able to have children.  However, this is just a minor thing and shouldn't stop anyone from buying and playing this.

- Addition of Lumber and Iron resources to manage.

CONS
- Can only use ""Charge"" and ""Loose"" battle commands on your own officer now.
- Guns are bugged and weaker than Bows when all the in-game help says they are supposed to be stronger.
- Playing as a retainer breaks your clan due to bug(s). Your daimyo will never create any new houses or ever expand his castles lands.
- Bugged AI will not buy Iron or Lumber like the player. If an AI lord doesn't not have the resources at their base(s) they never upgrade their holdings.
- Removed Horses and Firearms resources.
- Event Editor doesn't let you directly target your custom officers.
- Regents and their management have been simplified. You just assign them a base, a target and a ""attack people besides your target"" toggle.
- Your Regents can no longer send/receive resources, and you can't issue them any orders at all.

I'm a big fan of Koei's historical simulation game and have spent countless hours on them, but this is literally one of the most buggy product. This game is a big step back compared to ascension, let me explain some of the bugs.

- AI lords and daimyo does NOT trade resources, what this means is 90% of the daimyo and lords do NOT develop their land AT ALL because they are lacking wood and/or iron. So you can wait 50 in game years and some fief will have exactly the same facilities as what they started with in the beginning.
- AI lords and daimyo spend most of their gold income at policies. Like if they have income of 800 they spend 750 on policies... coupled with the problem above, they literally do not develop anything.
- If you are a retainer/chamberlain/lord/regent, your AI daimyo does not create other lords, which means your daimyo can conquer whole of Japan and the only lords are yourself and the lords that exist at the start of the scenario.
- Bow and Gun stats are reversed. Imagine how broken and stupid this is.
- The game looks fun at the beginning, playing as retainer, until you realized that all other retainer does not have a domain like yourself. Literally zero immersion once you realized this.

Once you know the ropes of this game, it is really stupidly easy compared to the original Sphere of Influence. For example you can try playing as the Uesugi in this game and compare it with the experience playing in the original game. Takeda in this game has no iron income, and therefore does not develop their fiefs whatsoever, so soon you have so much more troops and resources and conquer them easily. Also you can unrealistically entice Masayuki Sanada to defect immediately to your clan from the beginning of the game, because apparently he is unhappy to serve his dad Yukitaka because ""he is weaker"" according to the loyalty modifier. This basically sums up the incompetent AI and broken game mechanics of Ascension. In the original game, Takeda develop their fiefs and actually provide a challenge, and you can't steal his historically loyal officers easily.

Would recommend this game if the major bugs above are fixed in the future.",1479047949,1479047949,False,218,7,0.830944478511810303,42,True,False,False

Whatever complexity was missing in Sphere of Influence was added to this expansion. I am completely engrossed in the management and strategizing in my small, six castle realm. Not to mention even being able to choose to play as retainers, making the game that much more satisfying as you climb the political ladder from officer to Shogun. 

Another great addition was the new officer view in battle phases. An amount of realism is now a part of the battles with so many conditions and formations you can deploy. Not to mention the simplistic yet fun siege battles added in Ascension. 

I feel a lot more invested in my retainers when I can befriend them and acknowlede their accomplishments with rewards,

I can feel myself playing this game for hundred of hours as I do with most grand strategy games I enjoy.

This is your first day on the job?
OK Steve, I will assign you to a kitchen.
You must now grow buns, make beef patties, bust out our world famous golden fries, have pickles ready and apply sauce.
Understand? Good.
If you put the frier next to the fridge, it will increase efficiency and produce more fries.
Never forget that increasing oil flow around the friers will increase the output as well.
This is important, because more fries = more customer.
More customer is needed to win the war against other fast food chain.
But don't forget, we can't go to war without Coke, so build a few coke dispensers.
To increase Coke output, build it close to the ice dispenser.
Good. Special resources like Chicken allows you to create McNuggets when you place the proper appliances around it.
Try it now.
See? Now you have McNuggets to increase popularity and customers!
Don't forget when you have enough resources, you can apply Staff Training to unlock new machines and improve the productivity even more.
Advanced Fryer station needs Advanced Refrigeration and Advanced Oil Flow to hit Level 5.
Alright, order up. Please provide the following:
1500 Buns
750 Patties
1000 Fries
800 Coke

Serve the Daimyo and be honorable!

Hi, I'm Oda. Your floor manager.
I see you've been productive lately.
Here is 100 Honor.
Good job.
I will now give you new rank of Newcomer.
I see you have space for a new Coke Machine here.
Please buy one and put it here, I will give you 200 litres of coke if you do so.
Keep up the good work. 

Hi, I'm Honda. I work here too.
Let's be friends.
Would you like to marry my daughter?
No pressure.

Steve, my station is running low on Coke,
Can you provide 100 Coke?
