Summary:
Left 4 Dead is a cooperative first-person shooter video game developed by Valve Corporation. Released in 2008, the game focuses on a group of four survivors who must navigate through various levels filled with hordes of zombie-like infected creatures. Players can choose to play as one of the four characters, each with unique personalities and abilities.

The game is divided into several campaigns, each consisting of multiple chapters that present different environments and challenges. The survivors must work together to reach safe houses while battling the infected and special infected mutants with unique abilities.

One of the standout features of Left 4 Dead is its AI Director, a dynamic system that adjusts the difficulty and pacing based on the players' performance. This ensures a dynamic and unpredictable gameplay experience with each playthrough.

Left 4 Dead emphasizes teamwork, communication, and strategic coordination among players to successfully overcome the hordes of infected and complete the objectives. The game received critical acclaim for its innovative cooperative gameplay, intense atmosphere, and replayability.",1415503832,1708695532,True,3,0,0.558891832828521729,0,True,False,False

Pros
-» Gameplay: There is a nice array of weapons to pick from: pistols, shotguns, axes...you name it
-» Soundtrack and sound effects: gloomy and convincing for the context
-» Graphics: a plus amongst all brackets to consider, adding to the feel and pace of the story till the final chapter
-» Replayability: very interesting if you aim to collect all steam achievements, have online merit or play its harder iterations
-» Difficulty: Suitable for newcomers to the genre
Cons
-» If you compare the quality of the game to its sequel, there isn't much you could complain. LFD is already a great installement to the series

------------------------
Des vocalises, customisable possible à placer pour faire dire des bêtises à nos bons survivants. En modifiant un fichier possible de se faire un skin de perso, Des maps customs à avoir sur des sites, légitimes pour changer un peu d'air.
------------------------
A l'aide de groupes communautaires, ou via la console, il reste simple de trouver, des serveurs ou du monde, y jouant que ce soit en customs ou normal pour le serveur.
Le côté graphique ne dérange en rien bien que vieux. Puis le gameplay simple en soi.
------------------------
Armes de level 1 puis 2 en cours de campagne, sous chapitre à traverser jusqu'à la porte rouge de fin de zone. L'ia réagira en fonction de la difficulté jouer, ne pas trop restée loin, des autres ni trop proches.
Le TC est actif, il faudra faire attention, à ce qu'on fait pour ne pas avoir de reproche.
------------------------
En soi L4D reste un bon shooter, une communauté qui lui reste fidèle, même si parfois des sélections naturelles restent présentes, le prix du jeu reste raisonnable en solde il est à peine à 2 €.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

The servers :
Mainly friendly, a few people who don't understand how to play here and there, but many of them are skilled and willing to keep retrying and helping you if you die.
The people are fun to chat and hang out with and while they may not talk much, they are very active.
There is also at least 1 server you can play at all times, I have only played for 7.7 hours across 2 days, but there is at least 10 or so servers every time.

The characters :
Lovable, a lot more personality than games like Payday or Half-Life, even though those games are cool as hell, games which i also recommend, but aside from that the characters designs are iconic too, i'd say the L4D2 characters are more iconic but that's only because that one still gets updated.

        [td]💾Graphics[/td]
        [td]The graphics are pretty good for a 2008 game. Left 4 Dead has more of a charm compared to its Left 4 Dead 2 counterpart. The levels look really atmospheric and scary. The UI is really nice in this game, and I actually prefer this one over Left 4 Dead 2. The game runs really nice and had no crashes or stutters while playing this. Also the characters movement feels more “fluid and smooth” compared to Left 4 Dead 2, it’s hard to explain so take that how you want.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎮Gameplay[/td]
        [td]The gameplay was really unique when this game came out. Four survivors going against hordes of zombies and special infected that feel truly unique makes this game just so addicting to play. With a great amount of weapons and likable characters, I never got tired of hearing the characters' dialogue. If you die in game, you will respawn in a closet so you have to rely on your friends to get you out, or just wait until the next level as you will respawn back. The versus mode is really fun and if you have a part of eight players, well prepare for a long night of fun. I used to play this game on xbox 360 back on release with friends and we always played this game. It has a memorable place in my heart so I may be a bit biased when I say it's one of the best games ever made. Now if you are picking between Left 4 Dead or Left 4 Dead 2, honestly I would be Left 4 Dead 2. Okay now hear me out, Left 4 Dead 2 already has all the campaigns that Left 4 Dead has, and also steam workshop. I just find it hard to give a reason to go back into this game. Now if you are looking to bring in that nostalgia or curious about the original, you won’t be disappointed.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎭Multiplayer[/td]
        [td]Now the multiplayer is where the game truly shines. You have Co-op and PVP in this game. Let’s start with the Co-op. You have different game modes, starting from Campaign, Realism, Scavenge and Survival. I mainly played Campaign and some survival and they are both amazing game modes. Realism mode is basically like a hardcore Campaign mode. So you have a good bit of fun with the Singleplayer/Co-op modes. Also Mods work for Campaign mode as well if you play Co-op. Versus mode is really fun as well. It’s a 8 player game mode where you have 4 survivors, and 4 infected players. You win based on how fast you make it to the safehouse, distance, etc. It’s a fun chill gamemode with friends, but can be pretty toxic with randoms from my experience.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🕛Playtime[/td]
        [td]Left 4 Dead has pretty good playtime. The versus mode is absolutely fun, the campaigns are incredible and the gameplay is addicting. If you have any friends that love a good classic, you will add many hours into this game.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎧Sound[/td]
        [td]I love the sound design in this game. Now I’m not talking about the music, as the music is not like some Resident Evil save theme material, but the audio queues you get, for example a hunter has a specific audio queue. Hordes have a specific audio, every enemy does. Now the Tank (basically the boss) has its own theme and it's really good. The gun sounds good and not cheesy or lazy, the melee weapons have a good punch to them when you hit a zombie. It's all good and I see no issues at all.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]❗Bugs❗[/td]
        [td]Every game has some sort of bugs even though you may not “see them” or experience them. I haven’t really had any issues in this game. The AI are pretty “special” in their pathing and trying to help you get up from nearly dying. I wouldn’t trust the AI to do much of anything besides heal you.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🔅Performance[/td]
        [td]This game runs absolutely flawlessly. I had no stutters, crashes, frame drops, etc.You will be able to run this game with no problem at all.[/td]

        [td]🔗Conclusion[/td]
        [td]This game brings so many memories back on the Xbox 360. Beating all the campaigns on Expert was such a joy with friends but some of the best moments in my gaming experience. Even for newcomers, you have to give this game a try.[/td]

The campaign is extremely fun, at times it does feel a little repetitive, especially when your are playing with bots. None the less, it is an amazing game when it comes down to the unique gun play, interesting characters, and the special infected to spice it up.

Versus Mode
Versus mode really got me to understand the true potential of this game. Granted, sometimes it takes a really long time to get into matches due to this being the lesser game in the franchise. But being able to play as the special infected really brings a whole other level to this game. What makes versus mode shine is all the coordination and strategy involved in it. Going in alone as an infected is never an option which brings in the strategic play of all the coordination. In matter a fact, I'd argue that the game is partially cared by this remarkable game mode.

Complaints
My only complaint is that the game ends up crashing with an 'OUT OF MEMORY' warning often enough to the point where It's irritating and at the end of levels I have to just start praying that my game doesn't crash.

Rating
Left 4 Dead is quite the classic, and still holds up well to this day. It goes on sale often for a $1, regardless, $10 is still worth the price, so if you haven't played you should certainly get it when it's on sale. If it weren't for the crashing this game would be a 10/10 in my book, but considering the fact that is happens often enough my honest rating would be a 9.2/10.",1704856273,1705817890,True,1,0,0.508196711540222168,0,True,False,False

Left 4 Dead 1 is much more thematically horrific, providing an ambiance that's hard to replicate in a game of its nature. I find you have to play L4D1 a little more calculative-ly than L4D2, given you aren't provided as crazy of a kit as you are in L4D2, adding to the heavy horrific air that clouds over L4D1s campaigns. I love the audio design, the OSTs gentle but progressive sound keeping a tempo as you struggle, versus L4D2 where you slaughter. A lot more things in L4D1 have this sort of weight, on your senses, and in the gameplay itself, giving it some differences to the pacing and tempo that L4D2 has.

There's a mountain of love and polish that's loud and bluntly present in this game. From how infected behave and react to the environment, to the voice acting and how expressive and lively the cast are whilst fighting perilously against hordes upon hordes of common and special infected, to the various 'chemistries' (I'm inventing a word just for this), the cast themselves share between one another... I could ramble on and on. The map design feels like it was actively played and transformed, with L4D1 having my favorite finale out of all the campaigns, being Blood Harvest.

I'd argue to anyone, even on its own or if you've played Left 4 Dead 2, that Left 4 Dead 1 is a must. It doesn't overstay its welcome anywhere, and is a showcase of a Valve that once experimented with unique ways to evolve their own tech, and formulas, in a focused, condensed, tense and terrifying experience that feels fresh to play decades later.",1705792486,1705792486,True,15,0,0.69567263126373291,0,True,False,False

- Open the game
- Choose quickplay
- Nobody's online, so you need to make a server instead
- Start the match
- Kill the 1 special infected the director spawns for the entire chapter
- Hold M2 and walk to the safe room
- Find T2 weapons at the start of chapter 2
- Choose the autoshotgun because it outclasses every other gun
- Follow the main path to the safe room because there's no reason to look for supplies
- Kill the tank in 5 seconds because the autoshotgun is broken
- Ignore the witch because she can't move
- When a horde comes, hold M2
- Find some grenades
- Choose the pipe bomb, because the molotov is useless
- Never use the pipe bomb because all horde events can be beaten by holding M2
- Come across a running crescendo event
- Treat it as a hold your ground crescendo event instead
- Hold M2, wait until the event ends
- Wait as the director spawns the special infected one at a time so you can kill them easily

Ok, I liked the suspense, the thrill when you begin to play this apocalyptic game, which derives from the dark gloomy survival atmosphere and the zombie hordes that rush at you. But that feeling of tension lasts only 3,4 hours.  
Then you understand the biggest downside of this game: 
1) it's incredibly repetitive. All the missions are the same. Kill the zombies - the regular ones and the 4 special types (smoker, hunter, boomer and tank) and endure the hordes that spawn every minute. And of course get to the safe zone. 
2) The maps feel empty, and not very interactive (not much to destroy or blow up). 
3) There isn't anything to buy, upgrade or build (for example, why not having the possibility to build some defense system like walls, spikes, traps etc...?).
4) The environment is way too dark. I understand that it's a post-apocalyptic game and that the power went out everywhere. But still.....it is annoying to have to plow through all those dark maps, because it subtracts from the enjoyment of exploration. 
5) The multiplayer experience is poor. It is good that I first finished the campains on singleplayer and only then I played them in multiplayer - because the great majority of players moved on to Left4Dead 2 and Left4Blood. The ones that still play rush mindlessly to the end of the mission, so you can't take your time to explore and you can't play properly/realistically - which is to stick together and play carefully. Also there are a lot of hackers and trols. Multiplayer is ok only if you play with your steam friends, and especially if you play with your real life friends. 
6) There are some extra modalities but they are badly done - ""versus"" where one team play as monsters and one team as survivors - it is unbalanced and chaotic. ""Survival"" is just the ""hold the fort"" version of the maps - which is very hard - and only possible to finish with gold medal when you play alongside experienced and serious players. 
7) I didn't like that you can carry only 1 weapon, 1 health pack and 1 bomb- which can be a problem on singleplayer because the bots cannot carry bombs. 
8) The hordes rush at you every minute - after a while it gets annoying. 
It's not a bad game, I had a lot of hours of fun. But the thing is - only the first few hours are really great-thrilling entertainment and the rest is just repetitive grinding to the end. The golden years of this game are long gone (of course - it's a 2008 game) and the visibility is too low - which can be a problem for people with eye sight problems.",1705328509,1705328767,False,1,2,0.492777138948440552,0,True,False,False

The first years the game  out, I remember playing it at internet cafes, when I was just less than ten years old, so often, getting horrified and thrilled at the endless hordes of zombies as well as special zombies charging at me. I would play all campaign missions, and the first campaign the most, it never gets old.

Here I am, currently 21, still playing the game, to this day, for the first time on my very own Steam account, garnering tens of achievements. Sadly, there's not a lot of people playing it anymore, as expected, given its age over decades. If you intend on playing with multiple people, it's best to play with your friends as bot/NPC team members aren't the best. None of them will go forward but they love to heal. 

I will always love this game. But most importantly, I won't let a single member be left 4 dead.

Full Review: Left 4 Dead is one of the most iconic zombie franchises of all time. All characters are unique and coordinate together very well with each other. The game is also at its best when playing with a full team of friends and against the onslaught. There is plenty of content to go around for the base-game, especially when it comes to venturing into the campaigns. There are still some issues I have with this entry, however.

The versus game mode can be highly unfair at times, mainly for the infected. If there is only one infected team player, there is no stopping the survivors, and no AI to compensate missing player slots.

Modding for the original Left 4 Dead however is a much more complicated, unlike its sequel, mainly due to how there is no Steam Workshop involved. Even the vanilla modding method (i.e. addons folder) sometimes doesn't apply to certain modifications, which makes custom content a little bit of a challenge for those not experienced in modding.

Conclusion: Be advised that this game also has its content brought into Left 4 Dead 2, but is a much more lazy and inaccurate port to the sequel. If you wish to have a decent original Left 4 Dead experience, do yourself a favor, and PLAY THIS VERSION INSTEAD. This is not to say Left 4 Dead 2 is a bad game (because its far from it), but their port is nothing but laziness and was only done for convenience.",1573744572,1704569591,True,3,0,0.559050261974334717,0,True,False,False

The gameplay is awesome, I really like the details and the weapons. The story is okay for me although might be better for others. The characters are great too, along with the decent audio and graphics. I rarely play first person shooter (FPS) games, but this was both easy and challenging. I would also recommend to play with your friends for a better gameplay. It is a nice game, although I will have to say that there is friendly fire in the game but people seem to abuse that and just like all other FPS games, there are toxic players so if I were you I would just leave. There are also seem to have small bugs in it and it is sometimes hard to maneuver in first person. Sometimes I get stuck or I can't get through a door so I have to respawn or try and find a way. A good game with small flaws, the developers did a good job.

I must say this is one of the Zombie FPS games that is enjoyable and overall good than other games I have played. I also absolutely LOVE the part when I burn and explode the zombies with explosives and fire.

 I do recommend this game but with some tips like play singleplayer first and use shotguns/assault rifles for new players. And ALWAYS find and carry cans explosives to make hordes of zombies to go BOOM.

Positives:
- Good Graphics & Audio
- Awesome Gameplay
- Good Story
- Cool characters and weapons
- Does not need a lot for PC requirements

Negatives:
- Small Bugs
- Sometimes you get stuck
- Friendly fire exists in the game which obviously is abused
- You have normal walking speed in the game but cannot run in this game with the shift key, otherwise it will just slow you down. You will just have to play without using the shift key.

Neutral:
- Worth the price if it's on sale

The game's hallmark cooperative gameplay brings together four survivors, each with unique skills and personalities, fostering a sense of camaraderie as they fight to survive.

What sets Left 4 Dead apart is its dynamic and intense gameplay. The AI Director creates a constantly evolving experience, ensuring that no two playthroughs are the same. From the strategic use of limited resources to the teamwork required to fend off waves of infected, the game instills a sense of urgency and cooperation, making every moment a thrilling challenge.

The game's iconic 'campaign' structure offers multiple scenarios with different routes, encouraging replayability and ensuring that players are always on their toes. Additionally, the Versus mode, where players can take on the roles of both survivors and the infected, adds an extra layer of excitement and strategic depth.

Left 4 Dead's lasting appeal lies in its replay value and the seamless integration of cooperative gameplay with intense zombie action. Its legacy continues to endure, showcasing the sheer thrill and excitement of surviving against the odds in a post-apocalyptic world.",1703018360,1703018360,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

[i] [Scene opens in a dimly lit room with eerie green lighting. The camera focuses on a Special Infected, a Boomer, sitting behind a desk, dressed in a tattered suit. The Boomer stares blankly at the camera.]

Interviewer (off-screen): So, Mr. Boomer, can you tell us your thoughts on Left 4 Dead?

Boomer: [slightly gurgling] Well, Left 4 Dead is quite the masterpiece, you know. It really brings out the best in all of us, Special Infected.

Interviewer: How so?

Boomer: [leans forward, trying to look serious] You see, in this game, we get to showcase our unique talents. For instance, I get to vomit on survivors, covering them in bile. It's like a Picasso painting, but with bodily fluids.

Interviewer: That's one way to put it. What about the other Special Infected?

Boomer: Oh, the Smoker? He's like the world's worst magician. He just sits in the shadows, waiting to ""wow"" the survivors with his tongue trick. And when he finally gets his chance, it's like, ""Ta-da! You're choking now!"" Classic.

Interviewer: And the Hunter?

Boomer: [chuckles] The Hunter, well, he's the life of the party. He leaps across rooftops, pounces on survivors, and does a little dance on their faces. It's a real thriller.

Interviewer: Any favorite memories from the game?

Boomer: [nostalgically] Oh, there was this one time when we all teamed up, the Boomer, the Smoker, the Hunter, the Witch... We formed a boy band. We called ourselves ""Infectious Harmony."" We even recorded a single. But, sadly, it never made it to the charts.

Interviewer: That sounds... interesting. What's your take on the survivors?

Boomer: [smirking] Ah, those survivors. They're like the tourists of the zombie apocalypse. Always stumbling around, making noise, and shooting everything that moves. They never appreciate our efforts to bring a little chaos into their lives.

Interviewer: Any final thoughts on Left 4 Dead?

Boomer: [pauses, pondering] Well, if you're looking for a game that lets you explore the art of surprise and teamwork, Left 4 Dead is your ticket. And remember, as Special Infected, we're just misunderstood artists trying to brighten up the apocalypse.

[The camera fades out as the Boomer lets out a guttural laugh, leaving us with a strange mix of amusement and unease, much like the game itself.] [/i]

[b] INT. SAFE ROOM - NIGHT

BILL, LOUIS, FRANCIS, and ZOEY gear up for a mission.

BILL: Alright, team, let's keep it together this time. No friendly fire, got it?

LOUIS: Yeah, yeah, got it. Just don't shoot me in the back, Bill.

FRANCIS: (examining shotgun) If only this shotgun had a ""noob filter.""

EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

The Survivors navigate through the deserted city streets. Suddenly, a TANK appears.

BILL: (laughs) Hey, look at that big guy. He's kinda sus, isn't he?

FRANCIS: (snickering) Yeah, real sussy baka energy.

LOUIS: (pointing) Look, he's got that imposter walk. Totally sus! 🕵️‍♂️

TANK: (roaring) RAAAWR!

BILL: (mocking) Oh, you mad, bro? Must've been voted out.

A BOOMER stumbles toward them.

LOUIS: (pointing) Okay, boomer! 💥

FRANCIS: (high-fiving Louis) Nice one, buddy.

A WITCH sits in a corner, crying.

ZOEY: Look at her, crying in the corner. What a drama queen. 😢

LOUIS: (sarcastic) ""Boo-hoo, I'm a witch, and everyone hates me.""

A SMOKER lurks in the shadows.

BILL: (points at the Smoker) Hey, you! Quit smoking, it's bad for your health. 🚭

SMOKER: (gurgling)

LOUIS: Seriously, take up vaping or something. It's 2023, man.

A HUNTER leaps from a rooftop.

HUNTER: (growling)

FRANCIS: (to Hunter) Dude, stop being so edgy and broody. It's a zombie apocalypse, not an emo concert.

HUNTER: (sulking)

EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

The Survivors continue their banter as they fight off the infected.

LOUIS: (shooting zombies) Hey, Tank, did you vote for yourself?

BILL: (laughing) He's not the imposter; he's the Tankster.

FRANCIS: (grinning) Tank, you're the most sus monster in this game. You're like the impostor's big brother. 👾

ZOEY: (rolling eyes) This is worse than a high school cafeteria.

The Survivors successfully reach the safe room, still bantering.

BILL: (closing safe room door) Survived another day, team. Good job.

FRANCIS: (smirking) And remember, kids, if you see a Tank, make sure to call it sussy baka. 😆

LOUIS: (laughing) Next time, we'll teach the Smoker to quit smoking by force.

ZOEY: (sarcastically) Great life lessons, guys. Truly inspiring.

One of my favourite recollections was of a charming individual who turned rogue, incapacitated myself and fellow team-mates in the saferoom, set us all on fire with a molotov cocktail and proceeded to confess their love of midget porn to us all while admitting to never having lifted a finger at work for 20 years due to some form of combustion which would occur in their pants while they were at work. After having professed their Love for us all as we were now considered ""Family"", I mused if some people had that perspective on how to treat others, how much could be explained on the current state of the world at present. I thoroughly recommend getting this delightful game and experiencing the online options for yourself.

Left 4 Dead surely belongs to that list aswell. Some of the most fun I had while gaming was with this game, only to be exceeded by Left 4 Dead 2 a year later. 
The late 2000's were also a pretty good time in my life so nostalgia has a big impact. Also, there weren't as many co-op games like L4D in which you play with 3 others and try to survive. 

It is clear to see how special L4D is if you compare it to Back4Blood, which came out 13 years later. Aside from maybe the graphics, L4D is the better game. The maps, the atmosphere, even the A.I. and physics are better in L4D.

Back4Blood may have tons of guns and ways to keep playing the game, L4D did not need any of that. Will you spend more time playing Back4Blood?

[h1] [b] [i] ★★★★★★★☆☆ [/i] [/b] [/h1]

The first Left 4 Dead, while arguably not as famous as its sequel, deserves its rightful place in gaming hall of fame for the immense impact on the field of co-op shooters it had. While not the biggest or most expansive game in the genre, its qualities are still apparent a decade and a half after its original release, as evidenced by its dedicated player-base that continuously come back to it and one which often beats its contemporary copy-cats such as Back 4 Blood. That is a true testament to the kind of behemoth Valve created.

[h1] [i] “These things are like a brush fire: they don't discriminate. They just burn up every damn thing in their way.

I'll tell you what: if the meek inherit the earth after this, they'd better get a whole hell of a lot better at killin'.” [/i] [/h1]

Left 4 Dead is not a complex game. It’s one of those titles that doesn’t offer a whole lot of content but the content it does offer is delivered flawlessly. Thanks to their new technology, the AI director, the developers were also able to make this content endlessly enjoyable by making each playthrough randomized and adapted to your individual play-style by altering frequency and aggressiveness of the zombies. This, along with its endless modding potential is what makes Left 4 Dead as beloved as it is.

Additionally, the gameplay, animations and graphics still hold up surprisingly well after all these years. The Source engine simply never disappoints, and it both creates visually impressive environments that are a joy to look at and also allows for an amazing atmosphere and lighting that perfectly undertone the different scenarios you can find yourself in while going through different maps. The gameplay is incredibly smooth, responsive and satisfying, somehow always managing to feel fresh and unique to compensate for the smaller amount of weapons you can use. 

In short, if you are reading this, you are most likely familiar with this legendary franchise and if not – if you ever played anything from Valve, you’ll most likely enjoy this as its on the same level of quality as the studio’s other games from this era. Even if you, like me, only played the more improved and impressive sequel, you can still find value in re-visiting this classic as it stands really well on its own.

500,152459722,76561198252229240,0,1,5632,0,5560,1706336392,"This is a really enjoyable and replayable zombie game. There are only four main campaigns plus two more added through updates for a total of six, but the game mechanics are so solid and every aspect of the game works in-tandem to provide a simultaneously unique and complex situation each time you replay a campaign--zombie arrangement, pickup locations, weapon locations, which weapons are available, which special infected are in play, where the tank will spawn, how the players you're cooperating with will behave, etc.

          I find myself always coming back to this game (as well as the second) to play the campaigns again, and my hours on record really exemplify how well-done procedural generation is done in Left 4 Dead. If you're only going to buy one of the games, however, I would highly advise against purchasing this one and instead recommend buying Left 4 Dead 2, as nearly all the content this game has is contained in that title as well (all campaigns and characters). The only unique aspects this version has going for it over the sequel now are presentation and certain game mechanics--for example, there are no melee weapons, none of the newer special infected like spitters and jockeys, and guns work slightly differently such as the auto shotgun which will reload quickly if you initiate a reload before running out of ammo but will refill moderately slower should you let it fully empty (I don't know how that works in terms of logic, but it [i]is[/i] an interesting mechanic absent in the sequel).

          Left 4 Dead gets a lot of mileage out of simple mechanics, and I will outline a few which stand out to me in this final section of my review. The horde is likely to be overwhelming to both new and experienced players alike, as the commons can just surround you in sheer numbers where despite your best efforts with a shotgun, you can't free yourself from them. You'll quickly learn that separating from your team will be your death knell, so the teamwork required by everyone is very interesting both to watch and participate in, especially in the higher difficulties (in Expert, the highest difficulty, you can teamkill with just a few point-blank shotgun shells--yes, there are occasional griefers). The finales can be really tense and frantic, as not only are they the end points of the various campaigns, but also death is most punishing here, where survival can be the difference between receiving credit for the campaign or not. All of the weapons have a purpose and feel satisfying to use to an extent (your mileage may vary based on personal preference). Even for throwables, one has the choice between a molotov and a pipe bomb--molotovs excel at crowd control in a corridor or direction (zombies burn perpetually until death), whereas pipe bombs are a great getaway to divert attention away from a struggling team, attracting all horde to its location momentarily and then exploding all infected in its range.
           Among the negative feelings I have toward the game, I will say that griefers are not common, but also not very uncommon in the higher difficulties. Playing in normal, the team damage inflicted on others is very minimal, so one will mostly find these people in Expert (though there are ways to intentionally kill teammates in other difficulties like with molotovs). Some people can be unhelpful to new players, but there are also people who can be extremely helpful, even in other modes such as Survival in my experience--oh yes, I've forgot to mention there's an entirely separate survival mode with 16 maps to reach gold on. There's also a Versus mode. I don't play the Versus mode, so I've forgotten its existence for most of me writing this, but since it's PvP, as you might imagine, it would tend to be the most competitive mode with unpleasantly competitive people. Unfortunately, if you want all the achievements, you will have to play this mode a fair amount.

          This review is somewhat incoherent and disorganized, so I really appreciate if you've read this far at all. Left 4 Dead is yet another tightly-designed Valve game with replayability in mind, and to prospective buyers, the only game I can recommend over it is its sequel Left 4 Dead 2, which I believe is a testament to its timeless quality.",1701193947,1701194161,True,1,0,0.518750011920928955,0,True,False,False

[b] The Zombie Title That Defined A Generation [/b]

Instantly reviving the coop shooter, [b] Left 4 Dead [/b] was yet another groundbreaking achievement for Valve. Released during an age where cooperative gameplay was becoming a relic of the past, this action-packed zombie extravaganza almost single handedly revived public interest and developer support for coop experiences. With tight gunplay and great sound design, lots of replayability due to a unique due to the creation of ""The Director"", and well designed maps which were able to be enjoyed in a multitude of modes, Left 4 Dead provided a framework for one of the best coop games ever created. 

The gunplay and sound design of this game is amazing. The guns all feel like they pack a punch, and the different hordes and special zombies provide great atmosphere and sound ques to let the player know what terror is arriving next. Certain melodies may indicate that a Hunter is prowling around the area, whereas other may alert the player that a Smoker is ready to grapple a teammate to their deaths. All of this culminates in adding to the atmosphere of the game, creating a nice horror theme in the world.

""The Director"" is where the game shines apart from other shooters of its time, and even many others from today's slew of coop experiences. This system allowed the AI to place swarms of enemies at any given location that was out of sight for the players, and placed special zombies in locations that could do some damage or even kill players. It avoids feeling cheap by giving enough space for enemy spawns (for the most part), and diversifying the limited number of special zombies by spawning them in many different scenarios. This led to the game flowing nicely and creating a system that encourages teamwork, cooperation, and sticking together.

Lastly, I'll focus on the map design. There are six available campaigns, each with 2-5 acts within their runtime. From grimy city streets and sewers, to run down farms and factories, it almost feels like there isn't a classic zombie scenario you ""don't"" find yourself experiencing. My personal favorite was ""Dead Air"", which takes place within a destroyed airport. Additionally, with the campaign, versus, and survival modes, you can play through every map with friends, against enemy players taking control of zombies, or survive as long as possible against hordes of zombies. While the servers for this title are unpopulated at times, it is still a blast to play through solo or with friends.

To conclude, [b] Left 4 Dead [/b] is an important title in gaming history. It brought back mainstream appeal in cooperative experiences, with many titles in the late 2000's shifting to PvP multiplayer modes. This title provided a breath of fresh air within an industry that continued to settle for a lack of innovation in cooperation. While it only says I have played 6 hours at the time of this review, I have spent over 100 hours on the Xbox 360 during its original release. I [b] Recommend [/b] anyone to pick up this title!

İç Harcı İçin:


2 adet kuru soğan

250 gram kıyma

1 tatlı kaşığı biber salçası

Yarım su bardağı çekilmiş ceviz içi

1 tutam maydanoz

Kimyon

Karabiber


Hamuru İçin:


2 su bardağı ince bulgur

1 su bardağı sıcak su

1 yemek kaşığı sıvı yağ

1 adet yumurta

Tuz


Yapılışı


İç harcı için soğanları ince ince doğrayın ve sıvı yağda kavurun.

Kavrulan soğanlara kıymayı ekleyin ve suyunu çekene kadar kavurmaya devam edin.

Kavrulan kıymaya biber salçasını, cevizi, maydanozu, kimyonu ve karabiberi ekleyin ve karıştırın.

Hamuru için bulgur, sıcak su, sıvı yağ, yumurta ve tuzu bir kaba alın ve iyice yoğurun.

Hamuru bezelere ayırın.

Her bir bezeyi elinizle açın ve içine iç harcından koyun.

Köfteleri yuvarlayarak şekillendirin.

Köfteleri kızgın yağda kızartın.

Kızaran köfteleri servis tabağına alın ve sıcak olarak servis edin.


Püf Noktaları


İç harcını hazırlarken soğanları iyice kavurmanız önemlidir. Böylece harç daha lezzetli olacaktır.

Hamuru hazırlarken bulgurun suyunu iyice çekmesini bekleyin. Aksi takdirde hamurunuz sert olacaktır.

Köfteleri şekillendirirken çok sıkı sıkmayın. Aksi takdirde köfteler kızartırken çatlayabilir.

500,150734682,76561199007511278,73,9,338,0,338,1680867323,"While I wouldn't call myself a Left 4 Dead fan, I am very passionate about this game and the sequel, even to the point where I've played all of Back 4 Blood for some reason. In general, Left 4 Dead 2 is one of my favourite video games of all time, would be my favourite zombie (or infected, whatever) game if it weren't for plants vs zombies garden warfare, yes I am being serious. I love almost everything about this duology, from the gunplay to the artwork to the story to the mods to even the menu design, it is all impressive. Not my favourite duology because of reasons mentioned two sentences ago, but still very much up there. Here's the thing however, one thing I have intentionally excluded from the list is the characters, which are famously what makes L4D so good in so many of the playerbase's eyes. And I agree, most of the characters are reasonable, emotionally deep and realistic characters meaning you can sympathise with them, understand their struggles and make yourself feel like you truly are fighting alongside them in a chaotic post-apocalyptic world. But notice how I said ""most"". Now I don't have a unique or witty way of saying this so I'm just going to do what every other over-dramatic person in this situation would do, that being to say it as it is but with caps lock on so that I can emphasise my point: ZOEY IS ONE OF THE WORST VIDEO GAME CHARACTERS EVER CONCEIVED BY MANKIND AND I WISH SHE WAS THE ONE THAT DIED INSTEAD OF- whoops almost just spoiled the end of a 15 year old  game everyone has definitely already played by now there, remind me not to do that again when I do another negative review. Anyway here's why.

I don't know if saying that Zoey is a badly written character is an unpopular opinion or whatever, but I do wanna say no offence to the writers or voice actor playing Zoey in the slightest, the writers did an incredible job in other places and the voice actor did a great job in general. Zoey just feels like a side character in an 80's text-based adventure game, so whether the writers were being overworked with 2 hours of sleep when making her or she was made by a 12 year old on a ""bring your son/daughter to work day"", I wouldn't be surprised either way. But what makes Zoey such a bad character? Well I promise I will actually answer that question this time in the next paragraph.

I want you to consider the other characters in Left 4 Dead 1 to start. You've got Louis, a successful business man with no combat experience in the slightest, and who probably has a pill fetish if the L4D community is a reliable source. There's Francis, a biker dude not used to working in a team with strangers, but is still willing to lend a hand to the group of survivors he has found himself in. And then there's Bill, a war veteran who clearly has a lot of experience with combat and gunplay, but zombies is a whole other story for him. Now try and describe Zoey's character. This is problem #1, Zoey is a boring character with nothing unique or distinct about her. She's just some random person who ended up in the zombie apocalypse alongside three other far more interesting characters. Now I get it, complaining that she has little backstory and saying that that alone is the reason why she is a bad character is a harsh thing to say, which is why I would also like to bring up the fact that she has basically no character development at all, both in changes to her as a person as well as traits she adopts throughout. Now admittedly, this is a part of Left 4 Dead 1's story that was lacking a bit, there is barely any character development in general, but in this case, you'd think they'd go all in on Zoey having the character development, but in the end even Francis ends up having more than her. Zoey is more one-dimensional than a Back 4 Blood character. In fact, look at Left 4 Dead 2: pretty much every character is unique and changes their attitudes to the zombies, each other and the impact of the apocalypse on their futures, something Zoey seems to be physically incapable of doing. Now I'm going to change the subject out of fear of repeating myself again.

Whether Zoey also looking like a really boring character as well as playing like one was intentional or not I don't know because I'm not a secret agent at valve trying to see whether people would care about Zoey dying in Left 4 Dead 3 coming out in around 20 years time. I know it sounds bizarre, but hear me out. Just by looking at the characters you can see how equipped or unequipped each character is for the zombie apocalypse, from the one in a business suit to another in full army uniform. Zoey is wearing a bland red jacket and jeans. Again, I get it, maybe her looking like a regular person was intentional to show just how unpredictable the outbreak was and how any one of us could be in such a situation any day now. Still though, what are we supposed to make of that? That she likes wearing that particular kind of outfit? The plain features don't say much in terms of her non-existent personality or her interests of literally nothing, unless it's meant to represent youth? In which case, ok, but why make that her entire character? Anyway, you're probably wondering why I mentioned earlier about her playing like a  boring character given how the character difference is completely cosmetic and each character plays the same. Well no offence to the voice actor once again, but the actual lines given for Zoey really don't help with character building or establishing her as a human being capable of doing human being things. Also I don't know if anybody else experiences this, but why does the Zoey AI absolutely hate me? No joke, when I play singleplayer, Zoey always shoots the witch whenever possible, shoots gas canisters when teammates are nearby, uses the only medkit on herself when she has the most health of the entire team (usually in the green too) and completely refuses to revive teammates, even when all the infected are dead. As if hating Zoey couldn't get any easier.

I think one of the reasons I hate Zoey so much is just seeing how well the characters in Left 4 Dead 2 were done. L4D2 probably has my favourite cast of multiple main characters of any video game due to just how contrasting they are in addition to how well they go together. watching as Roachelle basically becomes like a mother to the entire group despite clearly having no experience with that kind of thing before, or seeing how Nick goes from being a snide asshole to everyone to really letting his light shine through in their darkest moments is really heartwarming, even in a grim zombie-ridden world. Coach and Ellis' humour despite their worst fears coming to fruition is also charming, making these characters not only easy for each other to love, but for the player to love too. It's a shame that Zoey never got this treatment, sure there was not much potential when you really summarise her character, but considering how much less inspiration there might have been for other valve characters, I know they could have done so much better.

I understand some people might defend Zoey or whatever, well good for you, more power to you in fact. I just wanted to complain about how terrible of a video game character Zoey is in my opinion, and not even for valve's standards, I'm comparing her to characters from games like Far Cry 6 and Saints Row 2022. If you think Zoey is a good character, that's fine, just know I am going to disagree with you unless you actually give a reason or reasons as to why, because I am seriously struggling to think of a single one. I know valve won't see this because they despise listening to their community, especially on the topic of their games, but at least they lay the foundations for wonderful communities to sprout in their wake. If only I could bring myself to give this beautiful game a positive review, unfortunately Zoey exists. So yeah, TL;DR: Zoey sucks.

Game is old, but immense fun with friends.

One of the only games I know where someone can be absolute garbage at videogames and still contribute.

My sisters' first real videogame.

Zombies were meta in 2007-2009, you can't go wrong if you wan't to revisit the past generations' form of zombie survival. Great plots, good storylines.

Seriously. Let me re-iterate LEGENDARY CLASSIC. If you don't play this game ever, here's a knife. Slit your wrists vertical for results, you mundane pleb.

UPDATE- I've played an additional 250 hours on Steam, let alone the probable 2000+ hours I have from 2008-2013 on Xbox 360. Actually re-installing the game after it spent some years uninstalled at home *but I had it installed at my job/at work to play it there. This game is such a legendary classic, in a world where the 50-year-olds balance work over Solitaire, I can balance it over Left 4 Dead 1. Guys, I wrote this review *years* ago and still nothing has changed. It is still perhaps one of the best games ever. 

To put it into perspective, I feel like these days with Escape From Tarkov, Halo: Infinite, Jedi: Survivor, Fallout 4, battle royale games like Fortnite and PUBG, that their scope and size is becoming too large and depressing. This videogame is the apex of what a videogame was always ever supposed to be: intense enough to make you feel the heat of fast pace, dark and damp enough to make you really remember the dystopia, and just the right size so if you want to become a master at it, you can do so while balancing a full-time job. The direct *right* temperature of porridge, this game. Not too cold where you feel lonely like in free-roam open-world games. Not too hot where you can't compete if you lose focus and end up hating yourself like Escape From Tarkov or RTS games. Where videogames were supposed to draw a line where you got a nice 60$ videogame, were promised 3-4 additions, and required no homework to play.

I personally prefer Romero style zombies so i chose to keep away from Left 4 Dead. Only recently out of curiosity i decided to give the game another try and i must say even though I prefer classic Romero style zombies I can understand why they chose to go with running zombies from 28 days later. Its fantastic pace for the gameplay the left 4 dead series is going for. 
What struck a cord with me this time though was the atmosphere. Its superb and the maps are really well paced. I like it. Even in single player, this game is fun and perhaps at its creepiest. 

Wish they made more games like this instead of Woke Jargon that the industry is spewing out in recent years. Fire those damn idiots and bring back people who care about art and creativity. No one cares about your political views, there is a place and time for that. And video games, movies, books etc are for art and entertainment, you failed politicians don't belong here. Go fire yourself into oblivion.

I mean at this point Woke can be categorised as the 4th Abrahamic Religion. It has all the trappings of organized religion that looks upon the rest of us as WEAKLINGS, AKA THE OTHERS and wants to convert us to their propaganda by whatever means necessary.

There is no point in playing the first game since L4D2 has all of the first games campaigns in addition to the new campaigns. In addition the second game also has more firearms to choose from, more special zombies, melee weapons, more consumable items, and of course more levels to choose from. So, if you want to play L4D I think there is no question which game you should choose. 

On the first installment tho, we played it for nostalgia reasons. The game has so much soul, so much action, so many iconic moments and so many intense moments through the campaign to keep you entertained. Our play through lasted about 9 hours, which is just as long as many games from that time. You also get a versus mode, where a team of survivors plays against a team of special infected, cool stuff.

As I said, the game is filled with soul. The amazing cast of 4 characters really gives the game life, you tend to care for them by the end. There is a reason why they are loved by the community and why the cast from L4D2 doesn't come close in my opinion. Game wise, the first installment has aged. The visuals still hold up, the atmosphere is amazing, the mechanics are simple but fun. 

Some of the cons we encountered were slow response times from the game, the hits land a bit later then expected so you end up hitting your friend when you didn't really want, the hitboxes of zombies can be weird at times, meaning you shoot the fucker straight in the head and the rounds just go through with no effect, but this is a rare occurrence. The hunter seems to glitch out and jumps at on of you only to end up on the player next to his perceived target. The player models get stuck on geometry, but this is also rare. Some indoor areas and rooms are very barren and bland, with only walls and some piping, and I think the game is a little hurt for it. Walking from a atmospheric outside to an very basic room with almost nothing but walls can be a bit immersion breaking. And a final con I will mention is that the game play can get a bit boring if you retry the same section of a level too many times. Honestly I love this game, but I do recognize that the simple mechanics can only carry it so far. Add that with the difficulty of some sections and you are in headache town for the duration of a couple of those sections. This is all regarding the campaign, I won't comment on the versus mode. 

The praise of the game is the fun cast of characters, very good level design, top notch atmosphere and sound design, mechanics that allow the special infected to really shaft your team hard if your not careful, and just the co-op game play that really shows you that you will need to work together if you want to survive. Just losing one teammate handicaps you highly, so the care of one another. I did write a lot more regarding the cons, but that's just because I want you to experience the so much good this game offers on your own. So I won't sing its praises anymore then that.

Overall, a very strong recommendation for everyone who like co-op games. I'm sure you'll love it, for this game really is one of the greats.",1698654631,1698654631,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I personally closely followed Left 4 Dead 1 before its release on the Steam Forums and the 'Left 4 Dead 411' site, played the unofficial 'Left 4 Dead' mod on Counter-Strike Source, talked about it a lot with friends on Steam and elsewhere, pre-ordered the game, and played it frequently after its release, up until the release of Left 4 Dead 2.


Development started on Left 4 Dead 1 in mid-2005, the game was officially announced by Turtle Rock Studios and Valve on November 20, 2006, and it was later released on November 18, 2008, on Windows and Xbox 360.

Left 4 Dead 1 was originally developed by indie game developer Turtle Rock Studios as a cooperative, Player-Versus-Enemy (PVE), Survival Horror, horde-based First-Person-Shooter (FPS) modification for Counter-Strike Source, with a focus on extreme replayability via semi-random procedurally enemy/boss-populated levels and item/weapon placements. After this demonstration version showed a lot of fun gameplay potential, they then decided to make it into a fully-fledged Source Engine game, with the help of Valve, who trusted Turtle Rock for its earlier work on Counter-Strike: Condition Zero.

Whilst the two studios worked on Left 4 Dead 1 together, Turtle Rock Studios would eventually be purchased by and merge with Valve on January 10, 2008, becoming 'Valve South' (which they remained until they left Valve under mutual agreement in June 2009, due to a variety of workflow and communication issues).

A sequel, Left 4 Dead 2, was announced on June 1, 2009, and released on November 17, 2009 (just under 1 year after the launch of Left 4 Dead 1).


A big part of what made Left 4 Dead 1 so special was its AI. Common Infected and Boss Infected are capable of rapidly and dynamically calculating the optimal route to their target, and can intelligently climb over obstacles, props, etc within reach in order to take shortcuts and reach the Survivors wherever they hide. Hordes/Mobs of Common Infected will also try to fan out and 'flock' like Boids, in order to create a more realistic and visually impressive presentation. The Special Infected navigate the level more like the Survivors, jumping over obstacles and climbing up special 'Infected Ladders' pre-placed into levels, in order to give them full access to the rooftops and heights (Common- and Boss-Infected can also use these ladders). Which all comes together and adds a tremendous amount of flare and intensity to the game.

Another big part of the game was its old analog VHS movie-esque visual aesthetics, lighting, shaders, film grain, movie poster loading screens, and gritty post-processing effects.

And yet another big part of the game was its innovative music and sound design, which includes instrumental leitmotifs/stingers to telegraph the spawning in of a Special Infected (each have their own unique stinger), the spawning of an impending horde/Mob, the capture or death of a Survivor, etc. And the Boss Infected each have their own dedicated musical themes that play when a Survivor is in their presence, rather than stingers.

The rest of the game's brilliance comes from its 'AI Director'. Much of Left 4 Dead 1's procedural generation magic is controlled by a suite of relatively simple AI systems collectively known as the 'AI Director', which consider metrics like map length/'flow', rate of progress/'flow', and each Survivor's health/item/ammo 'score'; which it tries to consider as an average, and then tries to actively balance around by converting items ahead into more or less useful variants, or by removing them altogether.

There's also flat percentage-based RNG that determine whether chance-based pre-placed items/weapons/ammo will appear in a given session (the odds of which are pre-determined by the level designer on a per-item basis), some of which the AI Director can presumably then alter/remove based on the average Survivor scores.

Other core gameplay elements such as Special Infected and Common Infected hordes/'Mobs' are determined by simple timers. Special- and Boss-Infected spawn numbers per timer/Chapter are simple presets determined by the Gamemode (IE 3 Special Infected min/max spawns and max 1 Tank + 2-3 Witches per Chapter on Campaign, 4 Special Infected min/max spawns and max 1 Tank + 1 Witch per Chapter on Versus, 5-7 min/max Special Infected spawns and max alive 2 Tanks on Survival, etc). Every Chapter of a Campaign has a set chance for a Tank or Witch(es) to appear, with these chances being lower on the first Chapter and the finale Chapter.

The game additionally uses a huge, dizzying number of customizable 'sv_' and cvar files to streamline the experience (like specifying the max alive idle Common Infected, disallowing idle Common Infected to spawn within a certain range of Boss Infected, and everything else in the game; from the health and speed of Tanks, to the capabilities and actions of the AI Common Infected, Special Infected, Boss Infected, Survivor Bots, etc, to the damage of weapons, and more.

There's also an internal lingo around the game design of Left 4 Dead 1/2 within Valve and Turtle Rock, referred to as the 'Left 4 Dead Dictionary'. The Left 4 Dead Dictionary is used to reference complex game design elements, game mechanics, internal game variables/settings, etc. And it served as a way to effectively streamline employees' thought processes and coordination as they were actively developing the game.


There's not many negative things to say about Left 4 Dead 1. The biggest gripe most people have with the game is that since the announcement and release of Left 4 Dead 2, there haven't been many content or balance updates. Infinite bashing is still OP.

Both Left 4 Dead 1 & 2 have major issues related to griefers and even hackers, who to this very day will join games on Expert for the sole purpose of friendly firing everyone to death, suiciding, and then leaving, suiciding their character and then leaving when they can't FF people, joining and starting false votes such as attempts to restart the campaign, change level, kick people, kick the host of a local server (thus ending the session), etc. Some hackers in the present even have plugins that enable them to start votes and have them automatically succeed. This issue is so prevalent that it's almost impossible to go through a full public game on Expert without encountering at least one griefer (often you'll get multiple per campaign), thus forcing you to either play with friends in private lobbies with bots, or local host with a full suite of anti-griefing and administration mods to counter and auto-ban the onslaught of griefers.

Both Left 4 Dead 1 & 2 also have issues related to rushers, who essentially try to outrun the AI Director's ability to dynamically populate the world with Common Infected, as well as exploiting the fact that Special Infected spawn based on timers. Rushing can be extremely effective, to the point of trivializing the game even on Expert difficulty, although it can also backfire spectacularly.


As aforementioned, Left 4 Dead 1 is the game that pretty much every other game released in the genre since has attempted (and often failed) to imitate/clone. This even includes the original developer Turtle Rock Studios itself, which has since released two major (largely) failed games in the same/similar genre, those being 'Evolve' and 'Back 4 Blood'. This highlights that Left 4 Dead 1's breakout success was far more than random chance, and that both Studios' ideas and involvement were crucial in that huge success.


All this said, since Left 4 Dead 1 hasn't received many balance or content updates since the announcement and release of Left 4 Dead 2, it's widely considered inferior to its successor at this point.

Play as one of the Survivors, either with other players or with bots, and fight your way across the levels to escape the zombie hordes.  The ""AI Director"" dynamically controls the pacing of the game and which zombies you will encounter.

The ""common"" infected come at you in hordes, which can be overwhelming, while the ""boss"" infected are of different types with special abilities to cause you all sorts of trouble!

Left 4 Dead is like revisiting cherished gaming memories. If you've played it before, it's a sweet reunion with an old favorite.

The heart of Left 4 Dead is still the same, a co-op zombie-killing thrill that takes you down memory lane. The surprises and intensity feel like you're reliving those classic gaming moments.

The characters and their unique traits bring back the camaraderie of playing with friends. Teamwork remains the key to success, and it's just as satisfying as you remember. The classic weapons hit all the right nostalgia buttons.

While the graphics may show their age, it's a reminder of simpler gaming times. For solo players, it can be a bit lonely, harking back to those days when gaming was all about friends.

In a nutshell, Left 4 Dead is like reconnecting with your gaming past. It's a walk down memory lane, where you relive the thrills and camaraderie of gaming nights gone by... RIP",1696041207,1697759909,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you haven't played this gem, you're missing out on more fun than a barrel of undead monkeys.

First, let's talk about the characters. You've got Bill, a grizzled war veteran who's been through more apocalypses than you've had hot meals. There's Francis, the guy who hates everything, including zombies. Louis is the team's everyman, which basically means he's the guy who's really good at getting pummeled by the horde. And finally, Zoey. They're like the misfit Avengers of the zombie world.

But the real star of the show is the AI Director. This sneaky overlord controls everything, from the placement of health packs to the timing of the next wave of zombies. It's like having a virtual Dungeon Master who enjoys messing with your head as much as your life expectancy.

The gameplay is as fast-paced as a caffeine-charged cheetah on roller skates. You'll mow down zombies with an assortment of weapons that range from your run-of-the-mill shotguns to rifles that seem more fit for an alien invasion than a zombie apocalypse. Oh, and don't forget the Molotov cocktails – the gift that keeps on burning.

Now, teamwork is key here. If you wander off by yourself, you might as well start auditioning for a zombie reality show. The fun really starts when you're frantically screaming at your friends (or AI teammates) to help you up while being smothered by a Hunter or pounced on by a Smoker. Nothing says ""I love you"" like saving your buddy from a zombie's clutches.

And speaking of zombies, they come in all shapes and sizes. The regular ones are like slow-motion zombies from a '90s horror flick, but then you've got special infected like the Boomer (who explodes in a shower of bile), the Tank (basically the Hulk with anger issues), and the Witch (a nap-loving zombie who turns into a chainsaw when you wake her up). It's a party, and everyone's invited!

Now, the game's levels are like a maze from your nightmares. You'll spend half your time lost, the other half trying to figure out how to save your friends, and all of it drenched in chaos and zombie mayhem. If you ever wondered what it's like to be stuck in a never-ending zombie parade, this is it.

In conclusion, Left 4 Dead is the gaming equivalent of a zombie-themed carnival ride – fast, funny, and freakin' fantastic. Just remember, when the world goes to heck in a handbasket, grab your buddies, some big guns, and let the zombie-killing hilarity ensue.",1697546330,1697546330,True,7,1,0.524926662445068359,0,True,False,False

Let me start by saying that Left 4 Dead 1 and 2 are like fine wines - they only get better with age. If you're looking for an adrenaline-packed, zombie-killing extravaganza, look no further. These games are pure, unadulterated fun with a side of 'OMG, did you see what just happened?'

Picture this: You and your buddies are dropped into a post-apocalyptic zombie world, and all you've got are your wits, a few guns, and your trademark witty banter. The goal? Make it from point A to point B without getting eaten by the undead or accidentally shooting each other in the face. Easy, right?

Well, not exactly. See, Left 4 Dead is like the ultimate test of friendship. It's all fun and games until your best friend ""accidentally"" tosses a Molotov at your feet. But hey, that's what makes it hilarious! You'll create unforgettable memories together, whether it's surviving the chaos or blaming each other for team kills.

The AI Director in these games is like your sadistic puppet master, orchestrating the perfect storm of zombie hordes, special infected, and panic-inducing moments. Just when you think you're safe, the Director goes, ""Hold my beer,"" and throws a tank your way.

Now, the graphics may not be cutting-edge by today's standards, but it's the gameplay that truly shines. Whether you're escaping a sewer in No Mercy or blasting zombies in The Parish, each level feels unique and terrifyingly thrilling.

And don't even get me started on the community mods and custom campaigns – they're like the gift that keeps on giving. Want to survive the apocalypse with the Teletubbies or shoot zombies in a reimagined version of Silent Hill? You got it.

In the end, Left 4 Dead 1 and 2 aren't just games; they're a friendship forged in the fires of zombie hell. So, grab your pals, grab your guns, and embark on an epic journey of survival, laughter, and ""Wait, did you see that witch?!"" moments. These games are a must-play for anyone who enjoys a good laugh and a zombie-slaying good time. Grab them now, and let the zombie mayhem commence!

I had a fascination with horror but didn't really have the courage to play the games myself alone.
My friends older brother and his friend installed the game and started it. Me and my two friends were watching (everything was in the living room without lights) and man the Intro really stuck with me. Also the whole intro isn't just a promo or something. The game starts off where the intro ends. After that we went outside to play with friends (late hours and we were in 6th grade in our coutry, going outside at about 9PM to play hide and seek lmao) and it really did scare the living crap out of us at the time, reminded of constant witch bs while hiding or searching in the dark. Later we returned to continue watching the older brother and his friend still playing the game, but in the forest this time.

So the game stuck with me since then and I still consider it great even after all this time. With fiends it is a whole different experience and much more chaotic. But with mods? Then it is insane lmao",1696809968,1696809968,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

[h2]Rating: ★★★★☆[/h2]

Playing Left 4 Dead is like joining a zombie-themed improv comedy troupe where your friends are the wacky cast, and the undead are the surprise guests who refuse to stick to the script. It's a hilarious mix of teamwork, panic-induced decisions, and the occasional witch-induced scream that'll make you laugh even when the zombies are closing in.

[h3]Pros:[/h3]

1. [b]Timeless Co-op Fun:[/b] Left 4 Dead's co-op gameplay is like a fine wine; it only gets better with time. The thrill of surviving a zombie onslaught with friends remains as fresh and enjoyable as ever.

2. [b]Dynamic AI Director:[/b] The AI Director is the real MVP, orchestrating the chaos with finesse. Every playthrough feels unique, ensuring you never know when the next zombie surprise party is about to start.

3. [b]Memorable Infected Variety:[/b] From the menacing Tank to the devious Smoker, the Infected are a memorable cast of characters. Each encounter is like a twisted dance where the goal is survival.

4. [b]Quick-Paced Action:[/b] The game's pacing is like a sprint through a zombie obstacle course. There's never a dull moment, and the action keeps you on your toes from start to finish.

5. [b]Versatile Weapon Selection:[/b] The arsenal of weapons is like a playground for zombie destruction. Whether you're swinging a frying pan or mowing down hordes with an automatic rifle, the choices add to the chaotic fun.

[h3]Cons:[/h3]

1. [b]Dated Graphics:[/b] As a 2008 release, the graphics show their age. However, the timeless gameplay compensates for any lack of visual polish.

2. [b]Limited Single-Player Experience:[/b] The single-player experience lacks the magic of cooperative play. While AI companions do their best, Left 4 Dead truly shines in multiplayer.

3. [b]Occasional AI Hiccups:[/b] AI teammates might exhibit moments of questionable decision-making, leading to unexpected and sometimes humorous outcomes.

4. [b]Repetitive Objectives:[/b] The core objective of progressing from point A to B can feel repetitive, but the dynamic nature of the game keeps it from becoming monotonous.

5. [b]Dependency on Player Activity:[/b] The game thrives on an active player base. In less populated lobbies, the energy of the zombie-filled circus may wane.

[h3]Conclusion:[/h3]

Left 4 Dead is a timeless masterpiece that brings laughter and screams in equal measure. Its co-op brilliance, dynamic AI, and cast of memorable characters cement it as a classic in the zombie survival genre.

[quote=][i]In the immortal words of a grizzled survivor, ""We got a tank!""

For me personally, I can only speak for the cooperative game mode, as I've never ventured into playing the competitive 'Versus' mode. So, what distinguishes this wonderful game from others in its genre?

For me, Left 4 Dead's brilliance shines most brightly in its cooperative gameplay. The necessity of teamwork to survive is not only encouraged; it's vital. This game epitomizes the joy of collaborating with either friends or newfound allies to conquer the challenges it presents. The ingenious AI Director is a key highlight in offering up different gameplay challenges. It ensures that each playthrough remains fresh and unpredictable. Whether it's enemy placement, item distribution, or the intensity of the infected hordes, it adapts to your team's performance, guaranteeing that no two playthroughs are identical.

One of the game's most compelling features is its limitless replayability, thanks to random events and procedurally generated content. Even after playing the same campaign multiple times, I've still encountered new challenges and surprises. The four playable characters, each with their unique and very likable personalities, add a layer of depth to the game. It's impossible not to form an attachment to them as you fight side-by-side, making their survival just as meaningful as yours.

This game takes players through many various different environments. Within this diversity, it ensures that the gameplay remains engaging enough to negate monotony. The game's pacing is impeccable, striking a balance between moments of quiet tension and heart-pounding action. And the sound design and music score are top-notch, immersing players with eerie infected cries and chilling background music, enhancing the overall tension.

In conclusion, Left 4 Dead retains its status as a masterpiece in the realm of cooperative multiplayer gaming, serving as the benchmark for thrilling survival horror experiences. Its innovative mechanics, exceptional AI, and enduring appeal make it a must-play for anyone seeking adrenaline-pumping thrills and unforgettable gaming moments. Playing it is consistently an absolute blast.

UPDATED: Furthermore, Valve's decision to support modding has further extended the game's longevity. The abundance of user-created content, ranging from new campaigns to custom skins and weapons, ensures there's always something fresh to explore. This, in turn, has nurtured a strong sense of community.

It's a shining example of how collaboration, strategy, and heart-pounding action can meld together into one unforgettable experience, at least from the viewpoint of a professional gamer.

The dynamic AI Director in the game is a brilliant idea because it makes sure that every playthrough feels different and difficult. It keeps you on your toes, adapts to the performance of your team, and unleashes waves of infected at precisely the right times to produce pulse-pounding excitement. Because of the way the game is designed, cooperation and communication between players are encouraged, creating a truly immersive cooperative experience.

The camaraderie that Left 4 Dead encourages among its players is what truly sets it apart. As you fight through hordes of infected, the bonds you develop with your team are irreplaceable. Few other games can match the tension, excitement, and camaraderie that the game's memorable characters and sense of shared survival foster.

The game has been given new life by the modding community, ensuring that there is always something new to discover. Even decades after its initial release, Left 4 Dead is still a favorite game for playing with friends.

Last but not least, Left 4 Dead is more than just a game—it's an experience. It's evidence of the effectiveness of cooperative gaming, which provides heart-pounding action and priceless moments. It's a classic game that is a must-play for both experienced players and newcomers.",1693679471,1693679471,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Also, there are some achivevements available only in this game, in case you care about that. Otherwise, now that these are the same price, (and especially with the Summer Sale going on) I would look to buy Left 4 Dead 2 (and read my review about it, if you're curious) if you want some zombie-killing action.

It impressed me a bit more than L4D2, especially since it is a real shooter, unlike the melee-shooters Left 4 Dead 2 and Back 4 Blood. The latter, however, still provides better balance, despite having overwhelming melee toy dominance. The game is mostly good, it is relatively simple as it has 6 weapons and 6 zombie types. Its difficulty system is unstable as a casual rookie player would seriously better start with ""Easy"", otherwise dying and even losing early on from a Witch or another madness is highly likely. Normal is better to come in further playthroughs. Advanced and expert are something you 'd better go for after 100+ hours of good experience, unless you are a masochist or a trollish newbie into the online games (and then you wouldn't be the first...eh). Survival maps have interesting constructions and stuff, but also remind us once again of the positioning and item carrying drawbacks of this game. I won't comment versus, since I don't play it as I don't care about it. The custom community maps here show random good ones and impressed me some more than l4d2's ones.
	
	The friendly AI has some good qualities such as following and helping you as much as they can and those 1-3x guys cannot deal direct friendly fire, but also has got numerous inadequacies and that's one of the game's silly ways to set up an artificially increased difficulty when playing in a solo, duo or trio. This is one of the early games that haven't realized friendly AI and therefore game can never be set fully adequately in such a 3x-obligatory-teammates system.

	Despite of the weaknesses here, the game provides a full playability even of the pre-last difficulty (called ""Advanced""), unlike Left 4 Dead 2. The situation with the real 4x base Campaigns is already unstable and goes further worse with the so-called ""DLCs"" (crash course & sacrifice), that don't quite feel like if made by the same developers. It is fun to shoot zombies and cooperate with teammates, but when it comes to things such as inadequate AI, one-shot tanks or gauss-railgun-action smokers it can simply get tedious for non-masochists like me. Fun thing is, a variety of solo-oriented games actually have far worse game balance, some examples being Alien Rage, Sanctum TD and probably even the semi-coop Sanctum 1. A great thing here is, the game doesn't need special external software to pull out some good playability - a player can just select a lower difficulty for his/her needs and that's all. Unfortunately, the thing that has been supposed to be a hardest dificulty in L4D1 looks more like some sort of a poorly playable 3d-super mario ripoff shooter hybrid and you might start to wonder where are the extra life pickups.

	I've been holding back till now to see if I'd be impressed some more by the vanilla game, but I just can't take it anymore and now I would allow myself any type of mods and modded servers as long as they don't screw up the balance even further. I don't care for any achievements here anymore. I'd probably go for a 58/73 for the solo-coop component before, but I've no longer interest in getting or showing better in a game like that. In fact, strangely managed, a wide variety of mods can gain many or even all achievements for those who bother.

	Having said those things, I feel like having lost most of my interest in this game, like with its sister one (l4d2), but it still offers adequate all-around playability up to Advanced and rather good coop feelings (unless you meet a troll), so I still have interest in playing such open games, despite having lost most...or maybe all of my interest in soloing here. Expert and Survival still have something to offer when with coop mates, but should I get left alone in those, I'd rather click my quick-quit shortcut and play another game as they seem to demand a lot, but the maps too often have nothing special to give in the hands of the player. Also they are rather pretentious as they need experienced teammates as well, not just casual beginner players.

I enjoy this game a ton and I would recommend it to you as it is an extremely well-made zombie PvE and PvP if you play versus, however, its sequel, Left 4 Dead 2, contains every campaign in this game plus a lot more and addons. There is even a mode to change the game to feel more like the first game.

However, this mode doesn't fully replicate the original game. All the mode does is change the weapons. The atmosphere of the original game is dark and dull and much less campy than the second game, which is very bright, and there are also other details not replicated such as the GUI and being able to see your legs. There are little changes to the maps as well. Therefore, I do not feel like L4D is entirely in L4D2. If you would like to experience the original atmosphere, buy this game. L4D2 is better if you don't want to experience the original atmosphere but instead want a game with more content.

A 2008 first-person shooter game, a zombie game and in my opinion the best zombie survival game ever. Till this day, given all the new standards of video gaming, this game holds up well and its still playable online. The theme, settings, environment, gameplay, weapons, mechanics, the characters and the zombies are just well done and made to perfection, giving a satisfaction while playing and also leaving an imprint of any gamer that has indulged in its universe. 

-The theme is zombies and viruses. Zombies have been mentioned in stories, myths, movies, songs, and now in Left 4 Dead as main theme, but combined with a virus outbreak that causes zombification to the infected people. 

-The setting is you are in a huge apocalyptic worldwide virus-outbreak that spreads so fast globally and causes zombification. You need to fight your way out to safety through huge hordes of infected people or zombies.

-The environment is as expected but very well done. Spooky and cloudy forests, abandoned public places where you usually see or expect to see large amount of people on daily basis, farms, basically every possible and suitable location for a perfect horror movie. While you walk slowly and careful through all of these places, you are never alone, as you are accompanied by the growls and screams of the infected.

-The weapons are amazingly well done and are satisfactory to use. There is no bad weapon to use. Every weapons is so good to use, that you have hard time choosing what to pick up and use. Their sound effects and reloading are amazing. The melee sequence is good and very helpful, as the bombs, which are a must if you want to survive. You have big variants of melee weapons to choose from. All of them useful, and not a single weapon bad. Perfect.

-Mechanic is simple and smooth. Easy to pick up, learn and master in short time.

The are two major factors that make this game, the game it is. One are the characters, and two are the AI enemies.

-You can play as one of the four main protagonists. Bill, an old Vietnam veteran; Zoey, a college student; Louis, a district account manager; and Francis, an outlaw biker. Their dialogs and monologs are well acted, fresh, amazing, and hilarious. I always had a smile on my face while I was listening to them talking to each other, while fighting are just catching a breath for a moment. 

- The AI enemies, or the infected are well made. both physically and functionally. Their appearance is frightening and zombie-like, as expected. To make the gameplay more interesting, there are 2 types of infected. Common and Special infected. Common infected are basically zombies with nothing special. They attack in hordes, trying to corner you and only use melee attacks. While the Special infected, have special physical appearance, which help you identify them easily even from long distances, accompanied with special voice lines and growls for each one, and special and unique ability. Each unique ability gives the special infected their role and job in the attack. Some like the Boomer and The smoker act as support classes, they don't deal huge burst damage, but aid and help the horde to killing you easily. The hunter is a flanker which is really scary and a pain to deal with, makes every player awaken and panic. The Witch is like a semi-crowd controller that sometimes blocks paths, but most of the time can be easily avoided. She is the most dangerous, because she can burst and kill anyone in just 1 hit. And lastly, the Tank. A big bruiser and bullet sponge. 

The characters and the AI enemies, combined with the special infected with their special abilities, makes for one hella good gameplay and memorable moments with people or with your friends. Just heads up, this game online, on multiplayer can be often toxic if you are new player or just did a small mistake. Here are people that play the game everyday non-stop from its day of release and want everyone to play as they imagine in their head with 0 mistakes, or you will get attacked in chat, voice chat, on your steam profile, and be vote kicked. But some good players and friends, its a play you must experience.

If you're looking for horror, that's not the department this is in. It's got more of an arcade feel to it, and that's what makes the game so replayable. It definitely has some differences between the second - not in the ways of things like different weapons and infected, but in gameplay, and just kind of how the game feels while playing. 

I'd say my only downside to this game is that there's barely any multiplayer on it anymore, as pretty much everyone has migrated over to Left 4 Dead 2.

The game is a blast to play with friends (most co-op games are) and with a generally fair sense of difficulty the game can be as easy or difficult as you want it. The act of actually fighting zombies is always engaging. There are 4 special types of zombies and the standard zombies and all provide a generally unique challenge. While the guns don’t have great feedback, they still get the job done and don’t show their age too much, being a game from 2008. I would have appreciated a more powerful sniper and perhaps modifications to the guns, but I suppose the simplicity plays into its charm to some extent. The levels themselves provide awesome set pieces and the final battles of each chapter are always intense. The last level in particular, provides quite the challenge. My biggest gripe with the game is the story. None of the chapters flow together and it is altogether pretty forgettable. This benefits replays of specific chapters, but does not lead to a great cohesive story. The characters are also not very fleshed out despite being charming on the surface. None of this matters really when gameplay is the focus, but a good story is always a plus. An underrated feature I liked that added to competition was the stat tracking it does throughout each campaign, showing who did the most damage, least amount of friendly fire, best accuracy, etc. At the end of the day, the game nails fun which is truly all that matters, but many of its story and shooting mechanics leave little depth, which can be disappointing.

Anyway here is a recipe for British Style Toad-in-the-hole

STEP 1
Heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Put the chipolatas in a 20 x 30cm roasting tin with the oil and bake for 15 mins until browned.

STEP 2
Meanwhile, make the batter. Tip the flour into a bowl with ½ tsp salt, make a well in the middle and crack the eggs into it. Use an electric whisk to mix it together, then slowly add the milk, whisking all the time. Leave to stand until the sausages are nice and brown.

STEP 3
Remove the sausages from the oven – be careful because the fat will be sizzling hot – but if it isn’t, put the tin on the hob for a few minutes until it is.

STEP 4
Pour in the batter mix, transfer to the top shelf of the oven, then cook for 25-30 mins, until risen and golden. Serve with gravy and your favourite veg.",1690936372,1690936372,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Cooperative playthrough:
«Left 4 Dead» introduces the concept of team play, where cooperative cooperation and player interaction is important. Each campaign features four players united by a common goal of surviving the zombie apocalypse.

Featured Zombies:
The game offers a wide variety of zombies, including special infected such as Boomer, Smoker, Hunter, Witch and Tank, each with unique abilities and posing different threats.

AI Director:
One of the features of «L4D» is the «AI Director», which adapts the game to the team's play style by changing the location and number of zombies, as well as offering different challenges and circumstances.

Atmosphere:
A unique atmosphere of fear and despair, flavored with paced and tense gameplay. The game skillfully combines elements of horror and action.

Versus Mode:
In this mode, players can take on the role of specialized infected, fighting against another team of survivors. This adds even more variation to the gameplay.

So, «Left 4 Dead» remains one of the leading representatives of the cooperative first-person shooter genre, and if you missed the chance to enjoy this game in your time, I recommend you remedy that.

If you are looking for a single-player game with a story or something of cinematic experience, stay aside or you won't enjoy it as much as you would have expected because this game has none.
Plus, all the content of this game like maps, characters, and weapons has been transferred to Left 4 Dead 2 so that makes it an ideal choice.

Now, Review:
The graphics look really well than I expected for a 2008 game in 2022, it even supports very high FPS. Was it remastered or something, idk. The campaign was very short which took me just around 5 hours to complete alone.
Some people still play this game so finding matches isn't impossible, and gameplay shooting was fun too. I wished the gun sounds were more heavy, and it had a proper cinematic story.

But they are selling it for quite cheap, and it is worth it if you have some spare money for collection. But if you ask my suggestion, skip to Left 4 Dead 2.",1655632311,1690039747,True,85,0,0.826726257801055908,3,True,False,False

As a devoted gamer, I can confidently say that this 2008 classic is one of the best cooperative first-person shooter experiences ever created.

From the moment I picked up the controller and teamed up with three other survivors, I was drawn into the apocalyptic world infested with hordes of ravenous zombies. The game's gripping storyline unfolds through a series of campaigns, each filled with intense and immersive gameplay. Whether I was running through the desolate streets of a city overrun by the undead or desperately fighting off relentless waves of infected, Left 4 Dead kept me on the edge of my seat.

One of the standout features of this game is the ""AI Director."" This ingenious system dynamically adjusts the game's pacing, enemy spawns, and item distribution, ensuring every playthrough feels fresh and unpredictable. This aspect alone adds incredible replay value, as I constantly found myself coming back for more, eager to see what new challenges awaited.

The diversity among the four main characters – Bill, Zoey, Francis, and Louis – adds depth to the cooperative gameplay. Each survivor has unique traits, dialogue, and personality, making team dynamics crucial for survival. Working together and coordinating strategies with friends or online players was an immensely enjoyable experience that strengthened friendships and forged new ones.

The atmosphere in Left 4 Dead is genuinely haunting. From the eerie sound effects to the eerie landscapes and abandoned buildings, the game successfully creates an atmosphere that leaves players constantly looking over their shoulders. The adrenaline rush I got when the infamous ""horde"" swarmed us, forcing us to fight for our lives, is something I won't soon forget.

Furthermore, the game's extensive modding community has breathed new life into Left 4 Dead, continuously introducing exciting new content, custom campaigns, and game modes. The dedication of both the developers and the community has ensured that the game remains relevant and enjoyable even years after its initial release.

Lastly, the cooperative nature of the game fosters camaraderie and teamwork. Whether I was playing with old friends or meeting new ones, the sense of achievement we felt after surviving a particularly tough campaign was unparalleled. Left 4 Dead taught me valuable lessons in cooperation and communication, skills that extend beyond the virtual world.

In conclusion, Left 4 Dead is a timeless classic that has stood the test of time, offering thrilling gameplay, superb cooperative mechanics, and a chillingly immersive experience. If you're a fan of fast-paced action, strategic planning, and a good dose of adrenaline, this game is an absolute must-play. Grab your friends, arm yourselves to the teeth, and prepare for an unforgettable zombie-slaying adventure like no other!",1690020068,1690020068,True,15,1,0.652319729328155518,0,True,False,False

And on the way, met a few people, either veterans, rookies, sometimes people who knew exploits for survival and others who couldn't handle 5 minutes without being babysat.

Despite the game being almost abandoned, it's still playable online. With about 600 to 900 players still on it occasionally.

Toxicity isn't too high, but can exist, but overall, a neat simpler times before the second game upped the antics.

Modding still exists to a smaller degree, just not using the workshop.

Would recommend people to play this game out of nostalgia or to beat my record of 124 hours.

[b]Technical state[/b]
The game is well optimized. It never caused lags or GPU overheat. My computer is not the best, and it runs this game with no problems. Also, I didn't notice any bugs.

[b]Style[/b]
Graphics are realistic and have their own style. The game definitely looks good. I even liked the main menu and loading screens.

[b]Gameplay[/b]
Gameplay is easy to learn. For example, there is no complicated inventory or loot system with confusing upgrades. Instead, you simply have 5 slots for weapon, pistol, medkit, grenade and pills. It is very easy and comfortable to use.
Shooting zombies is awesome. There are lots of animations combined with real-time physics, so every zombie dies in a unique way. Shooting them is a pleasure. Every zombie encounter feels like a challenge, not an obstacle.
There are not too many game mechanics, and every one of them is clear and has purpose.

[b]Level design[/b]
Levels in this game are well made. You understang where you need to go and why. Every location creates a unique feeling and atmosphere. Also, there are lots of details, like graphiti made by other survivors, or military signs and instructions for civilians. Those details make the world believeable and more realistic for the player.

[b]Characters[/b]
There are 4 playable characters in this game. Every one of them has a unique personality and manner of speech. They are just cool. Honestly, this is a team that you are proud to be a part of.",1688408743,1688409064,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The horde attacks all seem to occur at random, so you never get any sense of accomplishment after beating a horde. The next one could come any second, without any tension building up. The zombies just come running. There's almost no build-up or suspense. If you want to slay hordes of zombies solo, I recommend Days Gone or Dead Rising 1, 2 and 2 OTR, but only 1 for PC, since the others don't have reliable support for controllers.

I probably would have loved this game if it had some sort of story, a bit more varied and advanced game mechanics and zombie hordes that didn't seem to just appear at random but rather at specific places.

It's showing its age of course but the shooting is still satisfying, the dynamic music system sets the tone, the survivor bot AI still manages to impress all these years later, the zombies still very much do threaten, and there are still enough people playing it to get a game going within a minute or so, often within 30 seconds. Can't comment on how many of them are cheaters, but there are definitely a reasonable amount of people still playing.
There are many newer games that simply don't get the fundamentals right like this game did.
Of course you don't want to pay full price for this game. Get it on sale. Whether you want to get the sequel instead on sale, as I presume it will be on sale at the same time - is up to you.

The characters you play are also memorable. This is a fun (and painful) game to 100% and the game can be enjoyable if you have friends or someone you can play with. The only thing is that by the time of this review, there are only about 500 concurrent players still playing this game but most of them are a bunch of obnoxious brats playing in online versus matches. Be warned if you decide to play with random strangers in dedicated servers as they can easily ruin your matches/experience. Other than that, if you have like the genre and have a crew, then it is a definite try.",1687754768,1687754768,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

With its intense zombie-infested scenarios, strategic gameplay, innovative AI Director system, and cooperative focus, Left 4 Dead delivered an adrenaline-pumping experience like no other. In this review, we will explore the reasons why Left 4 Dead remains a beloved and influential title in the gaming industry.

    Thrilling Cooperative Gameplay:
    At the core of Left 4 Dead's success lies its emphasis on cooperative gameplay. Players team up with three other survivors, battling hordes of infected as they make their way through various campaigns. The game encourages teamwork, coordination, and communication, as each player must fulfill their role to survive. The dynamic AI Director ensures that the experience is different with each playthrough, adding an element of unpredictability and excitement to every match.

    Innovative AI Director System:
    One of the standout features of Left 4 Dead is the AI Director system, which dynamically adjusts the game's pacing, difficulty, and item placements based on player performance. This intelligent system ensures that the game constantly challenges players, adapting to their strategies and keeping them on their toes. Whether it's altering the spawn locations of enemies or adjusting the frequency of health packs and weapons, the AI Director creates a unique and intense experience every time.

    Intense and Varied Scenarios:
    Left 4 Dead offers a variety of campaigns, each with its own unique setting and challenges. From navigating through a zombie-infested hospital to fighting your way across a city in chaos, each scenario presents its own distinct atmosphere and level design. The game expertly ramps up the tension as players progress, with crescendos and crescendo events creating heart-pounding moments that require teamwork and quick thinking to survive.

    Dynamic and Adaptive Infected Enemies:
    The infected enemies in Left 4 Dead are more than mindless zombies. The game introduces special infected, such as Hunters, Smokers, Boomers, and Tanks, each with their own unique abilities and weaknesses. These enemies add layers of strategic depth to the gameplay, requiring players to adapt their tactics accordingly. The combination of different infected types in each encounter keeps players engaged and forces them to prioritize targets and work together effectively.

    Replayability and Multiplayer Modes:
    Left 4 Dead offers tremendous replayability, thanks to its cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes. The cooperative campaign mode allows players to team up with friends or AI-controlled teammates to tackle the game's thrilling campaigns. Versus mode introduces a competitive aspect, where one team plays as the survivors while the other controls the special infected. The intense battles and the opportunity to experience the game from both sides create a dynamic and engaging multiplayer experience.

    Immersive Atmosphere and Audio Design:
    Left 4 Dead excels in creating an immersive and atmospheric world. The dark and desolate environments, combined with the eerie ambient sounds, contribute to a sense of dread and tension. The infected's guttural moans, the haunting music cues, and the characters' panicked voice lines further immerse players in the apocalyptic setting. The attention to detail in the audio design enhances the overall experience, making every moment feel intense and suspenseful.

    Modding Community and Content Creation:
    Left 4 Dead has a dedicated modding community that has produced an abundance of custom campaigns, maps, and modifications. The availability of the Steam Workshop has made it easy for players to access and install user-generated content, extending the game's lifespan and providing endless new experiences. The modding community's creativity and dedication have contributed to the game's longevity, ensuring that players always have fresh content to explore.

Conclusion:
Left 4 Dead is a trailblazing cooperative zombie thriller that continues to captivate players with its intense gameplay, innovative AI Director system, and immersive atmosphere. The game's emphasis on cooperative gameplay, dynamic scenarios, varied infected enemies, replayability, and support from the modding community make it a timeless classic.

The cooperative gameplay in Left 4 Dead is where the game truly shines. Working together with friends or AI-controlled teammates to navigate through the chaotic and perilous environments creates a strong sense of camaraderie and shared survival. Each player's contribution is essential, whether it's providing covering fire, healing teammates, or saving them from the clutches of special infected. Left 4 Dead captures the essence of cooperative gaming, fostering teamwork and communication in a way that few games have achieved.

The innovative AI Director system sets Left 4 Dead apart from other games in the genre. By dynamically adjusting the game's difficulty, pacing, and item placement, the AI Director ensures that every playthrough feels fresh and challenging. This system keeps players engaged and on their toes, as they never know what surprises await them. The AI Director's ability to adapt to player performance creates a truly immersive and dynamic experience, making each session feel unique.

The game's scenarios are meticulously designed to provide intense and memorable moments. From defending against hordes of infected while waiting for rescue to navigating treacherous environments with limited resources, every campaign offers a thrilling and adrenaline-pumping experience. The crescendos and crescendo events, which trigger massive waves of enemies, add a layer of tension and excitement that keeps players engaged from start to finish.

The infected enemies in Left 4 Dead are not just mindless zombies; they are formidable adversaries with unique abilities. The special infected, such as the Hunter, Smoker, Boomer, and Tank, present different challenges and require different strategies to overcome. This variety keeps the gameplay dynamic and strategic, as players must adapt their tactics to counter each enemy type effectively. The constant threat of the infected ensures that players are always on high alert, heightening the intensity of every encounter.

Left 4 Dead's replayability is bolstered by its multiplayer modes, which offer endless hours of fun and excitement. The cooperative campaign mode allows players to experience the game's thrilling campaigns together, fostering teamwork and cooperation. The Versus mode adds a competitive element, allowing players to take turns as survivors and infected, resulting in intense battles and strategic gameplay. The game's multiplayer modes, along with additional modes like Survival and Scavenge, provide diverse and engaging experiences that cater to different playstyles.

The atmospheric and audio design of Left 4 Dead contributes to its immersive experience. The detailed environments, combined with the haunting sound effects and atmospheric music, create a sense of dread and desperation. The audio cues, such as the infected's distinct growls and the characters' panicked voice lines, enhance the tension and draw players further into the apocalyptic world. Left 4 Dead's attention to atmospheric and audio design elevates the overall experience and immerses players in the game's harrowing setting.

Lastly, the support from the modding community has extended Left 4 Dead's lifespan and provided a wealth of additional content. The Steam Workshop integration allows players to easily access and install custom campaigns, maps, and modifications created by the community. This support has kept the game fresh and exciting, with new content continuously being produced. The dedication and creativity of the modding community have played a significant role in the game's longevity and enduring popular",1686875779,1686875779,True,17,2,0.623078644275665283,0,True,False,False

However, it's important to set the record straight and acknowledge my profound affection for the latter. Left 4 Dead has a remarkable ability to captivate players with its delightful blend of humor and addictive gameplay. Unlike its counterpart, Left 4 Dead fearlessly embraces its wild and extravagant elements, resulting in a truly exhilarating adventure.

Whether you're teaming up with friends for riotous multiplayer escapades or taking on challenging single-player modes, the game consistently delivers an exceptional level of enjoyment.

No Mercy:
these 4 dumb*sses go through some apartments with some random shit inside them and a pipebomb in a goddamn bathroom.
they go into a whole ass subway and there's some generator room that honestly makes no sense to be put here in a required area to pass through, oh and there's also the big ass zombie called the tank
These stupid ass sewers are just some cliche so skip it,
The hospital itself, it works, it makes sense but out of all places for evacuation you choose a HOSPITAL.
the roof finale is quite uhhh... yeah it works i guess.
there's 2 goddamn big fat ass zombies that attack you as well, and should i mention this goes for EVERY SINGLE FINALE?!
Crash Course:
They fucking crashed, what else do you expect, it's IN THE GODDAMN TITLE
the pilot was bit and they went down down.
They go through some alleys and to be honest, this howitzer part makes SOME sense, but out of all places to guard, you CHOOSE A BRIDGE.
The go through and find a truck linked to a generator, which stops MIDF***INGWAY THROUGH THE PROCESS!
Death Toll:
What the fuck happened in-between? I don't know, their truck f*ckin' died and took a cop car that shortly ran out of gas. That's how I like to put it.
They go through this dumb tunnel here that had a huge car pile up in the middle of it.
Then they go through some sewers that has some weird ass gate with an ALARM ON IT FOR NO REASON!
They go to a train station and find a radio tower and move on, then the fucking church, THE GODDAMN CHURCH!
*insert Nathan Vetterlein here*
he turns into a goddamn zombie by the way.
You end up going through some buildings and then some chase or run n' gun part here.
Then this boat finale where Francis says they're cops, *they aren't*
these 2 dumbf**ks end up rescuing 4 carriers of a virus that are immune to the... virus...
Dead Air:
head for this big ass plane, you got it!
uhhh this campaign is like the most interesting to me. you start in the greenhouse
the next level has a barricade you have to burn down INSTEAD OF GOING OVER THE DAMN THING BY CLIMBING ONTOP THE GAS CANS AND WHEN SHOOTING LIKE 5 OR 6 GAS CANS ALERTS 6700 ZOMBIES!
you stumble up upon a construction site and then make it to the airport, which a SINGULAR AVOIDABLE BOX MACHINE STARTS RINGING IN A 2 WEEK APOCALYPSE!
Then the final level where you have to fuel up a plane while a conveniently placed minigun which will shred the fat ass zombies known as ""Tanks"".
Blood Harvest:
You were camping with your friends until a spooky monster pops up and forces you into a tunnel and one of the sandwhiches is poisened and then a hole somewhere opens and you go through it and it leads you to a bridge but dont worry! 2 idots set up bear traps and then you go up to the train station since a big black fog has risen up and then go to a farmhouse and but OH NO! it was found out the military had used rat poison and killed somebody since in the first map a random ass player jumped to the tunnel map instead of using the safehouse route since they're a dumb*ss!

The game adapts to how you play, and without spoiling anything, I will say that you will be constantly surprised by how the game changes based on what you do/how fast you are progressing. 

Left for dead also has engaging lore and is much more of a ""horror""  game then its sequel. Most of the game takes place at night, so if that's not your thing check out the sequel instead.

As a fan of intense first-person shooters and cooperative gameplay, Left 4 Dead has been a delight from the moment I picked up my trusty shotgun and joined the fight against the horde.

One of the standout features of Left 4 Dead is its lightweight nature. Despite its stunning graphics and immersive gameplay, the game runs smoothly even on modest hardware configurations. This low system requirement makes it accessible to a wide range of players, allowing everyone to join the undead battle without worrying about technical limitations. It's refreshing to see a game that strikes a balance between high-quality visuals and optimized performance, ensuring a seamless experience for both veteran and novice players alike.

Now, let's dive into the gameplay itself. Left 4 Dead truly excels in delivering heart-pounding moments of survival horror. Whether you're navigating through dimly lit corridors, desperately defending a safe room, or coordinating with your team to take down a terrifying Tank, the game keeps you on the edge of your seat. The cooperative aspect is where the game truly shines, as you and your teammates must work together, covering each other's backs and utilizing unique character abilities to survive the relentless onslaught of the infected. It's an experience that fosters camaraderie and memorable moments of triumph.

But what truly sets Left 4 Dead apart is its relentless sense of humor. From the witty banter between the characters to the cleverly placed Easter eggs, the game injects a much-needed dose of levity into the zombie apocalypse. The comedic moments provide a welcomed respite from the tension and add an extra layer of charm to the overall experience. Speaking of charm, keep an eye out for hidden jokes and puns that are sprinkled throughout the game. It's like finding a hidden treasure amidst the chaos, adding an extra element of fun for those with a keen eye and a love for wordplay.

In conclusion, Left 4 Dead is a zombie-slaying extravaganza that doesn't require a heavyweight rig to enjoy. Its optimized performance ensures a smooth and immersive experience for all players, regardless of their system specifications. The intense cooperative gameplay, coupled with the game's relentless sense of humor, makes for an unforgettable journey through the zombie-infested world. So gather your friends, lock and load, and brace yourselves for a thrilling adventure that will keep you entertained and laughing till the end. Remember, sometimes it's not just about survival, but also about having a bloody good time!",1670163299,1685394768,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Make no mistake: only consider buying L4D1 if you already own L4D2 and want to “see how it was back then”. The experience can be gratifying, because even when all relevant content was ported to L4D2, the atmosphere between the two is tangible. Maps are different, gameplay is slower-paced, and the tone is forbidding and stark compared to L4D2.

As for replaying the game after finishing each campaign, that’s when your mileage may begin to run out. I find it less enjoyable with less maps, weapons, and servers (Valve still runs official servers incredibly enough).

All modes outside of Campaign are dead. Rarely, you may find an open versus server, and as expected they form a clique of shut-in aficionados with a vitamin D deficiency. Essentially, campaign and single player survival is all you get. 

So with Co-op being the last remaining draw, I have to warn you about griefers. You cannot block Steam profiles like in L4D2 to prevent them joining your game. Public Expert is Russian roulette, to the point you need to kill bots preemptively when a griefer joins the server as incapacitated players still deal friendly fire. You either private the lobby or make a new one to continue (chances are you’re alone and can’t votekick them).

Other than replaying the campaigns on Expert (if you’re lucky to vet a sane group of people), custom campaigns and mods are the last bastion of content. The mod community is understandably small and more so a relic of the past. Mods are a hassle to install without the Workshop and a majority are very low quality given most were made when L4D was new. Suicide Blitz and Fairfield Terror are two exceptional custom campaigns to try.

Review:

Left 4 Dead is a game that revolutionized the cooperative first-person shooter genre, delivering an unforgettable zombie survival experience that remains unmatched to this day. From its intense gameplay to its innovative AI Director system, Left 4 Dead provides an exhilarating adventure that keeps players on the edge of their seats. With its seamless multiplayer integration and captivating campaign, it's no wonder that fans eagerly await the possibility of another game in the series.

At its core, Left 4 Dead excels in creating an intense and immersive survival atmosphere. Players are thrust into a post-apocalyptic world overrun by hordes of infected creatures, and their sole objective is to fight their way through the chaos and reach safety. The game's focus on cooperative play and teamwork is paramount, as players must rely on each other's skills and support to survive the relentless onslaught. This creates a dynamic and engaging experience that encourages communication, strategic decision-making, and a constant sense of urgency.

One of the game's defining features is the groundbreaking AI Director system. This dynamic system adjusts the gameplay experience on the fly, reacting to the players' actions and skill level. The Director controls the placement and timing of enemies, items, and events, ensuring that each playthrough feels fresh and unpredictable. This innovative approach to game design enhances replayability, as no two playthroughs are ever the same, creating an addictive and constantly evolving experience.

Left 4 Dead's campaign is a thrilling rollercoaster ride through a variety of meticulously designed scenarios. From traversing desolate city streets to fighting for survival in eerie swamps, each campaign offers a unique and atmospheric setting. The attention to detail in the environments, combined with the game's dynamic lighting and sound design, creates a sense of tension and immersion that is second to none. The pacing is perfectly executed, with moments of frenetic action followed by brief periods of respite, keeping players engaged and invested in the outcome.

Multiplayer is where Left 4 Dead truly shines. The cooperative mode allows players to team up with friends or other players online, reinforcing the game's emphasis on teamwork and communication. The intense moments of defending against waves of infected, providing cover fire for teammates, and rescuing each other from the clutches of death create a sense of camaraderie and accomplishment. The competitive Versus mode, where players take turns controlling the infected, adds an additional layer of excitement and depth to the multiplayer experience, ensuring endless hours of replayability.

Given the unparalleled success and adoration for Left 4 Dead, it's no surprise that fans eagerly anticipate a sequel. The potential for expanding the game's world, introducing new characters, campaigns, and infected types is immense. The advancements in technology since the release of the original game open up exciting possibilities for enhanced graphics, mechanics, and even more immersive gameplay experiences.

In conclusion, Left 4 Dead is a monumental game that forever changed the cooperative shooter genre. Its intense gameplay, innovative AI Director system, and captivating campaign provide an exhilarating and immersive experience like no other. As fans continue to cherish the legacy of Left 4 Dead, we can only hope that the developers recognize the demand for a sequel and deliver another unforgettable entry in this beloved franchise. Until then, let's celebrate the impact of Left 4 Dead and relish the countless hours of pulse-pounding zombie survival it has provided.",1514608671,1684711013,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Rating: ★★★★☆

Left 4 Dead, developed by Valve, is a classic co-operative zombie shooter that delivers relentless action, intense gameplay, and memorable moments. Released over a decade ago, this game continues to captivate players with its unique blend of teamwork, survival, and relentless hordes of infected.

One of the defining features of Left 4 Dead is its emphasis on cooperative play. Playing with friends or AI-controlled teammates, you'll navigate through a series of well-designed campaigns, each filled with challenging scenarios and a variety of undead enemies. Communication and coordination are key as you battle waves of infected, navigate treacherous environments, and race against time to reach safe houses.

The game's AI Director is a stroke of genius, dynamically adjusting the difficulty, item placements, and enemy spawns based on the players' performance. This creates a sense of unpredictability and replayability, ensuring that no two playthroughs are exactly the same. The AI Director's ability to ratchet up the tension at critical moments makes for some heart-pounding and memorable experiences.",1684539575,1684539575,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There's just something different about how the guns feel, and how your character moves in the original that doesn't match 2. I also prefer the original campaigns which have more horror atmosphere and a darker tone. The 2nd game is goated and by all means the definitive Left 4 Dead experience, don't get me wrong. For the fans of old though, there is something special about returning to the game that started it all. 

Bonus points: You can see your feet if you look down :O

For secondary weapons you get a 1911 pistol with infinite ammo, you can find a second one in all levels. There's no melee weapons only mouse2 to melee enemies, you can kill them this way and stun lock some special infected, needless to say this is useless on the tank( a special infected).
There's a few campaigns each with a diferent acts, the maps are nice and you are encouraged to explore.
You must survive each map along with 3 team mates, you shoul stick close to the group since there's a lot of infected & special infected. You will be damaged a lot by the zombie and to mitigate this issue you will start with one medkit\medpack each round and are rewarded another by the end of the round, should you run out of medkits you can find pill bottles scattered throughout the levels to help you and your team mates survive, use them as soon as your character is limping or you'll be left for dead.
There's also 2 throwable weapons, the molotov with sets AoE dmg for a few seconds or a pipe bomb which will ring loudly and atract only the normal infected to die in the explosion, mind you some infected might not make it in time to die and may go back to harming you.
There are still people playing this game, I found 2 games with nice people in the past 2 days, since I work a lot I can usually play 1 hour a day. If it's very early morning or late night you might find the servers unpopulated, but during normal hours you will have a blast.
Overall to me this is a solid 10\10 game, only wish the 360 died earlier and I got a pc instead & I tried to spoil the least possible in this review so you might give this game a try, this is the pure meaning of ""plug & play"" but instead you just sit down after a hard day of work and go to town shooting zombies, you don't need level ups or pay this or any barriers, just start & play.",1682063846,1682063846,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It was fun going around levels, strategizing about how to complete a certain segment. If you're playing on expert, completing that one stage of the level can feel very rewarding and finally figuring out how to survive the survival map you've been struggling with.

I all in all thought this was a good game, not the best i've ever played but good none the less. There were some things that bothered me like how the bots seemed absolutely useless at times which made it exponentially harder to complete expert. Also how when a zombie scratches you, you can't walk away and are soon going to be eaten by a horde of zombies.

It took quite a long time to get all the achievements in this game. If you are thinking about doing it I would recommend looking through a guide or playing it with 3 of your friends. I played this with one friend and it was harder than it would've been if we'd played with 2 others.

[u]A Really nice game that you can play alone or with friends/family / the homeless / Your Pets.[/u]

I am happy to [b]Recommend[/b] this game that i been playing for over [u]10.0 years[/u] now as of [b]04-16-2023[/b]

I'm at least at  3.974.0 hrs on record as of [b]04-16-2023[/b] and i still love it.

Left for dead 1 / Left for dead 2 are not better than each other what it comes down too is what one you love more because of that, I recommend you buy both and see which one you [u]Truely will love[/u] and you should spend at least [u]1K+ hours in Each[/u] before you [u]Judge[/u] them
(at least 250+ hours in single player mode & 500+ hours in VS Mode & 250+ Hours in Others) 
You should spend these hours in-game with good friends not just idle it / playing with bad teammates.
You will learn that in the end both games are great to play with others, with that said its a good idea to make some good friends to play with and join them when playing both games.

what I learn from playing this off and on for 10+ years.
The Tank gets mad because the group farted in his food and messed with him why he is with his girlfriend but in the end, the group remembers the tank just Wants a Hug.
The Hunter wants Zoey because she mooned him because they both enjoyed it.
The smoker wants bill for his beard & smoking habit because he loves it.
The Boomer wants Francis because the boomer wants his coat so he can sell it on eBay to buy stuff to help him lose weight.
The witch wants Louis but he rejects her for being a crybaby about his flaming farting in bed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I also learned a big part of noobs/newbles/bad teammates do often,

1. Blame others for their own mistakes instead learning from their own mistakes.
2. Vote kick for their own mistakes instead improving themselves by learning from their mistakes.
3. Do not know what they are talking about at least 75% of the time.
4. Barely learn how to play the game even when you tell them stuff based on your years of game experiences.

The above is more common then you think trust me but is it enough to not play the game? nope.",1403945805,1681626325,True,8,1,0.543256938457489014,3,True,False,False

First of all, the characters are like the cast of a B-movie. You've got your grizzled veteran, your punk rock kid, your nerdy college student, and your sassy black guy. It's like a ""Scooby Doo"" gang, but with shotguns instead of a talking dog.

And let's not forget about the zombies. Left 4 Dead 1 has more types of zombies than a ""World War Z"" movie. You've got your regular slowpokes, your explosive vomiters, your tongue-lashing stranglers, and your giant tank-like brutes. It's like a zombie zoo, but with a lot more blood and guts.

But the real fun of the game is playing with your friends online. Nothing brings people together like surviving a zombie horde while shouting profanity and insults at each other. And with the ability to play as the zombies, you can finally live out your dream of being a brain-hungry monster.

Overall, Left 4 Dead 1 is a zombie shooter that's as fun as it is ridiculous. If you're a fan of cheesy action movies, bad puns, and shooting zombies in the face, then this game is a must-play. Just make sure you have a lot of ammo, some good friends, and a sense of humor, because you're gonna need all three.",1681502734,1681502734,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

What's better is the fact that you get to experience the first game with the vastly superior gun-play of the 2nd game.

Now don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of L4D1 and have logged more than 150 hrs+ on the first one, but if the first one was a classic song, the 2nd one is a bangin' New Age remix. Plus the 2nd one is harder, with more Special Infected looking to take you out. 

L4D1/L4D2 helped me out during a really hard time in my life, when I was in-between jobs, and my personal life was in shambles, a lot like today. It's cyclical I guess, a lot like the seasons of the year. 

L4D1's amazing opening cinematic lays out the premise of the game, as our crack four are attacked by a horde and manage to escape to a terrace. Bill's caustic ""Son, we just crossed the street."" in response to Louis's positivist disposition just cracks me up.

My only complaint with the game is that Zoey doesn't seem to have much of a personality, other than being a pretty girl. For example, the banter between the characters is hilarious and Louis slots in as a perfect foil to Francis's ""I HATE EVERYTHING"" attitude. 

When Bill asks Francis: ""Son, is there anything you don't hate?"", it makes me laugh on the inside every time. I feel Zoey is lacking in this department, we just don't know a lot about her. 

They could've had a simple workaround for this,  They could've had Zoey be Nick's younger sister (Reveal happening in L4D2) and the story explained backwards from there. Ellis could work, but his Texan drawl doesn't match Zoey's accent, so they couldn't be siblings. 

Some people will tell you to skip this and just get the second one instead. IGNORE THEM. You can get both games for a pittance when there's a Valve sale. Don't miss the classical vibe of this late 00s shooter that still remains underappreciated, and a bit of a cult classic. It's the most ""cult"" game in Valve's library.

One of the standout features of Left 4 Dead is its intense and fast-paced gameplay. The game drops players into a zombie-infested world, where they must work together to survive and make their way to safety. The game's AI director creates a dynamic and unpredictable experience, adjusting the difficulty and pacing of the game based on the players' performance.

Another highlight of Left 4 Dead is its innovative gameplay mechanics. The game features four playable characters, each with their own unique personality and abilities. The game's ""special infected"" zombies, such as the Hunter and the Tank, add an extra layer of challenge and excitement to the gameplay, requiring players to adapt their strategies on the fly.

The game also has a strong emphasis on cooperative play, with players needing to work together to navigate the game's levels and survive the zombie hordes. The game's multiplayer modes, including Versus and Survival, add even more depth and replayability to the game.

Left 4 Dead also has a distinctive visual style, with detailed and atmospheric environments that immerse players in the game's world. The game's sound design is also excellent, with creepy and immersive audio cues that heighten the tension and excitement of the gameplay.

Overall, Left 4 Dead is an outstanding game that offers an intense and thrilling cooperative shooter experience.

Despite the likelihood of this game lookng simplistic to people who have yet to play Left 4 Dead the game is much more than that. Valve took the simple premise of a zombie apocalypse first-person shooter and added mechanics to make it more unique and interesting so it isn't a game where you just mow down endless hordes of zombies with nothing else to it (although you will be doing a lot of mowing down zombies).

First off it's multiplayer but instead of going against other players and comparing skills (although there is a versus mode) it requires teamwork. As in teamwork is not helpful in this game but rather it is absolutely vital to be able to survive with teamwork in this game. Special infected which are zombies with ""special powers"" will invetiably constrict or pounce teammates or yourself and the only way to break free of the grasp of special infected is to have a teammate help you out. (So basically without at least 1 teammate you're completely fυcked).

There are many other things to take into account while playing the game such as how much damage or how effective a certain gun will be in different maps and against different enemies, situations where it's appropriate to use pistols (unlimited ammunition) or primary weapons (limited ammunition), when to use pills (quick boost of health but health is only temporary) or a med kit (slower boost of health and health is permanent, so it will be a requirement for a teammate to cover their teammate while he or she is healing).

There are three modes to play through on this game which are campaign, survival and versus. Campaign is pretty straightforward: you progress through maps, kill zombies and special infected until you get rescued by a rescue vehicle near the end and there are four difficulties on this mode to suit to your skill level. There's versus mode which is essentially the campaign but this time players get to take control of the survivors and the special infected so the special infected team's job is to make it difficult as possible for survivors to survive and the survivors job is to try and get through and beat the level. Survival is the last mode and in my personal opinion the most fun especially if you have skillful players on your side. It requires the most strategy and teams need to formulate shooting positions for all teammates based on how much room they have to kill the infected and how far away ammo and resource runs are. Certain players are still attempting to break records on this map.

Which leads me to the biggest con of the game which isn't really the fault of the game itself but the community and not the fault of the community itself but rather the lack of community. While there still are active communities who still play the original Left 4 Dead they are in the rarity. Finding partners to play with particuarly as a newcomer is difficult and annoying. Relying on searching for online lobbies is near useless now since you probably will never find a group of people on and when you do they're already full. If you are an active player yourself you could post a comment saying ""feel free to add me"" to make it easier for people wanting to play with others. 

[h1]Comparison To Left 4 Dead 2[/h1]
The most prominent reasoning for this game receiving a ""not recommended"" review is usually because Left 4 Dead 2 has all the campaign and versus mode maps from here ported over with the addition of new maps exclusive to the sequel and it has increased choice for weaponry including melee weapons and more special infected. However in my personal opinion I prefer the original to the sequel, not to say the sequel isn't any good in fact it's definitely worth getting. The thing about this game is it has a different ""feel"" to it in terms of gameplay which I can't particuarly describe, this version just feels better. It's almost like Left 4 Dead was different in its approach to how it would be played while the sequel has adapted to the feel of modern shooters. 

Another plus is this game has better survival maps and the workload of zombies is much more bearable and reasonable instead of having a ton of special infected and tanks up your bum within the first minute of playing so this way you can go for much longer without constantly failing. But even if you like Left 4 Dead 2 better you have to admit the community is much less toxic than in the original and this is a huge positive on Left 4 Dead 1's behalf because seeing as it is a co-op game the community is an extremely important part of how enjoyable the game is going to be. Being a beginner or rather anything under being an expert player will have you kicked in Left 4 Dead 2 but the Left 4 Dead 1 community is much more supportive and friendly and will more than likely try to help you out and play with you regardless of skill level.

As for the characters they're more likable in this game in my opinion but I suppose that isn't really a valid reason since you can play as them on the maps in the L4D2. All in all I can't say for certain that I recommend this game to ""you"" because it depends who you are. If you absolutely loved Left 4 Dead 2 I recommend buying this game or if you want to pursue bigger feats like in survival and are considering becoming an expert player I recommend buying this game but if you're just looking for a game to play casually with friends then I would recommend the sequel over this. 

[spoiler]PS if you're an achievement hunter like me it gives you more incentive to perform certain challenges and makes playing the game feel more worthwile and rewarding. It's definitely a great game to complete, it's challenging but it isn't unbearably difficult.[/spoiler]",1481798035,1680525530,True,36,2,0.743675649166107178,5,True,False,False

As someone who has spent a fair amount of time observing the human race, I can say with confidence that Left 4 Dead is one of the best cooperative multiplayer games out there. The game pits you and your team of survivors against hordes of the undead, with each level presenting new challenges and obstacles to overcome.

One of the things that sets Left 4 Dead apart is its emphasis on teamwork. You and your fellow survivors will need to work together if you hope to make it through each level alive. Whether it's covering each other's backs, sharing resources, or providing backup during a tough fight, the game encourages players to cooperate and strategize to stay one step ahead of the zombie hoard.

But it's not just the cooperative gameplay that makes Left 4 Dead such a fantastic game. The graphics and sound design are top-notch, immersing you in a world overrun by the undead. And the AI director, which adjusts the difficulty level and spawns of zombies based on your performance, ensures that each playthrough feels fresh and unpredictable.

In short, if you're looking for a game that will keep you on the edge of your seat and have you and your friends screaming in terror and triumph, then Left 4 Dead is the game for you.",1680386927,1680386927,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

With its intense gameplay, unique mechanics, and replayability, this game is a must-play for fans of the genre.The game's premise is simple: players must team up with up to three others to survive a zombie apocalypse by battling hordes of the undead and completing objectives. However, the game is anything but simple, with each playthrough offering a unique experience thanks to the game's AI Director system, which dynamically adjusts the game's difficulty based on the players' performance.One of the best aspects of ""Left 4 Dead"" is its co-op gameplay. Players must work together and communicate effectively in order to survive, and the game's mechanics encourage cooperation and teamwork. The game also offers a variety of game modes, including Campaign, Versus, and Survival, each offering a different experience and challenge.The game's graphics and sound design may seem a bit dated by today's standards, but they still hold up well and add to the game's overall atmosphere. The game's zombie designs are particularly impressive, with each type of zombie offering its own unique challenge to players.However, the game's main drawback is its lack of content compared to newer games in the genre. With only four campaigns and a limited number of weapons and enemy types, some players may find the game's replayability to be a bit lacking.Overall, ""Left 4 Dead"" is a classic co-op zombie shooter that offers a thrilling and intense gaming experience.

When I originally played it on the Xbox 360 when it first came out, I was absolutely blown away by the level of detail in the game. Almost every level in the game has a sense of foreboding to it, since almost every level in the game (except for the Sacrifice campaign) takes place at either twilight or in the dead of night. Most of the zombies, at least in the campaign and versus modes, feel more like they are part of the environment than an enemy. 

Special infected, or the mutant zombies found throughout the game, don't really give the same appeal as the vanilla zombies (known as common infected in the game). They are there mostly to put the four survivors on their toes, forcing them to come up with strategies to defend and protect each other. It is definitely well developed and is honestly genius game design. 

In versus mode, you are able to play as either a survivor or a special infected. You score when you are the survivors (offence) by making progress through a level. The special infected are on defense, trying to kill all of the survivors before they can reach a safe room. It is all fairly strategic in nature, but the special infected often feel like they have an edge over the survivors at times. This is mostly due to the ghost mode mechanic, in which a player-controlled special infected can spawn in virtually anywhere, so long as they aren't in the line of sight of the survivor team. 

The biggest issues in this game, however, are the lack of diversity when it comes to weapon pickups. There are really only six weapon pickups: a second pistol, and uzi, a pump shotgun, an assault rifle (replacing the uzi), auto shotgun (replacing the other one), and the hunting rifle. For throwables, you're stuck with a molotov and a zombie-attracting pipebomb. The worst part is that a third of the weapons you get in the game are only available for the first one or two levels of a campaign, before you are expected to swap out for an upgrade. Of course, it is optional, but the lack of weapon variety really harms the players creativity. 

My second complaint is the lackluster bot system. Many times when a player gets grabbed, mauled, or otherwise pinned by a special infected,  that player will lose a large chunk of health before ever being helped by the bot survivors. I've been incapped a few times in my solo runs because the bots just refused to help me. They also cannot pick up items, and the voice command system is practically useless to them. That's why I recommend having at least one or two friends to play this with, as it will make everyone's experience better.

In conclusion, I highly recommend this game. It is a great multiplayer experience that deserves to be recognized as a classic. Sure, some of the items are a bit redundant and the AI is dumb as a box of rocks at times, but overall it is definitely worth it. However, if you really want the definitive Left 4 Dead experience, I recommend the sequel. It has more items, more enemies, and an active modding community which the original game lacks.",1679066735,1679066735,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Years later Valve released many updates including DLCs that expand upon the campaigns - the latest, The Sacrifice, came out in 2010.

The game can be played solo or with up to three other players, and it offers a thrilling co-op experience that will keep you on the edge of your seat.

The game's graphics and sound design are top-notch, with detailed environments and a haunting soundtrack that perfectly captures the eerie atmosphere of the game. The gameplay is fast-paced and intense, with hordes of zombies coming at you from every direction. The game's AI director ensures that the game remains challenging, adapting the difficulty level based on your performance.

One of the standout features of Left 4 Dead is its co-op gameplay. Playing with other players adds a whole new level of excitement to the game, as you must work together to fight off waves of zombies and complete objectives. The game's four different campaigns offer a lot of replay value, and the random placement of items and enemies means that no two playthroughs are the same.

The game is not without its flaws, however. The game's story is minimal, and the characters lack depth and development. Additionally, the game can feel repetitive at times, with similar objectives and enemy types in each campaign.

Overall, Left 4 Dead is a fantastic first-person shooter that offers a thrilling co-op experience. The game's graphics, sound design, and gameplay are all top-notch, and the co-op gameplay adds a new level of excitement and replay value.

Purists would call it streamlined. For the uninitiated, Left 4 Dead is a fast-paced multiplayer FPS where four survivors must work together to survive a zombie apocalypse, fighting hordes of fast-moving Common infected and Special infected with unique abilities. It's a fun game with friends and has proven to be popular ever since its initial release in 2008, with L4D2 maintaining a community of thousands of players even today.

In this original iteration, only the Hunter (fast pouncer), Smoker (long-range snarer), Boomer (kamikaze horde summoner), Witch (extremely dangerous if angered) and Tank (guess) appear.

There are four modes in L4D: Campaign (play through one of a number of 'campaigns' in the story with other people), Versus (like Campaign but additional people can control the Special infected), Survival (the hardest mode, where you must hold out for as long as possible against the Infected and set time records), and singleplayer (Campaign with bots on your computer).

Gameplay is directed by an AI system named The Director, who spawns items & enemies, and changes the level depending on the status of the survivors. The harder the difficulty, the more contempt it has for you.

The presentation, as befitting most Valve games, is stellar. The campaigns are presented as movies, with 'credits' after the end displaying gameplay stats and a separate music Director controlling the incidental music. It does a good job of creating a zombie-film like atmosphere. Overall, like its sequel, co-op in this game can be very fun.

The only thing of concern here is the microscopic community. It's not abysmal, and it's probably not even as hostile as L4D2's Versus, but it's [i]pretty[/i] small and you'll run into some toxic players, given how cooperative and intense this game can be. (Of course, given the smallish community you may also run into friendly veterans more than once.) If you want to play Expert at all, be prepared to do some janky metagame stuff to fit in - killing players who are below 50 health when they reach the safehouse so they respawn at 50 being one example.


Now you might be wondering: with all of the official L4D campaigns ported over to the sequel, why should I play this? Well, there [i]are[/i] a number of differences that make L4D unique and worth at least one playthrough, even if it lacks Workshop mod support.


Regarding weaponry and equipment:

* The weapon animations are simply better than the sequel's. Fortunately, there are mods for L4D2 that improve on this, even porting the original L4D1 animations over.

* The pistols are M1911s instead of the SIG/Glock of L4D2. There are also L4D2 mods that port the M1911s over to the newer game.

* There are less guns, which means more meaningful weaponry choices. Tier one only has the pump shotgun and Uzi; tier two has the auto shotgun, M16 and hunting rifle. The shotguns function the most different: if you reload them from an empty magazine you must rack the chamber before firing. This makes a difference on the harder difficulties.

* The melee in non-versus games does not suffer from fatigue; you can keep doing it as long as you need. This is helpful when there are no melee weapons to choose from!

* There are only pipe bombs and Molotov cocktails; and no adrenaline shots, defibrillators or ammo packs. Which, again, can make for more of a challenge.


Regarding your enemies:

* Less Special infected (no Jockey, Charger or Spitter) make for a different and some say harder experience, not in the least because the SI that remain are more dangerous here.

* The Common infected appear different and more true to what Valve had in mind.


Regarding performance:

* The game runs better than L4D2.

* The HUD is streamlined and looks better.


Regarding aesthetics and other stuff like that:

* There are different achievements in L4D; for example you do not get achievements in L4D2 for beating the original campaigns on Expert. If you want credit for doing so, you'll want to do it here.

* L4D2's campaigns and aesthetics are action-horror oriented. L4D's are more horror-oriented. While this is largely carried over in the L4D2 ports of the original campaigns, the optimal experience is playing them in L4D.

* For those who enjoy glitches, there are a number in the original campaigns that have not been fixed. The Jesus Rock in Death Toll's finale is a prime example.

* You can see your legs when you look down.


Basically, Left 4 Dead distills the formula to its essence and consequently makes this first entry into the series a classic. I suppose this right here is why it's still being played in a nutshell.

Not to say that Left 4 Dead 2 isn't bad, because apart from the weapon animations and difference in community size it's really not worse - just different. If you want a different Left 4 Dead experience, or you want to ease your way into the franchise by picking it up at the source, I'd recommend this.",1310246257,1678585581,True,4,0,0.597238898277282715,1,True,False,False

I left the game when my father came home and told us that we can go to a trip in America. The trip was fun. I forgot about the game for the next 7 years. Then, at 17, I played it again, trying to understand Versus a little better and also having fun on random servers with 16 people. It was an ok experience, a little random, but funny. Then, I forgot about the game again, until this year, when my friends invited me on L4D2 to play with them. I played it and I liked it too. To be fair, if you can, buy L4D2 only. But if you want to support the developers, buy L4D1 too. Besides all these, my recommendation would be to go for L4D2.

It's a very addicting game and if you play with friends you will probaly pour endless hours into it before you get bored ;P
Even though Left 4 Dead 2 has all the maps and characters from this one, i still recommend this game because both Left 4 Dead games play fundamentally differently from each other, and this comes down to a series of minor changes that quickly add up. These games are different and it is more than just Left 4 Dead 2 having more stuff and players.
---
Left 4 Dead 1 generally rewards being cautious and finding safe spots because of it's lack of melee weapons and additional reload animations. Horde events are not endless, bile isn't in the game, and more special infected being boomers. Tanks finish off survivors instead of trying to incapacitate the whole team unless shoved multiple times by a players.
Maps have more enclosed spaces that cannot be disrupted because the game does not have Spitters or Jockeys.
It's limitations force survivors to work together and be cautious. The L4D1 mode in L4D2 does not address all of these changes and often has no players.

Left 4 dead 1 Also has a much darker tone , textures are darker on all maps, game has a less ""cartony"" aesthetic. Left 4 dead 2 has silly sounding infected and more upbeat music. 

[h1] The Positives [/h1]
+ You can see your legs if you look down. 
+ Free DLC maps.
+ Low PC Specs required.
+ Flawless Lobby/Drop-in, allows player to effortlessly find a game. 
+ Tense atmosphere, creepy soundtrack, Perfect for Co-Op.
+ Really good replayability.
+ Includes remote play.
+ Excellent port, Windows and Mac support, supports high refresh rates and resolution. 
+ Playing with friends is amazing. 
+ Aged like wine, still alot of players in 2023.
+ Group conversations are really fun and engaging.
+ Gameplay holds up quite well and is similar to other source games. 
+ It was released in 2008 and still better than ""Back 4 Blood"".
+ Advanced enemy A.I that acts like a dynamic difficulty setting. If you’re having a hard time the A.I automatically eases you with health kits and ammo. The developers call this system ‘the Director.’
+ Each map has a movie like poster loading screen, and ends with movie style credits at the end of every map, it adds a little flavour. 
+ Many different enemy types.
+ You can make your own maps. 
+ Can play as Special Infected in Versus mode.
+ Dedicated servers are easy to set up. 
+ Developer Commentary.


[h1] The Negatives  [/h1]
- Many players ragequit and leave after going down once. It's a bit too common ;P
- No workshop, so players have to manually download maps, unable to download from server they are joining. 
- Tons of toxic players.
- Lacks a proper narritive. 
- Most games are probaly going to be unenjoyable (because of trollers), although the player count is ok for a 2008 game, you should play with your friends instead of randoms as the experience will be more enjoyable then.

One of the things I liked about Left 4 Dead is the intense and thrilling gameplay. The game's AI director dynamically adjusts the difficulty and number of zombies based on the players' performance, creating a sense of unpredictability and tension. The game also features a variety of weapons and special infected enemies, adding to the game's replayability.

One thing I didn't like about the game is that the campaign is relatively short and the game's story is not very well developed. Additionally, the game's graphics and overall presentation may feel dated to some players.

Overall, I would recommend Left 4 Dead to fans of cooperative first-person shooters, especially those who enjoy intense and thrilling gameplay. The game's AI director adds a sense of unpredictability and tension to the gameplay, and the variety of weapons and special infected enemies makes the game replayable.

This game is the best one of the two games in the series as of right now.
Things it has that L4D2 does not:
+ambiance
+mood
+color scheme
+animations
+hunter mechanics - bhopping the hunter, rooftop access in almost all areas, etc.
+minimal hud elements
All of these go together to make L4D1 a much more 'crisp' feeling environment.

Things about the game I don't like:  (Bear in mind not many of these are the game's fault - and most of these issues fall right on Valve)
- Lack of support from the developers, as it seems mainly, to pun, ""left for dead"" in sake of the sequel by Valve. I mean the game doesn't even have trading cards and early access titles on steam that are purchasable Alpha-stage games DO. What's that say? 
- Also, no steam workshop.
- There are a number of exploits in the first game that are left totally unchecked by the default game developers - such as crouch glitching a hunter in versus off of a collision-enabled object such as a moveable car [punchable]. (too many to list here)
- No competitive mode ever instated in the game: I.E. a rebalancing mode that would work much like the Rotoblin sourcemod plugin - removing tier 2 weaponry or limiting them, as well as items and health items.
- No SOURCETV or HLTV equivalent!!! EDIT: There is now a sourcemod plugin that fixes SourceTV!
- Extremely locked-down engine, with SO many commands being set to literally ""DEVONLY"" tags in the source code itself - making them invisible inside the engine without removing the ""DEVONLY"" tags or using Sourcemod.
- No easy or simple way to remove [u]all[/u] of the elements of the hud visually [u][Ilncluding visual recoil][/u] during demo recording, for good smooths, for stable recording that feels more 'camera-like', as POV demos can be somewhat messy, and a cleaning up is always in order when cfging, and you must write a config to record them smoothly, ((and while this is nice of them as a company to let us use the developer console, this is the best kind of game in that arena, and Valve has always held steadfast to that for their older games)); meant solely to increase the popularity of their games that much more.  :/ Come on its a glorification for a fan to dedicate some of their time on earth to the personal creation of something like that, and when done right they are very entertaining.",1446947815,1673561245,True,3,0,0.55163043737411499,0,True,False,False

Both L4d and L4d2 are similar in game-play, and a lot of mechanics and items are carried over, however there is still quite a difference between both of these, both in game-play and atmosphere.
In general, L4d has a darker, more grim tone to it, whilst L4d2 has a more comedic and lighthearted tone
L4d contains much fewer weapons and special infected, making the game (in my opinion), in general, easier than the second game.

Some game-play differences for l4d2 players
- There is no shove limit or delay in campaign (remains in survival and versus)
- No Jockeys, Chargers, Spitters (Boomers, Smokers, Hunters, tanks and witches all remain)
- The Shotgun and autoshotgun seem much better in terms of range
- The best weapon is either the hunting rifle or auto shotgun (No ak in the game)
- No workshop (so downloading mods/add-ons are harder)
- A few more map glitches that haven't been patched yet

  I originally got this game (alongside with L4D2 in a bundle) because I wanted to try out other games, especially horror.

  The game overall is fantastic and fun - the campaigns themselves are captivating and the ambiance is like horror; like what you see in movies. Obviously, that is the whole point. What I noticed between this and the sequel version is that this one is more onto the stereotypical horror-type yet grim tones throughout the maps while the second game is more comedic and lighthearted.

  I don't think I need to say much more of how much fun this game is, but, for those you only played L4D2, here are some key differences:

[*]There is no shove/push limit
[*]There's only the Boomer, Hunter, Smoker, Witch, and Tank
[*]There are fewer weapons to choose from (ex. best weapon overall is the hunting rifle)
[*]Interestingly, there's a higher chance of a Tank appearing extremely early in the campaign (ex. I started playing [i]No Mercy[/i] and literally the moment I was about to enter the metro station, a Tank spawned [note: I do not mod this version of L4D])
  [*]When looking down, you can see your Survivor legs unlike in the second game in which it is removed (you can still get a Workshop item that brings back this feature)
[*]Noticeably, the game on Easy is a lot more easier in this game then in the second game (I would compare the Easy mode from the second game equivalent to the Normal mode in this game)
[/list]

  Those are just some key points, so, it is notably a lot different in some ways. However, to be honest, I prefer the this game's horror-tone then the second game's brighter tone, but, it is still fun and addictive either way.

  Although the second game has a Workshop, lots more weapons, upgrades, and Special Infected, it is always great to try out the game that built up to that sequel.

  As a side note, I have not personally played Versus nor Co-op in the second game, but, in this game, there's a noticeable lack of toxic players.

  Anyway, just get the game - you will not regret it.",1673019814,1673019883,True,6,0,0.589641034603118896,0,True,False,False

Both L4d and L4d2 are similar in game-play, and a lot of mechanics and items are carried over, however there is still quite a difference between both of these, both in game-play and atmosphere.
In general, L4d has a darker, more grim tone to it, whilst L4d2 has a more comedic and lighthearted tone
L4d contains much fewer weapons and special infected, making the game (in my opinion), in general, easier than the second game.

- There is no shove limit or delay in campaign (remains in survival and versus)
- No Jockeys, Chargers, Spitters (Boomers, Smokers, Hunters, tanks and witches all remain)
- The Shotgun and autoshotgun seem much better in terms of range
- The best weapon is either the hunting rifle or auto shotgun (No ak in the game)
- No workshop (so downloading mods/add-ons are harder)

Although the second game basically also includes this one, so buying this game right now is redundent... However, there are many fun achievements you can do in L4D1 that are unavailable in L4D2. I went into versus blind, since the game is dead I made use of the GROUP SERVERS available that play a Versus campaign on repeat with lazy bots and stuff. I went in as a Smoker and dragged a survivor for over ten minutes and POP, an achievements is unlocked that literally says: ""Drag someone as Smoker for over a distance"". It was very funny! 

Is this game redundent to buy now? Yes! Does it deserve a full on review after I've already reviewed the second game that everyone plays? No, of course not! Does it deserve to be bought? Yes, to show support and maybe hope that L4D3 would come out while you're still alive, to experience (or re-experience) the campaigns that include the OG Bill lol and to hunt for achievements that are, in my opinion, more fun than L4D2's lackluster Bile-requiring achievements that mostly revolve around the worst, in my opinion, special infected EVER: The Spitter.",1672648520,1672648520,True,4,0,0.563802719116210938,0,True,False,False

The original Left 4 Dead still has an decent active player base (despite not being supported by valve anymore), along with unique achievements and game mechanics/details not present in the sequel. I would recommend playing this game over L4D2 if you enjoy slightly more detailed game mechanics, and overall what I believe to be a less toxic player base (especially on Versus)

Overall, after playing and getting 100% on both games in the Left 4 Dead series, Left 4 Dead is better for if you like a more polished and playable experience in the series, while Left 4 Dead 2 is a better choice in terms of the amount of content you get (both games are included in the sequel), and if active valve servers are more important

My son recently downloaded Left 4 Dead and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. We finally beat the main story together and we were ecstatic!

The way the zombies act when they are not hostile to you is impressively detailed. 
They all seem like beings trapped inside themselves, just suffering and attacking anyone in their way if disturbed by light, noise etc.

 Some can be seen leaning, fighting each other, puking or just sitting in a dark corner. Such outstanding detail!

All survivors have their own charm, story and personality to, I like all of them. I find almost impossible to dislike them.

The music is top notch and really gives you an accomplished feeling after each campaign. It also plays an really important part in the gameplay other than ambient, you are basically using the music in your advantage to know by what monstrosity you will be attacked sooner or later. It's really fun to play this game with a friend.

This game is one of the Greats. A fantastic game that brought atmospheric changes in gaming media, as well as setup a new trend in gaming for multiplayer. This game is very responsible for the zombies craze that happened around the time of its release.

I love this game. I HIGHLY recommend it, but DO NOT BUY THIS GAME unless you want to give Valve money. Buy Left 4 Dead 2, it comes with all the content of this game plus it's own content.

So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. My son hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

well.. still.. good to be paranoid with mordern times and trends

anyway. basically Source Game . Just shoot your way throught. The guns don't have this weird ""animation fluidness"" like in mordern games

im going too complicated. Just.. CS..old cs... but zombies.. And chapters. and a survival mode
idk how to play offline tho. I just played single player by basically making a private lobby
I'd rather have the bots that just blocked me in a room for 20mins until  i threw a pipe bomb at them than online..ugh.. people... 
atleast they save me the instant i get grabbed or shoot at shit when im healing and a bunch of zombies rush at me.

..as trend goes tho. It starts good and then idk what happens
but its old game. I trust.

stutters like a bitch tho. guess thats my pc going over 95C and then extreme thermal throttling.. gotta set the Watts to whatever value is below 95. 
also how does none mention this kinda forces you into mutiplayer...
Yea.. It does..

I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join.

Graphics hold up amazingly well, combat feels awesome, characters are likeable, story is basic but awesome so far.

Cons:

Not always clear where to go during a level; I'd often get turned around and forget where I was due to simplistic map design and no real help with direction from the game. It also didn't help that getting to another area sometimes required jumping onto a truck or something, which is strange because normally a truck blocking the path = go the other direction.

Why did I get this even though I played L4D2 knowing that it is far superior from the previous one? more weapons, better visuals, more special infected, mod support, dismemberment, Coach, and even free levels from L4D1. You can even install mutations to remove newer weapons and special infected from L4D2, so why bother getting L4D1 when you can make the second one play like the first? Well, It still plays differently even when you try to replicate it with the mutations. One thing, you can see your legs!

I know I am a decade and half to this widely popular game, so I figured at 99 cents it was time to give it a try. I have only played a little bit in the solo mode, but I can already tell this game would be a great time with bros.

I already knew and loved Bill from the Dead By Daylight video game. I like Bill because he is a 70 year old man that hangs out in dark forests and basements with a bunch of college kids. He also makes the most comical old man scream when he is tossed up on a hook.

My dream is for the final DbD DLC chapter to involve Bill getting an assault rifle DLC and the  game ending by him mowing down every single killer & survivor (sans Meg) like a farmer would use a scythe to flatten a wheat field. 

[h1]PROS[/h1]

-Bill.

-99 cents.

-Feels like a comfy XBOX 360 Era game.

This game is a certified classic.

Every character is on an even playing field, with no perks and no special abilities. Only your skills, your item management, and your teammates are needed to get through a campaign. Characters are memorable and quotable from both L4D1 characters(Bill, Zoey, Francis, and Louis) and L4D2 characters(Coach, Nick, Ellis, and Rochelle).

The gameplay has great reply value. The AI director makes sure each play session is unique. From item spawn of items to horde-infected spawns to the level of difficulty. Your team's performance, skills, and teamwork will truly be tested as you progress through each campaign level.

Community Content(Steam Workshop) is one of the reasons this game still holds up and retains a huge player base. Mods, Map campaign, and Enhancements.

I remember after school or over the weekend me and da BOiz would do a ""LAN party"" where we reset all achievements and go through all campaigns ranking up the best scores, awesome kills, and funny moments.

This game let me meet friends that I say in touch with to this day... so many good times.

Until now still playing and meeting new people on this game.. every game session is a new experience can't get enough of it.

Allow me to explain why. All of the content from this game, all levels and characters etc, are part of Left 4 Dead 2 by default. This means buying this one is redundant. Just save the money and buy the sequel so you can play them both at the same time plus have the added benefit of the new monsters you get to fight from the sequel.

~~~~~~~~~
2019 EDIT:
After countless people explaining the differences between the games, do yourself a favor and research these two great titles. I am sure there is a video out there showcasing how they are different. I personally feel that this game is redundant however many disagree and would rather play the original content on the original game only, not on Left 4 Dead 2. You should figure out which is best for you before buying.

With that being said, keep in mind these games are getting old and frequently go on sale for dirt cheap prices. I think you can sometimes even get both Left 4 Dead titles for about $5 total which is worth it. Then you can install and play both and decide for yourself. All that matters is that they get played because they are terrific and shouldn't be forgotten.
~~~~~~~~~

Review:
As for the game itself, I highly recommend this title. This is teamwork at its best. You literally can't get through this game by yourself. Sure, you can play single player mode just fine since the AI is decent but I mean you can't play ALONE as the game will inevitably put you into certain scenarios where you will get pinned down and die without someone there to save you. So either another player or an AI will have to help you up or it's game over.

The gunplay is fast and furious. The zombies are fast and attack in hordes so you can't really survive long by standing in one place.

There isn't too much story but with this type of game you really don't need story. Just fight your way from one obstacle to the next until you finish the game. Terrific good time.",1665596871,1665596871,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game provides different game modes which offers plenty of zombie killing fun and teamwork.

In case you want to buy this game: I would recommend to buy part 2 since that game has a more active online community and contains most of the content of L4D1 as well.

Cock and ball torture (CBT) is a sexual activity involving application of pain or constriction to the male genitals. This may involve directly painful activities, such as genital piercing, wax play, genital spanking, squeezing, ball-busting, genital flogging, urethral play, tickle torture, erotic electrostimulation or even kicking. The recipient of such activities may receive direct physical pleasure via masochism, or knowledge that the play is pleasing to a sadistic dominant.

Contents: Section 1: In Pornography Section 2: Ball stretcher Section 3: Parachute Section 4: Humbler Section 5: Testicle cuff

Section 1: In pornography

In addition to it’s occasional role in BDSM pornography, Tamakeri (literally Ball kicking) is a separate genre in Japan. One notable actress in tamakeri is Erika Nagai who typically uses her martial arts skills to knee or kick men in the testicles.

Section 2: Ball stretcher A ball stretcher is a sex toy that is fastened around a man in order to elongate the scrotum and provide a feeling of weight pulling the testicles away from the body. While leather stretchers are most common, other models are made of steel rings that are fastened with screws causing additional mildly uncomfortable weight to the wearer. The length of the stretcher may vary from 1-4 inches, and the steel models can weigh as much as five pounds.

Section 3: Parachute

A Parachute is a small collar, usually made from leather, which fastens around the scrotum, and from which weights can be hung. Conical in shape, three or four short chains hanging beneath, to which weights can be attached. Used as part of cock and ball torture within a BDSM relationship, the parachute provides a constant drag, and squeezing effects on the man’s testicles. Moderate weights of 3-5 kg can be suspended, especially during bondage. Smaller weights can be used when the man is free to move, when the swinging effect of the weight can restrict sudden movements, as well as providing a visual stimulus for the dominant partner.

Section 4: Humbler

A humbler is a BDSM physical restraint device used to restrict the movement of a submissive male participant in a BDSM scene. The humbler consists of a testicle cuff device which clamps around the base of the scrotum, mounted in the center of a bar that passes behind the thighs at the base of the buttocks. This forces the wearer to keep his legs forward, as any attempt to to straighten the legs slightly pulls directly on the scrotum, causing from considerable discomfort to extreme pain.

Section 5: Testicle cuff

A testicle cuff is a ring-shaped device around the scrotum between the body and the testicles which when closed does not allow the testicles to slide through it. A common type has two connected cuffs, one around the scrotum and the other around the base of the penis. They are just one of many devices to restrain the male genitalia. A standard padlock may also be locked around the scrotum; without the key it cannot be removed.

Some passive men enjoy the feeling of being ""owned"", while dominant individuals enjoy the sense of ""owning"" their partners. Requiring such a man wear testicle cuffs symbolizes that his sexual organs belong to his partner, who may be either male or female. There is a level of humiliation involved, by which they find sexual arousal. The cuffs may even form part of a sexual fetish of the wearer or his partner.

However, these are extreme uses of testicle cuffs. More conventionally, the device pulls down the testicles and keeps them there during stimulation, which has a number of benefits:

Making the penis appear longer. Pulling the testicles down and away from the base of the penis stretches the skin over the base of the penis and pubic bone, exposing the additional inch or so of penile shaft that is normally hidden from view. Improving sexual arousal. While some men may be aroused by the feeling of being ""owned"", the physical feeling of stretching the ligaments that suspend the testicles has an effect similar to the more common practice of stretching one's legs and pointing the toes. Preventing the testicles from lifting up so far that they become lodged under the skin immediately adjacent to the base of the penis, a condition which can be very uncomfortable, especially if the testicle is then squashed by the slap of skin during thrusting in sexual intercourse. Delaying or intensifying ejaculation by preventing the testicles from rising normally to the ""point of no return"". It is much harder to reach an orgasm... Yes.



From a shape language theory perspective, cocks are more attractive. They have a natural curve, a natural line of motion, and the cock head has naturally contrasting shapes, the shaft being a curved rectangle and the head being more triangular. The roundness of boobs communicates cuteness or comfortablility whereas the penis has a square and triangle shape, which communicates trustability but the triangle presents an edge, so perhaps the penis is not all it seems, which interests people.

Of course that's entirely from a purely shape language theory perspective.

left 4 dead is a 2008 4-player co-op FPS game developed and published by Valve.

The first adaptive AI game to be named ""Director"". Thanks to him, the game always floods the map with crowds of Zombies so that the players do not get bored, and also maintains a balance between the pace of the game and the difficulty.
In addition to the classic zombies - the player can meet ""mutated"" ones. Zombies that differ in both their appearance and attacks / amount of life. And no - these are not bosses, but ordinary opponents that prevent you from reaching the shelter.
Due to the structure similar to Half Life, the game quickly received a lot of modifications - which diversified the game in many aspects.
The game is recommended for purchase and play in the company of friends. And still ready to give you a few hours of challenging but fun action.",1662793920,1662793920,True,12,1,0.645185589790344238,0,True,False,False

In my opinion I prefer it over its sequel, despite having fewer features. This game has a specific atmosphere that I think L4D2 lacks and I also prefer the campaigns in this one compared to L4D2. 

The game is a little wonky on Steam Deck, but definitely playable. Just be prepared to have to tweak resolution and other graphics settings a bit. Also remember to enable gamepad support in L4D's settings menu. If you don't, your Steam Deck will not function like a gamepad even if you have the correct controller scheme set up in SteamOS. I don't have a lot of experience with PC games and all their settings so it took me a minute to figure that out. Hope it helps someone else!

If you like the mechanics of the first game better, you can restore them using Mutations or Steam Workshop mods. Everything L4D can do, the sequel can do better.

The only reason to play the original Left 4 Dead now would be for achievement hunting or nostalgia value. I cannot recommend buying it except at a very low price on sale, and that's only if you are really curious about it. Buy Left 4 Dead 2 instead for the best way to experience the gameplay.

If you don't feel like modding L4D2 to be more like L4D1 (which is possible), then give this a try.  
It's pretty nostalgic, too.

Also, I'd like to take some time to give praise to something that we often take for granted. 

Most game companies will often delist games on digital stores when they decide to release an updated version, like a remake or a remaster or something. 
This is a scummy, anti-consumer practice. 

Valve, however, knows full-well that Left 4 Dead 2 existing basically makes Left 4 Dead 1 irrelevant and obsolete for the most part. Especially considering everything from L4D1, even right down to it's PLOT, is in L4D2.
And yet they still insist on keeping L4D1 on Steam.  

Just in case oldies like me decide they wanna go back for nostalgia or for some other reason (which I did once.)
They allow us to have options even if most people won't choose it, and I find that to be commendable and an example that every other video game company should follow.",1575171759,1659062688,True,0,0,0.49352380633354187,0,True,False,False

+ transparency of campaigns.
+ simple control.
+ character behavior.
+ weapon control and behavior.
+ no unnecessary side quests.
+ variety and randomness of infected and special infected, including horde attacks.
+ graphic design.

- occasional hitboxes and ""lethality"" of special infected (a hit to the head of a witch with a sniper rifle from close range did not cause death - unrealistic, a hit to the head of a hunter from close range with a shotgun while jumping did not cause death - unrealistic - he jumped and knocked the character to the ground).
- the behavior of the UI characters in some parts of the campaign (mostly the final stage) when the main character uses the machine gun, they do not cover the machine gun but run away.
- do not react to the presence of a special infected (Tank) until it is in line of sight.
- occasional unnecessary shooting at the infected which attracts the attention of others or hordes. It's an unnecessary delay when trying to speedrun.",1658919469,1659052433,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Considering this game was made back in 2008 it surprises
me with it's unique shadow map design and amazing in-game music
that intensifies the horror element of the game. Everything
about left 4 dead feels perfect and unique in every little detail.
From zombies that have different face expressions when they are
attacking survivors to having amazing voice-lines that make
every character alive and fit into the atmosphere of the game.
The game comes with 4 different game modes to choose from -
Single Player, Campaign, Versus and Survival. In short - you
can play this game by yourself, with friends, Online
(Special Infected vs Humans) and Team survival mode that let's
you survive wave after wave of zombies until your squad gets 
knocked out. For me personally the best game mode is campaign.
There is nothing more satisfying than killing zombies with your friends after a long day.

While it might seem a bit simple in terms of variety compared to some modern co-op games, it still holds pretty well and can provide a decent amount of entertainment.

For those who dont know, you are a group of survivors trying to navigate the zombie apocalypse in order to survive. There are 4 people, either players or NPCs, that need to get from one point to another, picking up whatever weaponry can help them along the way. Story is limited, but pleasant. Enemies can be quite challenging depending on the difficulty. 

Good stuff, go for it.

My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

Ingredients
150g salted butter, softened
80g light brown muscovado sugar
80g granulated sugar
2 tsp vanilla extract
1 large egg
225g plain flour
½ tsp bicarbonate of soda
¼ tsp salt
200g plain chocolate chips or chunks
Method
STEP 1
Heat the oven to 190C/fan170C/gas 5 and line two baking sheets with non-stick baking paper.

STEP 2
Put 150g softened salted butter, 80g light brown muscovado sugar and 80g granulated sugar into a bowl and beat until creamy.

STEP 3
Beat in 2 tsp vanilla extract and 1 large egg.

STEP 4
Sift 225g plain flour, ½ tsp bicarbonate of soda and ¼ tsp salt into the bowl and mix it in with a wooden spoon.

STEP 5
Add 200g plain chocolate chips or chunks and stir well.

STEP 6
Use a teaspoon to make small scoops of the mixture, spacing them well apart on the baking trays. This mixture should make about 30 cookies.

STEP 7
Bake for 8–10 mins until they are light brown on the edges and still slightly soft in the centre if you press them.

STEP 8
Leave on the tray for a couple of mins to set and then lift onto a cooling rack.

RECIPE TIPS
FREEZING THE BISCUITS
If you’ve frozen the biscuits, take them out and arrange them on a lined baking sheet. Once defrosted, pop them in a medium oven 190C/170 fan/gas mark 5 and heat for 2-3 mins to crisp up. Don’t leave them too long or they’ll dry out.
STORING DOUGH
You can keep the uncooked dough in a sealed container in the fridge for up to two weeks. Simply take some out, dollop on a lined baking tray and allow to come up to room temperature for 5 mins before baking",1657099959,1657099959,True,145,23,0.849982202053070068,1,True,False,False

     So to get this out of the way first, most people ask, ""What's the point of getting Left 4 Dead if everything is on Left 4 Dead 2?"". If you're also asking yourself that, you probably won't need to care for this game. 
     What makes this game so good for me is it's much more minimal, has a more grittier/film artstyle. The sequel loses that artstyle and simplicity even with all the different effects used and cleaner and more compressed world textures. Sure, you can get Left 4 Dead 2 looking pretty close to Left 4 Dead 1, but it still won't look and feel exactly the same.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
     The gameplay is absolutely flawless in this game! Everything is very smooth; and since the game uses a thing they call the ""AI Director"" each time you play a map the enemies will be in different locations. Making it enjoyable for a long time! I've been playing this game since 2009 when it came out and I have yet to be bored of this game unlike the second one.

[h1]Player Base[/h1]
     There aren't much people playing this game anymore sadly, since everyone has moved to Left 4 Dead 2. But the people who do have this game are usually very fun to play with. You do have your ""occasional"" child gamer or troll, but other than that most players are mature and fun to play with as stated before. Versus is usually dead while 'Survival' and 'Campaigns' usually always have at least a few servers joinable.

[h1]Story[/h1]
     The story is very minimal to keep gameplay more replayable. A lot of more story-based lines were cut, and maps reworked to have less of a story in-game (and instead focused on the safe rooms for people to read while waiting for others to get ready) because of this decision. But the 'story' that is there, is pretty decent and plays out a lot like an action horror movie. Which was what Valve was ultimately going for.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
     Overall if you're looking to kill some zombies, have a few laughs, and have a good time with friends - I HIGHLY recommend this game. If you want a bit more, guns, special infected, and game modes than try out Left 4 Dead 2. I highly recommend this game and give it a solid 9.5!

Com uma proposta rápida, frenética onde o jogo te obriga a estar em movimento a todo momento, o núcleo da gameplay do primeiro jogo da franquia ainda é extremamente divertido, com um grande fator replay. A franquia ainda é amada principalmente por seu carisma, contendo personagens carismáticos, engraçados, e que, apesar de longe não parecer, suas personalidades combinam e complementam uma a outra. 

A jogabilidade é simples, rápida e intuitiva. Também lhe incentivando a estar em movimento não importa o que aconteça. Está com pouca vida? Cure-se que o seu time pode te dar cobertura com a horda de zumbis indo em sua direção. Precisa carregar sua arma? O jogo não deixa o jogador completamente indefeso, com uma habilidade de empurrar inimigos enquanto recarrega, fazendo com que você nunca pare de lutar.

O level design do jogo é impecável, com campanhas divididas em 4 partes curtas, cada uma com o seu tema e momentos de destaque. Isso influencia um papel gigante no fator replay do jogo, já que nenhuma jogatina parece a mesma, especialmente em níveis de dificuldade maiores, onde o jogo puxa seus limites de quantos zumbis você aguenta de uma vez só.

O design do som é impecável. Com sons distintos que permitem o jogador saber que perigo pode estar por perto, enquanto fornece um ar sombrio e de terror.

Os únicos pontos em que o jogo deixa a desejar será superado em seu sucessor, Left 4 Dead 2, especialmente a variedade de itens, zumbis (incluindo os especiais), mapas, e armas.",1655167701,1655167776,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.",1609195201,1653956373,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

I know it looks like I barely played this from my playtime, but uh, sorry don't yell at me but I used to have a steam account before this one. It was my first game! I barely knew what steam was, it was just the only shooty game that my laptop at the time could handle. I fell in love with the game pretty much instantly! and it's crazy how easy it is to just dust it up and play it even nowadays!! They did such a good job with the environments and characters as well as just the solid ass gameplay. I like that I can be the mom of a team and just constantly keep an eye on their booboos and remind them to bring their coats with them out of the saferoom.

So I hear there's a lot of debate on this one versus the second one. I kind of gravitate to the second one because I can play the same campaigns with more stuff in it! the new additions definitively vibe with me a little more, I'll never get sick of jockeys they're hilarious! My adhd brain appreciates the bigger variety in terms of items and guns and stuff because I can just keep switching all the time  and never really get bored of any of em, plus adrenaline makes me go super fast and that is funny but it doesn't make a lot of sense if you want players to stick together. I like the first one over the second one in terms of consistency and presentation; I think l4d thrives in its simplicity and consistency, the second game just sort of has a bunch of things that felt a little out of place or at inconsistent levels of quality. Don't they have cs source weapons in it now? They look so weirdly animated in comparison! 

Anyway, game good. Thanks for reading!",1652858218,1652858218,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

500,74982485,76561198431198110,324,36,5698,0,4670,1696567834,"Left 4 Dead is an absolutely outstanding and fun game even to this day, especially with tons of friends. The basic premise is that you are a team of 4 survivors left in a world where most people are zombies and you have to go through each campaign from start to finish without dying all the while being hunted by the zombie horde and special infected.

The game plays like your typical Source engine shooter so if you've played one then the learning curve here won't be that difficult, but this game feels so satisfying as each gun really has a distinct feeling of impact and control to it that other games don't. Each of the 6 guns all are good in their own ways and can be deadly in the hands of a great player. You have The Pump Shotgun, The Uzi SMG, The M16 Assault Rifle, The Hunting Rifle as well as The Auto Shotgun and your Pistol Side Arm.

The game looks really good for 2008 as it has some really nice lighting effects and models for the time. It also is very well optimized and will run on pretty much anything, even a potato could run this well.

I also think the campaigns themselves are all very good and each feel distinct and different enough and are fun to play through over and over again, especially in Versus mode.

Speaking of I feel I should mention the modes available in the game. You have your standard Campaign mode where up to 4 players play through a campaign and try to survive till the end, There is Versus mode where 8 players face off in a 4 vs 4 battle in a campaign where 4 players play as the Special Infected and the Tank and the other 4 play as the survivors and the 2 teams trade roles back and forth to see who gets the furthest in the campaign and the team with the highest score at the end wins. The other mode is Survival which involves up to 4 players playing as the Survivors in a small map and trying to last for as long as they can before they are overwhelmed, it may seem simple but it gets chaotic really fast.

I feel I should mention the Special Infected as well, There exist 5 types of special infected in Left 4 Dead, they are as such

The Boomer: A big fat Zombie that is slow and very weak but if he vomits on you or blows up on you then he will cover you in Bile which will attract hordes to you as well as cover your screen.

The Smoker: This guy will grab you from a distance with his Tongue and drag you to him where he will start hammering away at you or he'll hang you from a high place, the only way to escape is to either shoot him before he drags you or a teammate will have to help.

The Hunter: This guy can move pretty fast and is small, but he can leap onto a survivor and pin them down and constantly slash away at you, the only way to get him off is for another player to smack him off or shoot him.

The Tank: The Tank is like a boss basically and only shows up once or twice per chapter depending on the campaign, he takes a big beating and he deals out a lot of damage by punching you or throwing rocks at the player. He also can smack cars and other objects into a survivor for an instant knockdown, so watch out.

The Witch: The Witch is a stationary infected that sits and cries and if she is awakened or startled by a survivor such as shining a flashlight on her or getting to close, she'll get up and charge at that survivor and instantly knock them down if she lands a hit and will continue to slash away. It's best to stay away from her


I also really love the horror atmosphere of this game as it really nails it's tone so well and the characters are fantastic and all have unique personalities, backstories and bounce off each other well and are entertaining.

Overall this game is really a classic and you absolutely should play it, I also would highly recommend playing it over Left 4 Dead 2 as this game is a much better experience.

I would give this game a solid 9/10",1598496238,1652242526,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1][b]🎮Overview: [/b][/h1]
Everyone loves slaughtering zombies. If you’re tired of playing all the competitive games out there, this might be the best alternative to have some fun with friends! Left 4 Dead is pretty much a valve classic, do not let the 2008 release date of the game deceive you. I’ve played a lot of newer games which basically have better visuals and have the same gameplay as L4D, but no game can match the level of fun the original L4D provides!  

[h1][b]🎮Storyline: [/b][/h1]
So there is a story in the game, but it isn't a full-fledged tale. It's more like a zombie apocalypse film, where the survivors are just trying to get out of town. Because there's no knowledge on how the apocalypse began or anything, the story's primary purpose is to establish the game's goal: to survive. Oh, and I almost forgot the most important part: it's not just one film; there are a total of six to choose from.

[h1][b]🎮Gameplay Mechanics:[/b][/h1]
At some point in your life, you've undoubtedly imagined what a zombie apocalypse might look like. Now you can have a glimpse of it. In six separate campaigns set in different locations, the game depicts the struggles of four characters. The gameplay is straightforward. All you have to do is shoot zombies. Isn't this sufficient? Anyway, the combat might become repetitive, since the weaponry and zombies shown in the first hour are also seen in the following hours. But, given that it’s 14 years old, I had a pretty good guess. Personally, I didn't find it to be repetitive, and I enjoyed every second of slaying zombies. However, depending on how much you enjoy smashing zombie skulls, it may get repetitive for others.

So, you're tossed into a random area and given some guns and medical supplies. All that remains is for you to leave the safehouse and slay zombies until you reach the next one. Of course, there are tougher zombies who are difficult to kill, as well as bizarre zombies that make terrifying noises. The following is a list of all the zombies found in the game:

[b]Common Infected:[/b] Does this need an explanation?

[b]Hunter zombies: [/b] Extremely quick zombies with the ability to leap enormous distances. If it pins you down, you're doomed unless your friends come to your rescue.

[b]Boomer:[/b] If these fat zombies spit on you, they will attract a horde of zombies. As soon as you notice them, shoot them in the stomach, and they'll die with a massive explosion.

[b]Smoker:[/b] It may pin you down by wrapping its tongue around your neck. If you're pinned, you'll need friends to save you; else, you'll have to start over.

[b]Witch:[/b] Probably the most terrifying zombie I've ever seen in a zombie game. It won't attack you until you approach it, so stay away from it.

[b]Trunk:[/b] You can call it the mini boss. It has a lot of HP and it can even send you flying. 2-3 direct hits and you are dead.

That is all there is to it. The best thing is that you'll almost certainly run into them all within the first hour of playing. There's no doubting that it's one of the finest games ever produced, and the fact that it's still working like a charm a decade later proves it.

[b][h1]Modes: [/h1][/b]
L4D has two extra modes: Versus and Survival, in addition to a campaign that may be played with up to three additional people. The versus mode is quite similar to the campaign, with the exception that it may be played with up to 8 people instead of four. The special zombies indicated above can be controlled by half of the players (any except the common infected and the trunk). The infected must prevent the survivors from rescuing themselves, as you may have predicted. Then there's the role reversal, when the infected transform into survivors and vice versa. You are given points based on your performance in the game, and the team with the most points wins. In the other mode, you can confront unlimited waves of zombies and try to survive as long as possible. Valve has blessed us by allowing us to create dedicated servers for playing with friends. However, if you want to join online lobbies, the game's playerbase is virtually non-existent. So, unless you have friends to play with, you won't be able to access these modes.

[h1][b]📷Visuals and Audio:[/b][/h1]
The game's audio component is incredible. The audio will only add to the enjoyment, whether it's the distinct noises of specific infected or the nerve-wracking music. I'm not going to lie: the witch sounds TERRIFYING. If you don't believe me, go to YouTube and look up ""witch noises Left 4 Dead"" and listen for yourself. The game's theme is somewhat gloomy, as it is a horror game. It is able to portray a dismal world that has been overrun by zombies. Because the game is so old, the graphics are a little archaic, but it's not anything that will make your eyes bleed.

[h1][b]📝Main Pros and Cons:[/b][/h1]
[b]Pros-[/b]
[list]
    [*]Co-op play available.
    [*]Amazing sound design.
    [*]Versus and Survival modes available. 
    [*]The gameplay is pretty fun and slaughtering zombies is a nice thing to do.
    [*]Can run on most rigs flawlessly.
[/list]

[b]Cons-[/b]
[list]
    [*]Visually outdated.
    [*]Online servers are dead.
    [*]Might get repetitive after a bit.
 [/list]

[h1][b]✉️Miscellaneous Information:[/b][/h1]
[b]Left 4 Dead 2 – [/b]L4D2 includes all the campaigns of L4D and also has additional content including the steam workshop support. If you are planning to purchase L4D, just buy the second part instead. 

[h1][b]😇Honest Rating:[/b][/h1]
The game is well-worth your money if you have friends to play with. I would recommend buying Left 4 Dead 2 instead, as it contains every campaign from Left 4 Dead. For other people who like the original versions of games or just want some nostalgia, I would recommend grabbing it on a sale! (You can also buy the Left 4 Dead bundle which includes both the games.)

     - Gameplay: 8/10, zombie shooter with annoying bot.
     - Story : - the game isn't story based, but you could listen their interaction, that's realy fun!
     - Visuals : 8.5/10, the visuals is quite enjoyable for an old game.
     - Sound : 8/10, the sound fits the situation very well.
""I recommend this game even if you guys play it in 2030! Remain the best co-op zombie shooter game of its time and today (together with L4D2). I hope game development pays attention to the existing issues (which aren't really many, not too few) including global server issues. Going on, I'd like to see this game have a remastered version XD.""

I was even playing No Mercy and at one point in the subway section I was next to a water pipe and you could hear the water pressure inside. I literally found about this recently and I couldn't believe they would have added such a small detail for a 2008 game. Just goes to show that games like this one are not made anymore.

Comment:
Even if this game is 13 years old it still has really good graphics. The gameplay is a story where you need to complete a bunch of ""waves"", you gonna need to kill the zombies that are around the map until you reach the safe zone, you gotta do this over and over again until the end of the story. At first, it may be fun doing these, but after a little bit, it gets really boring cause you always do the same thing over and over, kill zombies, reach the safe zone, kill zombies, reach the safe zone. The multiplayer is kinda dead, there's almost no one playing on the multiplayer. But this game can run on any low-end system, of course with low settings, and it can get to 60 fps stable. I would recommend buying this in the bundle of the Game Of The Year edition cause it cost half of the price combined with 2 games.

Most custom campaigns made for the first are unobtainable unless you go outside of the Steam Workshop, and download them manually. 

Modders already made these type of mods for Left 4 Dead 2: 
- You can see below your torso
- Beta levels including beta survivors, beta weapons, and how dark it is. 
- There's a mutation called ""L4D1 Coop"" that removes newer special infected, keeps L4D1 styled infected, and exactly plays as how the first game should
- Infinite melee bashing
- Color corrections for all levels
- Beta sounds and L4D1 styled sounds
- L4D1-styled HUD including splash screens

About 12 years ago (going back from 2022), I was visiting a second-hand shop when I stumbled upon a selection of 4 console titles. They were pretty cheap, so I bought the two most interesting ones. Left 4 Dead being one of them. Outside of a couple minute long test run, the game would continue to sit on the shelf for a couple months before I'd actually take a proper crack at it.

After I finished my first playthrough of No Mercy, I was hooked. Spent hours upon hours playing the game. Some time later, when I finally got a proper game-capable PC, I knew I had to get this game. To this day I still play it every now and then.

Intro perfectly captures the atmosphere and introduces the four characters, and the whole game looks like an old school zombie movie. Apart from you and the three unknown people, there is no one to help you with the hordes of infected human debris, which evokes quite depressing feelings.

Almost every level starts behind closed doors. These shelters contain ammunition, sometimes first aid kits and, in the later stages of the campaign, better weapons. Until you leave this room, you are completely safe. If any infections are visible through the small window in the door, it's a good idea to fire them from here before you start exploring the area. After a few steps outside, hell begins. Crowds of the infected begin to sprint from all sides and the main weapon flies one bullet after another. From the very beginning, the issue of life and death has been the close cooperation between all four characters. The design of the game places great emphasis on the fact that once someone walks away a little, they are in great danger. When the first horde hits him, the player himself still has a chance if he climbs into a dead end or behind a door and a furious crowd attacks him from only one direction.
When you run away from the slime, which will make you vomit and stick out your tongue, you are trying to survive in this B-movie zombie apocalypse.

I was not interested in the game, but I give a positive rating, because it is the predecessor of games like Dying Light, and thus I show support for this genre. [b] 10% [/b]",1646846801,1646846801,True,17,0,0.630321502685546875,1,True,False,False

It's impressive to me how such a simple idea, which was to take the Source engine and build a survival-horror-FPS game on top of it, managed to be so unique and done in such a charming way. This cast of characters, though not my favorite compared to its sequel, is a blast to listen to banter, and experiencing their dialogue and their story is in part what makes the game worth it to me.

However, I have to admit that everything this game did was done better by its sequel. This game is worth playing, don't get me wrong, but I think the best way to experience Left 4 Dead is to play Left 4 Dead 2.",1645525574,1645525574,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It has all of the maps, weapons and characters of the first game. Hell, it even has a Left4Dead1 mode.” This is a completely fair series of questions, but before those questions are answered it should be made clear that this review is encouraging the buying of both games. The Left4Dead games are the best games in their genre and obscenely cheap (1 USD each) during Steam sales. These games are different and it is more than just Left4Dead2 having more stuff and players. 

The campaigns for both Left4Dead games play fundamentally differently from each other and this comes down to a series of minor changes that quickly add up. The campaign of Left4Dead1 generally rewards being cautious and finding safe spots because of its lack of melee weapons and additional reload animations. Changes that further establish this include horde events not being endless, bile not being in the game, and more special infected being boomers. Tanks finish off survivors instead of trying to incapacitate the whole team unless shoved multiple times by a players and maps have more enclosed spaces that cannot be disrupted because the game does not have Spitters or Jockeys. Left4Dead1 can be fairly described as a game of shooting and shoving while backed against a wall but that can be enjoyable in its own way. Its limitations force survivors to work together and be cautious. The Left4Dead1 mode in Left4Dead2 does not address all of these changes and often has no players. 

Left4Dead1 Versus places more emphasis on the common infected by having the only special infected be the Boomer, Smoker and Hunter. This makes versus more focused and not just a game about who can best use the Charger to instakill players. Left4Dead1 Versus games see less rage quits as they are less of a game of chance and more of a team game. Left4Dead1 has a better versus mode as it only has the special infected that rely on the support of the common infected to do damage and distract players. 

The two Left4Dead games play completely differently, but both are good for different reasons. Left4Dead2 is a fast paced action game that often demands that the survivors are always moving and often out in the open. Meanwhile, Left4Dead1 is a better horror-survival game that rewards survivors for being slow and cautious. This gameplay difference is intentional as the aesthetic of both games match their gameplay.   Left4Dead1 takes itself more seriously and has a much darker tone. Textures are darker on all maps, and the game has a less “cartoony” aesthetic. Left4Dead2 has silly sounding infected, more upbeat music,silly scenarios and silly weapons. This aesthetic different also manifests in the trailers of both games. Left4Dead1 and Left4Dead2 excel at what they do and you should get both.",1644017975,1644017975,True,102,0,0.896680176258087158,2,True,False,False
