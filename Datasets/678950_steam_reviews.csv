How is the game?: 
-If you are a DBZ fan or hell a fan of any Dragon Ball in the slightest pick this up. While this does have Bamco's annoying DLC practices attached it is a super well made 2D fighter. Arc Sys really nailed down their 2D aesthetic. 
-The game is super fun and offers a casual experience on the surface making it a nice casual game for winding down. On the flipside if you dig into the nuts and bolts you will be rewarded with an excellent fighter that can be played competitively. 
-The game offers combo trials for each character allowing you to get a taste of what each character can do before worrying about assists. This is a 3v3 fighter meaning you can do some really cool assists and tags which adds another layer of sauce to the mix. 
-The game does not require a supercomputer to play so if you could totally run this on a lower spec gaming laptop and bring it to a friends house. 
-Story mode is not super great. It is not really done very well and the writing feels super stilted and you will probably want to skip cutscenes which is generous as it really is character models standing and talking. But if you are bored and want to learn some of the games basics it is there to chew on. Just don't expect a Martin Scorsese cinematic classic. Is it worse than SFV's? Very debatable.

The Netcode and online:
-Well there was a rollback beta for the PC version (which you are likely thinking about picking up if you are reading this on Steam) but it has since vanished so we return to really annoying delay based netcode. Which is great if you can find ranked matches with reliable connections but don't hold your breath. You won't. Rollback is coming and it is a thing but it just is not here and I hope the player count can come back up a bit when it is implemented. It really is annoying that some of these excellent fighters have to be held back due to poor netcode and delay based implementation. 

DLC and Stuff: 
-Yeah the DLC is kind of overpriced. I would recommend getting one of the more expensive editions if it is on sale but with packs vs individual characters I would do the math and do what is best for your wallet. That is all I really have to say on that lol.

TLDR: 
-Game good, buy on sale if you can, price out the DLC with what you want or if you want it all it is there. Story is mid to terrible but there instead of not there. Mechanically fun but the netcode is pretty ass so get used to the occasional 8-10 frame delay. If you are lucky you will only have to deal with 2 frames of delay. In my opinion it is worth a buy even off sale but due to the negatives I am not sure I would recommend that. If you are a fan of the franchise you will find a super well made fighter to enjoy.

Esse é o único jogo de dragon ball que realmente é um fighter competitivo com diversas mecânicas ofensivas e defensivas, bom balanceamento, um roster extremamente variado que com certeza possuirá personagens para seu estilo de jogo e vai ter rollback futuramente (melhor forma de conexão para jogos de luta onde você geralmente joga sem lag/ sem problema algum de input delay).

Dragon Ball Fighterz é um anime fighter/versus game 3x3 com movimentação frenética, golpes com grandes hitbox e combos gigantescos, se você já jogou games como marvel vs capcom ou skullgirls você tem uma ideia inicial de onde está se metendo, apesar desse jogo possuir diversas diferenças e novas mecânicas que tornam ele um game bem diferente e único se comparado aos citados.

Para os fãs de jogos de luta competitivo, esse jogo é um prato cheio com personagens dos mais diversos arquétipos (apesar de todos também meio que serem rushdown pela ideia de alta velocidade do game), alta complexidade envolvendo muita estratégia e decisões, alto nível de execução de combos, pensamento na estrutura dos times, mixups insanos e grande espaço para ""player expression"", recompensando os melhores jogadores ao contrário de jogos de luta mais casuais. Futuramente ele receberá rollback netcode que muito provavelmente vai atrair ainda mais player para o online e ""revivê-lo"" . Por ser um jogo da Arc você encontrará um vasto conteúdo online para aprender o jogo como páginas no dustloops, guias no youtube e servers no discord.

Para os fãs de dragon ball, é incrível o sentimento de batalha igualzinho ao anime que esse jogo passa, com movimentos extremamente rápidos, lutas no ar, explosões para todo lado, mudança de cenário durante a luta (incluindo uma explosão que pode ser tão forte que destrói o cenário inteiro), golpes exageradíssimos e poderosos, contendo todos os principais personagens mais amados da franquia, com eles sendo retratados com perfeição em sua gameplay, além do jogo possuir um estilo gráfico e de animação incrível que só a arc consegue executar, replicando muito bem o visual do anime, não sendo como outros jogos de dragon ball que os personagens são claramente um modelo 3D totalmente diferente dos animes.

Para os fãs mais casuais de jogos de luta, não se assuste com o fato desse game ser um jogo de luta competitivo, pois ele possui diversas mecânicas que te auxiliam a aprender o básico do jogo e se divertir mesmo sendo ruim nesse gênero de fighter como auto-combo e um padrão nos motion input de especiais e supers, sendo a grande maioria (ou até mesmo todos? não lembro) um comando de 236 (famoso meia lua) ou 214 (famoso meia lua pra trás) + algum botão. Contra quem realmente sabe jogar o game em nível competitivo essas mecânicas novas não vão te carregar e você será completamente amassado, mas para jogar de forma casual com amigos eles são mais do que o suficiente para lhe proporcionar muita diversão e um sentimento de ""sou f*da, me sinto um pro player, olha esses combos que consigo fazer no game"" enquanto você só está spammando um monte de botão e terminando a sequencia em alguns supers.


Recomendo demais esse jogo tanto para o publico competitivo quanto o público causal de jogos de luta, é um dos melhores jogos de luta modernos e o melhor dragon ball até o momento. De preferência pegue a Ultimate Edition para ter todos os personagens.

Vou deixar aqui um vídeo que fala sobre a animação espetacular desse game e algumas técnicas que a Arc utiliza pra recriar esse visual e sentimento de anime 2D mesmo sendo um jogo 3D: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZsboyfs-L4",1629284360,1707670470,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

EDIT: Honestly, I don't think rollback is gonna fix this issue, as well.

Positives:
-The game looks stunning especially during the dramatic finishes and for the super moves.

-The roster is pretty big and I believe that they did a good job with their selections (I would've liked kid Gohan or Raditz)

-This is a good example of an easy to pick up but difficult to master game, especially in my first few months of playing I saw great improvements in my skill from both watching others play and simply messing around

-Incredibly fun if you have friends to play with who are also good at the game (but I guess that can be said about any multiplayer game)

Cons:
-Auto-Combos make the game feel too accessible, its very easy to just spam light attacks and pray you win

-The story mode is pretty boring, by the final arc (which is even more boring than the previous 2) I had already turned my brain off and just auto-piloted myself through. This is even more annoying when it is necessary to do story mode if you want to play as android 21

-Besides online and monthly boss events there isn't much to do after beating all classic mode maps and beating story mode

-A lot of the DLC characters are pay-2-win mostly the fusions, Z Broly and lab coat 21, this makes online unbearable when almost all teams have atleast 1 of them.",1707077549,1707077549,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After the success of the Xenoverse series, it’s time to introduce a new classic 2D DRAGON BALL fighting game for this generation’s consoles. DRAGON BALL FighterZ is born from what makes the DRAGON BALL series so loved and famous: endless spectacular fights with its all powerful fighters. Partnering with Arc System Works, DRAGON BALL FighterZ maximizes high end Anime graphics and brings easy to learn but difficult to master fighting gameplay to audiences worldwide.

        [td]💾Graphics[/td]
        [td]I absolutely love the artstyle! It’s so sharp and the cell shading is next level. The special effects are intense and the ultimate ability cutscenes look so similar to the DBZ and DBS show. Amazing attention to detail overall! Animations are just insane as well. The developers really took notes from the shows, and they did just a perfect job with it. Definitely the best looking DBZ game out there (in my opinion).[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎮Gameplay[/td]
        [td]Gameplay is just so top tier! The game is pretty similar to many 2D fighting games and that’s not a bad thing at all. The foundation of what makes a 2D fighting game is here, with many improvements. The character entrances are all unique from each other and are a picture perfect replication of the source material. Even many of the attacks and special moves look really similar to the source material. If you watched DBZ/DBS you will immediately catch on to this and will have the biggest smile on your face. The developers are definitely fans of the series! The combat is pretty simple and easy to learn. You have your simple, medium, and heavy attack moves and your special abilities that are unique from each character (but some button layouts are similar to other characters). You also have other abilities as well that keeps the combat intense (ki blast, teleporting, and other attack moves). The game is pretty easy to learn, but hard to master since many characters feel different from each other. Practice mode will be really important if you want to be pretty good at this game. You have a zapping system since you can pick up to three characters per match to change from. This adds an extra layer of flow, and mechanics that requires some skill to get good at. One big complaint is that the AI can be pretty inconsistent. You need to find the perfect balance of difficulty because they either are just plain dumb, or actual gods here! If you are looking for a somewhat casual fighting experience, this may not be for you. Just keep that in mind if you are not willing to take the time to practice and get good at this game. Also another complaint is that the content in the base game is pretty lacking. This game is missing many well known characters if you are just buying the base game. This is frustrating because I know many DBZ games back then had tons of characters to use. Also the stages are pretty lacking. No DBS stages, but has DBS characters if you get the fighter packs. This feels like a big oversight from the devs.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]📜Story[/td]
        [td]The story is pretty forgettable and boring in my opinion. I didn’t care about the villain and the overall story arc. It felt super linear with no interesting twist or character building. I did like some of the dialogue between characters, but besides that I didn’t feel interested and invested in the story. Not much to say here, just not worth replaying at all and doesn’t feel that rewarding.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎭Multiplayer[/td]
        [td]The multiplayer is pretty straightforward and overall really fun. Being able to meet new people at the game hub is pretty cool as well. You have some unlockables (in terms of lobby characters and profile decorations). I haven’t had any serious connections issues as well.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🕛Playtime[/td]
        [td]With friends and overall just fighting AI, you can add a good amount of playtime here. There’s no deep progression or anything deep in that regard. It’s a straightforward experience, but a fun experience nonetheless. The story is around 12+ hours long. And getting all achievements may take you around 40+ hours of playtime.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎧Sound[/td]
        [td]Sound is superb! The music is pretty solid and the voice actors did a great job. The combat also sounds really intense and addicting! The overall sound design is really good with no complaints at all![/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]❗Bugs❗[/td]
        [td]I haven’t really encountered any bugs from my experience. The game felt really optimized in terms of bugs.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🔅Performance[/td]
        [td]Performance was really good on my end. No lag, crashes or even stutters. You should be perfectly fine if you have similar or even a little lower end specs in my opinion.[/td]

    [tr]
        [td]🔗Conclusion[/td]
        [td]If you are a fan of the Dragon Ball franchise, then this is a must buy! I do recommend saving some extra money to get all of the DLC’s since this game is lacking content in the base game. The combat is absolutely fast paced, intense and so addicting. The developers showed so much love to the source material as well. This is the perfect fighting game for all of the Dragon Ball fans and just fighting fans in general![/td]

678950,50153829,76561198090392164,0,27,15014,30,14944,1708092135,"Where Dragonball FighterZ excels: its 'easy to use' for the layman fighting system, with more advanced combos for those taking it more seriously and well accustomed to fighting games. And the visuals and voice overs ooze DBZ vibes. 

Where FighterZ could easily be so much more: there could have been a LOT more characters easily, and when you compare the roster to previous titles like Budokai Tenkaichi 3 that had around 200 characters nearly, you can see that. Mods are working online again atm though, (edit: only if they have same mods as you I think maybe, even then I'm not 100% sure you won't desync using mods online, when I tried with my friend who was without mods, we desynced, I had to launch vanilla so we wouldn't desync, but at least you can have one .exe for modded and launch regular from steam for vanilla..)  so that's nice and offers some way you can customize, you can find some nice ones to recreate the battles that you want to, like Majin Vegeta or Mecha Freiza, first & 2nd form Cell, etc.. You would think steam workshop would be an easy no brainer here..

It's also worth noting of course that this is a much more classic fighting game, so there's that, and it works, and it is compounding many different tried gameplay tactics over the years from Bandai, so while it is a 'simple fighting game', it has all of that to draw from as to what works and what doesn't. You may not be freely sprawling across a huge but poorly rendered space (ala Dragonball Legends), or taking 3d flight like Tenkaichi 3; but alot of that sort of chaff is cut and in its place is a close up, intense, ki blasting, adrenaline filled fight from start to finish.

    So does the game do a fantastic job of carrying forward the awesome legacy of the vanish fights from Budokai 3? Is the game better than Budokai 3? Well, yes and no, to both of these.
But also, again, this game is more of a straightforward classic fighting game, so is it even a fair comparison.
 The dragon rush system is certainly much more optimal here for multiplayer, in the days of Budokai 3 however the dragon rush was innovative and maybe at the time the best way they could do it, but when it comes to more serious tournaments dragon rush's would often be banned because of how trivial of a gimmick it is seen to be, guessing or randomly hitting the same button as the rusher. So, the way dragon rush works here is a big improvement, and in that respect it was a step in the right direction as far as that movement goes. There are actually two types of rush here and they both work better than most other DBZ title's rush mechanic. Of the many DBZ titles I have played, this is one of the best ways to do the flying towards your opponent aspect. In general out of all DBZ titles, this game has some of the best fights and really feels like the show. 

Another thing is for instance while most characters have at least one or two specific combos like they did in Budokai 3, the basic combo inputs are the same across pretty much all the characters, for better or for worse, it does make it fun and casual friendly to change up characters and still know the combos but it's also more basic that way and a bit less specific to each character, making it (unless you learn every combo) a bit the same after a while. whereas if there were more combos that were character specific but not as long and complicated and drawn out as some of them which are hard to pull of, and easier to remember that would be cool but, anyway.

Characters attacks often are on point as far as being like they were in the show,
Artwork and animations in this game are very aesthetic
For best epic results mute music, and play with a playlist of DB music of your own, we use watch2gether so our music is sync'd up with eachother, and have many of the Bruce Faulconer score tracks on our playlist so it is epic!
Fun with friends, fights look and feel like the show for the most part.
There are some nice attention to detail like for instance ki blasts that get diverted into exploding in the background, by your character powering up or deflecting them, the destruction and dramatic finishes, voiceover Chistopher Sabat & Sean Schemmel, etc.., watching back your fights with character commentating over them ( this reminded me of Dragonball Legends character changeout screen : )  )
Don't expect much from the 'story' though, lol, but, c'mon, it's a straight fighting game lol. 

Another missed opportunity is the arena matches, who knows the exact reason most players simply ignore the arena match option, probably because people can watch I think? It wasn't until recently that I noticed it had different types of fights you can do which is cool and adds replay value, for instance with 'flashy fight' you can always vanish, which really brings back the Budokai 3 Vanish fights vibe, like when you equipped meditation lol. That's another thing that Budokai 3 had more of of course, more customization and probably the best story mode of any DBZ game so far ( have not played kakarot). Recently I have noticed people using arena match more, so some have finally taken notice of it.

Really a pretty fantastic DBZ fighting game. It plays a lot like Marvel Vs Capcom 3, if I had to compare it to something; Sparking! acts in much the same way as X factor. And the tag team change between characters, and specials with quarter circles, all that. But it is more layman friendly than MVC3. 
 
The game we needed after Budokai series...? Doing it justice...? Maybe. Probably. It is a more traditional fighting game compared to the Budokai's, and it worked well. The dragon rush system here as I said being much better suited for multiplayer than Budokai 3's (known to be its one snag). If you were into Budokai, well I was too, and IMO this is pretty good. 

Namek is probably the most gorgeous stage, although a few more wouldn't hurt -- A desert stage with Buu's house &/or Babidi's lair entrance in the background would be cool! Also Kami's lookout seems like a no brainer, rather than ugly boring galactic arena stage. (Someone make this mod)
However my suggestions aside of course who wouldn't be pleased with the excellent fighting system that is there : )
The dramatic finishes are awesome, but it would be better if they weren't limited to only a single stage. 

I look forward to maybe some of these suggestions being taken into consideration and showing up in FighterZ 2!!???!

One thing I will say is after about 70-80 hours, you can play any character because the basic attacks are the same; but you will reach a skill ceiling where you can not lose a character to newbs, & go head to head with some orange & pinks, but then you will get the pinks that just do not let you move at all. When the combo lasts so long that you are sitting there for 30 seconds pressing buttons and can't move at all, there is no point, lol. 
I suppose its akin to when our grandparents would break in billiards and get a ball in, and so then would run the table, but, this is a little extreme, lol.",1555381630,1707026143,True,3,1,0.541666686534881592,0,True,False,False

This is also a more competitive fighting game, where you're going to struggle a bit before you get better and start winning more. Practicing combos and the assist system in this game are essential things if you want to move up the ranks. The game does have multiple dlc characters, but they are relatively cheap and not at all necessary if you want to win. Of course, some dlc characters are better than other characters, but playing as the better character will only get you but so far.

But aside from that, the game is great, awesome music, impressive cell shading, and its great to play with friends. The Story Mode however, is way too boring, and way too long, and it only matters because Android 21, a fighter, can only be unlocked by either beating the whole of Story Mode or spending 2,000,000 Zeni, which, BY THE WAY, is quite a lot.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

If you have played any licensed video game, specifically licensed Anime games, you'll know they are usually poor quality cash grabs (technically I'd say this game does overprice itself and it's DLC. Look for sales, I got the FighterZ edition for like $14usd), but FigherZ being developed by Arc, who are known for quality Fighting Games, shows.

I came from playing Strive and you can definitely see where the DNA for Strive came from with this game. A lot of small mechanics can be seen in both. But I will say that FighterZ is probably one of my top 3 fighting games. It has the spirit and action of Dragon Ball, the style you'd see from Strive, and just good feeling overall gameplay. 

All the characters are fun and unique to play, and the game is generally responsive. It feels great to hit combos and inputs, and I don't hate playing any of the characters.

Dialga and Palkia then succeed in creating the universe and Pokémon world and retreat into their own dimensions afterwards, with a point of access being at the ancient Spear Pillar in Sinnoh.
Arceus then creates Uxie, Mesprit, and Azelf, giving knowledge, emotion, and willpower to all living things that come into existence in the Pokémon world. The three dive into caves at the bottom of Lake Verity, Lake Valor, and Lake Acuity in Sinnoh, giving them the name ""lake guardians"".
Kyogre is formed by the pressure in the deep sea trenches, Groudon is formed deep inside the Earth, likely from hardened magma and earth, and Rayquaza is formed by the minerals of the ozone layer. Rayquaza proceeds to fly around in the ozone layer, occasionally coming to rest at Sky Pillar.
Kyogre and Groudon then proceed to fill the sea and create land, respectively. A chance meeting turns the two into rivals, and a conflict for dominance over the Pokémon world begins. This battle continues until Rayquaza quells it, causing Kyogre and Groudon to retreat to special caverns, where they rest until the events of Generation III many years later. The Red and Blue Orbs are created to prevent the reawakening of Kyogre and Groudon, and are left at Mt. Pyre for safekeeping. At this time, Mew may have been plentiful and lived in large numbers.
Landmasses such as Mt. Coronet are created, and Regigigas moves the continents, forming the regions, and creates the three giants, Regirock, Regice, and Registeel, out of clay, ice, and magma, respectively.
The Sinnoh region is created around Mt. Coronet. During this violent procedure, Stark Mountain is created due to shifts in the crust of the world, and Heatran is formed in a pool of lava. Arceus creates the Adamant, Lustrous, and Griseous Orbs before falling into a deep slumber.
Prehistory
This information is based primarily on the study of Fossils and other archaeological remains. Some of this information is also based on scientific research.

Millions of years before Generation I:

The earliest known prehistoric Pokémon existed at this time. It is possible that the Mew population may have decreased at this stage, as they slowly gave way to other Pokémon species.
300 million years ago: An ancient version of Genesect was born. Kabuto and Kabutops lived in the sea.
Team Plasma later used Genesect's DNA to create an infinitely stronger version of it with cybernetic technology.
An unspecified hundreds of millions of years ago: Carbink begins its undisturbed underground sleep after its birth. It was born from deep underground temperatures and pressures.
100 million years ago: Species such as Aerodactyl, Lileep, Cranidos, Shieldon, Tirtouga, Archen, Tyrantrum and Amaura were supposedly widespread. They all ultimately went extinct, but not before Archen gave rise to bird Pokémon and Tirtouga gave rise to turtle Pokémon.
A Fossil is found millions of years later in Hoenn and revived scientifically by the Devon Corporation.
Shellder is known to be the prey of Omastar.
Carracosta and Archeops preyed on Omanyte. Only Carracosta is known to have eaten Omastar.
Relicanth is said to have remained unchanged for over 100 million years.
Anorith is stated to have existed in primordial seas, with its eight legs at some point developing into its known eight wings.
2,000,000 years ago: The Area Zero Underdepths may have been formed, according to Professor Sada/Turo.
1,000,000 years ago: The Great Crater of Paldea is created.
20,000 years ago:
A meteorite containing Eternatus fell in the Galar region.
The first Claydol was brought to life from a clay doll.
10,000 years ago:
During the last Ice Age, the Mamoswine population flourished, then decreased when the Ice Age ended.
Oldest known mural depictions of Cyclizar being ridden by humans.
At some point in the distant past, the Magikarp population mutates due to unknown reasons and becomes weaker.
At some point after the Iron Age, Regigigas is sealed away in the Snowpoint Temple, and Regirock, Regice, and Registeel are sealed away at various points across the Hoenn region after years of human worship.
5,000 years ago: Gogoat is domesticated & humans begin using them for transport.
3,000 years before Generation V:

The Relic items are created.
3,000 years before Generation VI:


AZ and the ultimate weapon
The Kalos war occurred, the ultimate weapon was created underneath Geosenge Town, and AZ was given eternal life.
3,000 years before Generation VIII:

A black storm called the Darkest Day occurred and was stopped by Zacian and Zamazenta.
Melmetal is worshipped by ancient humans for its ability to create metal from nothing.
2,500 years before Generation V:

The Relic Castle is built.
The Dragonspiral Tower is known as Unova's oldest structure, though its age is unstated.
2,000 years before Generation V:

Conkeldurr is said to have taught humans how to make concrete using centrifugal force.
2,000 years before Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire:

Hoenn is plagued by meteor showers. A meteor turns the homeplace of the Draconid people into Meteor Falls.
The world overflowed with natural energy which Groudon and Kyogre, in their primal forms, fought over. They ravaged the earth and were only calmed by Rayquaza after the Draconid people summoned it using a wish on a meteor at Meteor Falls. The people of Hoenn begin to revere Rayquaza as a savior.
2,000 years before Generation IX:

The Paldean Empire began to rule Paldea.
The emperor of Paldea ushers in the Great Age of Exploration by sending expeditions into The Great Crater of Paldea to find the treasure rumored to lie inside.
1,500 years before Generation I:

The earliest known system for writing is developed and used at the Ruins of Alph, Tanoby Ruins, and Solaceon Ruins. Archaeologists are currently unsure whether the nearly identical Unown preceded or succeeded the writing system, but it is assumed they share some sort of connection.
The Farfetch'd population decreases due to overhunting.
c. 1,000-2,000 years before Pokémon Legends: Arceus (c. 1,300-2,300 years before Generation IV):

An ancient society called the Celestica people lived in the Sinnoh region. They worshiped Arceus and built many structures which can still be found as ruins in the region in modern times, such as Solaceon Ruins, Snowpoint Temple, and Spear Pillar.
1,000 years before Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire:

A thousand years after the events at Meteor Falls, a meteor struck Hoenn, creating Sootopolis City. Groudon and Kyogre reawakened to fight over the wellspring of primal energy which came from it. The people of Hoenn wished on Rayquaza to save them, and using the meteor, Rayquaza performed the world's first Mega Evolution and calmed the two. Sky Pillar was built in Rayquaza's honor, and the Draconid people promised to pass down the prophecy that in 1,000 years the meteor would return - causing the events of the Delta Episode.
805 years before Generation IX:

Naranja AcademyS/Uva AcademyV is founded in Mesagoza.
800 years before X and Y:

Xerneas released life energy throughout the Kalos region and fled to a forest, where it went to sleep in the form of a tree.
Yveltal absorbed life energy throughout the Kalos region and fled to the mountains, where it went to sleep in the form of a cocoon.",1703787761,1703787761,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The input execution for special moves is heavily simplified (involving only either quarter-circle-forward/backward motions) and jump cancel timing feels less tight compared to other anime fighters like BlazBlue. This is a good thing because long combo strings generally require chaining into air combo and they are relatively easier to execute here. For the record, I can never quite pull off long combo strings in BlazBlue regardless of how much I practice. But I can do pretty long combos in this game with lesser time spent in training mode and still feel I can get better.

There are also auto-combos (by mashing Light or Medium attacks) which are inherently part of the combo system - imo, I feel they are well-implemented. Auto-combos have certain properties like auto positioning closer to the opponent, making it easier to pull off air combo chains. For e.g. a basic ground-to-air combo like 2M, M, JC, L, M, JC, L, M, H can also be done as 2M, M, JC, L x2, JC, L x3. The latter will be easier to pull off, and that's not just because it requires fewer mixing of inputs but simply because of the auto-positioning itself. The great thing I feel about this is that even if an entry level player uses auto-combos as a crutch, he/she still needs to get into the habit of fairly precise inputs instead of just button mashing (since the latter combo requires hitting L the exact number of times). I think this is a good way to enable a new player to do something complex in a easier manner and condition them with the right habits at the same time.

If I have any complaints about the game, they would be:
- The story mode (which makes up the bulk of single-player content) and its plot are kinda meh.
- The tutorials are not really that useful.
- [strike]The OST is largely forgettable, though there are a few tracks that I fancy - like Bardock's and Android 16's themes.[/strike]


The game is heavily discounted so you should get either the FighterZ or Ultimate Edition when on sale.
Both editions include only the FighterZ Pass 1 (8 additional characters) while the latter includes additional commentator and music tracks if you care about that. Personally, I got the FighterZ edition as the music tracks don't appeal to me. 

Strongly recommended!

Edit: I take back what I said about the OST. After occasional listening to various themes on Youtube over the course of time, I think I actually do like the OST quite a fair bit. The two I mentioned are probably still my favorites but there are at least 7 others I've come to love.",1601284212,1703602617,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

BUT, [i]If you [b]don't[/b] have [b](A)[/b] or [b](B)[/b], then I [b]do not[/b] recommend buying this game.[/i]

[b]1.[/b] The online is horrible.
[b]2.[/b] The DLC structure is horrible.
[b]3.[/b] The ""campaign"" and other PvE elements are not worth mentioning.

Although it is relatively easy for beginners to [i]get into[/i] this game due to auto-combos, and the graphics/animations are very pleasing to the senses, once you peel back the onion it is just like any other fighting game wherein it is very difficult & frustrating to compete against someone with a skill disparity.

[b]If you don't have the time, you will never enjoy the game and you will waste your money.[/b] 

Yes, this is basically true of virtually any fighting game, but in DBFZ it is especially true.  DBFZ is very fast and unforgiving (for better or for worse, depending on the skill disparity).  This does not bode well with the online play, which, again, is absolutely horrible.   So, unless you and your friend(s) are relatively matched in skill/knowledge, AND you are local, you probably won't play for very long before someone quits out of frustration, helplessness, or boredom.

Once you give up on trying to convince your friends to play, you are then stuck trying to compete online.  And, well, like I said, the online is horrible.",1570208634,1703543481,False,17,4,0.586788594722747803,0,True,False,False

Honestly, this isn't really a review. I just need a space to say my piece here, because there's so much I can say about this game. From launch to current version, so much has changed.

I'm speaking to the other folks with a few hundred or thousand hours in here - Remember when A16 got a hard knockdown from a command grab? Remember watching Bardock's super 4 times every set? Remember when people thought Z Broly was bad? Remember the menaces of Kid Goku, UI Goku, Fusions? Remember Labcoat (not like you'd have to dig very deep)? Do you remember how much your characters changed, from patch to patch? Do you remember going back to an old team and feeling nostalgic? Do you remember reading patch notes and feeling like you were so betrayed, or so uplifted? Do you remember when she said ""rollback"" - and before the translator could even think about speaking - the crowd exploded? Do you remember cell screams?

I apologize for being so sentimental in a literal steam review, but damn man, this game showed me that every hour you put into a fighting game can be an hour you get out. I'll admit, the IP does make it. Even your dad knows Goku. But that's all part of it. I never really did comics or their movies/shows/related media, but I did watch Toonami. I did watch Krillin explode. I did play Budokai, Xenoverse, the WORKS trying to feel like I was a super saiyan, chasing some kind of high. Nothing came close to DBFZ. I feel like a fucking warrior playing this game.

It's not for everyone. Absolutely not. It's SO hard to get your homies on discord to play the stupid unlimited gokus fighting game with you. But for what it was and what it did for me, this game is my GOAT. The bar everything else will be held to. I feel so lucky I had it, have it, and will have it (WITH ROLLBACK!) in the future. I will be playing this game in the nursing home. I will be playing it if and when my consciousness separates from my body.

Enjoy never winning a match against anybody who's been playing since launch or at least a few years. There is ZERO casual play. The frame perfect requirement for even the most basic of combos will shut down most players out the gate. I'd consider myself average in other fighting games like Soulcalibur or Tekken, but those are more combo forgivable with longer airtimes and ""slower"" gameplay and can be played casually with no issue because of this.

This game, has zero casualability. You either play and train for hours a day, or you never properly pick it up... I love DBZ and watching the videos from this game, but I would not recommend it for newer players.

The people in the forums say it's possible, it just doesn't work in Online Mode because the anti-cheat doesn't work in Linux. Which is fine, my goal was set up multiplayer matches like it is 2004 and I'm renting Budokai 3 from Blockbuster to play at my friend's house on the PS2. I think I may have gotten it to work but had to reboot due to the game being in windowed mode on the TV and the now it won't launch because it can't verify my purchase and I have to wait 24 hours. 

Yup. Doing tech support on a steam deck used up all the activation tokens of the anti-pirate program and locked me out for 24 hours. At this rate I'm probably going to return this game. 

Also, massive sale five years after the game is released and it's still 50 dollars to get all the character DLCs and that required research to figure out to make sure I got them all.",1702343214,1702343214,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Played about 400 hrs on the ps4 as well so, I have around I guess 900 or so of game play. Easily the most fun I've had with a DB game since either BT2 or Burst Limit. Played when the game dropped, but didn't play for a while since season 3. Lately played with some friends and wanted figured I'd write a review since some of my buddy's started doing there own. This is going to be long, so brace yourselves.   

 A fun fighting game to learn for beginners. Inputs are simple by comparison to other games, yet there still plenty of combo variety where execution can be real difficult. If your looking for a challenge in combo execution, this game has for you. The trainer in lobby can teach some of the mechanics in the game, and they added another trainer as well that goes over more. There have been plenty of mechanics changes since release, which some have reduced issues that made it harder to deal with game-play situations in matches. Such has made characters be more viable to play, but at the risk of reducing options offensively. It's arguable either way whether it was good or not to do such, but I would never say it took away form the fun of the game.

Of the mechanics that are something to mention and that is sparking. Sparking is a useful tool that generally gets used in three ways;  use to get out of pressure to keep from losing a character, for comebacks for the anchor or just the last remaining character, because its remains for a longer period of time, and increases damage, or to gain the damage increase to finish an opponents character. You can also jump cancel from your normal inputs, adding to the combo variety and mix-up options you can use. It also regenerates some of lost heath in blue and gives extra meter than you get normally. Spark can be used while your blocking which is a change they made season 2 I believe, but cannot be used when getting combo'd like in some other Arcsys games. I would say that by comparison, this game is a bit more fair defensively with some situations you'll run into by comparison with the other games like MVC where assist can hit you low, making potential unblockable situations.

There's also the story mode {which has its ups and downs} and an arcade mode, both increasing in difficulty the further you get. Story mode has a leveling system increasing character stat values and items that aid you in fight. Downside in both of these is..the AI is FUCKED UP with how much damage it can do to you! Generally it will hit you once than if it has meter to spend, will super for high amount of damage. Its really frustrating when you'll have a near full health character, is around 30%. If it did a combo, it'd be less annoying maybe, but just...geez. Otherwise, the story mode does drag a bit. There are some fun character interactions in cut scenes, Depending on who is in the team and more. There are hilarious and great moments that you can just look up on YouTube if your interested. 

Online is where the actions is with other players and man! The connections  can be good to HORRENDOUS. This is the games biggest issue to the detriment of its longevity, and has remained such since release. When you do have a solid connection, matches can be fun. However, connections can fluctuate which is annoying as hell making it increasing more difficult to play matches or even want to play at all at times.

As far as getting into matches, here is a Fair warning; don't be shocked if you get steamrolled. Games been out for over 4 years, and the players are gonna play with intention to win. You can of course set that you want to play people by rank, but I'm not sure how many people play in the lower ranks which you could either be just sitting there or it could match you with someone more relative to your rank. Still, don't be discourage, there are plenty of people and communities willing to teach beginners. There is also boss run which you play a single character on a team with other players against ridiculous AI that happens occasionally and you can there is 3v3 styles against another set of players which is fun to play with friends. There is the arena in the middle of the lobby area that has gimmick matches you can play which seem like they can be a lot of fun, but I don't remember seeing alot of people playing them that much nor played them myself. 

Had so much fun playing this game and its one of 2 fighting games I've spent the 500 hours in. I doubt at this point that this game will get rollback to help with the online issues, but I have hopes if they do have a sequel to this game that it won't have this issue. Especially after the release of Strive and rollback being added to there other games which has gained interest towards all of them. Recently Lab Coat came out and what maybe the last update is coming and could help some characters a buff or 2. That also means this we are coming to the finished state of this game now and I loved it regardless of my own complaints. This was great game and is one my favorite fighting games that I have played.

Campaign is terrible and I wouldn't play it even if you paid me. Story, writing, and structure are awful. Some character interactions are great like Gohan meeting Perfect Cell in his mystic form. However this isn't anywhere near enough motivation for me to play through this campaign.

Gameplay: Outstanding. Great for new comers with auto combos and a simple controller scheme for players to pick up. Characters may seem homogeneous at first but experimenting with different teams and understanding the move sets of various characters allow for 1000's of hours of labbing. 
Sound/Music. Great all around. Voice acting for both Japanese and English are exactly what you expect if you have watched the anime. Music tracks are a mixed bag.
Graphics/Performance. Runs perfectly fine on my system and everything looks faithful to the anime and even better in areas. ARC knows anime and with the experience with Guilty Gear shows in spades here.
Online is not great. The inferior delay based netcode is a chore to deal with. Finding red bar connections and fighting the same few people over and over again in ranked make for a terrible experience.

I am aware of the balancing issues of some characters though such as SSJ4 (Both SSJ4 and SSJB Gogeta), broly and a few others. this game isn't really ""perfect"" in balancing but PvP has been fun if you're not fighting against those meta characters.

The game's combat is actually extremely good. I didn't even notice this was developed by the same dudes at Arc (Same people who created GG:S) so that's already a great merit to it. the artstyle is amazing given how hard it's been for many studios to transfer the anime style to 3D, this had very nice eye candy and many references to the source material, with dramatic finishes being re-animated scenes from the show / movies, and i think that's a nice touch for those very familiar with DBZ. I didn't actually purchase this as a DBZ fan and wanted to try a fighting game like this, this was on sale too so i figured why not.

The DLC locks quite a few characters, some being extremely fun to play and others being... ok. The base cast of characters are still good to play and enjoyable.

Even if I didn't touch PvP much, I actually had a lot of fun with its combat system and the assist mechanic which allowed other characters to tag in shortly to use a single attack and whatnot. It's a very fun game regardless of whether you're familiar with the DBZ IP or not.

New players, casual players or returning players should avoid the game even though rollback is announced a lifeline measure. Honestly the game is simple and straight forward, but has too many interactions and mechanics to keep an eye for, for casual players who cannot spend several hours on the game on a daily basis. The game rewards those who keep practice everyday in and out every combo or TOD. Matchmaking is a joke as most matches in lower ranks just hit a wall when actually getting matched against higher ranked players. Additionally the matchmaking takes too long for lower ranks; probably because there have been no new players in the game or lower purchases. Don't get me wrong, DBFZ allows for high skill expression, yet is resoundingly oppressive against those that do not constantly play the game. Sure, you can just say get better or git gud, but sometimes it is better to play others games like Terraria or Stardew Valley to relax than stress out on a fighting game. Although I have played around 90 hours the fun gotten is very little, but the amount of stress is considerable.

[strike] Keyword NEARLY.
The netcode is absolutely atrocious, borderline unplayable in some cases. [/strike]

Offline? Best fighting game ever.

[strike] Online? Don't waste your money.

Only reason why I continue to play this game is due to my fondness of the game's artstyle and overall gameplay (which is solid af.) 

[UPDATE 1] Its been 1K more hours later. still no rollback.

[UPDATE 2] Rollback is a government psyop. [/strike]

[UPDATE 3 - THE ROLLBACK BETA TEST] 2,168 hours later, yes you heard that right.
The Pros:
Online has never felt this smooth.
I'm able to play against players from Central-East Canada (I am US South West) with little to no delay/rollback frames. Have not tested with European players but from what I heard is that its playable, but not ideal. Japanese/Korean players have a great connection however.

The cons:
- the continuously flashing character icons mid match are not only distracting, but they flash so often it [b]could[/b] be considered a epilepsy hazard.

- the KO screens are bugged, nothing insane or bothersome who are here for the gameplay, but for people who like the overall aesthetic of the game will definitely find it annoying.

- ring lobby matches have a chance to disconnect when someone is spectating, should be fixed by the time rollback officially releases.

Overall, I've never been more happy with the game. The rollback is so buttery smooth (so smooth and fast that a lot of players I've been talking to are considering turning on button delay to match PS4/tournament standard delay.)

The beta ends on December 10th. I do not recommend buying the game after the beta is over or until a sale presents itself. But when that happens, this game is an instant buy for both casual Dragon Ball fans and casual/competitive fighting game players. The meta is in a weird but interesting place where every character is playable to a certain degree. Obviously the stronger characters at the moment will still dominate but its not nearly as bad as the Fusion/Labcoat meta, which made a good 60% of the cast non viable.

Again, when rollback is officially added as an update and not a beta, or a sale presents itself.

The satisfaction of hitting combo strings you've been practicing is AMAZING, and it definitely helps that the combos in this game are so flashy. I found myself actually having a good time just going into practice mode to mess around, learn new characters, and look up optimal combos to practice with my favorites.

If you are new to fighting games, or a Dragon Ball fan, I highly recommend giving this game a shot, ESPECIALLY now that rollback is out, it makes online a lot smoother. I hope more people get to experience this game the way I have, and have as much fun as I do getting some friends to hop on and run some ring matches still to this day. <3",1701459363,1701459363,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Story mode is a blatant attempt to stretch out play time with a very grindy, repetitive ""beat up all these guys"" simulator, with rare cutscenes peppered in. Granted, these scenes are great and offer a relief from the dull gameplay, but the gameplay is kinda the important part. PvE difficulty alternates between laughably easy enemies who don't know how to block and being combo'd for half of your health, seemingly at random. You will trash 9/10 opponents on a map, but 1 will randomly decide it's been too easy on you and just annihilate you for a minute, before seemingly forgetting how to block again.

The UI is clunky and feels like it was ported from a console, rather than actually designed for PC. Just opening the lobby takes multiple loading screens, which are repeated every time you change modes. Want to quit out of the game from Story Mode? Save Game -> Leave story mode -> wait for loading screens to reload lobby -> Quit -> wait for the title screen to load -> Quit

Then there's matchmaking, where there seems to be no difference between ""I have been playing this game daily for 5 years"" and ""I'm new and looking to learn how to play"". Matches appear to be a combo competition where the battle has been decided after the first few blows. Either there are no longer new players to match with or the system does not make an effort to differentiate skill levels.

This is a game that has as much potential as you're willing to put into it, but you really need to bring your own friends to play with too.",1701458071,1701458071,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm over 500 hours in and I still have so much fun learning new things in this game. 

My only negative is that the single player gameplay modes are lacking. The campaign is repetitive and grindy. It's not terrible, but if you stick to single player content you'll be missing out on the best the game has to offer. 

I'd criticize the online here, but ROLLBACK IS HERE BAYBEE!!!! 

As a whole I very strongly recommend it. It's one of my favorite games ever and I love it with all my heart. DBFZ has pushed me further than any other fighting game ever and i'm so excited to play more of it with the rollback update.

So much of it is less learn how to actually do things than it is ""Force a guard, miss your attack intentionally""
Why would I want to intentionally miss to leave myself open when I can just wait .2 seconds to actually connect the attack and continue a combo?

The repetitiveness of it feels a bit unbalanced and at times annoying. Sometimes the clones feel like they are just target dummies and other times they mop the floor with you. There is no difficulty option. I guess the difficulty goes higher and higher with the level. 

The tutorials during story missions is kind of an annoying addition and from time to time they don't even let you beat the the opponent if you don't complete the required task (plus the clone just wipes the floor with you if you don't do the task correctly in some cases).

To start off, despite having a few fighting games between all my systems, I've never really be that great at them. I just don't have much of a patience for sitting down to learn the combos, and end up being terrible because it. But with this game, it was never a problem for me. I don't know why, maybe it's because it's Dragon Ball, and I grew up with most of the cast, and love Team Four Star. It just clicked with me.

That being said, this game is easily 10/10. It has very solid 3v3 fighting game mechanics similar to, but not as broken as, UMvC3. The game is extremely easy to pick up, and is very newbie friendly. I don't think I'd ever be able to climb as high as I have in any other fighting game. This game is the perfect balance between ""I have no idea what I'm doing"" and ""esports level plays."" It's fast paced, Dragon Ball action, with the perfect look for a Dragon Ball game. While it isn't quite a 100% recreation of the Dragon Ball fights in the anime, it is still the most fun I've had in both a fighting game, and in a Dragon Ball game. Nothing has topped this to this date, and I this game is a solid addition to any fighting game collection anyone could have, and probably won't disapear until a sequal comes out.

plays pretty well. even just moving around feels really good, and all the mechanics come together well. basically all of the characters have at least something interesting going on, which can actually make it hard to settle on a team when so many of the options work for you (non-issue).
singleplayer content isn't great? the story mode is pretty boring, bots with cranked up damage are mostly just annoying to play against and the story itself isn't anything special. multiplayer has the caveat of still being on delay-based netcode for the time being, and it's filled with really annoying players.
the balance also kind of blows. the game's been powercrept to hell, to the point where if you want to spend the resources you can TOD with basically anyone in pretty realistic circumstances. a lot of characters have frustrating tools they can skip neutral with and brutal mixups that are hard to even see through all the visual noise you get with assists, it really gets out of hand. i guess all characters are viable? so if you're a big tien fan you don't necessarily have to toss that away to play 3 versions of goku and/or vegeta, but the good characters are still stupid good.
still, there's a lot of fun to have with the game, and it's definitely worth the pretty low price it goes on sale for. maybe not -all- the dlc? buying pass 2 & 3 alongside the fighterZ edition with pass 1 ends up, like, quadrupling the (on sale) price. it's not like you're really gonna play every one of these guys, anyways. but the base game is 100% worth it, even if you aren't necessarily a fan of the series.",1700865123,1700865123,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b]Good Point (My Opinion)[/b]
- It not a best graphic in fighting game but i like this graphic style, it like a you play character that you love in real dragon ball anime/manga.
- I like how to combo in this game that was sick !!
- You can play with your friends 3 or 6 peoples in this fighting game (Party Battle [Boss Mode] / Ring Party)
- You can get free 3 characters by play story mode (Goku-Vegeta SSGSS / Android 21)

[b]Bad Point (My Opinion)[/b]
- If you match with laggy players 10-19 fr you can't play normally, combo that you practice in practice mode will be mashed potato.

Totally : 8/10 scores

This game is the best looking Dragon Ball game you will ever play. The 2.5d cell shaded style is so pleasing to the eyes. The cinematic sequences in the games add a ton of ""holey crap"" moments. Overall, this game is extremely visually appealing.

Gameplay is tons of fun. The fact that newer players can mash and feel like they are doing something is always great to see. Press X repeatedly to do a cool combo. Let it be known it that this doesn't give you an advantage in online matches. If you mash, you will lose. Knowing combos, timing, frame data, spacing, and inputs will beat out mashing every time.

Characters feel unique and there are plenty of them to choose from. Heck there are 5 or 6 Gokus to choose from. You'll definitely find your favorite character to play or maybe even a character you never heard of before. And with the tag based system, you get to bring 3 of your favorites into battle. 

The game is always active, probably because its Dragon Ball, so you will always see someone online.

Now with all that out of the way lets talk about some negatives. 

The game has been out for....a while. Most players online have been playing since the beginning and are very experienced in the game. So, finding a match can take a while for ranked modes. And, for unranked...good luck. You could get paired with a brand new player or a max ranked veteran. 

I also feel that each character has optimal combos and if you aren't pulling them off, then you aren't gonna win with the current players. If you try to experiment with different combos, you're going to be in for a bad time. You'll see several players doing the same combos for specific characters. Not really a big negative, but something I found to be a little sad. 

The game may be easy to get into, but you'll struggle online unless you put in the time to learn your characters and their combos. This goes for any fighting game, but I feel it's more prevalent here. So if you want to win, do some studying and practice your combos religiously.

Over all, the game is great and worth picking up!",1700590769,1700590769,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As a lifelong Dragon Ball fan and a gaming enthusiast, this title left me thoroughly impressed and deeply satisfied. From its stunning visuals to its intricate gameplay mechanics, Dragon Ball FighterZ is a must-play for fans of the series and fighting game aficionados alike.

Graphics and Presentation: 5/5
The visuals in Dragon Ball FighterZ are nothing short of spectacular. The developers have captured the essence of the anime with stunning, cel-shaded graphics that make it feel like you're controlling the characters directly from the TV screen. The attention to detail in character animations and the impressive recreation of iconic scenes from the series are breathtaking. It truly feels like you're part of the Dragon Ball world.

Gameplay: 4.5/5
The combat system in Dragon Ball FighterZ is both accessible for newcomers and deep enough to satisfy seasoned fighting game enthusiasts. The controls are intuitive, allowing for a smooth learning curve. The combo system is robust, and mastering it is incredibly rewarding. Each character feels unique, and the game offers a good balance of offensive and defensive strategies, making for engaging and varied matches. However, the only minor downside is that the learning curve for some of the more advanced mechanics can be a bit steep.

Character Roster: 5/5
The game boasts an impressive and diverse roster of Dragon Ball characters, including fan favorites like Goku, Vegeta, Piccolo, and Frieza, as well as more obscure choices like Beerus and Hit. Each character feels true to their anime counterpart and has a distinct playstyle, making for exciting matchups. The DLC characters introduced over time only add to the excitement, giving the game a great sense of longevity.

Single-Player Content: 4/5
While the main attraction of Dragon Ball FighterZ is its multiplayer battles, the single-player content, including the story mode, offers a substantial and enjoyable experience. The story mode is engaging, featuring an original storyline with excellent character interactions and epic battles. However, some of the battles can be a bit repetitive.

Multiplayer and Community: 5/5
The heart of any great fighting game lies in its online multiplayer, and Dragon Ball FighterZ does not disappoint. The netcode is top-notch, resulting in minimal lag and seamless online battles. The game's competitive community is thriving, with frequent tournaments and updates keeping the experience fresh and competitive.

In conclusion, Dragon Ball FighterZ is an absolute gem for fans of the series and the fighting game genre. Its stunning visuals, diverse character roster, accessible yet deep gameplay, and strong community support make it a game that can be enjoyed for years to come. Whether you're a Dragon Ball enthusiast or just a fighting game enthusiast, this title is a knockout powerhouse that should not be missed. Kamehameha your way into the action and experience the thrill for yourself!",1698368028,1698368028,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b][u]Score: 2/10[/u][/b]
[hr][/hr]
DBFZ was a game that united the Fighting game community. When it first released, you saw pro players from all different games come to this one in particular to duke it out. New players, who never even touched a fighting game, also chose this as their first, myself included. This game's aggressive play style, beautiful visuals and easy to pick up, hard to master game play, all backed up by a giant franchise that everyone has at least heard of before, made it so that no matter how experienced you were with fighting games, you were drawn to this one. That's how it started, at least.

Over the years, Dragon ball fighterZ has morphed into something completely different, when you compare it to how it started out. I've played this game for a loooong time and I stopped right around the end of season 3. I had several issues with the game, that made it not enjoyable in the end. In ranked, you would see the same 5 or so characters over and over again. Around the time there were also characters released as DLC, who were completely broken and stayed that way for many weeks, before finally getting nerfed. Combine that with weird balancing patches and just better, more fun games coming out and I lost interest in this one. I recently got some youtube videos recommended of this game and wanted to check it out again.

So, what is the game like right now? It's been over a year and a half, since the last DLC character was released and patches for this game are few and far between. Rollback, a great net code that makes even the worst of connections at least somewhat playable, is apparently coming, it was promised many months ago and we still haven't heard any news about it. I was quite excited to come back to this game, after so long. However, I felt sorely disappointed. I know that this entire review, seems like I'm some sort of old lady reminiscing about the days of old, but that is how I truly feel. I think the developers pushed this game too far. Right now, the game is very broken. All characters can seemingly do everything and the game became very brain dead. I can't take it seriously as a competitive fighting game, but I also can't enjoy it in the same way as a broken, silly fighting game, where you laugh with friends about how stupid the things happening in the game are, something like SF 2 Rainbow edition, or the different turbo mods for smash games. To me, the game is stuck in this weird middle ground, where it's too broken and brain dead to be enjoyed competitively, but also too boring to be enjoyed with friends. I think it's time for DBFZ to retire. It was fun while it lasted, but all things must come to an end.",1600896000,1697986315,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you've ever dreamt of settling the age-old debate of who would win in a fight between Goku and, say, a large green Namekian or an android with a mad scientist's haircut, this game is your answer. And it's like an intergalactic WWE match on steroids!

Pros:

Non-stop action: Remember those moments in the anime when they'd stare intensely at each other for five episodes before throwing a single punch? Yeah, you won't find that here. It's a relentless brawl from start to finish.
Ridiculously powerful moves: Unleash the power of the Dragon Balls, and watch your enemies cower in fear as you summon Shenron. Just don't wish for ""more fighters,"" or it'll break the game.
Over 9000 nostalgia points: This game will transport you back to your childhood when you attempted (unsuccessfully) to go Super Saiyan in your backyard.
Saiyan Hair: The ultimate power of Saiyans? Gravity-defying hair. Just wait until you see your fighters' locks go wild during a match.
Cons:

Button mashing mayhem: You might start out with strategy, but the chaos quickly devolves into frantic button mashing. ""Hadouken"" or ""Kamehameha""? Who cares, just mash everything!
Learning curve: If you want to master all the combos and special moves, prepare for a steeper learning curve than Goku's power level.
Absurdly long attack animations: When Cell does his solar flare or Frieza decides to chat for five minutes, you might find yourself wondering if you can order a pizza in between.
In the end, Dragon Ball FighterZ is like a giant Dragon Ball-themed carnival, and you're invited to the wildest party in the universe. Whether you're a die-hard DBZ fan or just someone looking for over-the-top anime brawling, it's a blast! Just be prepared for the button mashing madness and the occasional existential question: ""Do I want to win this fight or see another transformation animation?""",1697373766,1697893808,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

For starters if you want a friendly battle or want to try other types of modes you can forget about it because no one plays anything but serious fight on ring match, rare times I find a match labeled friendly and no times have I ever seen anyone trying to host any other modes so kind of lackluster. Personally I'd prefer more variety in my playing if I'm going to play with other people. Gets old rather quickly if no one on there has a wider range of preferences.

Aside from that, you can't change your region from what I can see after you pick your region, so if you pick a region and then decided you rather try playing with a different crowd from a different part of the world you can't, you're trapped in whatever region you chose. The battle stages you can pick from are limited and while you can thankfully play as certain characters that are normally only playable via unlocking in other games, the roster is still pretty pathetic. Beerus is in it, but Champa is not, yet we have Goku's whole family and even fusions. 

Also if you don't like toxicity and thought the preset chat style would save you from having to deal with it, you've thought wrong, because people still find ways to be toxic/unsportsmanlike using the preset chat. The cosmetics are done in a Gacha  style way, which would be fine if you feel like grinding for days to get zeni, but if you're a casual player and only play every now and then you will likely never gain the cosmetics you want without throwing away a lot of your time and hardearned zeni to hope you get it.

Finally, my last complaint about this game is just that using the controls are difficult. While I'm sure most of us who played this game, probably have had our share of combo fighting mortal combat type games, the control in this game are particularly unintuitive when compared to other games of this similar genre.

Bottom line, don't get it unless part of your fun comes in the form of being an absolute masochist with only one game mode you like. Have a good day.",1697174716,1697174716,False,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

As my first fighting game other than casual Smash bros, DBFZ really taught me many basic fighting game things such as neutral, punishes, anti-airs and the cruel reality of not having a burst mechanic and being TOD’d out of nowhere. Regardless, the hundreds of hours spent in training mode wasn’t a waste because it was not only satisfying to learn new combos, but it also opened me up to the world of fighting games! If only we could get more character diversity😂 I know that’s how its supposed to be with 1000 goku allikes, but I feel like several characters from DBS could be added for a larger roster?

Getting locked into a long combo by an opponent while the game does nothing to teach you how to prevent it or where your counterstrike point would be. Need to spend an entire university degree's worth of effort learning the tinest details of each single character so you don't spend most of a match getting smashed into the corner with no way of getting out.

Update: Many hours later, the game's problems remain the same. Ranked Match is the only way to get anything remotely fair, but this is not guaranteed when you have people smurfing in the lower levels. Casual Match is utterly unplayable - you only ever see top end players who can kill each of your characters in 1-2 combos. At that point, you might as well just go play Fantasy Strike instead.

Game badly needs some form of options to help players who don't have the time or skill to master these combos. An option to lower the damage you take from combos while lowering the damage you deal with them. But they won't, so the game has sunk into a rut like many fighting games before it - the only ones left will destroy new players so thoroughly they'll just give up and play something else, all while complaining that the game is dying.

EDIT: I've tried this game on and off over the last 2 years and came back again with the recent update. My view of the game is unchanged. When you actually get a similarly skilled opponent and the game does not lag to hell, it's a genuinely good fighting game. But that's not what happens 90% of the time.

What mostly happens is you get dunked on by smurfs in ranked. You, with your 45% win rate and nearly a thousand games total, vs someone of the same rank with only 50 games. Yet the opponent earns barely any extra points in order to rapidly get them out of a rank they are clearly outclassing. Winstreaks badly need to multiply the ranking points in order to get smurfs back into their proper brackets and allow lower skilled players to actually enjoy the online component, especially because...

""Casual Match"" - possibly the worst case of false advertising i've seen in years. There are no casuals left in a fighting game of this age. The only opponent you will get is a top tier tournament level player who can dunk on you in 2 combos with each character and perform all sorts of techniques like crossups that you can't deal with. Even when it's become obvious their opponent is far below them, they don't tone things down to let the ""casual"" match actually be enjoyable. They will happily go full sweaty palm tryhard every single match. It's completely offputting to newer or lesser skilled players and it makes them quit.

Then they cry about their communities being dead.",1614327271,1695054806,False,8,0,0.576305985450744629,0,True,False,False

you could say it's the kind of game which you love as much as you hate it. let me explain:
for the good things:
- the gameplay and combo routes.
It's by far my most prefered gameplay of every fighting games I've played so far. easy to start, and still really hard to master. with that every characters feels really unique but if you still like to change characters often (which is usually hard in fighting games) you can by learning some universals basics (though it wont be enough ofc to learn what your new character can really do with advanced combos).
So yes, the gameplay is trully amazing and that's why I have more than 1k hours on this game.
BUT, now, let's talk about why I still don't recommend this game, THE CONS:
- no content:
by that I mean, when you play solo, you have almost nothing to do (and some might say ""hey it's a fighting game ofc you have not much to do in solo"" ... go see what Mortal kombat can do, yes fighting games can have solo modes, and good ones).
Then you have nothing to unlock by playing, I mean nothing worth your time: the only thing you can unlock after getting all characters is : new music tracks (which are rlly bad for 80% of those), new lobby characters (= useless) and ... new colors for your playable characters ... yes ... colors ... you can have a new skin to customise even a little your favourite characters, only colors ...
Yes I'm maybe asking a lot to add some real skins but think about it, when you have nothing to do in solo, nothing to unlock ... yes the only thing you can do is train your combos in training mode, spar with a friend or go online ... nowadays that's not enough at all.
- Bad support from Devs:
another bad thing about this, Devs are really like REALLY bad at communicating anything, that and giving us like 1 or 2 worth updates each year (basically this game is quite abandonned by devs so).
If you don't believe me, just look on the internet about the famous ""roll back net code"" the devs promised us for way longer than a year ago, and still nothing ...

SO yes, I do play a lot this game, sadly I can't recommend it unless you get it for like 5 Euros or so, or if you have a really good friend to play with and sparing with the 2 of you will be enough.
If you go solo, don't buy it, some others fightings games have a way better content (like SF6 and upcoming MK1 for example) and will be hopefully more supported by their devs.",1693598965,1693599086,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I just want to learn a fighting game to get better to escape the trash heap but no: these meta players need their hugbox because they're too scared to play a character that isn't covered in bright colors.

- Coming home to my country bumpkin of a wife who better fucking have dinner ready.
- Completely ignoring my children. If they want my attention they'll have to fight me for it.

That being said, 80% of the joy I get from this game is the eye candy visuals. Although I respect the jagged-edged pixel th 16bit history of 2D cartoon fighters.. there's something to be said when a game can make a crisp sharp 3D rendered environment look indistinguishable from a 2D game. Arcworks knows their craft well, and I consider them to be the pioneers of cel-shading in video games. Every other game that attempts to make Dragonball Z work as a 3D game but look 2D like the show still have those technical struggles to make it look truly 2D... Arcworks does it like a science. 

On to the gameplay. The cool thing about this game is that the range of skill and approachability of this game were designed for both kids and hardcore fighting game enthusiasts. Don't ask me how it was done, but it seems like the focus of this game was to allow a kid to pick it up and play their heart out and still do ""Goku stuff"" while a hardcore competitive player can play this game and make it as technical as desired at the same time. 

Much like Nintendo's 'Smash bros.' was enjoyed by your 5 year cousin while you also lost adult friendships from sweat lording hang outs, this game combines easy to use fighting techniques with serious competitive range to appease all crowds and fans of a franchise to come together and enjoy the experience alike. 

If you are even a half fan of the DBZ franchise you will love this fighting game. 

The only downside is the DLC cucking they do on letting you have all the cool fighters without paying 50$ extra.

Wait for it to be on sale. Then  splurge away. Cheers!@

If that wasn't enough the e-Sports scene around this game is so hype. I just couldn't help myself and I watched tons of pro matches and learned all about the deep, intricate technicalities behind fighting games like DBFZ. 

The community around this game is great, so much content online to enjoy and to learn from. And the game itself is very solid, with lots to enjoy in both single player and online modes. For single player, the main activity is going to be story mode and for a DBZ game, the story is decent. Just don't expect too much. For online play, you'll be doing ranked matches and improving in the practice lab. The lab is excellent and let's you set up any situation that you want to practice. Just beware that you'll need to buy the DLC characters or you won't be able to practice with or against them in the lab. It's not strictly necessary but if you're serious about climbing the ranks you'll definitely need to unlock characters that are popular in the meta.

There's much more to say but I think this covers the general points I wanted to share. If DBZ is totally your thing, you really should play this title.",1691529245,1691529245,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

not to mention that this game has a poor poor roster and that BT3 for the ps2 had much much more characters and that game. you know... was actually accruate to the DBZ fighting style... this one however? this is just tekken with DBZ skins. nothing in the fighting resembles anything from the show. the battle screen in this game with all the flashy combos is just stupid. this is like games from the 90's. and it does not fit dragon ball. dragon ball fights suppose to be in big open areas. you suppose to fly. shoot beams. teleport. this is how dbz fights are and this is why both BT3 and raging blast 2 were so good. and on top of that. those games had a big roster and no DLC'S

this game however is a joke. you get default small pathetic roster and each for each character you have to pay sepretly.

and then people claim that westren developers are bad while japanese one are good. dont make me laugh. both the pokemon and dragon ball franchise are the biggest cow milking franchises in existence because they know how many fans those franchises have so they know they can get away with anything

i know that bt4 going to have all those stupid DLC'S as well.

 first few night are a get good moment tho,
 gotta adjust to the mechanics, but its unique.

really good representation of the dragon ball universe.

there are also build in auto combo, like x,x,x or y,y,y,y  on a controller.
it makes new player somewhat able to pick up the game easy, which is nice.

but there are also way more advanced combo (manual combo) for down the line,
 when you got the basic figured out. 

it would add like 10 % more dmg if you do the manual combo compared to the auto combo.

The vibrant colors, the fluid animations, and the explosive special moves all contribute to an immersive experience that left me awe-struck. But it's not just the visuals that make Dragon Ball FighterZ an emotional journey. The gameplay itself is a testament to the love and passion put into this game. Each character feels unique and faithful to their source material, with their signature moves and personalities shining through. The combat is fast-paced, intense, and exhilarating, allowing for strategic battles that keep you on the edge of your seat. The satisfaction of landing a devastating combo or unleashing a spectacular super move is unmatched. Beyond the gameplay mechanics, the story mode of Dragon Ball FighterZ touched me on a deeply emotional level. The game's original storyline takes players on an epic adventure that explores themes of friendship, sacrifice, and the enduring spirit of Dragon Ball. The dramatic cutscenes, the heartfelt dialogues, and the nostalgic encounters with beloved characters brought tears to my eyes more than once. It reminded me of why I fell in love with Dragon Ball in the first place and rekindled that fire within me. Dragon Ball FighterZ also shines in its online multiplayer component. Competing against other players from around the world not only offers an opportunity to test your skills but also fosters a sense of camaraderie within the Dragon Ball community. The online community is passionate and welcoming, and the competitive matches are intense and gratifying. It's a testament to the game's ability to bring people together through their shared love for this incredible franchise. As I sit here, reflecting on my journey through Dragon Ball FighterZ, I can't help but feel overwhelmed with emotion. This game has taken me on a ride that I will cherish for years to come. It rekindled my love for Dragon Ball, brought back precious memories, and reminded me of the powerful impact this franchise has had on my life. Dragon Ball FighterZ is not just a game; it's a love letter to the fans, a celebration of everything that makes Dragon Ball special. If you're a fan of the franchise or even just a lover of fighting games, I implore you to experience this masterpiece. Get ready to unleash your inner Super Saiyan, because Dragon Ball FighterZ will leave you emotionally charged and eternally grateful for the memories it creates.

There was a meager balance update not long ago, supposedly another one in the future, but I was genuinely hoping to come back to this game upon desperately-needed rollback being implemented in the game since it was officially announced at EVO 2022. Yes, almost a year ago, and still no rollback - although Bandai Namco still insists it will happen.

These flaws aside, I wholeheartedly enjoy and recommend this game if you're a fan of Dragon Ball or fighting games in general. If you're new and intimidated by fighting games, I assure you that this game generally follows the formula of ""easy to pick up, hard to master"", and straight-up mashing will still be a fun experience before you take the time to formally learn the mechanics. The game is still going relatively strong, it's still a main stage EVO game this year in 2023, the player base is there even without console crossplay, and it's guaranteed that its popularity will rocket to the stratosphere upon rollback netcode becomes implemented and available.",1689287219,1689287219,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1. If you want to play MnK instead of controller it allows you to, but there is no option to actually switch input so that it would give you MnK keyboard button context rather than controller buttons.
2. This isn't really a gripe geared towards this game specifically it is more just towards fighting games in general, but there is a Dpad roll in the game that initiates special moves that definitely goes off of a pretty slim actuation point. It is VERY hard to get consistently and can be pretty frustrating. I personally would like to see fighting games do away with actuation based moves and instead just make more combo buttons and more ways to defend or avoid against those attacks. There's probably a way to bind macros for such moves making it unfair in online play and hardware based moves shouldn't be a part of any online game for above reasoning.

Unfortunately, the game fails at everything else. The story sucks narratively and gameplay wise. It's just repeated fights. While it does allow you to practice sort of, its just a slog. The alternative modes, just more fighting. No pretext, no purpose, no unlockables, just DLC. 

Speaking of which, the game feels very incomplete without the DLC. A major portion of your roster is locked behind it, and it is very unsatisfying to see. Also the netcode issues can make online play inaccessible, which is a huge downside. All these factors build up and bring down a great game. Even though Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 factually fights worse, the variety of things to do in the game has caused me to play it 5 times more than this. It sucks that Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 3 remains one of the few dragon ball fighters that has balanced these two factors. Fighting games need more than great fighting to be a great game.

-No real Transformations
-Close to cheating AI on Hard, even at level cap vs non-level cap. and AI being able to continue combos while youre on the ground so long as your pinkie toe is still sticking up like it put its dukes up and said bring it bitch.
-Serious lack of special abilities(Frieza makes me sad asf tbh. No death beam)
-No CAF(not a huge issue but the main boss looks like my Majin from Xenoverse 2 :D)
-Too much focus on PVP, but not at the same time.. like they left brokenly OP stuff and left others useless.
-No way to escape combos
-Not enough playable characters, too many DLC, basically you buy the game twice.
*-A lot of characters have absurdly broken combos, which turns into a + once you learn them

+Story thats actually different
+Flashy graphics
+Japanese and Eng dub voices
+Destructive environments
+Dramatic events(There are far too few IMO but its still a +)

-/+ Spam buttons and do the thing

6/10, get it on sale like i did. But more t han 50%. This game isn't worth 60$ by a long shot.


30 hour Edit:
The only consistancy in the game i've found is that the AI on Hard Arcade doesn't have an air combo or normal combo damage regression. Kid Buu just comboed me from 90% full health to 0 in one Ultimate Move combo which at the end was 130 hits. The AI Shouldn't have a drastic damage advantage over the player. The only reason this game has high reviews is due to the game being flashy. I love all things DBZ but I'd rather play Famicom DBZ games. Broken AI =/= Challenge.

It goes against Everything DBZ that you can't break a combo, especially ones so high. After reading and then performing how to Infinite people in corners with specific characters, I can't help but lack the understanding of why the developer hasn't patched these out or introduced the ability to break combos, at the very least with support characters. This is the first time i've ever regretting purchasing a DBZ title. I just want the Non-Online achievements because ive already been a part of cancerous game communities online. Just pick the 3 spammable characters and spam your medium attack until you're done. Boring as hell.



Edit: 100h After waiting several years, I came back to see if they fixed anything. Nope. In fact they made it worse with paid DLC being extremely OP online. Which has attributed to the death of the game. Several thousand people playing online scattered all over the planet mean extremely long(30-60m) queue times. Most of my game time is now waiting on a ranked match just to get the achievements. Using a VPN helps but it makes match making worse than it already is sometimes. Save yourself a headache and don't bother with it unless youre like a lot of us and just straight up DBZ fans and non-canon story doesn't bother you.",1538690238,1687890105,False,3,2,0.369386732578277588,1,True,False,False

        [td][h1]The Review[/h1][/td]
        [td]A very good Dragon Ball fighting game. The graphics look beautiful and the gameplay is fast and fun. The biggest surprised is that the story is very good also. My biggest issue with the game is that during the story campaign you mostly fight clones and that can get really repetitive. Highly recommend to both Dragon Ball and fighting game fans.[/td]

As for the actual game itself, pretty fun. Dragon Ball FighterZ strikes a sweet spot between being beginner friendly and having a solid skill ceiling. The auto-combo system is good for getting a general feel of the game, and the inputs are simple enough for anyone to pull off. A three-character team system also means more room for error and improvisation, especially with the Limit Break buffs and Sparking.

The matchmaking also works surprisingly well, so you won't get paired against a player too far out your league (unless you don't mind that).

Also runs decently well on low-spec PCs, always a good thing. So if you're a casual player or just a DBZ fan, this is a game worth checking out.

- Nice graphics. Low/mid-end PC can run the game.
- Main Z-fighters and villains are available.
- Movelists are easy to learn. (I'm able to play although I'm not really good at fighting game)
- Super attacks and meteor attacks from each character are magnificent like you are watching anime.
- Each dialog when characters face each others or be the same team is related to anime. If you are DB fans, you will understand.

Cons:
- Looks like AI has read inputs and has been a bit quicker than players' characters. AI quite takes advantage on players. There are ways to beat AI but getting S or A to rise up the upper path is hard.
- Boring story. No replay value.
- Overpriced. (recommend to wait until it's on sale)
- What is fatal error? It might appear without any reasons.

Neutral:
- I play offline mode. Arcade mode (random) is my favorite. Don't care of online mode.
- Some combos in training mode might be impossible to do by casual gamer but not necessary to do them all.
- You can use a keyboard but using a gamepad will get better experience.",1562690757,1685618270,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b][u]PROS[/u]:[/b] This is one of the most fine tuned Dragon Ball fighting games on the market.  The controls feel tight & well tuned, the action is fast & frenetic, & everything about it shows the quality the team put into the game, down to individual animations being tied to different aspects of Dragon Ball as a whole.  The visuals pop & represent the style of the series very well, & the audio just keeps that nature going, down to the ability to select songs from the Dragon Ball anime.  The wealth of additional fighters through the season passes will also please many fans.  Finally, with rollback netcode on the way, the online is only bound to get better.  That isn't to say it's poor where it is now, just having a few kinks.

[b][u]CONS[/u]:[/b] The story mode is a bit of a sticking point.  Where it is an entirely new story rather than treading old ground, it becomes a rather uninteresting slog with next to no variety on the way through it.  On top of that, the three campaigns don't line up with each other, making the first two feel like filler.  The online does have bouts of lag here & there, but that should be fixed with rollback netcode.  Cheaters & rage quitters aren't as prominent as they were years ago, but there's still no penalty for doing the latter of those two besides an eventual marking on one's name that takes far too long to take any kind of effect.

[b][u]ACHIEVEMENTS[/u]:[/b] This list can be a serious challenge.  Where many will be gotten through casual gameplay, some will not.  Arena matches are underutilized, & finding matches to play, let alone spectate, might take a bit.  Set For Life is an insane grind based achievement that will eventually be gotten through logins thanks to the sheer amount of Zeni giveaways tossed at the player.  My Power Level Is 530,000 is by far the most difficult, requiring players to win ranked battles all the way to 530,000 BP, an insane requirement considering one loses BP on lost matches.

[b][u]FINAL[/u]:[/b] Dragon Ball FighterZ is in contention for being the greatest Dragon Ball game on the market, & one of the best fighting games period.  The charm & aesthetic the game has just oozes from every beat of it.  With exception to the lackluster story, the game provides a great deal to those fans of fighting games, fans of Dragon Ball, & those who are interested in one or the other.  Without a doubt, this is an easy recommendation.",1684696697,1685245177,True,1,0,0.516795873641967773,0,True,False,False

As expected, Arcsys knocked it out of the park with the visuals. Honestly I think how good this game looks made it easier for me to learn. When I started, I didn't mind getting wombo bombo'd because it just looked so damn good getting 2 touched by some vet. Supers are flashy, impactful and just plain fucking awesome.

If there's one thing I think DBFZ has in spades, is its labbing potential. Johnnys can spend hours in training mode just labbing out different combos with different combinations of characters. To this day, I still see plenty of lab monsters posting insane combos that leave me speechless. It's precisely because I am so spoiled with this in DBFZ that I couldn't play GG Strive as my main FG, there simply isn't much to lab there.

Mechanically, it feels really good controlling a character. A good portion of the cast share a very similar BnB, so picking up a new character shouldn't take too long. This doesn't mean all the characters feel the same though, as you dive deeper into each one, they all feel very different from each other (yes, even the 75 different gokus). Motion inputs aren't too strict and are limited to 236/214 or 22X. The game also features 2 autocombos (Light and Medium) for new players to jump in with. I also appreciate how Light autocombo isn't just a newbie crutch, and does have practical uses as you get better and learn new combos.

Of course, no game is without its flaws, and DBFZ has some that might turn you away. Long combos are a big part of the experience, and if you don't like watching 15-30 second combos, you probably won't enjoy this game. I'm also iffy about how at some point after season 3, they decided to buff everyone and many characters have near-fullscreen range projectiles / gap-closers, which can make neutral feel alot more scrambly and unga bunga.

The community is still alive and well, and DBFZ has already been confirmed for this year's EVO. With rollback on the horizon and a recent balance patch, now is a great time to dragon some balls

The attention to detail in her character model and animations is impressive, capturing her beauty and grace.

Rating: ★★★★☆

Dragon Ball FighterZ, developed by Arc System Works, brings the iconic Dragon Ball series to life in a visually stunning and action-packed 2D fighting game. With its vibrant graphics, faithful character representations, and fast-paced gameplay, FighterZ successfully captures the essence of the beloved anime, providing fans and fighting game enthusiasts with an exhilarating experience.

One of the standout aspects of FighterZ is its remarkable visuals. The game beautifully replicates the vibrant art style of the Dragon Ball series, with characters that look as if they jumped straight out of the anime. The animations are fluid, and the special moves and energy attacks are visually spectacular, adding a sense of awe and excitement to every battle.

The gameplay in FighterZ is both accessible for newcomers and deep enough for competitive players. It adopts a simplified control scheme, allowing players to unleash devastating combos and flashy super moves with relative ease. However, mastering the mechanics and learning the intricacies of the game's tag system and assist attacks adds depth and complexity for those seeking a competitive edge.

The roster of playable characters is diverse and expansive, featuring a wide range of fan-favorite fighters from the Dragon Ball universe. Each character is faithfully recreated, not only in their appearance but also in their move sets and special abilities. From Goku and Vegeta to Frieza and Cell, every character feels unique and offers a different playstyle, providing plenty of options for players to find their preferred team composition.",1684518650,1684518650,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Bought it again and during raids I'm consistently hitting 19 frames. Rollback seems like the messiah at the minute cause it doesn't exist. I've seen apes with better server management skills. In short, if you can't handle an unplayable game when you're trying to have some coherent gameplay with friends DO NOT buy this game. £45 is a scam for an almost 5 year old game with less balance than a paraplegic on a tightrope, if you wanna buy it regardless of what I've stated (not sure why you would but go ahead it's your money) just go to CDKeys it's £7.

Played it a little more and 4 months later it's a sweaty game full of people who lack the mental skills to run 1+1 on a calculator. The only people who ""enjoy"" the game are masochistic fu cks who cannot enjoy any other game. They only really enjoy the game after they leech off their friends until they buy the game cause they wont shut the f uck up and then with the copious hours of complete swamp ass gathering they've mustered up while playing this shi tefest of a game they proceed to beat on the ""less skilled"" (more socially aware, hygenic people who don't reek of unfiltered ass) players.Then they stroke their ego acting as if they are good at the game when all they do is bi tch and moan every time they fight someone of higher ""skill"" (someone who has had less contact with women) cause they're all pus sies who can't handle a day without a dopamine hit and will fall apart in the real world.

Very fun game and fairly easy to get into, originally had the switch vers and put several hundred hours on it before getting it on pc. Tons of content to delve into, the graphics are absolutely beautiful, it can at times feel like you’re watching an anime. As someone who started playing it with zero fighting game experience I think its safe to say its very beginner friendly on the casual level and has a high skill ceiling. my only con besides the balance of some characters is that the game uses delay based online play, however bandai is currently working on a rollback patch which will hopefully fix this.

this is one of the worst fighting games i think i've played, like I actually feel scammed playing this. This game is just a combo simulator, go to practice mode, spend a couple hours learning a few combos then go into ranked to test them, then get absolutely destroyed by some guy on a smurf account. The matchmaking system in this game is probably the worst matchmaking system I have EVER seen. Casual shouldn't even exist, it's not even casual, it's casually get butt fucked every match. You would think ranked would be where it's difficult, but its not. Either way it doesnt matter, because you'll play against a guy who has 1k hours but is on an alt account because he needs to make himself feel better about his weight problems. Ever since the gogetas were introduced, the game got considerably worse. If you want to play a DBZ fighting game, go back and play budokai, or wait for the new one to come out. This game and all of its DLC is a WASTE of money. The team that worked on this game needs to kick rocks and stop making games, they failed at making a fighting game. If this game didn't have the Dragon Ball IP and it was something else, it would be dead in the water. For anyone who is reading this and wants to get the game, don't.

However, some players and critics have cited the game's repetitive gameplay mechanics and lack of variety in character moves and combos as major drawbacks, which can make the game feel stale and predictable over time. Additionally, the online matchmaking system has been criticized for its inconsistencies and long wait times, which can make it difficult to find matches quickly or easily.

Another criticism of the game is its reliance on auto-combos, which can make the game feel less strategic and rewarding for experienced players. Some players have also reported issues with the game's netcode, leading to lag and other online connectivity problems, which can make online matches frustrating and difficult to play. Additionally, playing in casual mode can be challenging, as it often pits players against opponents who are either smurfing (playing under a new account to face lower-skilled players) or who are far above their skill level, resulting in difficult matches where players are often trapped in infinite combos and unable to fight back, which you may as well grab a drink and popcorn to watch the show.

The netcode of the game is so shootily made that if someone is lagging it'll make the game feel like it slowed down to .25x speed and when you go back to normal it'll feel like the game is too fast. The characters and teams that are in the meta are going to be meta forever since the game isn't going to get anymore updates with the last update adding Lab Coat Android 21. Ranked seems more like a fun experience since most times even in the high ranks there are people who have just gotten the game since most of the sweats are playing casual preying on the inexperienced players who don't know how to play.",1652494085,1681799480,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,1,True,False,False

Some dislike this game because of auto combos, or only quarter circle command inputs or they feel it needs more mechanics.  That's fine if that's you.  In my view though, this game can be a lot of fun with people, and it attracts a very large audience, and it can get your friends into 2D fighting games when they might not have found out what a wonderful thing they can be otherwise.

I really do like the combo system it has, as well as the assist system.  I feel the game is really fleshed out now and has enough depth to keep people engaged at any level.  

Mechanics like Reflect have a ton of uses, counter play, create interesting interactions, and can take place of a lot of other options you might miss from other 2D fighters.

The gameplay is overall, more reactable, and about half of the confirms will come from neutral rather than pressure or setplay.  But that isn't a bad thing to be honest.

The characters do play pretty similar in a lot of aspects, but it makes hopping between characters not as much of a challenge, but there's still enough uniqueness to each character to make them compelling or fun in my view.

This might not be the deep dive tons of options super fast paced gameplay of Xrd I love, but it is very fun.

I'm looking forward to the rollback patch so it finally feels smooth online!

Hopefully with the incoming patch they will also even out the playing field a bit more, top level play is a lot of A21 and fusions and not a lot else.

3v3 takes a bit while to understand but once you get it team building is a fun process. 

The game has new player friendly combos with same button presses repeatedly if you land them that even look decent and a one button super dash that zooms you over to attack your opponent and that's a simple way to feel like you are doing a lot but it wont take long before you see something and go ""wait... you can do that?"" Then training mode does a decent job of teaching many of the rules and systems properly so you can ""get good"". Seriously the skill gap is so noticeable in 1v1 games if you like the game at all your ego will probably check you into trying to learn more and its a capable training mode (if you don't just blame the online connection.... its not great) and the options in training are great. Watching another player use one character demolish all three of yours can be humbling in a more unique way than other online games at least as far as what I am personally used to BUT! I will say.. once you land some cool combos you kinda feel a little super if you know what i'm sayin. 
I can't recommend story mode unless you love the dragonball universe because its all fan service character interactions layered behind a generic boring plot and weird battle path you follow to reach the end of levels? That's not why you get this though its the high pace frenetic combat that will have you watching long block strings, combos and cinematic supers but again if you love DBZ you are probably down for that.

Also if you don't want to play online or story there is an arcade mode for playing against cpu but its pretty bare bones and local play to enjoy turning your family and friends who don't play to space dust if that's more your thing. 

I hear rollback netcode is coming and that is apparently much better and once that comes you might even be able to take ranked mode seriously but even without it (ranked due to good online) it is tolerable to play others for fun.",1680568727,1680568727,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

So how does this game do?

1. Style: This game's style is off the charts. The developers did an amazing job staying true to the design of the anime and manga, and overall the game is pure eye candy.

2. Character choice: While this game does exclude a few cult favorites of dragonball, it has such a huge cast of very playable characters that it more than accomplishes a wide selection of good characters

3. Gameplay: This will definitely be a break point for some players, and that's fine. Defense is hilariously strong in this game. Extremely varied wakeup options combined with defensive moves, assists, invincible supers, and many more character specific responses allow the defender to have lots of agency, quite often to the detriment of the attacker. If this is a dealbreaker, allow it to be. This game is not for everyone.

Overall, a great adaptation of an extremely beloved IP. It's only gotten better over time, and still has an active community. Enjoy!",1680050042,1680050042,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Maybe there's more deep stuff hidden behind tons of practice, but as a mostly casual player there just doesn't seem to be much to this on a surface level compared to other fighting games.

It fills me with that nostalgia hit I always get from participating in this franchise, from when I watched it as a kid. I did want to preface this review with this in case I am using rose-colored glasses

However, this game isn't just that for me. It's also a quick to learn fighting game that has a skill gap. Anyone can play, but it is hard to master. I absolutely love the graphics of this game. Every fight seems to pop off the screen. Everything is so exquisitely detailed in that classic Toriyama style with a twist.

There are some drawbacks though. Not all the fighters can be played, a lot have to be purchased through DLC, and sometimes the special moves can be a bit complicated to pull off. You really need a controller to play this game, but that is the norm with these kind of fighting games anyways.

Overall, if you're a Dragon Ball fan looking to make this purchase, and are into these fighting games, I highly recommend it! I thoroughly enjoyed it! 7/10",1611636853,1679518977,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But overall, I would recommend this game to anyone who is looking to get into fighting games, and those who are veterans of the genre. This game truly embodies what makes Dragon Ball special to so many of us, and you can tell that every inch of this game is dripping with character. The roster of this game is impressive to say the least, and each character really feels like their own work of art as far as presentation goes. 

Pulling off combos in this game feels like you are jumping your opponent and unleashing an ungodly amount of hurt on them. Getting hit by combos in this game feel devastating, and like you are in a playback montage on your opponent's YouTube channel. The frustration, and glory are both equally addicting. And there is nothing more satisfying than landing a combo you've been trying to get down for hours.

This game rewards your success with an amazing amount of flare and flashiness, and it's enough to get anyone hooked. 

Diving deeper into the game though, there are some present issues that really do need to be addressed. For example, the net code and online play in this game is some of the most inconsistent I have ever seen. The developers have been saying for years that they plan on implementing rollback netcode into the game, however it hasn't come. Currently they are claiming that it's coming with the next season, but we will have to see. That improvement alone would make this game leagues better than it currently is. Also the DLC characters in the game, have clearly received more love and care than the rest of the base cast. They have made changes here and there to address the power creep, but nothing big enough to say it's not an issue. Some characters really could use new tools to bring them up to snuff with the rest of the cast, or at the very least some aspects that make them stand out a bit more.

Overall though, this game is just really fun. 8/10",1679328152,1679328152,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I kindly wish to raise your awareness to people trying to cheat you out of your steam points: The following comment is copy and paste from a lot of reviews on steam. People do that to trick you into giving you steam points (the steam currency) by posting something to appeal to your human compassionate aspect thereby ripping you off because it is all ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, lies and deceipt.

""I am a 52 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 16. My son recently started Dinkum and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.""",1679151739,1679151739,True,2,0,0.516243636608123779,0,True,False,False

1. The AI spams the same thing over and over again, to the point where it becomes annoying and somewhat predictable
2. Zamasu AI at level 100 is somehow able to break through your guard? I've seen this several times, where I'm blocking high, and he does the flying slash thing and he just hits me through the block
3. Tien AI, this AI is an actual PAIN! I hate Tien AI at level 100, the moment he hits you with a level 3, and he gets back down, HE TRIES TO GO FOR THE VOLLEYBALL FIST EVERY SINGLE TIME! I managed to predict this, and now, I can prevent him from hitting me with that.
3. Grappler AI at level 100, this is actually annoying, for no reason do they use the command grabs, even when I'm in the air, they go for it!
4. Counter AI at level 100, so, Vegito AI doesn't use his counter AT ALL, but Jiren uses it to the point where it just becomes spam... I throw out an attack, hup, Counter! Throw out a ki blast? Counter! literally do nothing? Counter(whiffed)!
5. CAPTAIN GINYU OF THE GINYU FORCE! Ok, this 1 is self-explanatory... level 50 to 100 Ginyu AI just spams the same attacks over and over again, to the point where you literally can't do anything! You're constantly in block stun, meaning you can't even reflect anything, this is bothering me because it's just so annoying!
6. AI sparking, the AI using sparking itself isn't the problem, it's just, they use it too early! They don't use it conservatively, like, they're low hp, or they're going for high damage, no, level 75-100 AI is blocking, you're attacking, SPARK! Nothing you can do about it, and then, they proceed to NEVER BLOCK AGAIN WHILE SPARKING IS ACTIVE!

While the graphics and animations are stunning, the gameplay itself quickly became dull and uninteresting. The moves and combos are limited, and the battles feel repetitive and unsatisfying.

Another issue is the online matchmaking, which can result in long wait times and frequent disconnects. Even when I did manage to connect to a match, the lag made it difficult to enjoy the battles. Overall, the online experience left much to be desired and detracted from the overall enjoyment of the game.

In conclusion, while Dragon Ball FighterZ may appeal to die-hard fans of the franchise, the lackluster gameplay and problematic online experience make it difficult to recommend to others. There are many other fighting games out there that offer a more enjoyable experience, and I would suggest looking elsewhere if you're in the market for a new fighting game.",1677113355,1677113471,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

as with basically every fighting game ever, the low-to-mid section of the ladder is LITTERED with smurfs. the moment I see a player card that reads ""36 games played, 30 wins"", is the moment I know that the next three minutes of my life are going to be absolute garbage. the fact that this shit isn't moderated in any way whatsoever is nothing short of idiotic, and the ranked experience here as a new player is nothing short of rancid ass.",1676264972,1676264972,False,3,3,0.493826419115066528,0,True,False,False

Let's start with the most pressing thing.  Matchmaking, you  get a white,blue, green, orange, red and pinkish Card to signify that you have won a certain amount and what not. That is the most Useless thing in the existence of the game.  You are paired up with people who had thousands of Hours logged into the game. Making this game VERY anti beginner friendly game. It better to go into ranked to get a Fair fight. F***ing Tekken 7,Guilty Gear, MK,street fighter is more friendly than this sad excuse of a fighting game. 

Let's talk about Gameplay... You have 4 buttons, Light, meds,heavy and projectile, you can block and what not, the basic for any fighting game. The problem comes when the meta has and will always be rushdown oppression. If you are new; I am sorry put down the controller for 30 sec while someone gets a 120 hit combo on you,all because you can't block one repetitive string that stun locks you out of recovering.  It is more apparent with the insane power creep. You have Gogeta(SS4) who can hit you with his 3 bar even when it should miss like goku's kaio ken move,You have kefla who can hit you anywhere on the map, You have Android 17(Ranger) who can outblitz you cause he can just zip zip zip everywhere and then you have the most egregious offender MUI Goku who ,not only online but AI as well, can blitz you because A) most of his move are counter moves B) He Can just dodge everything. oh and did I tell you that he can even counter your beam supers? You see the issue? 

Put him with any of the other people who are power crept to hell and congrats, you have a brain dead team who can just sweep and stun lock the shit out of you. The base roaster have it's offenders. (looking at you hit.)

You know the worst thing about this and why I would not recommend this to people. The Community, The community is the most toxic thing i have Ever seen. If you talk about VERY apparent issues, They tell you ""get good"" and "" you are just a casual"" Yea, no duh, you have to sink a minimum of 1000 hrs in the game, have a minimum a 1000 wins to be even heard. They do not help new players, all while they sit there and play like they a have a world tourney to uphold, They beat the shit out of you then complain when people Rage quit, They sweat so hard you can smell it coming through the netcode. Then complain that you are not fighting because you literally can't! Then when you point this out, they default back on what every Elitist say Get good or I don't like Rage quitters in my game! 

I like all things Dragon Ball, but this is the first thing Dragon Ball Related that made me say no... Xenoverse 2 is a better fighting game than this. I wanted to get into this after having logged over 600 hrs in tekken 7 between ps4 and steam,but i just can't this is last straw...",1669954934,1676247117,False,1,1,0.453400492668151855,0,True,False,False

This game is really fun and very challenging. Very open world and have a lot of content which you need to figure out yourself, with mechanics that I enjoy a lot.

First of all, it works fine in console, but it stutters a lot on pc and have terrible optimization, even with controls.
But the game is still new tho, so it may change in the future.

The start of the game is pretty good so far, but there is a lot of minor flaws like the scarcity of armor and ways to level without farming for hours straight.

The PVP is fun, although metas and high damaging magic ruins it sometimes, it's really fun!

The Co-op on the other hand is not that viable, it works and are bareable, but could've been better.
It is coop, but there's too many restrictions and too many steps to get 1 session, which you need to repeat when you die to get back in the session.

The weapons are really good, and the way you acquire them is pretty fun, but it is disappointing that magic deals too much damage and also the fact that one of the highest damage dealing weapons is easily acquired at the start of the gaming without beating the boss.

Overall, this game is fun if you like souls-like games or simply hard single player campaign games, I do hope that they fix a lot of things tho.

It has an easy to figure out combat system that you can stick with and then get better with slowly. All you need is 3 characters your good at. In my opinion both ssj saiyans are a good start for 2 characters. The third can depend on your playstyle. One of my only main issues is the fact that half the roster is behind a paywall but what can you really expect from a dbz game?

My son recently downloaded DragonBall FighterZ and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

I have always considered the Street Fighter (for 2D) and Tekken (for 3D) to be the best franchises in this genre; but I can say that DBFZ has taken the crown for me. Being based on an anime series I like certainly helped, but previous games for the same IP didn't have the appeal this game has.

Gameplay is important in any game, but for fighting games it's even more so, because it's a genre that depends on tight controls, the correct pacing and movements to be good, and DBFZ offers all that, with a very good transcription of what is seeing of television and what happens in the battles. Presentation is excellent, with a story mode that is fun to play; battles are frantic, but understandable, with quick movements and powerful attacks. All in all, it's a great game, one that can offer a lot of hours of fun.

My only complaint is that DLCs are expensive for what they offer. New characters are interesting, and the base game already offers a good roster, but optional content could be cheaper. Anyway, I recommend this game, as this is my favorite since the appearance of the 1990's franchises that are still relevant today.",1674492410,1674492410,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My name is Patrick Bateman.
I'm 27 years old.

I believe in taking care of myself, in a balanced diet, in a rigorous exercise routine.
In the morning, if my face is a little puffy, I'll put on an icepack while doing my stomach crunches.
I can do a thousand now.
After I remove the icepack, I use a deep-pore cleanser lotion.
In the shower, I use a water-activated gel cleanser.
Then a honey-almond bodyscrub.
And on the face, an exfoliating gel-scrub.
Then I apply an herb mint facial masque,
which I leave on for ten minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine.
I always use an aftershave lotion with little or no alcohol,
because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older.
Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm, followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.

There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman.
Some kind of abstraction, but there is no real me.
Only an entity-- something illusory.
And though I can hide my cold gaze...
and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours...
and maybe you can even sense our life styles are probably comparable,

This game is an absolute blast to play casually.  You can pick it up and immediately pull off amazing looking combos and shoot Ki blasts while flying through the air.  For me, this is the closest a game has come to feeling like you're actually playing an episode of DBZ or Super.  Movements are fluid, combos are crisp, animations are perfect, and hits are impactful.  The story mode is lackluster, but passable enough as an excuse to learn the basics.

Once you get past using Autocombos and start learning the actual fighting system underneath, there is no end to the depths of the combos you can pull off.  It feels like an even faster BlazBlue, with combo strings of 20+ inputs.  You will find yourself pulling off a normal combo, launching your opponent into the air, comboing them into a wall bounce, grabbing in the air into a sliding knockdown, and calling an assist to keep the opponent juggled while you reset and start the combo again.  Input buffering makes it fairly simple to pull these combos off, though it becomes trickier online if you have a large frame delay.

Note that I said simple, not easy.  This is a game you can play casually and never touch the depths of the systems, or a game you can lose hundreds of hours in if you choose to master its mechanics fully.  It's rare to find a game that handles both well, but DBFZ manages to do so.

At this point, there is not a huge community, but I really don't have trouble finding online matches when I want them.  It's old enough now though that I would definitely wait for a sale -- it's 90% off during most sales.  If you have any interest in DB or Fighting games, as you probably do if you're reading this, it's absolutely worth picking up for $6.",1673618444,1673618444,True,10,0,0.669759392738342285,0,True,False,False

This game is the most easiest game i ever played of the fighting game category other than Street Fighter franchise, Tekken Franchise, Mortal Kombat, Justice League, etc and etc...

It's really fun and easy to know/master each combos and move sets if you like to study of this game.
It has Auto-combos, simple move for each abilities of each characters. All characters have the same joystick move set for the abilities and Supers/Ultimate.

The training is very helpful to understand the mechanics of this game and within 10-20 hours, i already done the BnB combos for 3 characters and will learn more. (Bread and Butter: good optimal combos. Almost 90% of every characters have the same BnB combos or you can say universal BnB combos).

Anyway, if you like intense and anime feeling, this game is for you. Although the price is expensive but it really worth it. Better to buy it during the sale. 

Told my friend who rarely play any fighting game to get DBFZ. After some times, he love it and consider it the most easiest game to learn how to fight.

Developers usually have to tip-toe across a metaphorical tightrope to make sure they don't fall entirely into one or the other. Balance in competition is key, thus many devs obsessively try to tweak their game into being perfectly competitive. This often results in rigid, super-streamlined fighters that almost feel like an elaborate game of charades. You think a legitimate bout is occurring, but really, it's all by the numbers. 

Dragon Ball FighterZ says: ""Y'know what, screw it, just swan dive into the fun tank."" 

100+ hit combos on a whim, planet-destroying instakill moves everywhere, tons of combinations and transformations, you name it. Casual players have an accessible and flashy combat sandbox to play in, while pros can dig into the meat and make some really badass stuff happen.

But in the small amount of time I've played, the game is super fun to play. There's a massive skill ceiling with some of the most snappy and fun combat most of any game I've ever played. The visuals are absolutely stunning and the voicework is superb. I never feel really cheated out of a loss, and discovering new combos and character synergies is some of the most fun I've had with a  game in a while. I'd totally recommend.

First things first, the top four or five characters of this game are far, [b] far [/b] better at playing it than the rest of the cast. You don't have to play them to win, to be good, or to have fun, but playing against them without having them on your team, you can feel the difference in capability almost immediately. Team synergy is far more important in this game than the raw power of individual characters, but man. Vegito, Lab Coat 21, Gogeta 4, Gohan, and Gogeta blue are playing a different game. 

Does this change whether I believe the game is worth picking up and playing? Absolutely not. It's still fun, easy to pick up for new players, there's a ton of room for personal choice and creative freedom, the game is reasonably balanced despite the top tiers, and the playerbase isn't inactive. There's a ton of players playing this game at every skill level, so you [b] will [/b] find good matches, and you [b] will [/b] have a ton of fun discovering new stuff and getting better. Rollback is still (hopefully) coming, and that will only open up matchmaking even further. This game isn't going anywhere.

Original review:

TLDR is at the bottom for those of you that don't want to hear me preach.
Dragon Ball Fighterz is the perfect fighting game for newcomers to the genre. To see if DBFZ is right for you, consider the following questions:

[b] -Do you like fighting games, or want to break into the genre? [/b]
[b] -Do you like Dragon Ball? [/b]
[b] -Do you like mashing buttons and watching cool shit happen? [/b]

If you answered yes to any of these questions, congratulations, you should buy DBFZ.
DBFZ is a 3v3 tag-team fighter, and although the game is fairly well-balanced, there are certainly characters within it that are much better off than others. However, the bottom of the tier list is not very far from the top. Any character can work on any team! Pick whoever you want, jump into casuals, and play some matches. The game goes on sale fairly often, and while you don't need the DLC to play, most of the DLC characters are better than the characters in the base game. So if you like it, shell out the extra cash. Wait for it to go on sale before you do buy it though, please.

The game has a great modding community as well, with skins, stages, music packs, aesthetic overhauls, whole new characters, and even a mod that replaces the voice lines in the game with lines from Dragon Ball Z Abridged. Bobs your uncle. You can only play online against other people using mods though, so... don't take them online. Anti-cheat won't let you play if you do. 

Boot Camp takes you through EVERYTHING the game has to offer, and I mean e v e r y t h i n g. Training mode has a LOT of options, letting you practice almost any interaction you can think of: learning how to tech throws, setups for your character, practicing your own mixups and combos... all with the ability to change the frame delay, input delay, enemy counterattack settings, etc. Its a lot. RathFGC has a pretty good guide to training mode on youtube, it's a little old, but nothing available within the mode has changed since then; new characters have been added and balance changes have been made, but the mode remains the same. 

The servers are pretty packed whenever I log on, no matter what time of day it is. Casual matches are always easy to find in my experience, but ranked is a totally different story. You wait forever for matches, and when you do find one, they're not even close to your skill level most of the time. At least you can fuck around in training mode while you wait, right? 
Also, ranked matches are first to two, while casuals can be rematched any number of times. I personally wish ranked was first to three, but that's just my opinion.

Online play right now is... questionable. When you and your opponent both have a good connection, the game plays so smoothly that I can't even tell it's online sometimes. But, if it slightly dips, or god forbid, one of you is playing on wifi, get ready to lag your whole ass off. The developers are working on implementing rollback right now, which would ideally solve these problems, but right now, it isn't great. Not unplayable at a casual level, but not great.

Aside from online play, the game doesn't have all that much to offer. The story is not well-written, although it will give you a few laughs if you're a fan of the series. It takes a good long while to beat, and you have to beat it to unlock Android 21, so. Good luck. You can also buy her in the shop in the game, or for $4.99 on steam if you don't want to wait. Arcade mode is much the same; not very deep, fun maybe a few times, but you have to play it to unlock SSB Goku and Vegeta. You can also get them both by hitting certain Zeni milestones in game, which takes a little bit longer if you aren't playing that often. The AI is brain-dead, and once you get even slightly okayish at the game, it will never present a challenge again. The combo trials aren't helpful and don't teach you anything particularly useful about any of the characters, although they are pretty fun to blaze through. Some of them haven't aged well with patches though, and are oddly tricky to complete.

One last thing. In my experience, this game has a bit of a smurfing problem. Just a warning.

TL;DR: I love this game.

Pros:
-easy to pick up with a decent amount of depth and set play once you get invested
-a good size community of players, never hard to find matches in casuals
-every character is viable and has dedicated players that have found good tech already, and new stuff is still being found, surprisingly
-teaches a lot of fighting game fundamentals in a beginner-friendly way by making most options reactable
-the devs are in the process of implementing rollback netcode
Cons:
-half of the roster is DLC, and that half is better than the base cast
-have to play the garbage arcade/story modes to unlock SSB Goku, SSB Vegeta, and Android 21, unless you want to pay
-the current delay-based netcode is dodgy and not great to play on unless both players have great internet connections
-ranked matches are hard to find and even harder to get paired against someone close to your skill level
-a non-zero amount of smurfs",1663846939,1671435934,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Graphics are beautiful.  Every character looks amazing.  And even the backgrounds are very nice.  The art in this game is better than a lot of the art from the actual show.  The game uses a mini town hub to select what activity you want to participate in and everything looks competent there.  But all the gushing is really for the story mode cut scenes and the actual battles.  I really can't praise the graphics enough.

Music is pretty good.  It sounds ""dragon ballish"" if that makes any sense.  It's nothing you will find yourself wanting to jam outside of the game.  But it all seems to fit.

The sound is a mixed bag.  Mostly good.  One of the best things I want to point out is it seems to have the entire Japanese and English voice casts from the show.  I've watched the entire series in Japanese and English dubs.  If it ain't the cast from the show in each language then they need a freaking award for best imitations I've ever heard.  And you can switch between these freely in the sounds menu.  During combat it can get pretty noisy though.  It all sounds good - hits, combos and special attacks.  Characters have special voice lines when they do certain things.  But in certain situations it can all overlap a be a bit of overload.

Practice mode.  As someone who was away from the genre for a long time this mode was pretty important to me in the beginning.  I want to say overall it does a pretty good job at teaching you the basics of the game.  It does challenge you with some pretty dang difficult combo strings to pull off that seem unrealistic in actual matches with a live opponent.  But maybe I am just noob here and I will get to that later.

The game claims I am roughly half way through the story mode.  And I have to say it is fairly lengthy.  I don't know if that is par for the course nowadays for the genre.  But there are A LOT of cinematic scenes and dialogue.  An overall critique of the story itself is... eh.  It's there.  I won't spoil anything.  You can tell they put some effort in.  But even half way through I am still a bit confused about wtf is going on but maybe it will all make sense in the end.  There is also an item system that seems exclusive to this mode but for me it just makes the experience even more confusing.  I think they could have done without it.  Not a single encounter has been challenging.  I didn't see a difficulty option and maybe it has been ramping up at a snails pace.  They must have thought they had a top notch dragon ball esk story lined up that even if it's your first time playing a fighting game you could experience it.  The difficulty is flatter than a plate full of piss and the item system adds needless complexity.  But other than that it's fine.

Local multiplayer is near perfect.  Almost everything you would expect is there but nothing that detracts from it's identity.  I'd like to have seen some handicap options as my only local opponent is my 9 year old daughter.  It's like if it were Goku vs. Krillin in dbs.  I can't really go all out on her.  It would be cool to give her the win if she could land a single combo string on me or something rather than me having the drop the quality of my already poor quality play to give her the W or make it close.

Online play.  Shew... There is a ranked and casual match making system.  You can edit the options before hand to try and find only folks that have a good connection to you.  Seems to work well because I've not had any lag during any of my matches.  So at least for me, online felt about as good as local.  But now I am going to talk a bit more about how exactly games seem to play out.  Every single character can execute nice looking combo strings by repeatedly pressing a single button.  Some characters will even mix in lows and overheads.  Veterans who have spent a lot of time with the game will know what is coming and when.  Noobies like myself who has not memorized every characters combo strings are at a disadvantage.  But needless to say knowing how to block and counter with some sort of punish is important.  And I mentioned earlier that I may be noob when it comes to thinking some of the elaborate combo's aren't viable in actual matches.  But hot damn. Most of the folks I have played against were exceptionally deadly if they landed even one attack.  I've been combo'd for nearly half a characters health multiple times by very grand and impressive looking combo's.  I have managed to squeak out the occasional win against these behemoths with shear fundamentals.  It really felt like I had to outplay my opponent constantly because one slip up from me was devastating.  I'm going to say it's great because I did enjoy the challenge and I felt next to no lag.  But if you are not willing to invest the time you will get smoked.  I never once played against a person similar to my skill level or lower.  To be expected as old as the game is - everyone active online seems to have the ability to be somewhat competitive.  Side note: Not a dead game as of this review.  Always tons of folks in the lobby ready to que up.  Never had to wait long for a match.

Lastly... DLC content.  I'm not new to the concept.  But this def pops my cherry for how monetization works in modern fighting games.  I bought the game on sale with a fighting pass that came with a few of the oldest DLC characters.  I still lack 12 characters.  Even if they go on sale at half price for 2.50$USD I'm still looking at 30$ to complete the collection.  On top of the (I think it was 15$ paid for the deal at the time) for the base game and a few extras.  Which is a bit steep imo for how old the game is.  But not terrible since you can acquire everything for roughly 50$USD if it's on sale.  And you are encouraged to buy the DLC character's.  They all seem better than the original in the base game via various means.  More overheads and lows in there combo's to force your opponent to be more proactive with blocking.  Downright quicker, maybe more range on a few attacks.  It's all there.  You can win with base game characters,  But your work is cut out for you.  I complain about cost because the age of the game.  But if you are really having a good time it's not that bad of value - again, with a sale.  Also kind of sucks how some characters are simply outclassed and become jokes.  I guess that is also just like the show too though.

Oh and there is also an in game currency you earn perpetually that is used to unlock color schemes for characters and various things for your lobby avatar.  Unlocks work in a loot box type manner and you can earn duplicates but those seem to turn into a special currency.  But when you use that special currency, to my understanding, you cannot get duplicates.  A round about way to have you play more.  Also if you are playing in an online lobby around certain holidays there are certain things that can only be unlocked during those holidays.  So that is kind of neat.

Overall to super summarize I do recommend.  Even to newer folks to the genre.  Especially to fans of dragonball.  If you are a fan of both what have you been doing with your life to not have this?  All the characters have iconic attacks from the franchise.  It feels good, looks good and sounds good.  Expect no quarter this far in to the games life cycle when it comes to online play.  Everyone is dangerous and absolute monsters.  Prepare for a challenge.  However, I would only recommend buying on sale.  The full price for the base game and all DLC combined is absurd.  But an easier pill to swallow when at least 50% off.",1663558489,1671252276,True,16,0,0.65964275598526001,0,True,False,False

But the problem is they only give you like half a roster and expect you to pay an additional €5,- per character. Which is a complete sham when you consider that you take 3 characters with purposefully limited movesets and specific roles in your team to essentially build one full character. Even different forms/transformations of the same characters are used as an excuse to just sell you a whole ""new"" character. Having or not having certain characters greatly impacts your options. Oh and the base game is [i]still[/i] full price after all this time as well. Costing €60,- for what is essentially a bare bones starter edition that after all this time should definitely be half price at the very least. One that in hindsight wasn't worth the price even at launch, monetizing all aditional content like it's a F2P title..

Sure the roster was very limited but I figured hey you know what the basics are all here (a few characters to play with, a story mode, some arcade modes, etc.) they will probably update and support this game for a while to come. What I didn't know was that every little snippet of content was going to come with another price tag attached. There is a way to do DLC's and this ain't it. Loved playing this at launch but quickly stopped when I noticed what they were doing with their cash grab DLC's. Gone are the days of old when a company making a DBZ fighting game would take the time to create a fleshed out roster of characters with complete movesets and sold us a finished game.

Total cost of the game is now at €160,- and still rising... Only buy on sale at like 75% discount if you ever get that lucky.",1670790654,1670874093,False,1,0,0.494699656963348389,0,True,False,False

Besides worldwide online play, fighting your friends online is VERY fun and can be played for hours if you and your friends have a decent internet connection. Even if you get bored of some of the standard characters and options there is a army of DLC to buy for a ""worth it"" price. Personally I would say the game is a 9/10 and is worth AT MOST $60.

mvc like gameplay with 3 on 3 fights, assists, supers, tags, etc.

flashy level 3s, tons of custom voice lines and interactions based on who you're playing voiced in both JP and ENG by the classic actors, a relatively engaging singleplayer game (which you kinda have to play to unlock two chars).

AMAZING music! really great soundtrack with a ton of good shit to listen to during fights. the visuals, ofc, are amazing as well, with the beam and destructive finishes and even deflecting energy to have it land in the background scenery and crater it is just awesome.

Season 1: Oki meta which forces a guess of high or low. Snap vanish meta which is tagging your opponent character for another resulting three-way guessing of rock paper scissors (High, Low, or Air Grab). Cell one-touch + sparking-less damage that does 50% no assist needed. Kid Buu's damage is abysmal, especially landing level 3 on top of it.16 level 3 Oki meta, 21 level 3 Oki meta, Bardock level 3 Oki meta, a true 50/50. 

(I dropped the game after messing around with Bardock and Broly. Too many variables as in opening opponents in raw defense with command throws and level 3 Oki meta.)

Season 2: Came back after the DLC character GT Goku was added. The meta in general was tuned down the last time I visited season 1. Snap vanish and the level 3 Oki meta was reduced still strong.  My team was GT Goku, Vegito, and Cooler. During those matches, I didn't know GT Goku was a meta character so I think most of his tools were mediocre until the tournament event when Japan players along with Go1 used a ""Spirit Bomb"" level 3 which turns into a combo or a true 50/50 on Oki. So the Oki meta was tuned down and given to a single character that does 90% by GT Goku self. Next thing everyone has GT Goku on their team while repeating the meta-strategy same as Season 1.

(Just realized the piccolo meta. That was nerfed and buffed along the way and finally BALANCE including Zamasu. Piccolo is not really considered a meta character though debatable. The meta was Hell zone grenade which is when a bar is dispersed for a ki blast ambushed which is considered a 50/50. That is fair due to spending resources during the session.)


Season 3 (Current): At the beginning, every character that was non-meta was giving buffs. Goku, Trunks, Krillin, Frieza, Cell, etc, including the meta characters although were given, nerfs still strong. The game was overwhelmingly balanced and had a good momentum after announcing Ui Goku and Kefla. First Kefla was released and then UI Goku. Once again another DLC character, UI Goku to no surprise became a meta character with command throws. Now failed to mention that in Season 2 ninety percent of the DLC characters have command throws. In this Season command throws are buffed by cutting bar disbursement by 50%. So, back to UI Goku's command throw. The move itself can be transitioned into three stances with a mid that's +3 on block, a double DP, and a cancel. The damage from command throws is insane. There are over 49% of the cast including DLC have command throws. The final characters of Season 3 are Master Roshi, Super Baby, and Super Sayian 4 Gogeta. THEY ALL HAVE COMMAND THROWS. 

Season 3.5(Current): So the meta has shifted to characters with command throws that due damage right. Season 3 was wrapped up until another character was announced. The laziest character for the final season is Lab Coat 21. It could have been Whis or Hercule, whatever. Lab Coat 21 is by far the most broken fighting game character that I have ever seen in the FGC. Lab Coat 21 has an overhead mix-up, level 3 Oki, over 5 LOW OPTIONS, Command grab, an INVINCIBLE COMMAND GRAB THAT REDUCES YOUR CHARACTERS DAMAGE BY 21%, and a grounded stomp that picks characters off of Oki. THE ONLY CHARACTER THAT HAS THAT IN THE GAME BY THE WAY.

Command throws are crazy wait unit fusion meta. Fusion meta was never a thing until season 3.5 when Vegito can reach across the screen with a medium punch, safe on block too. On counter hit does 65% because developers felt Vegitos damage wasn't already good enough. Vegito Medium Punch has push back if failed to mention this before so good luck punishing it. The same can be said with Gogeta Blue just damage buffs.

Conclusion: I do not want to get political but this is what happens when a woman is in full control of a fighting game. No honor whatever makes the most money can keep the players hooked. I am done with this game. I do not like losing to lag. I do not like having buttons eaten by delayed frames. I do not like getting command thrown in lag or in general. I do not like broken characters that take away damage during the session. I am STRETCHED from playing Dragon Ball Fighter Z. As a Dragon Ball Z, Kai, Superfan that has played every Dragon Ball fighting game, Budokai, Tenkaichi, and Ranging Blast this has to be the s****** fighting game that I have ever played. I will most likely purchase the next one when it comes out until then PEACE OUT.",1603587820,1669333465,False,0,0,0.477456629276275635,0,True,False,False

Animation and Graphics are so good.

Story is boring af because of the weak clones and repeated fights. 

Ranked and Casual matches are good but the game need an update to punish quitters.

Moderately simple campaign (as most Dragon Ball game stories go) and is fun and to the point.
Graphically, this game is outstanding, capturing the aesthetic of Dragon Ball Z perfectly whilst being fluid and smooth. Performance in this game is perfect with great scalability for different computers.

Unfortunately to attain all characters you are going to have to spend a pretty penny for the DLC characters, I would recommend getting a CDkey or waiting for Sales. The DLC are all amazing, however I believe theres a few missed opportunities in regards to some of the choices of the characters. But alas, I enjoy 'em.

[b]Hi, I'm DragonBall FighterZ's official subreddit creator, and I'm posting this review, with the help of our current megathread created by Electric over /r/DragonBallFighterZ![/b]

Dragon Ball FighterZ is a Dragon Ball fighting game developed by Arc System Works and published by Bandai Namco. It released in 2018, and has had three competitive seasons since then. Each competitive season has also had an accompanying DLC release schedule, with over 17 DLC fighters released since the start of Season 1, and two more coming before the end of Season 3.

A Season 4 is highly likely, and Arc System Works (along with BamCo) have been supporting the competitive scene very heavily through sales to extend the game's lifespan and prize pools for tournament play.

[b]HOW TO PLAY[/b]

FighterZ can be purchased on any platform or PC, and will run on most systems. The game frequently goes on sale for as low as $9, and you can find current system requirements via Steam. Several DLC passes are also available, and can be purchased on sale during the same sale windows. The game can generally be found at a discounted price at least once per month.

If you don't wish to buy DLC, the base game comes with 21 characters.

[b]DO I NEED A FIGHTSTICK OR ARCADE STICK TO PLAY?[/b]

NO, you do not need any special tools or equipment to play or be good at the game. 75% of the competitive playerbase uses a standard Dualshock controller. Any professional player will tell you that FighterZ has been designed with ""ease of access"" in mind. While it isn't the easiest game to learn, it's very beginner friendly, and there are no entry barriers other than how much you're willing to learn.

That said, if you're dead set on obtaining some cool peripherals, highly consider checking out Battlebeaver Customs for controller orders and HoriUSA or Hitbox for fight/arcade sticks. If you'd like to learn more about making a fightstick of your own, you can check out r/fightsticks.

[b]WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES FROM PLATFORM TO PLATFORM?[/b]

Playstation 4 is the most active, due to its use as the main tournament client. Other consoles are also well populated. PC players are also very active, though this may vary region to region. FighterZ is currently the most popular anime fighter on PC by far, and one of the five most popular fighting games on PC. It is considered one of the Big 3 competitive fighting games.

[b]IS THIS GAME HARD TO LEARN?[/b]

All fighting games are hard, but DBFZ was designed to be easy to learn for Dragon Ball fans that may not be experienced in fighting games, yet still hard to master. The game features easily performed inputs (quarter circles) and something called a ""magic series,"" which is a combo that can be performed by 66% of the cast. The /r/DragonballFighterZ Discord server also features a litany of coaches and helpers who are more than happy to help you figure the game out.

The community itself is incredibly active and lively, and you'll generally find someone who can help you at all hours of the day.

[b]IS THIS GAME COMPETITIVE?[/b]

YES! As mentioned before, FighterZ is one of the ""big three"" fighting games right now. It's regularly featured at EVO, and with a possible fourth season on the horizon, the game's future is looking bright. Expect to find a ton of events throughout 2021, and likely beyond. A possible re-release with all of the DLC content may also come for next generation consoles, which currently feature crossplay with their predecessors.

You can also find the game's top players on twitch, but you can also observe fan favorites like DotoDoya, LotusAsakura, or learn from players like RathFGC, LordKnight, Rooflemonger!

[b]WHAT CHARACTERS ARE GOOD? DO I NEED THE SEASON PASS(ES)?[/b]

EVERYONE IS VIABLE, but there are some popular characters among the DLC cast. UI Goku (Season 3), GT Goku (Season 2), and Z-Broly (Season 1) are some of the standouts. You do not, however, need any of the DLC to play the game competitively. Among the base cast, Kid Buu and Android 21, for example, are highly regarded characters.

Though tier lists will vary from player to player, it is an indisputable opinion that every character is viable.

The Season Passes will deliver any character from the season in its name.

[b]Overall, an amazing fighting game. For more, come say hi over /r/dragonballfighterz, we'll be more than happy to have you there with us :)[/b]",1608778523,1667954491,True,171,9,0.729914844036102295,0,True,False,False

The balancing is a little over the place, but if you just play the game for fun with a couple of buddies and not too seriously, you can still have a great time.

However, if you dare go online, have fun pal! The online experience really makes you feel better about yourself because you know that half of these guys haven't spoken to their families in months labbing combos on their tierwhore pick of a character, making the experience all the better.

In it's final state, FighterZ is the best 2D fighting game of this decade. The years of support, updates, DLC, and regular online events have made it fairly balanced and approachable, while also maintaining a fan-focused presentation and high skill ceiling. Action and Special inputs are reasonable and forgiving, so the process of discovering and crafting combos is incredibly satisfying. To be perfectly honest, inputs in FighterZ are simply unmatched. Some of the DLC characters can be tricky to learn, but if you tell the game to do it, you will not be told ""no."" Other fighting games will restrict the timing of inputs to certain frames and such if you want to pull-off a sick combo, but FighterZ is purely visual. Make a light-attack, press the heavy-attack before the animation ends. When you lose in FighterZ you will rarely, if ever, blame the game for misreading your intentions. I love it, A+ 10/10.

Offline modes are fine. Nothing extraordinary. You have 9 simple arcade modes, a straight-forward story mode with RPG mechanics, combo challenges, and tons of guided training modes. The story mode can be slog, but it's also fully voice-acted by the original cast and stuffed to the brim with fan-service dialogue. In the dojo, you also have the ""tournament of power"" modes, which are essentially a supplement to the lackluster arcade (with beefy in-game currency rewards). 

At it's core, FighterZ is a well-written love-letter to the series, which just happens to come in the form of a lightning-fast, hella-hype tag fighter. If you aren't a Dragon Ball fan, however, the complete game offers enough character variety and unique presentation to keep you interested long-term.",1665960894,1666341715,True,1,0,0.515669524669647217,0,True,False,False

The story is actually good, but not the story mode. I like that Yamcha is useful again as well as the other side characters that Z and Super throw to the side. But the actual gameplay of story mode is... eehhhh.
It's serviceable enough I suppose, but enemies start off really weak, then go to way too strong. I get why the final boss is like that, but why everything else? 

Arcade mode, is an arcade mode. That is basically it.

This game is just ok. I would recommend it only to highly competitive fighting game players. However, my biggest problem with this game, is not the game or story itself, it is the pricing.
$80 FOR A FIGHTING GAME!? I got this on sale for like 6 bucks yet I still kinda feel ripped off. This is a complaint I have for all of modern gaming, but this is preposturous. AT LEAST SONIC FORCES, MY LEAST FAVOURITE GAME OF ALL TIME, HAD STUFF TO DO. This is just an excuse to throw tournaments and nothing else. 

Instead of spending $80 on this, spend $70 on Xenoverse 2, an actual good game with thought, care, and stuff to do put into it.
