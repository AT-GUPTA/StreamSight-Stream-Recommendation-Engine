the tutorial map shows basically everything this game has to offer : not much

i would also warn about the game being oddly optimized. in the beginning it made my graphic card roar way too much and i had to disable the shadows, and lower other settings (but the fps were pretty fine). also, it started dropping steam cards only a few minutes after launch, which as far as i know disables refunds

from the store page and the reviews, i would have expected much more open and varied areas and a much more dynamic gameplay, but it's always the same boring pattern of dark caves that are very frustrating to navigate with a map that does not help much in which we perform the same boring tasks, even with the class with the best mobility (scout)

the game revolves around getting into a map, completing a mission of a specific type among several (like gathering resources, hunting, building a pipe system) and then backtracking to leave. completing a mission can take dozens of minutes, so it might not be ideal for people with not a lot of free time, especially in multiplayer as one griefer would be enough to waste a play session.

overall it's not fun, it's bland and shallow  and it's more like a job

gathering is unfullfilling, and frustrating at times, with the resources required by the tasks too difficult to find (usually they don't exist in enough amount, only what is required by the task) and too difficult and time-consumming to mine, sometimes requiring dozens of minutes of running in circles around the entire map to find all of them, that, or have to waste all that time and end giving up on the side mission. said resources are then used to buy meaningless, superficial upgrades that exist in very small amounts for the pieces of gear, and that may just as well not be used at all, which is fine balance-wise, but in this state, just boring. and all that to go and grind more meaningless resources. as a bonus, the mining is rather slow, tedious, and boring. at least, as a solo player we can get around this with a companion robot that can mine stuff for us and do it faster

the weapons and gadgets are pretty boring to use, and the too limited ammo (especially for some gadgets) makes it worse. there are games with much more dull gunplay than deep rock galactic, but it's still not great. plus, the enemies are boring and are almost always the same, with little variation. it's not that bad, but it's not really fun or engaging either. at times, spiderman-ing all over the place with the scout's grapling to perform different actions in a hurry during combat can be somewhat interesting, but again it's still not really great, especially given the rest of the game's environment.

the difficulty levels ranging from 1 to 5 are dumb and unbalanced. 4 and 5 are a ""the developpers did not test their own game"" situation and losing or not does not depend on players skill and the mobs and combat mechanics are fucking lame and overpowered. even the event tasks in any difficulty. the game heavily discriminates against and punishes solo players for being solo players, as companies do as usual, but they make shitty events that may let players earn rewards, well maybe or maybe not, who knows, because a timer is imposed there and there is just not enough time to complete them, so that you did everything right, like having 2 minutes to go and killing health sponge mobs and collecting and bringing 6 resources from them that you have so slowly carry to some pod, and have the timer end 2 or 3 seconds before you can use the pod while you are next to it. very few games make me go ""wow this is so lame and such a waste of time, what a shitty game, let's do something else"" and alt f4 midplay and this ""game"" is one of them
 
account and characters level ups let players unlock and buy more upgrades but also cosmetics. but after about 10 hours of active playtime, the game has nothing to show for it. there are very few unlocks and they are barely visible, are very similar to eachother, and pretty ugly and uninteresting. it's very meager. i did not even bother with them and mostly kept the base looks because there is no point to it. a few cosmetics can also be unlocked by having a chance to have a chest-like event spawn in a mission or reaching milestones, or completing tasks in the time-limited battle pass (which does not cost additional money and, according to what i read, let players access to all items from the previous ones, which is how it should be, so supposedly it's not the typical super-hard fomo kind of battle pass), but here again, the cosmetics are pretty ugly and uninteresting. and not just that, but cosmetic chests are very rare in game, i've had 3 in over 25 hours and 1 set of skins for 1 class that were ugly, doing ""endgame"" content after about 30-40 hours, so you could play hundreds of hours and not getting what you want/get only ugly things. there is also some paywalled content as displayed on the store page

along with the boring cosmetics, the graphics are pretty plain and dull, and the humor is bad

the online sucks. join a host and they kick you before the mission ends or you brought all the resources needed for a task. host a game so that you can't be kicked and others put efforts into griefing you by activating things without waiting (including the exit event when you are not ready, not with them, and don't know the way back), starting end of mission event, and entering the exit and then blocking it to try to prevent you from successfully finishing the mission. otherwise it's struggling to get everyone at the same place or finding the way to get back to them even with the 3D map because it's terrible

i kept playing after the tutorial thinking that there would probably be more, but even being past completing the hours-long introduction and its series of missions and having played in all zones, unlocked new weapons and reached max level and prestiged on a class along with a few perks, it's never really the case (around 25 hours playtime, 50 steam hours is due to idle). spending a decent amount of hours and nothing to show for it and just not really having fun because this game has nothing much to offer. it's not the most terrible game there is, and i might still play it, but it's rather a bland game, and certainly not a super fun jesus game like the very overhyped reviews and ads make it out to be",1679249020,1708855131,False,2,2,0.389531701803207397,0,True,False,False

- I stopped playing due to how stale the game got, half of my playtime (the last 400 hours) was just to carry or fill in friends parties.
- Then I tried the game again recently and after a whole year avoiding this game due to toxic community outside the game I thought it was time to give it a chance one more time:
- And in a single mission I found bugs that haven't been fixed since I bought the game (glacial heat vents) and not a single one of the issues I had with hitboxes from dreadnoughts were fixed.
- On top of that I actually found a few visual glitches that I didn't noticed before (Drak weapon switch smoke). 

Well done DRG, actual game development stopped long long ago and all that's left is pumping content...

+ I still keep this review as positive recommended because even though I hit the skill ceiling a long long time ago and am severely disappointed at the devs and the community, this is still an amazing game and worth it for most people. 
- I might come back when new seasons are released but since each season has longer intervals between releases and it's mostly cosmetics and gimmick mission mechanics or gimmick equipments, nothing to improve the skill ceiling so I don't have much hope on the new seasons.

The game is by far the best example for live service, as it keeps getting updated and it doesnt have any stupid microtransactions, you can only buy skin dlc packs. Personally it does get boring eventually when you've seen everything, but for exactly this we have updates. More mission types would be nice, but it is what it is. For a multiplayer game, I must say, toxicity is rare and that's known by everyone. 

Though a fair warning to those coming in the next following seasons, the current game progression is starting to become a bit too luck based. There's upgrades which you get by pure luck, as updates roll around these upgrades become harder and harder to get, atleast the specific ones. Same with skins, though you don't have to fear missing out, the chance you'll get the specific thing you want will become smaller and smaller as more updates come.

It's all about that cave exploring, whilst fighting hordes of enemies L4D style.
But most importantly you can be one of four classes and screw over your friends (sold separately) by not fulfilling your role.

Or, if friends are too expensive for you, rely on randoms, because that's completely foolproof and is totally not going to end in chaos (but let's be honest though... this is exactly what you want, isn't it?).

Or, if you're so bad at socializing that even randoms aren't an option, then let me present to you your new (and only) robot friend: Bosco!

With any online random players there are bound to be shenanigans; but over 700 hours I played I only recall like 2 or 3 tops; a staggering feat this community is aware of and proud.

It's a fun, quirky first person shooter that provides exploration, customizable loudouts, plenty of cosmetics to unlock (the vast majority of which can be acquired without DLC), and the choice to either tackle a mission alone, invite friends and coordinate abilities, or join an online game. Each of the four dwarf classes feel distinct from one another, and encourages cooperation with other players. The weapons and equipment have great customization options between the selectable perks and ""overclocks"" which provide substantially different effects that change the way you use them.

While the mission types and objectives start to feel recycled after a while, the maps are randomly generated to offer a new-ish experience every time. Every once in a while, it will toss in a random event or chest to unlock an upgrade or cosmetic.

Overall it's worth checking out, and would definitely recommend it to a group looking for a cooperative multi-player experience, or for lone wolves who want to tackle a cavern themselves. Have it your way like BK.",1708731325,1708731325,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Seeing the intricate tunnels of our home rendered with such care and detail was nothing short of breathtaking.

Deep Rock Galactic portrays us, the native fauna of Hoxxes, as mere obstacles, easily squashed under the boots of the formidable dwarven miners. While it's true that we do have our disagreements with the miners over territory and resources (and admittedly, we do occasionally snack on an unwary dwarf), the game simplifies these interactions into straightforward combat encounters.
 
It's important to remember that not all of us are hostile by nature. Many of us prefer to live in peace, away from the booming explosives and piercing drill bits.

The depiction of our kind as simple fodder does a disservice to the complexity of our ecosystems and social structures. We have families, communities, and even cultures that are as diverse as the biomes we inhabit. Some of us are indeed fierce and protective of our territory, but many are just curious or even friendly, merely observing the dwarves with fascination rather than malice.

However, despite these misgivings, I can't help but admire the game's design and the thrilling adventures it offers. The teamwork and camaraderie encouraged among players are truly commendable, and the sense of accomplishment from completing a difficult mission is unmatched.

 The game beautifully captures the thrill of exploration and the relentless drive to delve deeper into the unknown, something both dwarves and bugs can relate to.",1708723234,1708727435,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is the gold standard of what games should be like these days.
One year and 200+ hours later, it has become one of my favorite games.

Deep rock galactic (DRG) is a breath of fresh air in a market where most ""team-based"" multiplayer shooters foster toxicity and stress. It's the only team shooter I really enjoy having random teammates. Furthermore, DRG is not trying to manipulate itself further into your wallet. You get a lot for your buck, especially with this game commonly being on sale.

-The game encourages and facilitates comradery and teamwork.
-Because the game encourages comradery, the community in turn is very nice and friendly 90% of the time. (I can count on my hand the amount of times I've bumped into rude teammates.)
-Engaging progressions system.
-Countless fun and viable gun/perk builds between 4 incredibly designed character classes.
-Almost 0 fomo mechanics that give you a false sense of urgency to play the game. (At worst you have to wait a year for a holiday event to come back around)
-The game is as hard as you want it to be but always rewarding.
-There is no stupid rotating cosmetic store.
-This game has had (and continues to have) multiple free massive content updates.
-99% of cosmetic items are earned with the exception of a few rewards from developer supporter packs.

Deep Rock Galactic is a somewhat simple game; you kit yourself out with a loadout that starts basic and grows organically into something more complex and custom. You go down into a gorgeously crafted environment, immerse yourself in brilliant atmosphere and music, focus on extracting minerals and completing tasks while fighting off bugs, and then you are rewarded with better guns, cool cosmetics, and a round at the bar.

Then you go again. That's it.

Compared to a sprawling, epic game that would typically be called an 'AAA' game, Deep Rock Galactic seems to have comparatively little 'meat' to offer. But between the biomes, the mission types, the enemy variety, the classes, the frequent updates, and of course the tantalizing and frequent rewards all create a gameplay loop that is worth coming back to over. And over. And over. 

Yet with that, and the fact that there are multiple DLC offers festooned on this page, all of this sounds less than appealing. Why get into yet another 'live service' and grind for a million hours only to come up just short and have to shell out for a cooler looking helmet? If the glowing praise of the gameplay doesn't interest you enough, then this is what sets Deep Rock Galactic apart and makes it a true modern gem;

It respects your time entirely.

Besides said DLC which are entirely cosmetic, every one of the beard colours, helmets, hair styles, and all other cosmetics can be earned in game. Despite having seasons and a (entirely free) battle pass to work through, said seasonal items are placed into random drops for you after the season is over. These drops are available forever, in any mission, so no matter if you play daily or hop on for a few hours every week or two, the game is always cheerfully ready to reward you for playing it. If there's something you want, you don't have to be browbeaten into spending money to get it... You just have to dig!

In all of this, I could praise the voice work, the writing, the graphics, the gunplay, but the most important thing to point out is that Deep Rock Galactic is an incredibly friendly and wonderful multiplayer experience. You haven't truly grown your whiskers until you've plunged into Hoxxes with a friend (or three) and shown what four drunk midget miners can do to a bug population in half an hour. The PvE design and the clever positive reinforcements the game has in place make it legendary for its friendly community and welcoming atmosphere. It can't be guaranteed, nor can we assure it will always be that way, but it says something about a game when it grows its own wholesomeness, instead of the expected toxicity.

DRG will be remembered in perpetuity. In fifty years, when someone is discussing top tier multiplayer games, Deep Rock Galactic will always be on someone's mind. And in a world where greedy companies are slavering to increase the price and create perpetual whale-draining machines...

It's probably better to go with indentured service to the number one intergalactic mining company instead!

Danger. Darkness. Dwarves. Deep Rock Galactic expects you to report to work soon! Rock and stone miner; we'll see you below!",1708642149,1708642535,True,1,0,0.527559041976928711,0,True,False,False

Deep Rock Galactic is a stellar example of the four player co-op formula done right. This game has almost everything going for it and there's not really a lot of areas where I would say it fails. The most obvious trait that sets the game apart are the destructible procedurally generated environments. Not only do these destructible environments set the game apart, but mining your way through levels and creating paths is a very key element of the gameplay. The cave setting also allows the procedural generation a lot of freedom to keep environments unique and the replay value high as a result.

The four classes also present a good amount of variety and good synergy between classes. For instance engineers can fire platforms to reach hard to reach areas and the scout can then use their zipline to access those platforms and acquire the minerals in those locations. Each class has a primary and secondary and 3 options for each. They also have a choice of 4 throwables they can take as well. On top of that they also have two other unique tools specific to each class (ie ziplines, drills, turrets, satchel charges, etc). You can also customize each class beyond just picking weapons by using overclocks to change how weapons function, as well as mods to modify your weapons and gear in different ways, and perks that also impact your gameplay. Then, of course, you have the usual cosmetics of which there is a good variety of ways to customize your look.

Then of course there's the games humor, which you can't talk about DRG without bringing up. You've got amusing voicelines, dancing and mini-games between missions in the space rig, a bar where a good selection of specialty brews can help fuel all sorts of antics, and of course just kicking barrels in to the launch bay to upset mission control. Between missions the bar also offers a beer to purchase that will provide a buff for your next mission, though which beer is available for the next mission is random. The community also has a number of rituals of sorts, such as pinging large mushrooms or gold chunks/bittergems until mission control gets angry and yells at you. There's also the faux pas of leaving your drilldozers head behind in escort missions in spite of no real benefit to bringing it other than the shame of not doing so. You'll quickly discover once you start that this is a very good and friendly community with a lot of rituals and in-jokes to familiarize yourself with.

Long-term replay value is provided not just through the use of procedural environments, but also a large array of mission types, most of which play quite a bit different from one another. If you've come from other co-op games one of my personal complaints has always been the generally repetition of missions regardless of the type. Warframe, for instance, is another game I play which unfortunately tends to play out the same every time regardless of the mission type. In DRG, however, each mission type is pretty unique in what you have to do and how you do it. You've got missions to setup a refinery and build pipes to your pumps, missions to gather eggs or a certain type of mineral, others to eradicate a boss or a number of powerful enemies, and so on. On top of that every mission has a secondary objective to work as well. Then there are also events which have a chance to show up during a mission, each of which are pretty unique from each other in their own right and can range from a unique enemy, or a machine you have to feed a material or destroy, or a machine to hack, or meteors to crack open, and so many more.

Then every week you also have an assignment to earn overclock cores or materials, or do a 3-mission long deep dive or elite deep dive which is more difficult than a typical single mission but also rewards overclock cores. There are plenty of overclock cores to earn as well so you'll have plenty of long-term value if you're someone that likes progressing. There are also seasonal events as well as a number of holiday events which usually provide decor for the Space Rig, cosmetics to earn, and often another side-objective in missions for a bonus.

Another good plus worth mentioning is the games small footprint both in size and in how much it needs from your system. This makes the game very accessible since you don't need a high end machine at all to play it and it doesn't take a lot of space on your machine either. This can be a very good thing when it comes to games to play with friends since we all probably know at least one person with an outdated PC or that's always eating up their drive space.

The only main gripe I have is that the game uses peer-to-peer hosting, similar to Warframe. While this, in itself, isn't completely terrible, it does have the unfortunate side-effect of sometimes causing lag if the hosts connection isn't quite up to the task, and even mission loss if the host should lose connection outright. It's rare, but it is possible if the host drops then the mission is basically just lost. Warframe offers a host migration which is often buggy, but at least it means the players can continue. Sadly in DRG you just get booted from the mission outright if that happens. Now, in my currently 274 hours played, this has only happened twice so luckily it isn't common. Also, I will note, that the effect of lag is not as pronounced as I've noticed in other games that use peer-to-peer hosting.

All in all I would say DRG is definitely one of the better games I have picked up over the past few years. It's great fun with friends, but also completely soloable if that's your thing, and it offers great long-term value. It also receives great support from its developer which is definitely a huge plus compared to a gaming world dominated by the EA's and Ubisofts of the world.

In short: buy it. it's a great game.",1708595823,1708595823,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Fellow dwarves are friendly in the community. Even when you're having a bad day and getting downed people are generally kind. The combination of having rounds that have no negative effect / damage to your overall experience is relieving compared to the competitive nature of many modern games.

- Enemy design is pure garbage. It's just bad. Enemy types entrench the game's stagnant meta strategies with heavy feast or famine practical functionality on higher difficulty settings. For examples, Naedocyte Shockers are small mobile flying electric bugs randomly appearing in large numbers that get rolled over by meta weapons like ECR Lok-1 and PP EPC and make you eat excrement otherwise with their annoying full screen blind and slow and tiny hitboxes that screw over a good number of weapons that already weren't great. Stingtails are designed to be annoying (despite that not adding any unique design language to a game full of annoying enemies) yet don't meaningfully serve as a counter to hold strategies due to the existence of Dash just letting you run back to your hold and instead messing with mobile strategies where you get pulled directly into the swarm you're kiting or more likely into an instant death fall that you don't have any control over because you're not controlling your environment like in a hold strategy. (Just add fall damage resistance when grabbed by stingtails.)
- Seasonal content is implemented horribly. Seasons last until the next seasonal update rolls around, which is simply far too long to be subjected to one sort of thing. Seasonal content is rushed and lacks appeal past the season end date, like Industrial Sabotage which is extremely repetitive in its design (repeat objective twice into boss fight that only changes up its between boss fight ability) and lacks any real longevity despite you now being forced to play it constantly because of the Assignments system. The game will have been plagued by Critical Corruption for a full year when it is finally superseded by Season 5, a season that seems to have actively just been bad for the game. A toggle was added to turn off seasonal content, but doing this means nuking a third of the mission choices off your map and also avoiding the season 3 content (seasons sort of come in two parts). I like getting frequent meteor events, I don't despise rockpox, I just don't want to see the corruptor every time I do an escort.
- The community is okay for a horde shooter. It gets compared to PvP games a lot, but for the genre, it's just okay. Low level of skill amongst the general playerbase makes hosting public higher difficulty lobbies a chore and general community sentiment on places like Reddit is obnoxious and boils down to a toxic positivity that completely evaporates if you word your post passively enough that it doesn't bruise egos.
- Game generally lacks polish in a lot of areas. An enemy like the Cave Leech turns from a minor nuisance to a fun ruining nightmare due to an audio bug easily addressed by mods. Buff beers apply the effect they list twice due to a bug that they decided to keep in but never formalize despite it taking minimal effort to just change the description text on the drinks. Weird ass bugs (not a pun) like Qronar corpses t-posing and moving around distractingly. Antiquated mechanics that haven't been tweaked like one of the Dreadnought bosses moving and attacking really slowly in solo to the point where it's a joke while the other ones that came afterwards are completely unaffected so it's a jarring jump between the two. And many other issues caused either by bugs or incompetence.
- Balance issues. Balance updates are few and far between (the November maintenance update brought some changes, but Feburary did not), and aren't super comprehensive. Why is the MK2 turret still completely useless compared to Gemini? Why didn't you buff the Stubby ammo mods so they still had more total damage than the damage mods? Why is the Springloaded Ripper still only good for killing teammates? Why does the Wave Cooker exist?
- The Overclock end-game progression system that gives weapons cool and fun stats was fun for the first while when the game is showering you in Overclocks from your initial promos and the introductory assignments, but now I just hate that it's a slow ass 90% random grind that handicaps my ability to make new cool builds. Only getting 6 weapon overclocks a week in addition to one every 10 hours from your promos sucks considering how random the system is. There are a lot of overclocks that aren't even very good but sound fun that I want to try making builds with anyways, but I just can't, because I keep getting boring cleans that are straight stat upgrades that take overclockless builds.
- Higher difficulty levels are just not fun experiences. This is due in part to the game's ""mantra of the curveball"" design philosophy, which is a neat game design hack that works on lower difficulties and lower skill levels of player, but does not work on higher difficulties where the bare workings of the game are more apparent and the game becomes an obnoxious flippy nightmare of either being bored out of your mind or dying instantly. This does not help people have an experience that's consistently engaging, nor does it help people find the right difficulty for them so they don't engage in content out of their league.
- You can block players from joining your game, but like, is there any way for me to block hosts from my server list so I don't keep joining horribly laggy games?

I have more issues with the game than I have listed here, like solo balancing decisions, certain random event designs, more enemy designs, perks, the assignments system, the early game progression, but it's a lot, and I'm not going to beat off the horse. Suffice to say it makes the game a genuinely unfun chore to play at times, more than enough to offset the positive moments. So, why am I still playing this game?

- Practical functionality excluded (some weapons are real bad without overclocks), I think DRG has some of the coolest weapons in all of FPS. The Lok-1 is a genius idea, the Shard Diffractor is a gun that both works on its own right and comes into its own with the most varied selection of overclocks, the Voltaic Stun Sweeper is not technically a very good grenade but I love it anyways and you'll never stop me from using it. If this stuff was in a game that didn't make me irrationally angry, I would be coming non-stop.
- I enjoy the mission type variety. I love building and riding pipes in Refinery, I love the mad dash to shove the final egg that spawns a swarm into the M.U.L.E in Egg Hunt, and I love one-magging Dreadnoughts on Haz 1 Solo Elimination in comedic fashion. Sometimes you're not going to be playing what you want because you're caught in an endless cycles of assignments or the mission type you're in the mood for is in Hollow Bough, or has a bad mutator like Mactera Plague and you don't feel like playing Engineer right now, but I mean, it does make it feel that bit better when you do finally get to play Refinery.
- Uh, mods? I installed a mod that makes Mission Control super entertaining. I would have actually stopped playing the game already if not for Cave Leech Loudener because they are genuinely that bad. I like it when the Lootbugs are cats and play Stockmarket by Weebl.

Other than that, I still play this game because I actually enjoy being angry because it's a preferrable alternative to the horrible intrusive thoughts I would be dealing with otherwise if the game was just boring me to death.",1708430420,1708498526,False,2,0,0.459469139575958252,0,True,False,False

My only hope is that they get rid of it with the new season to salvage the game.

It offers diverse mission types, and multiple sidegrades and weapon overclocks (that can modify from stats, to core mechanics of a weapon), so there's always something new to try in this game. Of course, I highly recommend that you play it with friends, because, while the game can be fun in solo, it's at its most awesome when ""crisis managing"" with your buddies, and making it out alive.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.",1708354899,1708354899,True,2,0,0.5,1,True,False,False

Game doesn't cost much, frequently appears on sales and has easy learning curve.
Multiplayer is the most enjoyable part of the game as community is very friendly and patient, if you're beginner don't be afraid to ask about stuff. I generally recommend to avoid playing alone, having Bosco by your side is cool but this is not when the game blooms.
Each character is unique in his own way, have own set of guns, tools and requires different playstyle.

Big chunk of game is locked behind progression which is new guns, modifications, overclocks and access to Deep Dives. Also ton of cosmetics for your characters. So in other words, game gets better with every next unlock.

There's couple of cons I would like to mention:
[list]
  [*] Overclocks unlocks are randomized and you have no control over it, so better try to get advantage from what you have got instead of trying to follow some specific build;
  [*] Resources required for upgrades aren't evenly distributed, so one way or another there will be always shortage of one resource and surplus of another. Thankfully you can buy/sell them;
  [*] I've been playing for a bit longer than year already and would like to say that Season 4 being a bit extended version of Season 3 is quite disappointing. Rockpox isn't the best mechanic, yet you get another season about it, now with even more frustrating enemies. Really looking for game getting some big updates in the future.
  [*] Game really needs shooting range, as you can try your updated build only during missions. I know there's a mod for that, but would really like if it was included in game officially.
[/list]

Still, I would recommend it to everyone, at least to try, pretty sure you won't be disappointed.",1708274906,1708338646,True,7,0,0.569110214710235596,0,True,False,False

Second only to the venerable Earth Defense Force 5 in my pantheon of cherished team-based endeavors, this game has etched itself indelibly upon the canvas of my gaming tapestry. Let us delve into the expansive quarry of reasons that makes this title an exemplar of digital opulence.

Firstly, the optimization prowess of Deep Rock Galactic is nothing short of remarkable, accommodating even the most humble of computational configurations with an unrivaled finesse. The graphical tapestry, while eschewing realism, crafts its own aesthetic allure that resonates seamlessly with the thematic undertones of this celestial escapade. It harmonizes impeccably with the game's essence, a symbiosis of visual delight and functionality.

The hallmark of destructible landscapes unfurls a realm of possibilities where terra firma yields to the incendiary might of our endeavors. A cavalcade of drilling, explosive detonations, and cataclysmic alterations to the very topography itself lends an exhilarating dynamism. Each geological contour, a testament to the malleability inherent in the cosmic canvas we traverse. A symphony of controlled chaos orchestrated to reach point A from B with unbridled creativity.

Dwelling upon the bedrock of Deep Rock Galactic's ingenuity lies its class system, an intricately woven tapestry of symbiotic roles that harmonize seamlessly within the confines of cooperative play. Each class, a distinct facet, coalesces with others to craft an ensemble of versatility. A well-balanced team, a veritable phalanx of varied skills, ensures a harmonious traverse through the cavernous domains that await.

Content, an inexhaustible fount, cascades forth with a profusion that challenges the temporal constraints of mere mortals. Countless hours wane, yet the riches within the game persist, promising ever-elusive depths waiting to be plumbed. The metaphysical quarry, a cornucopia of missions, challenges, and undiscovered treasures beckons with a siren's call.

The whimsical caper of spontaneity unfolds as I descend into the enigmatic maw of random games. A dalliance with fortuity, my companions are not mere cohorts; they are co-architects of our collective destiny. A testament to the amiable player base, where toxicity withers like a parched lichen in the face of cooperative exuberance. For over 500 hours, a transient odyssey with strangers, not a whiff of toxicity, but a tapestry woven with shared camaraderie.

""Rock and Stone,"" a mantra that transcends linguistic confines, reverberates through the caverns of camaraderie, echoing with the resonance of shared triumphs. As stalwart miners, we traverse the cosmos, leaving naught but the resonant chorus of our endeavors—indeed, we are rich. Rich not merely in gold nuggets, but in the intangible wealth of shared laughter, triumphs, and the enduring bonds forged in the crucible of Deep Rock Galactic.

In conclusion, do I, with the fervor of a prospector who unearths an unparalleled gem, recommend this game? With resounding certainty, I utter the emphatic refrain: indeed, I do. The echoes of ""Rock and Stone"" pervade my gaming sanctum, a testament to the heartfelt connection that transcends the pixels on the screen. Deep Rock Galactic is not merely a game; it is a tapestry woven with the threads of friendship and camaraderie. We are rich, not just in in-game minerals, but in the wealth of memories forged within the cavernous embrace of this digital cosmos.",1611797773,1708325237,True,2,0,0.462511271238327026,0,True,False,False

Different anomalies and warning to make the missions more exciting. The dialogue in this game is funny as hell between the dwarfs and Mission Control. The multiplayer in this game is phenomenal as the dwarfs interact with each other. If you don't like using your microphone then you can let your dwarf speak for you as you play. The single player in this game is also amazing with the addition of Bosco to your team. Most importantly about this game though is Steve, beer, and the unholy amount of bugs.

The gameplay loop is perfect for it. The gameplay loop is intuitive and requires a bit of thinking and understanding but once you understand the gameplay types it requires a lot less thinking. This means that while you and your bro/s are going out and completing this task (all of which are pretty satisfying) there's lots of time for laughing, joking, bants.

There are enough assignments and unlocks to keep things interesting for a lot of gameplay. The weekly assignments are nice just for some amount of play but the events have a lot more fun. The guns are great but get unlocked pretty quickly. This is actually great though because then you can experiment with your loadouts to see which works best for you and for each mission type. Past that, each gun has perk slots that you can experiment with to further tweak your loadout. For even longer interest, the overclocks allow you even further tweak your guns or unlock really neat abilities that can really change how each of the guns play.

In my opinion, difficulty 4 is just enemy spam so it makes it more annoying without it being more difficult. 

Overall, buy this with your bro/s and have tons of fun.

It excels in many areas of gaming, such as how it is marketed, team building, and gunplay to name a few. I am decently new to the game, so take everything I say with a grain of salt.

      Pros
- Each class is fun to play and balanced
- Requires extensive teamwork and communication
- Great to play with friends
- Almost to no microtransactions
- No adds for the givin microtransactions
- A GIANT cataloge of enemies with a guidebook showing each attack
- Easy for new players to pick up
- A giant hub with tons of stuff to mess around with
- Great randomly generated caves
- Tons of FREE cosmetics
- Satisfying gameplay
- Keeps you thinking

I would like to note, the cons are mostly my opinion, many people might disagree. I will leave a small reason of why I think it is bad. 

        Cons
- Hitscan guns
Makes aiming wayyyyy to easy for most weapons, I feel there should be less hitscan in these games (Like 1
hitscan gun per class or smth)
- Not fun without friends
I love the community of drg, but for someone who is decently introverted, it can be difficult, I am lucky to have a large group of friends to play with, but BOSCO can not replace them.
- Grindy near the end
Overclocks take way to long to get, along with them being mostly RNG
- Not a ton of graphics settings
There are several graphics settings, but I want to count the dwarfs nose hairs, so a ""OMEGA"" graphics option might help.
- Seasonal events
It feels like season 4 will never end, I want to start a new season and half to grind a ton more.

I know many people would disagree, but it isnt a perfect game, there is no such thing as one. I love playing
this game with my friends, it is some of the most fun stuff ive ever done, so dont take the cons as critisisms,

The combat is more fun than I remember, but not great. Surely more fun with friends (was revisiting solo), but I have played the game co-op and it doesn't exactly turn a new leaf. The reality is the moment I start a new mission of a type I have already done, I completely zone out. There isn't a greater goal. The missions themselves are fun in their repetition but don't lead to anything other than doing them again on higher difficulties. I can already solo level 4 missions with level 1 or 2 classes, and the max difficulty is 5, so the challenge isn't a selling point. The setting of the game is great, but I need the game to be engaging, and it isn't. Some people seem happy to run around yelling ""ROCK AND STONE"" at any and every mention of dwarves like it's a personality trait but I don't know what the average player is really getting out of this game.

The gameplay instills a sense of camaraderie between complete strangers and has a very positive community that helps and encourages each other to be successful and efficient in the way you play. I've yet to meet a negative person that griefed or refused to perform their job roles when in a match as it does take the help of everyone to get out successfully on the harder difficulties. When playing with friends everyone feels a part of the team and knows they play an important part in helping out which creates this active and inviting nature about the game. The developers actually listen to the community and make updates that keep the player base high and extremely rewarding! All the collectibles in the game are completely free and even the past season's loot is still obtainable. I've now played the game for roughly 130ish hours and I'll prob play it much more in the future as it's a game that I've met so many new friends who I've created exciting and extremely funny moments with.

Finally, I'd like to say if you're considering getting this game either for yourself or a friend you'll feel it was money well spent.
Best wishes and Merry Christmas!

The mechanics and missions are nicely varied, the graphics have a nice stylised look to them, and the developers are beyond-awesome with no predatory monetisation. Co-op is a great laugh, and the game is oozing with character and charm. These dwarves are like if the Discworld dwarves were in a sci-fi setting.

That's to say nothing of the enormous and hugely dedicated modding community that will likely keep this game alive forever...

If I had to have a complaint, I'd say it's just one that's endemic to all games with procedural generation. While it works in the context of DRG (adding to the feeling of an unexplored frontier and how caves aren't meant for human navigation) it does mean some levels can end up a complete mess made with spite in mind. Don't even get me started on the fossil objectives...

Nonetheless, I have had a grand time with this game. Absolutely recommended.",1707216898,1707824939,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But if you cant commit to long periods of time or do not feel like playing with others, the solo mode is damn fun too! Most of my 250+ hours have been alone with Bosco, your friendly drone.

Also playing alone lets you pause your mission without any worries. Really comes in handy if you find yourself needing to venture away from your PC frequently.

Brothers of the mine rejoice!
(Swing, swing, swing with me!)
Raise your pick and raise your voice!
(Sing, sing, sing with me!)
Down and down into the deep
Who knows what we'll find beneath?
Diamonds, rubies, gold, and more
Hidden in the mountains store

Born underground
Suckled from a teat of stone
Raised in the dark
The safety of our mountain home
Skin made of iron
Steel in our bones
To dig and dig makes us free
Come on, brothers, sing with me!

I am a dwarf, and I'm digging a hole
Diggy diggy hole, diggy diggy hole
I am a dwarf, and I'm digging a hole
Diggy diggy hole, digging a hole

The sunlight will not reach this low
(Deep, deep in the mine)
Never seen the blue moonglow
(Dwarves won't fly so high)
Fill a glass and down some mead
Stuff your bellies at the feast!
Stumble home and fall asleep
Dreaming in our mountain keep

Born underground
Grown inside a rocky womb
The Earth is our cradle
The mountain shall become our tomb
Face us on the battlefield
You will meet your doom
We do not fear what lies beneath
We can never dig too deep

I am a dwarf, and I'm digging a hole
Diggy diggy hole, diggy diggy hole
I am a dwarf, and I'm digging a hole
Diggy diggy hole, digging a hole

For those that haven't played it, lemme break down how things work in your average gameplay loop:

-Pick mission
-Buy beer (this is not optional)
-Drink beer (Also not optional)
-Go into the drop pod to be dumped in a cave system deep below the surface
-Mine resources, set up pipelines, recover equipment, or something similar, all while bugs try to eat you
-Kill bugs (You guessed it, not optional)
-Complete the objective
-Haul ass back to the Drop Pod for escape
-Buy celebratory beer before doing it all over again

Going deeper into how the game works:

-Players have four classes to choose from, and can have as many or as few of the same class as they like (I once had a team of all drillers and it was a chaotic blast to play).
-Each class provides their own unique playstyle and team benefit in a lineup. Scout is highly mobile and is able to help complete objectives quickly thanks to his grappling hook, as well a being able to light up entire caves, Gunner obviously provides heavy firepower and allows his team to traverse across chasms thanks to his zipline. Driller can tunnel through walls or create enclosed bunkers to funnel enemies into a chokepoint thanks to his drills, and Engineer provides fire support with his turrets. 
-Each mission takes place in a procedurally generated biome, so no two missions will have a cave layout that's exactly alike. Expeditions can be long or short, or somewhere in between, with some missions taking place entirely in one cavern and others that will have you trekking through snaking tunnels that lead you far from the drop pod, making your escape more frantic at the end.
-Biomes also determine what kinds of fauna you may encounter in the area, as well as helping you determine your loadout to take for the mission. For instance, the Driller's Cryo Cannon might be a great weapon, but it's probably not as good of a pick to take into the ice-filled Glacial Strata, so you might consider taking the Flamethrower instead.
-Certain beers provide functional benefits for your team (This is why buying them is not optional) while also getting your character wasted.

In addition to the gameplay being fun as hell, the community and Developers are straight up some of the coolest folks you'll run into. The Devs are openly transparent about the direction the game is going, constantly puts out updates and new seasons, and willingly listens to community feedback to give them what they want. The community is super friendly and is always willing to lend a hand to greenbeards that are just starting out. In all the years this game has been active, it's shocking how few toxic people I've run into over the course of playing it. Everyone is chill as hell and wants to goof around as much as the next guy.

All in all, if you're looking for a fun game that has a live service model actually done *well,* with an active and friendly community, all while playing as a Space Dwarf in a mining corporation, then this game is for you.

It's a little fun basic game. Nothing new or special about it, just mine craft without the building/crafting. Just jump in shoot bugs, troll your teammates, mine shit, then extract. Just one of those ""Turn your brain off and play"". Has alot of gimmicks, both good and bad. Very repetitive, content is stale. 


The more I play the more it feels like B4B
- Enemies magic spawn (even within 2-3 meters of player)
- Using cover is pointless
- Hit-box is inconsistent, and always at player's disadvantage 
- Enemy attacks are inconsistent in reach, damage, attack rate
- Game relies on gimmicks to advert attention away from it's flaws
- Game relies on cheap tricks to fake high difficulty 
- (Be it server lag or some other in-game issue) enemy attack still hit long after you passed them.
- You take damage from nothing for no reason (no little bug, spitter, level hazard, or friendly)
- Any critic towards the game that isn't toxic positivism is met with ad hominems and brain-rot comments by the community (few engage with proper etiquette and counter arguments) (but what game forum in steam doesn't have those types of people)
- Lastly, once you learn all the cheap tricks and gimmicks the game throws at you, and curate your playstyle to minimize such antics. High difficulties are of no challenge at all. 
- The physics are retarded, very inconsistent.
- Cliff-edge vaulting also retarded, very inconsistent and made worse with retarded physics.

The guns feel amazing, builds are fun to try out and play with because everything is so well balanced, each class feels incredibly distinct and complement each other well (engineer placing platforms under mineral veins so scouts can grapple up to them being the most obvious example), the devs are the opposite of predatory, frequently releasing FREE content updates and season passes and events. They let you get the cosmetic items from last year's holiday events the next year. The game is polished to a sheen, with every action and every menu being slick as hell. 

Perhaps most impressively is the random generation of the caves. Each mission feels so unique because of it. It just works SO well. 

Difficulty options are perfectly tuned. Depending on what you want this game can be a very chill, relaxing time, something to play while listening to a podcast. Or it can be genuinely brutal and heart-pumping. 

But most importantly is it's just FUN. Every single moment of this game is fun. Nothing feels like work, or a chore, or an annoyance. Every single interaction from mining to shooting to throwing various quest items or minerals around is FUN. It's one of the few games where I don't really care if what I'm doing is giving me some kind of meta progression or not, because the simple act of playing the game is so fun. I'm actually...enjoying playing the game simply for the sake of playing it. Which feels like a WILD concept in 2024 when everything is live service or has a season pass or even if it's single-player it has loot and RPG systems and character progression. It feels like every game is trying to find a better carrot to put on the stick to keep you walking, but Deep Rock throws the carrot in the trash and instead crafts a beautiful hiking trail that makes you WANT to walk through it so you can enjoy the scenery.",1672593059,1707585411,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The teamwork aspect comes together very well, and diversifying the team really makes a difference, with each having their own abilities to bring forward. The promise of future updates and additional content with planned release dates is reassuring. I'm looking forward to the next update!

Warning: There are 2 versions of this game: Steam and Microsoft store. The Microsoft version can crossplatform with Xbox One, while the Steam version can't, but the Steam version seems to be more stable.... so hopefully there will be a compromise in the future.

The objectives are varied and even though you play the same objectives a lot it rarely feels repetitive. The caves are randomly generated but takes different factors into account like the biome you go to or the objective you have. but no cave is really predictable. But at the same time even a team of randoms has enough direction to have succesfull dives on the highest difficulties. 

The 4 classes you play are very easy to pick up on. Scout, Engineer, Driller and Gunner. All of the titles explain their job. But gameplay is different with any player. Based on all the upgrades and as endgame someting called overclocks. wich get after you promoted one of your classes. You can do this after you leveled that class to 25. So you level these classes seperately. 

If you dont want to communicate much you can still have very high difficulty awesome missions because the objectives are clear, you can point out things to other players and loudly announce you did so, regular text chat and you can always see player outlines and objective markers. You can do this by setting your Laser pointer key to ""toggle"" instead of ""hold"", then press ctrl for the laser pointer, and then swapping to your main weapon. Now you have player outlines and objective markers permanently.

Oh and free cosmetic-only battle pass, and no shitty micro transaction store with xp boosts or any of that sh*t

However, I cannot recommend this game if you have any other people or devices sharing wifi with you. I cannot remember how many I time I lost connection when doing deep dive elite.

I checked the task manager and closed all the other apps, and turn out to be the host need consistent 300kbps send and 600kbps receive to keep another 3 players online, which is kind of needy. Also, players usually get disconnected during evac or beginning. The connectivity issue is so severe that I have to host every time. I got disconnected in five games in half an hour, which literally means I wasted half of an hour doing nothing. 

The worst thing is there is no option of retry or server history, so if you are lucky enough you may pick up where you have left. Probably next time we should have a wifi or internet hardware benchmark hierarchy in the PC master race. The consumer grade wifi can only hold extra two players if signal is good.

2. Reading the ""Miners Manual"" as you familiarise with the game.

3. Rant
thats it. pretty sure ayy, its actually a very good, well thought out game. It is a good video game too. Its like minecraft, and no mans sky had a baby, and when the baby came out it was a dwarf, buy not just any dwarf, naeieghhh twas a su'per saiyan d'warf. It neuw this and wanted to be a dwarf, despite the best intentions and teaching of the parents the dwarf grew on, resembling much of its father Minecraft and its mother NoMan'sSky. But to the relief of many, it was also unlike its parents in all the best ways.
Ayyyeee, the Dwarf grew up to be not as large as his parents, but what he lacked in size he made up in BMI and FFM. DeepRockGalactic has the substance of its father and the quality of its mother. What it lacks by mass and expansion, it makes up for in granite like hardness - (Kevin Levrone 1992; Dorian Yates, Side Tricep, 1993).",1707528381,1707528381,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Since Left4Dead 2 invented the genre we can call ""Horde Shooters,"" games in this genre must come up with unique game mechanics to stand out. You have stuff like the zombie wall-scaling (and class-levelling) of World War Z: Aftermath, and the D&D-like fantasy vibe of Warhammer: Vermintide 2, full of ammo & magic.

So what exactly is it that makes DRG so special? Is it the charm of the dwarves? Is it the interesting weapons you can pick up? Is it the digging mechanic? The challenging difficulty? The variety? All of those help, but they are not the real hero of the game.

The hero of DRG is: The randomly-generated levels.

No other game in this genre has this level of randomization, including the masterpiece L4D2, which instead has a still-vibrant community of modders, creating new levels. But once you've played a level, the familiarity somewhat kills the novelty.

The reason randomization is so important is because you will NEVER have the same map twice, making every mission feel unique. Once you've played through other horde shooters, they tend to feel repetitive once you know exactly where to go. Clocking in at almost 300 hours at the time of this review, I can say this: I'm still not bored.

I'm sure the other reviews discuss other great aspects to it, like the random side-missions that you can optionally complete, the variety of biomes and assignments that you can choose, the different guns you can equip to fit your play-style, etc. Look, there's a lot to love in this game.

But the real reason why you can keep coming back is that once you start getting really good at the game, you can always rely on the fact that you'll find challenges in the randomized maps to fit whatever difficulty level you're willing to play on.

The bottom line: This game is a phenomenal achievement of game development, and has some of the best replay value of any game I've ever played.",1707511172,1707511172,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

The concept has been done, but DRG manages to be the best-in-class and it isn't even close. Maps are proceduraly generated so that no 2 caves will ever be the same, even in the same biomes. Better yet, once you buy the game then everything is yours. The season pass is free, all cosmetics roll over into the random loot pool, and there isn't a single micro-transaction. You can't buy progress, you don't need to dump everything you own for a single upgrade, and the supporter DLC's are well made and genuinely creative. The characters have fun personalities, the theme is perfect for the narrative, and all 4 of the classes play completely different from one another. At this moment each has 3 primary, 3 secondary, and 2 movement tools which are completely unique and exclusive to each of the classes. DRG is proof that games can be fun again.

If you've ever dreamt of delving into the inky depths of the cosmos, surrounded by towering alien caves, and battling hordes of extraterrestrial foes, then ""Deep Rock Galactic"" is the game you've been waiting for. Brace yourself, miners, because this game is an interstellar gem that will have you hooked from the very first plunge.

From the moment you step into the boots of a brave Dwarven space miner, you're thrust into a universe that's both mesmerizing and treacherous. The game's visual aesthetics are nothing short of breathtaking; the dark, mysterious caverns of alien planets are beautifully rendered, and the soft glow of minerals and crystals give an otherworldly ambiance that's hard to resist.

What truly sets ""Deep Rock Galactic"" apart, however, is its ingenious blend of cooperative game-play and strategic depth. You and up to three other players form a team of badass miners, each with unique skills and abilities, to tackle procedurally generated missions beneath the planet's surface. The camaraderie that develops as you work together to navigate the twisting tunnels, mine precious resources, and fend off relentless waves of alien creatures is unlike anything else in the gaming world.

The class system in the game is a stroke of genius. Whether you choose to be the stoic Driller, the agile Scout, the sturdy Gunner, or the explosive Engineer, your role in the team is crucial, and teamwork is paramount. It's like a deadly ballet of teamwork and destruction, where everyone has to play their part to survive. The way you combine your skills and adapt to the ever-changing environments keeps the game-play fresh and challenging.

""Deep Rock Galactic"" is, at its core, an adrenaline-pumping, edge-of-your-seat experience. The swarm encounters are heart-pounding, the boss battles are epic in scale, and the sense of accomplishment when you and your team overcome these challenges is immensely rewarding. The thrill of setting up elaborate defenses and mowing down wave after wave of enemies with your trusty weaponry is intoxicating.

But it's not just about blasting aliens and mining minerals. The game has a surprisingly deep progression system, with character upgrades, weapon mods, and cosmetic options that give you plenty of reasons to keep coming back. The developers have done an outstanding job of providing a continuous sense of achievement, ensuring that every mission feels like a step forward in your galactic career.

And let's not forget about the game's sound design. The echoing caverns, the menacing growls of alien creatures, the thunderous boom of your weapons – it all adds up to an immersive audio experience that further enhances the game's atmospheric brilliance.

To top it all off, the developers at Ghost Ship Games have proven themselves to be masters of community engagement. They actively listen to player feedback, consistently release updates and new content, and host special in-game events, all of which contribute to the sense of belonging to a thriving, passionate player community.

In conclusion, ""Deep Rock Galactic"" is an interstellar masterpiece. It's a game that combines stunning visuals, intense cooperative game-play, strategic depth, and an incredibly welcoming community. Whether you're a seasoned miner or new to the depths of space, this game offers an unforgettable experience that will keep you coming back for more. So grab your pickaxe, rev up your drill, and prepare to embark on a journey through the cosmos like no other. ""Deep Rock Galactic"" is the ultimate space mining adventure you've been waiting for.

I assumed that this meant that reconnecting to a dropped session was impossible, because I found several threads and discord comments complaining about the same issue, and no one suggested simply going into your Steam friends list and clicking ""Join Game"" again, which is what ended up working for me. I still find it very odd that, when your game crashes, you DO get an in-game prompt to reconnect; they just failed to implement it for regular disconnects, which resulted in a lot of frustration after some particularly long missions ended in failure because of connection issues. 

After about 100 hours I can definitely say that this game has staying power if you are playing with friends. Pathfinding and gathering minerals is relaxing, and since I've only focused on upgrading one class (Gunner) I haven't ever been short on resources or credits. Resources are rare and varied enough that I don't get tired of mining them, and there is a nice flow between gathering them and fighting waves of enemies.

Every class comes with a fairly interesting kit, and the starter guns are more than adequate, to the point where, most of the time, weapon choice is purely a matter of preference. Things change when you get into the higher difficulties and you're choosing specific loadouts according to mission types. Most main weapons have a secondary weapon they pair very well with. Which upgrades you choose can largely depend on which bugs have been fixed. If you are playing casually though, there's not really any drawback to choosing what you think is the most interesting. 

In my opinion, the only ""essential"" class is Driller. I would probably list the class priority list as Driller > Gunner > Engineer > Scout.  While I'm sure higher skill players do just as well as the Engineer or Scout, the Driller I usually play with has gotten us out of more tense scrapes than I think any of the other classes could deal with. Being able to simply drill through solid rock straight to an objective turns an impossible mission into a merely difficult one. While I personally prefer to play as Gunner, if you are playing solo you have the option of taking the autonomous drone Bosco, who is essentially a mini-Gunner. He can even mine for you, so the hard-to-reach ceiling minerals become an afterthought. 

The most frustrating part of the game, apart from connection issues, is fall damage. It's very easy to slip or get knocked off a precarious platform and plummet into a chasm you didn't even know was there, and for your team-mate to take a tumble into that same chasm trying to save you. It's much less frustrating with the ""Bosco in multiplayer"" mod, since he can revive you, so I would recommend grabbing that. But it speaks to the fact that this game was REALLY designed to be played with a full party of 4, and if you are playing with less than that, you are putting yourself at a significant disadvantage. Especially if the person you are playing with is not particularly skilled with shooters. *cough*

Speaking of mods, even though there aren't a ton for this game, a few key ones are definitely worth picking up, especially for casual players. The aforementioned Bosco mod is extremely useful, as is the upgraded Doretta (drilldozer) mod that helps with defending a stationary target at higher difficulties. My team-mate was constantly complaining about how dark the game was, until we downloaded the improved flashlight mod. They still throw flares like they're 20's at the club, so I don't think the overall intended experience was ruined, but the complaining definitely stopped. 

Overall, DRG has an almost perfect balance between relaxing resource gathering and challenging combat. It's the only game I've continued to play almost daily since I downloaded it, despite its frustrating flaws. I'm rarely ever bored despite the gameplay loop being fairly simple. I wouldn't play it on my own, but with friends it's a 9/10. ",1702957268,1707354845,True,0,0,0.496268630027770996,0,True,False,False

However, there seems to be a lot less players now, it takes longer to find groups to go with, but its not too bad.

My main issue is the amount of modding. It makes all of my accomplishments meaningless, and now have no desire to play anymore. In one crew I was with we got infinite script and every resource after the mission. I have never downloaded/played with any mods for this game. It is very lame that my game play is effected by other players mods.
There have been other mods I've been pulled into as well. Like mods that allow more than four players, mods that allow players to teleport around the map. But this infinite resource reward mod is what ruined the game for me.",1679609403,1707296178,False,1,0,0.47129976749420166,0,True,False,False

The dwarves on the Deep Rock Galactic space rig are gathered at the Abyssal bar, chugging down a round or two of their favourite beers. Sharing stories and highlights of their latest assignments in the dark caves on Hoxxes IV, a dangerous planet full of minerals and biomes. Biomes are where the missions take place, and range from galactic salt mines to radioactive tunnels, infested by various swarms of alien arachnids called Glyphids. The Drop pods were getting ready for launch and our miners for a Elite Deep Dive. Ziplines, drills, flares and of course, a faithful pick axe, the team was locked n loaded with heavy fire power in order to make it back alive from the depths. Management gave the last call for everybody to get on board, fearing the worst for their experienced miners and expensive equipment.

No in game purchases to be seen with the only exception to the DLCs that only provide cosmetics. Along with the fact that the battle pass is also free and that all cosmetics can always be found if you miss out on it. 

The replay-ability is just perfect. Special events, different biomes with their own unique world generation and terrain, mission hazards, missions themselves, and finally enough different enemy wave encounters. It's not even close to being stale or dull.

The Gist: You are a dwarf that works for the titular mining company Deep Rock Galactic. In addition to whacking mineral veins with a pickaxe to harvest them, you also shoot monstrous bugs.

The Good
- There's a decent variety of weapons to choose from, and with lots of mods for each one, there's virtually endless styles of combat.
- The sound design is amazing, making you feel like something could be lurking around every corner.
- There's a surprising amount of humor, typically at the expense of Mission Control.
- The graphics are decent, but the presence of darkness and the need for illumination is actually really immersive and an overall nice touch.
- This game scratches the itch you never knew you had of having to smash mineral deposits and pick up the fallen pieces. 

The Bad
- All four classes of dwarf have more or less the exact same voice, with only the pitch changed for each one. It seems kinda lazy, but it's probably a budget and manpower issue, so I can let that slide.

Pro Tip: When playing with others, ask or respond to others with a simple ""R."" For example, once the mission quota has been met and the M.U.L.E. can call the drop pod (if the M.U.L.E. is present; it isn't always), type ""R?"" and if everybody responds with ""R"", press that button and make a mad dash for the pod.",1707178828,1707178828,True,1,0,0.502107501029968262,0,True,False,False

Deep Rock Galactic - An amazing, fun, unique game for a cheap price.

Overall thoughts on the game aspects:
-----------------------------------------------------------

Graphics - 9.5/10 , The best poly-type game to give the most immersive graphics you could get with such poly-type rendering

Gameplay - 10/10 , Gives you the true experience and feel of being an actual miner in an alien rock in space, literally

Weapons and variety - 8/10 , unique weapons for each class, just wish there was a few more options.

Atmosphere - 10/10 , Stunning lighting effects.

Price - Worth the full price but buy on sale

It can be played for relaxation, just mining some shiny minerals at lower difficulties, or really challenging in other missions, its such a versatile game.

Since caves are randomly generated, every mission is unique.
The voice actors did an amazing job at really bringing the atmosphere of the game together.
The concept of space dwarves fighting life-sized bugs is just so cool.

Ghost Ship has blessed us with a beautiful experience that has strengthened bonds through trawling for gold and really huge beards. And we're eternally grateful.

I have to say that every new update since rival escalation has been either terrible or just disappointing. Every new monster has sucked more and more fun out of the game. I don't even kill corruptors anymore because they're mind-numbingly boring to fight, along with taking ages. Rival escalation was the peak of this game and I kinda miss the simplicity.

[b]Genre/Similar Games: a 3D Terraria with dwarves? Left 4 Dead underground and mining and bugs instead of zombies? Yeah, those work. [/b]

[h1]PROS: [/h1]
✅Cooperative experience can be fun, especially when all unique abilities mesh together

[h1]CONS: [/h1]
➖Mostly boring perks lead to lack of build diversity in the name of balance
➖Grinding for cosmetics…who cares? 
➖Not a lot of incentive for solo players

[h1] [b] Content (Game world/Narrative/Lore/Length/P2W/Mods) – [7/10] [/b] [/h1]
In Deep Rock Galactic (DRG), you play as one of 4 classes of dwarf – Driller, Gunner, Engineer, or Scout. You enter a procedurally generated (RNG) cave system to complete a mission. Missions range from things like collecting a specific type of item like ore or alien eggs, to recovering equipment, to killing a big enemy. I noticed about 4 or 5 different types of missions (mine, recovery, kill, collect…).
The game world is split into 2 main parts – your ship, i.e hub, and the mining locale. Since each mining location is unique and different, the ship will remain the only consistent location in the game. 

The narrative is almost non-existent. You are simply an employee of the company Deep Rock Galactic. You take orders from the same “Narrator” dwarf whom is considered management. 
I put in about 20 hours as of this review. This is one of those games that can be an infinite loop if you enjoy it enough. 

There is no P2W here, but tons of cosmetics available to purchase. 

There is also mods available. I did not choose to use any, but I did like how there are two lists of mods – officially accepted and everything else. Since this is largely a coop game, there are modded lobbies you have the option of joining. These lobbies, which are filterable, allow officially accepted mods, all mods, or no mods. 

Overall, DRG has tons of content, if you find it enjoyable is the question. 
[h1][b] Gameplay (Controls/Mechanics/Loop/Difficulty/Bugs) – [7/10] [/b] [/h1]
The gameplay in DRG is good, all the classes are very balanced and control as well as any FPS on the market. 

Mechanically, each class has a variety of their own guns and equipment that make navigating the caves easier. Drillers are exceptional at drilling huge caverns, Gunners have ziplines, Engineers have shootable platforms, and Scouts have a flare gun and a grappling hook. You also have some perks which adds some small passive bonuses to the gameplay. Due to balance being so tight, there isn’t a lot of room to do anything truly unique. Perks like 30% less elemental damage, or run 10% faster after sprinting for 5 seconds, or insta-revive once per match. These are nice, but I’m not seeing the ability to build some really cool things here. 

The general gameplay loop consists of choosing your buildout from guns, perks, class, and if solo, your robot Bosco, then launching into a random cave to complete the mission. Once inside the cave you must endure waves of enemies while you move to complete your objective. You normally have about 1-2 optional objectives to complete, as well as 1-2 hidden objectives like a tower or chest key event. Each match takes somewhere between 15-45 minutes. 

As for difficulty, this is measured in hazard level. It’s generally considered something like:
haz 1 = literally for children
haz 2 = new to FPS or just learning DRG
haz 3 = good for grinding in the beginning levels
haz 4 = main choice after you are familiar with the game and confident in your abilities
haz 5 = professional players only, ridic bullet spongy enemies 

I played mostly on haz3-4. I felt that the difficulty can be wildly inconsistent. There were times when I died 10x on haz 3, then no wipes in haz 4. 
Lastly, for bugs, I did encounter some (pun not intended since the main enemy type in this game ARE bugs). There are sooo many cases where enemies are able to hit you from underneath a platform and you are literally unable to damage them because they are inside the indestructible terrain (mining platform). This lead to many deaths that should have been preventable by the mining platform’s auto guns shooting the enemies before they got there. 

[h1] [b] Graphics (Quality/Art style/Animations/UI/Performance) – [6/10] [/b] [/h1]
Probably due to the procedural nature of the caves, but for the most part, the graphics are not that great, even with everything maxed the inside of a mineshaft can only look so visually impressive, but DRG takes it a few steps even lower. 
If every environment was made like your ship was made, I would probably give this a 7, but the ship is the only thing that was immaculately designed. The art style from all the clutter is great and feels like a lived-in vessel. 

Animations are okay – nothing exemplary but serviceable. 

The UI is good. I feel like one of the devs learned how to program certain things on in-game monitors and threw them EVERYWHERE because they thought it was cool. I do need to call out my hatred for the class colors. Driller is yellow, Gunner is green, Scout is blue, and Engineer is red. Well, it so happens that when a player is downed their class icon changes to flashing RED. This has annoyed me so much when I have engineers in my party, and I glance to see where they are in the cave, I always end up thinking they are down. OR the opposite, I see a red icon and think they are an engineer, then need to look at the health bars. C’mon, there are more than 5 colors here. 

Performance is great, no complaints. I played on my desktop and got a consistent 120 FPS. My rig is:
i9-13900KF | RTX 4090 | 64GB RAM | 1440p @ 240hz | installed on SSD
[h1] [b] Audio (Sound Effects/Music/Voice Acting/Ambient) – [6/10] [/b] [/h1]
ROCK AND STONE! Yeah, this section is hard-carried by the hilarious things the dwarves say. 
The sound effects are good, but aside from the digging of enemies, they are almost completely silent. I want to hear them walking towards me, or grinding their fangs, something! 

The music is limited and/or boring. 

Voice acting is on point and great. 

Ambient is not even noticeable, which is a shame. Game really fails on the immersive aspect and instead focuses on the coop play. 

[h1] [b] Replay Factor (Side quests/NG+/Player Choice) – [8/10] [/b] [/h1]
There is tons of replayability here in DRG. The game is pretty much a gigantic side quest. There is no clear main mission, as you’re just an employee at work. There are multiple areas, each with their own objective and each under constant different effects that alternate missions. I can see this having near infinite replay value and for the cost of the game, it’s a great deal. 

NG+ isn’t a thing. 

No player choice other than what type of match to do. 

[h1] [b] Final Verdict – [7/10] [/b] [/h1]
The core part of DRG is built around cooperative play, and while there is some RPG elements and options for builds, those exist only to provide the player with minimal choices as you happily mine planets forever. It has a lot of heart (and stone), but I can’t help feeling that I want more from DRG, just like Left 4 Dead. After you experience 20 hours of the game you’ve seen pretty much everything there is to see, so what’s to keep people playing? I would reckon on having a static party of friends to liven the experience, but that can be said about most coop games, so I try not to use that as [i] the [/i] determining factor, after all, not everyone has 3 pocket friends to play with at any given time. 

[h1] [b] Recommend? [Y/N] [/b] [/h1]
[h1]Yes [/h1]
While not entirely for me, the content you get for $10 on DRG’s every month or two sale (https://isthereanydeal.com/game/deeprockgalactic/history/) is definitely worth it.

Every pieces of this game works perfectly together: the class, the weapons, the lobby, the art-styles... 30 mins in and you feel like you entered a big universe with a rich lore which is impressive considering there is almost nothing apart from the lobby and the gameplay itself.

The missions are realy different from one another and while you mostly end-up slaughtering lots of bugs and a few bosses here and there, the freedom you have on each run is always compelling.
If you feel comfortable, you can stay and mine as much ore as your dwarven eyes can lay upon, but if you struggle with ammo, you might want to get out as soon as you've done the main objective.

The randomness in map generation is realy fine tuned and even replaying the same mission always give a different vibe.

Difficulty is also modular, going from a walk in the park to a hardcore trail in hell, depending on what you want, but fun is to be had whatever you pick.
A real masterpiece totally worth the 97% positive review given by more than 210k people as of the writing of this review. 
Even out of sales, the game is a nice pick but if you get it for 15€ or less, it's a real steal.",1706978914,1706978914,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've been playing this for a couple of weeks now.
Not what I expected at first, but, better.

You are basically a Dwarf working for an interstellar mining corporation known as Deep Rock Galactic. Your crew is based in an orbital mining rig above the planet Hoxxes. Players select missions and are deployed to beneath the planet's surface in a giant drill pod. You the make your way through the tunnels and caverns, occasionally creating tunnels of your own, until you find what the company sent you in for. Usually some sort of valuable mineral, alien eggs, or even some lost equipment. Once you complete the objectives, a drop pod is sent for you, and it's a race against time to get to it before it leaves.
All the while you must be wary of the Glyphids - arachnid like creatures that inhabit Hoxxes, and are extremely aggressive. Don't worry though, you are well equipped to handle them with a variety of firearms and explosive weapons.
On the way, you can find other items and minerals. Some are secondary objectives for which you earn a bonus at the end of the mission, others are just there, and you can freely take them. These can be used to get money or as materials for upgrading your equipment.

There are 4 classes: Scout, Engineer, Driller and Gunner. Each has a unique set of weapons and equipment. You can do everything that a mission requires with any class, but each class is vastly superior in a certain aspect. For instance, the Gunner has a powerful heavy automatic weapon that is good for firefights, while the Driller has heavy duty mining drills that allow it to dig much faster. The player can switch between classes prior to beginning a mission, but are locked in once it starts. 

There are also a large number of perks that you unlock by completing milestones. I won't go into them all because there are a ton. 
Given the number of available perks, I can see there being a massive volume of different character builds.

I will note that I have been playing solo exclusively. This makes things a bit harder, especially on some of the longer mission types (ie. Onsite refining) but as long as you bring the right kit for the job, it's doable. Even if you don't bring the right kit, it's still doable, it'll just take a lot longer. I was initially put off by this, but after trying a different approach, I got the hang of it. The game is definitely balanced with multiplayer co-op in mind, and up to 4 players can go on a drop at a time. Luckily, solo players get a handy drone that watches your back, shoots enemies, mines hard to reach minerals and can be equipped with a rocket launcher. Not quite as good as a friend, but it'll do.

Also, Fall damage is by far the greatest killer in this game. Watch your step; it's a LONG way down.

If I have one gripe, it's that there isn't much weapon variety. Each class has only 1 primary and secondary weapon to start with. Others can be unlocked when a character reaches level 10, but 18 hours in, I haven't gotten there yet. Then again, I have been switching between characters for variety's sake, so it's probably possible to get there quicker.

All in all, a really solid game. I'm certain that it's even better with friends.",1706942004,1706942004,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's not a bad game per se, but it becomes tedious and extinguishes any hope for more content quite fast. On the positive side, it's decent for wasting some time and playing with friends on a few occasions. It looks pretty in a few areas. All four classes are more or less fun to play, and that's about it. I can't see this game as anything more than a time-waster if you really have nothing else to do. The reason I kept playing was solely based on the hope that it would eventually get better. However, after playing for 150 hours, I still feel like the game exhausted itself after the 10-hour mark. After that, it was nothing but the same repetition of ""clear the 1st cave level, drill into the other one, get the minerals, kill the bugs, return to the drop pod"" – nothing more than that.

Objectives change with each mission, but the core gameplay is very bland and overly repetitive. The variety of bugs and weapons doesn't feel special; I've been using the same weapons that deal the most damage from the start until now for each class. Despite differences, they still don't give the feeling of any of them being special. Overclocks aren't fun to use either with a few exceptions (still doesn't matter, because every overclock you get is random).

The developers could've added way more content to make this game less shallow, like flooded caves with giant monsters three times the size of the caretaker, space battles with ship control, and forsaken ancient structures in the caves, etc. The game would've been way better if it were more horror-oriented, but I doubt they'll ever going to add any of this.

In terms of visuals, it looks rather ugly. I've been trying to figure out what it reminds me of and concluded it's like a weird mishmash of western comics, a neon-related look, and lots of chunks of other stuff. However it's one thing being unpleasant to look at and another when you can't tell what you're looking at. Spatial awareness in this game is terrible, and it has nothing to do with its lack of light but rather the developer's art style. Even when the cave is well-lit with no approaching bug swarm; it's generally hard to tell what you're seeing most of the time in terms of terrain or where you are standing. Every each biome with the exception of sandblasted corridors looks blurry. Just a few examples: 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3133331964 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3133332090
It's not that it's dark, it's that the color palette is too monotonous and everything looks too blurry.

The last thing I'd like to address is the community. To be frank, they're zealots. Anyone with any sort of criticism always gets trash-talked, with every issue you may have with the game resulting in a ""git gud"" or some other more passive-aggressive response from players and developers alike. They remind me of the source-game communities like that of TF2, so complaining about anything or wishing for a meaningful developement here is a waste of time.

Overall, the game really isn't worth its original price. You can play it, but it'll get boring rather fast, even with friends, and there won't be any new meaningful content for a long while. 

P.S. I'm sure that in this game, for most players and all developers, the whole ""dwarf"" setting is just a fetish.",1706917639,1706918617,False,3,0,0.436921030282974243,0,True,False,False

Since season 3 started something hasn't felt right, I might be getting RSI with my 1k+ hrs in this and many thousands of hours in other games but ever since they changed how the caves generate ..eg more jumping and climbing things like way way too much, so much jumping and not much open feel anymore. Nearly every time I play now my hand is messed up for a day or two after.

That in conjunction with the reboot of season 3 and a great many other indicators of what feels like ""game sabotage"" is an indication that its time to move on, I would say good work all round for the time they have spent putting into new content with every season previously but yeah I think they are running out of ideas, my 4 classes all 3 star legendary, at least I can say I been there done that, so long my dwarven bothers.

It is basically the retelling of the end of the Squats in the Warhammer 40k universe to the unnamed Tyranid splinter hive fleet that consumed their homeworlds in the 41st Millennium.. At least before they got reincarnated into the new dwarven AI-worhipers that they are nowadays. With this in mind the game is quite relatable and actually have a story to tell! Otherwise it is a fun take on a shooterfocused minecraft with dwarves digging after treasure on a treacherous planet.

Overall the core gameplay  is pretty fun but the fact that you have to grind up inventory means that you slowly unlock the equipment you need to progress further in the game. This can make it feel tedious to some, others might find value in this method of keeping players engaged. Also, I wish there was a way I wouldn't have to play as one of four burly dwarfs coded as men with more or less obnoxious voices.. Come on developers, its 2024, where are the equality? (and don't give me excuses about rigs/skeletons in a game that introduces new enemies with more and more abstract shapes..) Play it with friends (if you have those) and gallywant on epic raids after precious resources needed to fuel your capitalistic company spacegreed further. It is a Vermintideish game where the theme is switched from dark medieval fantasy to alien(the movie) infused sci-fi mixed with super motherload(the game) and dwarfs.

(But perhaps that's the point and they only care about farming money using support packs, who knows)

Mind that this is the second account I'm leveling up to the end game and it's the second time I'm deeply disappointed by how they handled Deep Rock's end game, which is always the same from season to season: there's no depth to difficulty and the meaning of difficulty never gets renewed in terms of challenge, missions become repetitive and boring, mechanics are always the same (sadly I'm not joking) and all that changes between higher levels is that swarms get progressively bigger and spawns are annoying - without your ammo or every other spawned resources following up, which makes soloing impossible in a long term unless you have the time to grind tirelessly through the [b]same cenarios over and over and over and over the whole week for at least 12 hours straight[/b].

Map generation is [b]awful[/b] to say the least, where half end game levels have a fucking screwed up layout as the sheer display of hiring someone to design things he/she doesn't have the bare minimum clue about. You're most probably sticking with a character who has some crazy mobility like Scout or some very good utility like Engineer or you probaby won't make it through the first 5 minutes of any intermediate to hard mission.

If you're a casual player who likes to stick with friends and do easy missions, go ahead and waste some time with this. Otherwise, it's way better to [b]avoid and go play something better[/b] like e.g Risk of Rain 2. It just becomes the same, a bullet hell where you just gotta survive but at least there you won't be stuck and hard nerfed by shit devs, depending solely on your skill/a bit of luck.

I don't mean to hate, as I love the game. Deep Rock is brilliant and stands out from almost everything in the store when the topic is multiplayer fun, but it is [b]broken at its core and devs aren't giving a shit nowadays about balancing or fixing issues, they just wanna make ""battle passes"" and events with boring recycled themes and mechanics.[/b] Being that the utmost and most painful fact that holds this gem down, it would be unfair telling someone to ignore everything else because shouting ROCK AND STONE nonstop at missions and laughing at friends being instakilled by supply drops is awesome. You [b]will[/b] be disappointed as soon as 50 hours (tops) hit and you realize you can only play with friends to make this work.

Solid mechanics, go into the deep with your other dwarf buddies to do a task for your mining corporation, seamlessly optimized and easy enough to run the game for even some old-ass PC's. Each mission has a similarity to others with variety in level generation, mission type, or unique modifiers. The mechanics of the game make that never go stale.

And the challenge, it comes in the deep dives. You just have to get far enough into the game to understand what I mean.

Re-Review: 3 years and almost 1000 of game hours later I can certainly say this is the best videogame I've played. The community is the least toxic I've ever experienced, the consistent free content updates, the variety of things that you can see in this game, and the emphasis in the core game loop and mechanics to promote fun above all else is why I still boot up this game every week. I feel like i can easily sink another 1000 hrs into it and not be burned on it.

For newcomers, get through the first 10-mission assignment, and promote a class once, and you'll have access to the fun stuff like overclocks, deep dives, etc. Also, press V whenever anything cool happens. When you become high level and drop into a newbie's game, mine the gold for them, they need it.",1606343897,1706853072,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

After over a hundred hours of playing this game, I can say with absolute confidence that it is lacking content. You are introduced to the game by having to complete one of each mission type, which is a great way to start someone on a journey with proper expectations. The issue is that it doesn't scale into anything more grand, mechanically. There are just buffs and debuffs which make the same 10 missions more chaotic and difficult to handle. At some point, you will unlock Deep-dives, which may indicate that more diverse content and a deeper progression system should be locked behind it. No, this isn't the case either. Deep Dives are just a randomly selected three missions, out of the same 10 missions you've already done over and over, but with random debuffs and more bugs. 

This was really disappointing because you have to promote your dwarves to even unlock this feature (along with other side missions you can't participate in until you promote), only to do more of the same thing. This is a huge missed opportunity to have unique bosses and map layouts that deviate largely from the core 10 mission types, but could encourage the players to use the skills developed to overcome these weekly challenges.  


[b][i] Builds and Character Progression [/i][/b]

This part of the game is great, until you get to promotions, then it completely tapers off as there's no incentive to promote other than flexing how long you've been playing the game. All of the major playstyle changes come when you unlock passives on your armor, weapons, Pick-axe, robot helper and grenades. This is where the most fun in the game comes from, because all the features are new, your character is incomplete, and there is something significant to strive for. You feel the power of having 2 passives, and then 4 passives, etc, and start to establish a style for your gameplay. There are weapon alterations which you can make, but you won't have access to those until you've farmed some weeklies and deep dives post promotion. After promoting, there's nothing... Just empty levels, which don't reward you at all. No additional damage reduction, dmg dealt, enhanced passives or party buffs... Nothing that you would expect when you look at a player who has a 3-star gold promoted Dwarf, who then dies just as fast as you and outputs the same as you. This just doesn't make any sense to me. I recognize this is potentially design-space, which could be saved for a future update, but this game has been out almost 4 years at the time of writing and this studio is working a new project in the same world as DRG. 


[b][i] Customization [/i][/b]

This system is mostly good. I don't have a lot to say about the different cosmetics themselves, they are fun and interesting. My main criticism is actually regarding the way they are obtained. Each of the four dwarves have their own independent customization loadouts, but it's the same hairstyles, colors, armors, etc for each dwarf and you have to purchase them all separately. I think this is totally bullshit and could improved very easily. The full collection should be available to be used by any dwarf, just divide the cosmetic unlockables amongst the classes, so that there's an incentive to change classes. Like a mustache or a particular pair of chops? Well, you gotta play the Driller to get it or maybe the Engineer has a unique armor you want to unlock on your gunner. This facilitates each player spending some amount of time on each character and a proper reward for doing whatever the requirement is. Currently, it's just grind mats, buy hairline 1 on all 4 classes. Grind more mats, buy hairline 2 on all 4 classes, and that's awful.


[b][i] Music, Style and Charm [/i][/b]

This is where I honestly feel the game's identity is the strongest. The Jokes are funny, the characters are endearing, and the music when you're in the middle of the shit is freaking awesome. They've really captured the essence of a 9-5 job, and turned it into a game, which is hilarious and relatable!


[b][i] Closing Thoughts [/i][/b]

I had a unique experience with DRG, and there's a lot of things that are done right in this game. There's a lot of charm in this game, and it's clear that this project was loved by the Developers and it's community. Their seasonal pass is very generous and rewards effort over money. Their DLCs are reasonably priced. The game is fast-paced, and while is easy to get lost and very chaotic, it's still fun. But would I recommend it? Personally, no. I think the type of player who wants to play this game, knows who they are and will find this on their own. This is a an acquired-taste for sure, like black licorice.",1706831261,1706831772,False,5,0,0.478328913450241089,0,True,False,False

1) [strike]stingtails stop appearing with greater frequency than acid spitters AND are given an implementation that cannot slingshot you into insta-death on a hazard 1 mission.[/strike] With the battery of nerfs it has received, I can remove this complaint. It's still a very badly designed enemy for a lot of reasons, but at least new players are unlikely to get annihilated for no reason with no idea what killed them.

2) the godawful stain that is the rockpox spew and suck minigame is removed or sufficiently relegated so as to no longer be a meaningful addition to any mission. Whatever dumbf- idiot decided that a game about running around shooting bugs should instead be about not running and not shooting bugs should be banned from game design. Sure glad I collected all those overclocks that are now totally worthless as I use this POS vacuum cleaner to suck up a bunch of bubbles!

This used to be one of my favourite games. I could run missions for hours. Every part of it was fast-paced and engaging. These days, it feels like every mission is an endless chain of invulnerability phases, toxic zones, and death stuns. At this point, if I see a corrupter I just bail on the mission and close the game because I would have more fun watching Stockfish play chess than blow foam all over a giant sh- snail that takes 4000 minutes to kill.

I'm still gonna play the game, but I have to very carefully cherry pick my missions if I want to have any fun, and I can only do that because I have played it long enough to know exactly which missions are still fun. I genuinely don't recommend it to new players. There's just too much crap going on, too many overclocks to collect, too many things to unlock. I have no idea how you're supposed to catch up to someone that has hundreds of hours and has been playing since before season 1 even existed.

And as much as the positivity of the community is a boon, it's actually pretty toxic, because god forbid you complain about these things.

The worst part is, prior to season 4, I still would have recommended it. I feel incredibly sad to be writing this. It feels like my friend is slowly dying and there is nothing I can do except whine about it on the internet.",1687909752,1706798287,False,13,0,0.529319882392883301,0,True,False,False

Almost certainly the best live-service game out there, damn near factually even. A satisfying gameplay loop that does not easily get boring, a hearty and helpful community, and an absence of the cancerous FOMO that plagues an industry made to help destress and unwind make Deep Rock Galactic the healthiest online game to play of all time.

This game is fun. You should play it. It is more fun with friends, and even strangers. The devs did a really beautiful job of making the characters interact in a way that fosters good play.

They also say stuff that makes you laugh out loud. For example, while fighting for your life in a swarm of enormous spiders, the driller next to you will be heard to shout ""god dammit, there's a pebble in my boot""

All the starter weapons are fun, which makes it really easy to enjoy the game at the start. There are no bad starter weapons that make you feel the need to grind for better ones. For example, the scout starts with an assault rifle and shotgun, and what a perfect combination that is. The driller has a flame thrower that you won't want to put down. The gunner's minigun is as satisfying as it is deadly.

Deep Rock Galactic is an absolute gem of a game that combines the thrill of cooperative gameplay with the satisfying chaos of dwarven mining expeditions. Despite my relatively short 4-hour playtime, I find myself compelled to share my initial impressions, as Deep Rock Galactic has already left a lasting impact on me.

Gameplay (5/5):
From the moment I stepped into the shoes of my trusty dwarven miner, I was hooked. The gameplay is a seamless blend of action, exploration, and strategic decision-making. The randomly generated caves ensure that each mission feels fresh and unpredictable, keeping the excitement levels high. The diversity of mission types, from point extraction to egg collection, adds a layer of variety that prevents the experience from ever feeling repetitive.

The heart of the game lies in its cooperative play. The synergy between the different dwarven classes—Gunner, Engineer, Driller, and Scout—is crucial for success. My limited playtime has already shown me that effective communication and teamwork are not just encouraged but absolutely essential for overcoming the challenges thrown at you. The sense of camaraderie and shared objectives elevates the experience to new heights.

Graphics and Atmosphere (4.5/5):
Deep Rock Galactic boasts a visually stunning underground world that captures the essence of a dwarven mining operation perfectly. The attention to detail in the caves, the lighting effects, and the distinctive character designs contribute to an immersive atmosphere. The game's aesthetic manages to be both charming and gritty, striking a balance that suits the theme of dwarven mining.

The dynamic lighting system deserves a special mention. As you traverse the dark, cavernous depths, the use of flares and the glow of precious minerals create an atmospheric tension that is both thrilling and beautiful. The game achieves a perfect blend of tension and excitement, especially when swarms of hostile creatures descend upon your team.

Progression and Customization (4/5):
Deep Rock Galactic offers a satisfying progression system that keeps you coming back for more. The ability to upgrade and customize your dwarf, both in terms of equipment and appearance, provides a sense of personalization. The variety of weapons, tools, and perks allows for different playstyles and strategies, adding a layer of depth to the overall experience.

However, I must admit that after only 4 hours, I have just scratched the surface of the progression system. It seems promising, but I look forward to exploring it further as I delve deeper into the game.

Community and Support (5/5):
One of the standout features of Deep Rock Galactic is the active and friendly community. Whether playing with friends or joining a random group, the community's cooperative spirit is infectious. The developers, Ghost Ship Games, have shown a commitment to the game with regular updates and engagement with the player base. It's evident that they genuinely care about the success and enjoyment of their creation.

Conclusion:
In my brief 4 hours with Deep Rock Galactic, I've found an engaging and thoroughly enjoyable cooperative experience. The game's blend of intense action, strategic teamwork, and dwarven charm has left a strong impression on me. With its promising progression system, stunning visuals, and an active community, Deep Rock Galactic is a must-play for anyone who enjoys cooperative games or just wants to embark on a thrilling mining adventure with a group of friends. I can't wait to see what the depths of Hoxxes have in store for me as I continue my journey with this delightful gem.",1706553149,1706553149,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Solo game play is fun, immersive and you can get to really enjoy the game for its beauty. Or if you don't like solo, grab your friends. The games difficulty will scale and offers more of a challenge and reward for playing with more people. On top of that, if you don't have friends to play with you can always fall back on the community of Dwarves'.

""Leave No Dwarf Behind"" is the motto of the game. This community is almost cult like and it makes it even more enjoyable. Are you down, in a hopeless situation? Your team is gonna fight tooth and nail to get you up and out on that drop pod or die with you. Are you unable to reach an ore needed for the mission? Just pull out your laser pointer and ping and someone will be right there to help.

I seriously recommend this game, especially if you are looking for a sense of comaraderie and something that is fun to pass time. It can be a little overwhelming at first but the amount of information you can get for this game whether from reddit or from those you play with, will ease that.

Give it a chance. You will not regret it. Rock and Stone Greenbeard.

If you're here at this point, here is my honest review, and it's going to be long

TO THE DEVELOPERS: You have created my favorite game of all time, which has been previously held by Left 4 Dead 2! Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, not only for the simplicity, but for the sheer amount of community there is.

I started with a few friends, just to see this game through, and then my friends played offline more than I did, so it became a competition: who would get the highest first? And that only led me to love this game more and more. The four classes do not feel restricted, and the guns allow enough diversity that it does not matter what types of characters are in a party, and everyone can play whomever they want at any level, at any time. 

The guns are not restrictive as I originally thought, and the classes are more similar than I thought. 70 hours ago, I would've said that Scout has become my least favorite class. Now? He's played the last 40 of my 70 missions. I kid you not, PLAY. THIS. GAME.

You still doubt it? I would happily tell you hours upon hours of my favorite moments, of my favorite guns, and my favorite ways to play anything. Heck, I am finishing up video editing courses so I can MAKE CONTENT ABOUT MY LOVE FOR THIS GAME. I cannot wait to meet you all out on Hoxxess and Rock and Stone miners.

After playing Role Playing Shooters consisting of enormous amounts of loot and game-changing skill trees, Deep Rock Galactic is simply not catching up.

The rewards are displeasing. Perks give minor improvements rather than  introducing new movement/combat abilities... This is unsatisfactory. You just keep doing the same thing mission after mission, slowly grinding your way up just to get another minor boost. I can't recommend this game to solo players.

Would still prefer dedicated, controlled servers but player hosting and occasional cheaters indeed turned out to be much less of a problem than I thought it would be.

In regard to the gameplay, coop cave exploration/navigation is surprisingly enjoyable. Procedural level generation and classes with different builds provide variety. And I appreciate that DRG doesn't require time investment to get to the ""real game"", majority of the experience is opened pretty much from the start.

The game's very friendly monetization is often mentioned. All DLCs are cosmetic and, with plenty of comparable cosmetic available for free, could be seen more as an ""voluntary donations""(with some DLCs marketed exactly like that).
I don't mind paying for continous game update/support and ""single purchase is enough"" doesn't excite me as much as it does many others but whatever works for the developers.

DRG feels like an absolute labor of love, while the game can seem a little daunting to start, I quickly felt that I was able to understand what was going on. That being said I feel like I constantly learn something new while playing this game.

Solo or COOP I feel that I can play an endless amount of DRG, and so far I have been. This game is incredibly well balanced, and just about every build I've made is viable. Speaking of builds, there are thousands if not hundreds of thousands of possible unique builds. This on top of 4 different characters, each with 3 primary and 3 secondary weapons to choose from, makes for endless variety. As someone who enjoys switching playstyles frequently I feel like I still have thousands of hours of new playstyles and builds to use.

The possibility of nigh infinite build variety is further elevated by how fantastic the gunplay feels. On the highest difficulties you genuinely have to try at this game, and the tightness of the game feel makes that effort exhilarating.

DRG also has a very satisfying reward and progression system. Cosmetics, season pass, and materials for upgrades are all fantastic to provide something to work towards.

A tale of stout-hearted dwarves, beneath the sky.
With pickaxes and hammers, they carve through the stone,
In the caverns they dwell, in a world all their own.


Dwarves of the deep, with beards long and bold,
Legends untold, in the caverns they hold.
Mining for treasures, under moon and sun,
Dwarves united, a brotherhood begun.


Underneath the earth, where the jewels gleam,
Dwarven forges echo with a fiery theme.
Crafting the armor, forging the blade,
In the heart of the mountain, where secrets are laid.


Oh, the halls of stone, where the echoes ring,
A symphony of hammers, the anvils sing.
In the flickering torchlight, a tale unfolds,
Of dwarves so resilient, with hearts made of gold.


Dwarves of the deep, with beards long and bold,
Legends untold, in the caverns they hold.
Mining for treasures, under moon and sun,
Dwarves united, a brotherhood begun.

Through the dark tunnels, they march as one,
A fellowship strong, under the mountain's sun.
In the mines they toil, with a purpose clear,
Dwarves of the deep, free from doubt and fear.

Deep in their halls, where the ale flows free,
Dwarves raise their tankards in jubilant glee.
Songs of old, tales of the brave,
In the company of dwarves, memories they save.


Oh, the halls of stone, where the echoes ring,
A symphony of hammers, the anvils sing.
In the flickering torchlight, a tale unfolds,
Of dwarves so resilient, with hearts made of gold.

Dwarves of the deep, with beards long and bold,
Legends untold, in the caverns they hold.
Mining for treasures, under moon and sun,
Dwarves united, a brotherhood begun.

As the mountain stands, against time and tide,
The dwarves endure, with honor and pride.
In the depths they thrive, where the gems do gleam,
Dwarves of the deep, in the realm of a dream.",1679313042,1706433448,True,3,0,0.54356849193572998,1,True,False,False

The combat is intenese cause that is exactly what you need while you search for a fountain for 30-40 minutes and you went 3 or 4 times in the same places, and it seems that there is no place on the map unsearched, a lot of combat during that to get you out of ammo eventually.

Though the genre itself is not huge (4P PvE FPS) I think DRG is easily the one game that got closest to L4D2 standards and even surpassed them. Showing the true amazing potential of this category. This game has near perfect gameplay and chemistry between players, it also has amazing developers that crafted a game for the players first, and passion second. Rather than most FPS games developed these days, made for profit first.

I think it's fair to start with the gameplay first. You are one of the four dwarves with unique load-outs and skills, you are dropped in a procedurally generated cave each time, your missions vary from mining out a specific ore, salvaging mini mules, or operating a machine such as defending the refinery or escorting a drilldozer. You are not alone in these caves, or rather this shattered scorched mineral rich planet. Bugs of various shape and form chase you down, climbing out of the soil. I will admit, unless you're playing a harder difficulty the types of bugs don't matter that much. But I think the true strength of the game lays in the chemistry between the four dwarf classes. Each one has unique abilities that help you throughout the game tremendously.

Now nothing is really stopping you from playing the same class, but playing a well rounded team with all four of the dwarves proves to be the most fun and functional way to play the game. The Scout's ability to use his grappling hook to reach places quickly, the Gunner's strong DPS, shield and zip-line, the Driller's ability to quickly drill away soil, and its above average fighting skills, and the Engineer's various gadgets such as the turret, and his platforms. All of these things compliment the team-play perfectly. The Scout is very useful during high stress clutch moments, with the ability to evade bugs quickly to get nitra (resupply currency) for his team. He is also useful to get to places most teammates can't get quickly to. The Driller's ability to dig through soil comes to use when drilling to the Drop Pod, or other objectives. You can even establish underground bunkers to survive bug swarms. The Gunner's ability is simple, yet powerful. He is the big tank, he shoots the big bullets and shreds through bugs, his shield is important when reviving downed teammates, or when you are in a pickle. His zip-line is also another useful movement gadget, especially if you are protecting a target. The Engineer's passive damage, and his platform gun pair well with the scouts movement.

While during lower difficulties you are simply growing accustomed to the game, when you start playing higher difficulties, bugs start to become a real problem. There is a lot of variants, big boys that spit out acid or freeze you, flying or walking spitters, things that can grab you and throw you around, or drop you from heights. There is also missions where you need to fight bosses, or robots. There is a lot of mission types, and they can be replayed many times, I won't mention each one but my favorites are definitely refinery and escort missions. Each involve protecting a target, and surviving waves of bugs coming at you. The refinery is especially fun on hard difficulties when you are scrambling to stay alive, preserve your ammo, and fixing the refinery itself. There is also other missions that are each very fun, but obviously some are better than others.

Another notable thing is that throughout the missions you go to, there is a chance you will come across other random missions, spicing up the game even more. There is also deep dives which you unlock as you level up, but in order to talk about those we first need to talk about perks and leveling up. Each mission you finish earns you in game cash, and XP. With XP you can unlock various perks and use up to five of them (three being passive and five being active) on your missions. You can also buy upgrades for your guns and gear, buy hundreds of different accessories (instead of paying real money for them) etc. In order to unlock different types of guns, and stations within the ship you need to pick up assignments. Which award you handsomely.

Now Deep Dives are just like regular missions, but deeper and more difficult. Especially Elite Deep Dives. Where you need to finish three missions consecutively. You need to ration your ammo, survive various hazards, and depend on each other. Until you are done with each mission and can return home. These missions earn you matrix cores and overlocks which you can use to even further upgrade your loadout. Though this part is usually controversial due to how grindy it can be.

I think that is all for the gameplay stuff I wanted to mention, it's time to quickly run through various stuff I enjoy about the game. It's well optimized, I never had frame issues with this game on the highest settings. The voice overs with mission control and between the dwarves can be hilarious. The amount of times me and my friends just kept pointing at a mushroom cuz of the funny voice lines is insane. Or the WE'RE RICH! The OST is phenomenal too, and the lobby... Good lord, I just love the lobby. Drink beer with your friends, kick barrels, piss off mission control. Dance on the dance floor, block your friends in their bedrooms. Try to clip out of the ship, find jetboots and fly to Hoxxes using them. Play the funny boot game and try to sabotage your friends, or just jump around.

 This game is an absolute masterpiece of passion and love. No microtransactions, no shitty policies, just pure old fun. This is what a game is supposed to be, so... ROCK AND STONE TO THE BONE!

[b]First of all[/b], the strongest side of the game is definetly the coop gameplay. From the first seconds of the game till hours of gameplay later, the coop way of playing is just perfect. With right friends this is kind of game where you will have fun even after getting bored from the coregameplay. Because of that i belive the game worth is beyond the price. For some 30$ can seem like a lot, definetly f*cking not. Now im 77h in and i have no plan of leaving any time soon. For 30$ you will ""mine"" more fun then from some AAA game.

DRG is where dwarves dig for gold, shout ""Rock and Stone!"" or ""Mushroom!"", and occasionally question their life choices while staring at the same cave missions for the 400th time. Don't get me wrong, blasting bugs and grappling through caverns with my bros is beard-strokingly good fun.

But after a while, the novelty of mining the same ol minerals and dodging the same ol critters starts to wear thin. It's like that feeling when you've memorized every line in your favorite movie - yeah, it's still a classic, but you wouldn't mind some fresh popcorn, am I right? We're practically dwarven archaeologists at this point, unearthing the same relics and fossils faster than Indiana Jones on a sugar rush.

So, the devs, bless their pointy ears, throw us a bone every now and then. New weapons, cosmetics, even the occasional biome shake-up. But let's be honest, it's like adding sprinkles to stale space cake. We crave a whole new bakery, a buffet of biomes, a smorgasbord of spooky crawlies to squish. Don't get me wrong, Deep Rock Galactic is still a blast, a guaranteed pick-me-up after a long day of not being a badass space dwarf. But like any good ale, it gets a little stale if you keep pouring from the same keg.

I'll start this by making clear that this game is really less grindy, and the grind that it has it's really damn fun! a lot of types of missions + random maps? Hell yeah, and even the cave is your enemy, the cave won't make your life easier to get to the stuff you require.

Even if it seems complex at the start the game does a nice job guiding you, and you'll realise how simple the game really is, and you can always ask people around! This community is one of the least toxic ones (i ofc saw 1 toxic even if i had less than 10 hours, but let's be real.. toxicity will be anywhere).  Even if you find a toxic player your experience won't be really sour at all! Because of how this game is made it makes people be nicer and just work as a team.

Upgrades? I fucking love them! this is one of the few games that doesn't stress me to try to focus in the meta, most upgrades have their use, and you can do some strong or crazy loadouts with them, so yes any upgrade is better than having none.

Battlepass? damn it doesn't even matter if it ends! the cosmetics ain't gone, you can get them other times, even if it's slightly harder it's 10 times better than stressing your players by making them play for ""exclusive"" stuff, and after all they're cosmetics.

It's a really nice game and i hope it goes far, it offers a lot of replayability thanks to how it's designed, and the fact that they allow you to play on directx11.. it made me even more excited! 

Tip: if the game crashes try to launch on directx11 or safe mode, this usually fixes problems.

But the reason this review is marked Not recommended is that the game suffers from various issues, and I cannot in good conscience allow new players to buy in uninformed.

1. The game is very grindy. 

DRG relies on an absurd amount of loot RNG. Overclocks are your ""keystone"" equipment upgrades, but you can only loot them from a random pool. Do you play scout? Have a driller upgrade instead. Cosmetics are gated by the same system, but are even worse because they are split between three different loot pools. Matrix cores, lost backpacks and equipment crates have hundreds of possible drops and the chance of getting any particular item (ie, what you want) is miniscule. This is a grind that will take you months, possibly years for a more casual player and nothing has been done to alleviate it even as GSG piles more unlockables on top with each passing season.

2. The gameplay is very repetitive.

The basic gameplay of DRG has not changed much since the game was in early access. You dive into a cave, you mine minerals, you come back with the loot. What varies is the biome, the mission type, the enemies, the mutators etc. The pool of assets the map generator can pull from is pretty broad, but not as much you'd think. You will quickly start to recognize recurring elements, like ""the spiral room"", or ""the vertical shaft"", or ""the salt cubes"". The more you play the more things become rote and uninteresting because you've seen them so many times. If the game doesn't catch you within the first 2 hours of play I would recommend refunding and trying something else. What you see is what you get, the game does not expand much if at all, you just get more guns and hats to wear while you do the same content again.

3. The game doesn't respect the player's time.

When your dwarf gets a promotion to the next rank it used to be that you could just go to the class select terminal a few steps way from your bedroom spawn point and click a button to get promoted. Now you are forced to trudge all the way to the far end of the memorial hall every time, turning what should have been a point of pride into an irritation.

Sometimes when you try to join a lobby the last slot is filled by someone else just before you hit the button, in most other games this would just say ""oops lobby full"" and return you to the lobby browser to select a different mission. In DRG you get an error message, followed by a loading screen as the game forces you to respawn in your bedroom and run back over to the lobby browser before you can try again. There is a nearly identical error message called ""UNKW Server Error"" that does the same thing and you may encounter both of these multiple times per play session just for having the audacity to join a mission in progress.

A third example of this is crafting matrix cores at the forge. Every time you craft something it plays an unskippable cutscene. The playerbase has been begging for years on their hands and knees for a mass-crafting feature or at least the ability to skip the cutscene, to no avail.

4. The game relies too much on FOMO and other tricks used by Live Service Products tm and MMOs to cover for a lack of content.

Once you see the tricks the game uses to prod players into doing the same content over again you won't be able to unsee it. Better finish your Battlepass Dailies! Better finish your Weekly Assignments! Reminder that the Deep Dives will reset in X hours better complete them before they're gone for ever ever ever! It's the same stuff that MMOs and other predatory games do to keep players hooked, which is a shame because the game didn't need any of this. Deep dives have multiple objectives per mission instead of the primary and secondary of normal missions, that alone proves that they could easily iterate and expand on their core gameplay loop, but instead we got FOMO.

------

As a conclusion I'll mention a particular issue that saps a lot of the enthusiasm I have to play the game or support it going forwards.

The first two DLC bundles released were Dark Future and Megacorp containing an armour set, a weapon set, and paint jobs. There was also a free cosmetic set called Scale Brigade that players could earn by ranking up. What all three of these sets lack is a skin for pickaxes, unlike every other cosmetic set released to date. This is not because GSG doesn't care or put effort into things they make, it is simply because those three sets actually pre-date the pick customization system entirely. Scale brigade just happens to be my favourite set, so I (as well as many others) for years now have been asking for GSG to go back and update those old sets to include pickaxe skins. It seems like low hanging fruit since the skin texture already exists and the only possible result of adding fresh content to older DLC is the sale of more DLC.

And yet, even so many years later this and many more issues remain. It’s apparent that GSG is making the game they want to make and don't pay much attention to what the playerbase wants or needs. Instead of adding quality of life features, they would rather spend the time and effort to program, model and skin of all things, a flappy bird arcade machine for the space rig. To be fair, they have every right to do that as the owners of the IP, but it still comes off as profoundly tone deaf and is why I cannot fully recommend the game to anyone in 2024.",1706189911,1706198732,False,7,0,0.491242885589599609,0,True,False,False

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I got this game shortly after season 4 came out (which is probably the least favoured of all this game's updates) and since then I've sunk over 500 hours into the game.

This game brings me back to the days where I'd get home from school and just sink HOURS into OG Call of Duty Zombies. The days where I'd just completely lose all track of time because the crew was trying to finish an easter egg or something. After playing COD zombies for so long, it just stopped being what it once was, and it left a hole in the games I played that was never really filled by anything.... until DRG came along.

I got it because of the funny memes my buddies sent me but, after a week or two of hesitation too, and man do I ever regret that time. The concept of the game is solid, you play as a team space-faring, cave-spelunking dwarves with the sole of objective of making it out alive. Using unique guns, grenades, and equipment you do your damnedest to keep up with the company's quotas and objectives. 

The voice lines are funny (even if you don't include the google translate mods), which is something you'd expect in a co-op shooter of this variety. But where Deep Rock really excels is with voicelines that have different rarities over others. There's times where I hear some for the first time today. Not only that, but the biomes are much more beautiful than they need to be. Even when I started playing on my own build (which struggled to maintain 40 frames at mid-high graphics cuz it was so old), there were times where I'd turn off the HUD and just meander through the caves with the only goal of taking it all in. ESPECIALLY in Azure Weald, place feels like you were sent to Pandora but instead of tall blue aliens you're up against crab/spider monsters.

Getting to Season 4, the elephant in the room, I really don't think it was as bad as people said it was at launch, even as green as I was at the time. Sure, sometimes a Stingtail would send you to a different area code, and sometimes a Corruptor would end your run before it started. But I still think they provided a good amount of challenge, not too much or too little, and they could be beaten easily so long as you and your team strategized accordingly. I think the saddest part of Season 4 was when the Devs made it possible to turn off the higher corruption odds in the November update. I see it as ""hey Devs, we hate this thing you made SO MUCH that we want you to remove it completely"", I just see it as an unnecessary kick in the face from the community.

The gameplay is top notch, I keep jumping into games whenever I can even though I've unlocked pretty much all there is to unlock because its that good. With friends, with randoms, and on your own, this game gives you everything you need to be successful, but makes it challenging every step of the way. Throwable flares both give you just the right amount of light and also nowhere near enough. There is endless customization with your weapons, equipment, cosmetics for it all, and even Bosco that i wonder if anyone has ever made the exact same loadout as someone else by accident (even though Infinite Monkey Theorem tells me otherwise). The new weapon maintenance feature adds on to that even more by rewarding you for playing with every gun. Before, I used to stick to maybe one or two loadouts, but now, I've fully built out every loadout the game gives you. Procedural generation really is the engine driving this game. It makes it so that typically easy challenges can go to impossible in the blink of an eye (like a tritilyte bomb dispenser in a pit). It makes it so that no to caves are the same. Even if some individual cave shapes are copied, the smaller terrain it generates can go anywhere which keeps these caves fresh game-over-game. The hordes are crushing, you can go from peacefully mining nitra to downed because you decided to finish the vein and not get ready when mission control said so. Sometimes it seems the horde spawn time is random, but the pacing is always just enough to test you for a couple minutes before dropping you back into the peaceful atmosphere. Even if you think it's too easy, the modding system this game has makes it unimaginably easy to make the game as hard as you want. Enemy design is spectacular too, you can look at two pixels of some bug and know exactly what it is, but they're also similar enough that in a horde you don't notice the slasher about to one-tap you. It only adds to the masterful balance the game puts forth for difficulty.

Man and I haven't even talked about the music yet. Remember when I talked about the ambiance of the caves? Well imagine you always had a perfectly fitting theme song for whatever you were doing. Booming drums for huge swarms, and softer horns for quiet spelunking. This game takes music to a whole new level. You'll never want to open up Spotify and bring your own music because the game pretty much has a DJ that perfectly fits whatever situation you'll find yourself in. And there's juuuuust enough music to have some songs feel new to you on occasion (maybe because you were too busy blasting bugs to notice).

Boy do I love this game, it really got me back into gaming after pretty much stopping altogether. I could go on forever about this game but I seriously doubt more than 3 people read all that^ up until this point. After playing games like Left4Dead, CoD Zombies, and other co-op shooters across many platforms, I can firmly say that DRG really has no rival. The only way I would improve this game is to add more mission types, that's it, maybe make it so cosmetics didn't come as suits but as individual pieces like with the pickaxe? It would be cool to see a mission where you recover the whole drilldozer or smtg, justify it by saying ""management says the overhead on losing an entire drilldozer every time is too high, we need to bring em back now"" and make that a whole new mission type. Or maybe one where you're saving a dwarf that was left behind? You get it up and it becomes an NPC aid like BET-C or smtg. I've played a lot, and more and more ideas for this game just keep popping into my head.

Idk, this game is great, get it if you haven't.

While matchmaking can certainly be fun, and playing alone can be rewarding in it's own right, a group of friends feels necessary to approach such a refreshingly cooperative yet casual experience. 

That said, DRG can be deceptively challenging at times. Difficulty can spike, but never in ways that feel unfair. After all, death is never very punishing, and you're always in control of adjusting the difficulty. The more complex elements of the game feel like the right kind of slow-burn, and will keep casual fans entertained for as long as this game is supported.

Simply, DRG is the perfect hang-out game where everyone can contribute without having to hyper focus on bosses or objectives.

Buy this game now. Deep Rock Galactic is my favourite horde shooter available. There are 4 classes that each have their own strengths weaknesses and play styles, every single one of them is fun to play and use, all of them feel balanced. The procedurally generated caves make every run of this game feel unique and rarely gets boring.

The development team are active, they are open to suggestions and criticisms and they listen, something that is very rare in the current industry. I love this game and you will too, go and play it now.

Every class plays differently, each with a unique arsenal of weapons and their own tools for navigating environments. There's a good variety of missions and enemies, as well as randomly occurring events which sometimes pop up during missions which provide bonus rewards and progression as well as a fresh objective to keep your team on their toes. The music is arguably the best aspect of the game in my personal opinion, as some of the tracks surrounding the horde sieges are truly bangers. My only real complaint with this game is the progression system itself. It's not until 10-20 hours of playtime that you start to feel your character getting stronger with the perks and upgrades you unlock, as the XP reward system is very stingy and revolves very dependently around a battlepass. You cannot pay for tiers of the battlepass, which I generally consider a positive, however, in order to progress through the tiers you need to complete daily objectives, some of which the game outright does not allow you to do. All too often I've found myself loading into the game with the goal of levelling up, only to find that my daily objectives require me to complete missions of a certain type or in a specific region which I cannot access due to its absence from the current rotation. This leaves me feeling as though my time playing the game is wasted unless the proverbial stars have aligned to allow my progress, and ultimately drives me away from playing the game entirely. The rotations swap out relatively frequently, every half-hour or so, but if you don't get the region/mission type you need, waiting around for another chance at the region appearing in the next rotation is less than fun. In the scope of everything this game does right, it's a small complaint, but it's one that has consistently irked me. The game's community is notably quite friendly, but that is not without exception. Never trust a Driller. They can and will use their satchel charge to blow you and everyone else up in the final moments before extracting. If you've grown tired of Left4Dead after all these years, I would recommend this game. Otherwise, just play Left4Dead.",1705879222,1705879222,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game offers four distinct classes, each with their own unique weapons and tools, that complement each other in team play and create diverse gameplay scenarios. The game also features a rich progression system, with customizable cosmetics, perks, and upgrades for your gear and your personal space rig.

The game’s strongest point is its dynamic and immersive environment, where you can dig, build, and explore in any direction, creating your own paths and strategies. The lighting and sound effects create a tense and atmospheric mood, as you never know what lurks in the dark corners of the caves. The game also has a great sense of humor, with witty dialogue, hilarious animations, and a catchy soundtrack. The game is best enjoyed with friends, as the co-op mode allows you to coordinate your actions, share resources, and revive each other in case of trouble. The game also supports cross-play between PC and Xbox One, making it easier to find teammates.

The game’s main drawback is its lack of variety in terms of mission types, enemies, and biomes. After a while, the game can feel repetitive and grindy, as you do the same tasks over and over again, with little variation or challenge. The game also suffers from some technical issues, such as network lag, bugs, and crashes, that can ruin the experience. The game is still in active development, though, and the developers are constantly adding new content and fixing problems, so the game has a lot of potential to improve.

Overall, Deep Rock Galactic is a fun and addictive co-op shooter that offers a unique and satisfying gameplay experience. The game is not perfect, but it is definitely worth checking out if you are looking for a game that combines action, exploration, and comedy.

So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he let me borrow his controller. Me and my son then played in turns and I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

[h2]Gameplay[/h2] 
I love how the game plays. It is a team co-op where you and your teammates have to complete an objective while being attacked by constant swarms of bugs. Thanks to the mission variety and the cave generation, each play session feels as refreshing as the last. But I think what most impacts the game’s lack of boredom is its characters and build variety. Currently, the game has 4 classes: [b]Gunner[/b], [b]Driller[/b], [b]Engineer[/b] (best class), and [b]Scout[/b]. Each one counts with 3 main weapons and 3 secondaries[spoiler], and each one of those has a variety of overclocks that change the gameplay completely[/spoiler].

[h2]Visuals and effects[/h2] 
There is no denying that this game looks awesome. It has a unique and flavorful art style that emphasizes the whole map’s destructibility, and it complements perfectly with the astonishing biomes. All of this is paired beautifuly with an awesome sound design that helps you immerse in the various caves that you encounter… and let’s not start with the soundtrack since I want to eventually finish this review. Finally, to round everything up, the interactions between [b]Mission control[/b] and the dwarves feel so natural and are extremely funny. I love the voice acting.

[h2]Ending Statements[/h2] 
Honestly, I love this game and its awesome community. I never knew people could be so kind and working towards an end goal, be it with strangers or [strike]friends[/strike]. It made me boot the game excitedly almost every day. And I have not mentioned the awesome perks, like a FOMO-less free battle pass, incredibly content-packed updates, or developers that actually listen to the community. I have spent around 300 hours when writing this review and the only thing I regret is buying the DLCs on a discount.

That would be it, miners. Thank you for reading me and hopefully we can meet in-game. ROCK AND STONE!",1705795157,1705795338,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead- murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was… astounded. I… I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time – something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange – uh, I guess… I guess you call it a ""hit"" – on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in [heck]. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is.",1705790726,1705790726,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

I don't like how progression works though - a highly leveled character can't really play with a new player. The power difference is simply too big, and it seems like that game doesn't really do anything do help mitigate this fact.

I don't know how they managed to make spamming voice lines a regular occurrence, but it's never annoying.

I don't know how they made the lobby where you wait for your friends to get ready for the next mission, so fun and satisfying to be in. The space rig somehow never gets old, and there's plenty to do! They even go crazy during the holidays and make it extra festive and decked out!

I love pissing off the boss at every possible opportunity, such as by kicking barrels into the launch bay. Or kicking barrels into the ship... or by... dancing? :D

Every single class feels fun, and I love playing all of them! I thought Engineer and Driller sounded dumb on paper, but they're probably my favorites!

I was also afraid to do public lobbies, but once I did I did not regret it. The community is very accepting, very tolerant, and very helpful. If you seem like you're lost, there's almost always someone coming down to show you the way. Get grabbed by a cave leech? Well, your whole squad is booking it to help you!

While there is a relatively interesting game here it's buried under cosmetics and live service game design that leave it feeling hollow.

The gameplay itself is simple and engaging, you land, you dig out valuables and build up your horde, fight the monsters, and then make a dash back to the ship to escape. In practice however it can be a bit clunky and highly repetitive. The game is built around terrain deformation which can be tedious and unwieldy until you've upgraded your tools, and requires some blind digging upwards into walls to reach certain minerals. The procedural level design can also make navigation confusing as you dig down and have to make use of limited mobility tools to get around the map.

I can see the game being fun with friends but PUG play felt uncoordinated if at least cooperative and friendly. The most off-putting part for me was the live service framework - don't get me wrong, it's a free game but you're instantly met with a colossal grind in every aspect. Class levels, talents, equipment upgrades, unlockable equipment, cosmetics, shop points, buff beverages... it's one thing to have a lot of content but every one of these have progress bars and unlockables stretching off into the distance of the screen. While some might be excited at the prospect of so much content to discover, I found myself groaning at the chore of what laid ahead.

Ultimately this is a game that really wants you to no-life it in order to get anywhere, you start under-powered and unable to contribute much so the grind is a necessity from the start. Mission objectives are repetitive and gameplay is shallow as there might be a lot of minerals and mobs but gameplay is largely 'hold left or right mouse'. Friends can make doing anything fun, but seeing the daunting mountain of work and not really getting much out of the gameplay it's not an effort I have the time or interest to invest in. Also the voice acting is offensively bad. Overall a fun game for the right people but expect to put a lot in to get anything out.",1705318185,1705669752,False,0,1,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

I just want to leave this game a positive review, I may well edit and add more at a later date.

All you need to know is this is a fantastic game that makes the grind very fun. So far in my 60 hours of play it has a very solid and friendly community. As its not competitive and very team work focused it just seems to attract a greater calibre of player, its refreshing to enjoy playing with people again.

Despite only having a handful of mission types it does not get boring and each time down in the depths of Hoxxes feels great. 

Great customisation, perks and weapons upgrades. It's just great

I really wanted to like this game, especially after hearing my friends talking about the fun they had with it.  I tried the first couple of missions solo and it seemed intriguing enough.  Grouped up with those friends and tried a few more, but it never felt like I was making much of an impact, enemies soaking up everything I threw at them before downing me over and over.  I couldn't join them on regular, allegedly more fun missions since I hadn't finished the introductory batch, and helping me out was just holding them back from doing what they wanted.

I tried doing a couple more solo to catch up.  I still felt like everything was taking too long and that I must be doing something wrong, that there must be something that I was missing.  I got frustrated, I got bored, and I wasn't having fun, not caring if it gets better later.  I uninstalled and haven't played it since, and have no desire to return.  I would have applied for a refund if I could, but my game time was over the limit.

It's a shame since I can see that this game keeps getting a lot of praise.   But I'm not generally fond of multiplayer-focused shooters, and this game, as good as it seems to be for a lot of people, has not won me over.",1705519526,1705519526,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Never in that time have I ever had a doubt about the passion Ghost Ship Games has for this game: They remain grounded and active in the community, while their sensible approach to problems and criticism has earned my trust.


The game is very team-spirited, and encourages collaboration and camaraderie between you and your fellow Dwarves: Should you fail a mission, you failed it together (No doubt with a heroic last stand!); order a round of beer and try again.
I will naturally suggest playing with friends, but joining a random lobby is just as fun since there is no 'meta' so to speak.
Virtually any combination of weapons, upgrades and classes will work: A big part of this game's replay-ability comes from how many different play-styles and tweaks can be made to a given gun, specialising for certain missions or generalising for adaptability - I urge you to experiment with your loadout and class rather than stick with what is comfortable.

The procedural generation of the levels makes each mission a challenge, and gives each biome a different atmosphere.
The sound design evokes feelings of wonder and fear in equal measure, and that's not to mention the gloom.
Darkness is one of DRG's core mechanics, and makes it stand out amongst similar co-op games with destructible terrain.
A few dozen rare events and challenges allow for even more variety, without even mentioning modding.

Some may be discouraged to have heard about a season-pass - Do not fret! No content is locked behind any kind of paywall: The DLC are exclusively cosmetic, as are the rewards from progressing through the season.
It usually takes about 100 hours of playtime to unlock all the new content in a season, and it is possible to unlock everything you missed from past seasons and events, from Christmas Hats to Weapon Skins.

Grab a pick and try it out!
Be warned that if you reach Greybeard status as I have, you will struggle to play other games that include darkness without attempting to throw a flare. And the Rock and Stone! Shouting will start to become a genuine habit.",1705508987,1705508987,True,2,0,0.53947371244430542,3,True,False,False

I have to admit there's not much content (only 8 mission types and some missions modifiers), but the gameplay offers a high degree of replayability. Higher hazards (difficulty level) pose a real challenge, by increasing swarms, enemy damage and health, for those of you who want a tough, demanding experience.

Weapons are fun to use for the most part, with a few outliers being just usable but not as good as their counterparts.

Weapon build variety is slightly better with OC's (OVERCLOCKS) which change the way a weapon behaves but even amongst overclocks there are only a few viable ones for each weapon type, some overclocks being straight up WORST than their original overclockless variant. However, besides 1 or 2 bad weapons most were fun to use.  

The no-pay battle pass system is commendable and all the game modes are fun. The constant rotation of maps, hazards and random modifiers added with procedural generation freshens things up, keeping the game interesting.

Its so good I had to get it twice(gifted a friend and may possibly gift another to another friend).  If you love adventurous games I highly recommend this game. I rate it up there with legend of Zelda games, The Witcher 3, and of course my favourite Skyrim. I thought I put in many hours into those games COMBINED, but this game has taken that podium. With over 670hrs into the game, I've not yet lost any interest which is saying a lot considering I play mostly RPG high profile games that requires a lot of hours into its game play.  Saying this game is a gem of a an indie game that should deserve more recognition that it currently has, isn't even cutting the ice. You can do so much in this game I don't even know where to begin so I'll just list random things off the top of my head that I love:
- customise your charter to whatever you can think of. I saw someone roll play as freaking Nardwuar and Bob Ross.
- SOO many collectable things to acquire in game. Such as gun mods, and skins for each and every gun/BOSCO 
- NO MICRO-TRANSACTIONS! YOU buy the game, you get access to the whole game!(well excluding a few cosmetics add ons, but its not needed to play the game)
- Procedural generated caves. Definitely one of my favourite aspects as its what keeps the game fresh and exciting. 
- And of course my favourite would be the community. The community is like none other. The players are all (at least in my 670hrs experience) very friendly. You want help completing tough missions? Need help getting certain achievements? Just ask and you'll be surprised the amount of people who will help. 

I know this is a long review, but just know that its, because this game is just this good.  It's a game I cant explain to you or tell you how great this game is. All I can say is give this game a try. Sooner or later you'll find yourself on the same position as I am right now, on the review section of Deep Rock Galactic and write away your experience.

It's very fun to play with friends especially if each goes as a different dwarf class.  It's even easy to play on older computers that also don't got a lot of memory.

The gameplay loop is on the level of Monster Hunter in terms of satisfaction, the gunplay is extremely diverse and satisfying, all four classes feel distinct and compliment each other perfectly, and the enemy variety is just about perfect. As a horde shooter I'd actually put it ABOVE Left for Dead. Environments are similarly fantastic with only one real stinker (fungus bogs, why are you the way that you are?).

Technically, the game is utterly exemplary when it comes to procedural generation. The systems they have in place make every single cave feel engaging to navigate and interesting to explore. Even with how complex the generations can be, it is incredibly rare for something to feel scuffed or broken. 

The community is also the best I've ever experienced in an online game. The absence of PvP, the emphasis on teamplay, and the amount of character and charm the game has are likely the biggest contributors to that sense of camaraderie. It's so non-toxic that it's genuinely jarring when someone puts down another player, even mildly. In my hundreds of hours I can count the number of negative interactions with randoms on one hand.

I like other aspects of the game, like the silliness of the Space Rig and all the little details that the devs have put in, but the core aspect of the game seems like a time sink with little to no significant reward. The other thing is that the build structure seems completely played out.

There are optimized ways to perform each task or mission that have long since been discovered and laid out, but even with future updates, nothing new is being added to the game outside of additional threats in the form of New enemies or regions.

I see the appeal, but the game is too similar to the 'same-y-ness' of games like Left for Dead or Gears of War. You're essentially just running over the same ground (or under, as the case may be), indefinitely to pass time. Level ups feel less impactful knowing there's nothing significant waiting for me at the endgame outside of (again) long discovered and laid out modifiers for the existing abilities.

If you like the kinds of games that I listed above and enjoy a simplistic 'horde mode' with gradually increasing difficulty and lots of grind, then by all means, pick it up. The community is extensive and there's lots to enjoy. Ultimately though, its not engaging enough for me without more significant progression or story.

Rock and stone lads. You are a dwarf, you mine, you blow up bugs and you get drunk. What else is there to ask for? A really fun game with a massive fanbase, great humour and something for every kind of player. 

[b]Story:[/b] No story, but fun characters that the fanbase has fully fleshed out into icons.

[b]Gameplay & controls:[/b] First person shooter and a run bind! My pinky is very happy. I don’t think I’m ever playing the game and getting mad about the controls.

[b]Visual design:[/b] Love the way the game looks, very simple while still allowing for some cool and gorgeous caves, while also not sacrificing my PC’s hardware.

[b]Music and SFX:[/b] So good, one of the few games I would not mind just listening to without having spotify on in the background. Guns make a very satisfying sound and all bugs and events are identifiable by different sounds.

[b]Enjoyment:[/b] A really fun game, solo, with friends or with randoms! If you like shooters, what the hell are you even doing? Go get the game.

[b]Achievements:[/b] 69 achievements in total, not hard, but very time consuming. You will need friends for a couple of them like Car pool and Karl would be proud. 

Overall, completely deserved the labour of love award. Such a great game that I am unable to explain in just a review, you have to go play it. Literally my only issue is that some of the missions get stale after playing for 300 hours and there’s no cross play with steam and console. Hopefully the next update brings in a ton of new stuff!

Absolutely amazing gameplay, great music, classes that synergize with teamwork and a NON TOXIC GAMING COMMUNITY?!?!

Also this game is SO BEAUTIFUL and immersive with it's worldbuilding despite mostly being procedurally generated, and everything moves so fluidly and alive that it just immerses you even more!

Overall it is a banger game and should definitely be recommended, and even if you aren't the best with shooters or gaming in general, my mother (who barely actually plays games) actually enjoyed it a LOT, so i just wish the best for this game!

Rockpoxs removal is annoying. It is designed in a way that one person sprays cleaning foam and the other sucks cleaning foam however 90% of the time one player will end up juggling both tasks while the other shoots all the aggroed rockpox bugs
Stingtails should not be able to climb walls or ceilings. This in combination with their grab gives them the ability to throw dwarves into the air and oneshot two out of the four classes that can't negate their own fall damage without a perk
Timegate on cores sucks and serves no purpose other than to pad out the game's real world play time. In my experience unlocking all the weapon overclocks takes a little under 10 months of weekly play which is ridiculous for completionists. This isn't even counting the cosmetics

I used to enjoy playing ""Left4Dead(2)"". Deep Rock Galactic is not directly comparable, but it is similar in terms of game mechanics and replay value. Although a single-player mode is possible, the game is really fun in multiplayer, as each dwarf has his own skills, which can be combined well with the others.

Each class brings something to the table, interacting with the environment (and other players) in clever ways - not to mention the wealth of weapons, mods and skills you can play around with to cater to your preferred playstyle. The procedural generation and mission variety, combined with the random modifiers and events, also put a unique spin on every session. Even after 250+ hours, Deep Rock keeps me guessing. 

It's also very silly, if you like that sort of thing. 

Honestly, this is one of the smoothest and most enjoyable gameplay experiences I've ever had, jam-packed with action down to the last detail. The devs clearly have had fun making this one - every single aspect of the game simply oozes with charm, innovation and quality, to an frequently [i]ridiculous[/i] degree.

This game is (as the developers said themselves) [quote=devs]""A mix of Left 4 Dead 2 and Minecraft""[/quote]4 player co-op against hoards of AI enemies. This combination works very well together and when combined with the aspect of procedurally generated maps (all of which having stunning ambience and visuals) makes for something that no other game could accomplish.
My favourite aspects of this game are the friendly and welcoming community and how visible it is that this isn't another cash grab from a greedy publisher. There is no premium battlepass, there are no microtransactions within the game, all customisations can only be gotten through playing the game.

If you have't played it yet, go and try it out, you won't regret it.

Getting down to tacks, the gameplay is amazing, a PVE, objective-based horde shooter with Four classes and four distinctly different styles of play, with many opportunities for great synergy.
they also have plenty of extra content there with them to shape how you play.
the levels have varied objectives that keep things interesting, from the simple mining of a specific ore, to eliminating a bunch of boss monsters. side objectives included! 

i wanted to add this to my reasoning.
 in this day and age where games are constantly swarming you with battle passes and other such subscription services, DRG never does that in the traditional way. in fact it makes itself distinct by making last season's ""battle pass"" [and cosmetics grid] items obtainable through the normal loot pool. the ""battle pass"" is also completely free, you don't have to buy it, and it's not subscription based.
This. This is what a live service model should be. a reward for doing something you were going to have fun with anyway. not something you fork money over and grind forcibly because you want one thing, and you feel obligated to do rest of because of the money you spent.

with all of this in place, the DLCs that are here are purely cosmetic, and nothing more. if you like what you see there, i'd encourage you to get it, buying the DLCs are one way to support the devs! in fact there's two DLCs dedicated to that.
there are other ways in game to get cosmetics, if you were worried about cosmetics only being sold by DLC don't be, this game won't pull F2P garbage on you.

while i don't think i'm the best at utterly describing how good this game has been to me and my friends who have played it, i still definitely think it's worth full price. if you grab it on sale that's alright too, the game's great and has genuinely been a good time.",1705170018,1705170018,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game itself is boring, since what little progression there is requires massive amounts of grind, to the point you will get a higher rate of progress/hour in a fucking MMORPG. Shooting mechanics are boring and bland, and the gun balance is ass when you try to solo. Naturally, that ISN'T really a problem in a co-op game... Until you are down 2 guys and your gun has enough ammo to down 3,5 enemies and your grenades barely do anything kek

One of the best games I've played so far, and even after lots of hours it's still just as enjoyable. Thanks to procedural cave generation every mission feels new, you see different challenges in each cave which keeps the gameplay fresh
[list]
[*]Jet Boots are great and fun to use, it's always exciting when you find their create in a cave
[*]The class system is excellent, all 4 types are unique with diverse weapons and gear, and all of them are very enjoyable to play. Despite having different movement tools, you can climb and descent almost anywhere with any of the classes with each tool
[*]Weapons and tools have great visual and audio feedback, all of them sound and feel exactly how you'd expect them
[*]Every input is instant and you can animation cancel almost anything. Every time you move, shoot, climb etc. the effects happen instantly and it feels great. It's hard to explain without trying yourself, but everything you do feels snappy and satisfying
[*]Great class synergy, all the weapons and tools can be used together and you never really feel like you're the weak link or not as powerful as other classes. They're all unique, they can all deal with pretty much any enemy alone and in a team
[*]Great custom crosshairs for each weapon and tool, they're really neat. The only thing I dislike is the M1000's crosshair because the exact center of it isn't visible enough compared to the rest of it, which often throws my aim off
[*]Nice built-in modding support with automatic updates
[*]You can play solo with a small drone companion, or in a team with friends or randoms. In most mission types you can join in mid-game too
[*]Good enemy designs and excellent variety. There's a lot of them and they all feel, look and behave uniquely with different counter plays
[*]The art style is great, and the audio design is excellently done. Positional audio, unique enemy noises, sound queues etc. are all really well done
[*]The developers seem to listen to the community which is great to see <3
[/list]


[h1]Mixed[/h1]
[list]
[*]Although the animations are top notch, some weapons kinda feel meh to use imho. The Warthog has a strangely unsatisfying recoil effect and reload animation. The EPC and Sludge Pump often don't feel responsive, you have to click and hold for a bit for them to fire sometimes, rather than just spam clicking. It's kinda annoying especially when you have bugs swarming around you and the gun just doesn't want to shoot
[*]Some features work differenly based on if you're the host or a client in a team. Hoverclock, Jet Boots etc. can be really annoying to get used to when you're the client as they behave differently than how you'd expect them to. I can't get used to Hoverclock as a client player, it's considered a buff but I don't see it, imho it's clunky and annoying. And Jet Boots activate when you only want to jump and I find that they overheat quicker because of it, since you build up the heat meter when you didn't even want to use them
[*]The new player experience is poor, you have no clue where anything is on the Space Rig. Once you get used to things everything's fine, but it's quite miserable and overwhelming trying to understand what's what as a new player
[*]A lot of things on the UI are great, but a lot of things could be improved and made more intuitive
[/list]


[h1]Negatives[/h1]
[list]
[*]Cave generation can be complete bs sometimes with its heights and tunnel entrances
[*]The OMEN machine event is unfair if it has a Drone Replicator module. The other 2 options are fine and enjoyable to play against, but since the bottom module is always a Radial Pulse-Gun, you can't focus on both its projectiles and the drones, while also dodging the 3rd module, staying on the maintenance spots, and shooting the weak spots all at the same time. The drones make this fight complete bs
[*][strike]Some enemies are horrendously imbalanced, such as the Rockpox infected ones. They have what feels like 99% damage reduction everywhere apart from a few random weak spots which are tiny and hard to hit as the bugs more around. And every time you do they release a cloud of Rockpox that lasts for way too long, having complete area denial wherever they shoot their projectiles or where they're are killed. Not to mention some enemies have their weak spots on a side you can't even attack, such as Macterra or the Breeder, so good luck killing them. Blasting their weak spots, and cleaning Lithophage spikes are satisfying, but everything else about Rockpox is a headache. I get that it's the lore and whatever, but the gameplay is awful. It's not even about the difficulty, they're just irritating and unfun to play against. I actively avoid every single Lithophage mission as much as possible, literally never want to see them again until they're rebalanced.[/strike] The November 2023 update fixed a lot of these issues imho
[*]Some maps have environmental effects which imho are annoying and don't add much to gameplay. Things like earthquakes in Magma Core, ice storms in Glacial Strata and sandstorms in Sandblasted Corridors. The last 2 significantly limit your vision, and all of them reduce your movement speed by a lot. These don't do anything, just annoy the player
[*]Septic Spreaders are frustrating to deal with because they fire in an arc even if they don't have direct line of sight on you, and their toxic projectile deals too much damage imho
[*]The difficulty spike in some cases is terrible imho. The Glyphid Dreadnought for example has a close range stomp attack which is really slow and easy to dodge as a solo player. But as soon as you have 1 more player with you the Dread's attack speed makes it almost impossible to dodge; if you're within its range when it starts the stomp you're basically dead
[*]Hazard scaling is sometimes inconsistent. Haz4 (second highest difficulty) is sometimes surprisingly easy, other times it spawns way more bugs than haz5 would. I don't see why this difficulty level is so whack. Sometimes it's so insane the mission becomes undoable because the game spawns an unreasonable amount of bugs that are impossible to deal with
[*]Rival Shredders and Naedocyte Shockers are irritating to fight against, I wish they were removed from the game
[*]The Rockpox Corruptor is tedious and imbalanced to fight against, and I hate how it can hyperspeed jump away during the battle, so you have to waste even more time trying to track it down. If you don't, you'll have puddles of Rockpox on the ground which deal way too much damage, so you're kinda forced to deal with the Corruptor if you want to enjoy the rest of the mission
[*]Some machine events can spawn in areas that make them impossible to complete within the given time. I get that it's procedural generation so you can't implement failsafes like that, but in some rare cases you have zero hope of completing the event
[*]Similarly, primary objectives can (extremely rarely, bit still) land in inaccessible spots. We had a Deep Dive where the Gunner with the Coil Gun shot a tiny hole that went deep into the wall during a fight, which is where Hack-C ended up landing afterwards. If we didn't have a Driller that would have been a nightmare
[*]In solo, Bosco is absolutely useless when it comes to defending Doretta. Quite often enemies can clip inside the drilldozer's hitbox which might be what's causing this issue, but even if they don't Bosco refuses to shoot anything at all even if the bug is literally right in front of him. It's mind blowing how this hasn't been fixed yet, which is funny because Engineer's turrets can find and shoot bugs regardless of where they are around Doretta
[*]Bosco sometimes fails to launch missiles on command. For some reason he stops engaging the enemies and just floats there doing nothing at all. And when you recall him or tel him to attack something else, he'll fire the missile you had ordered previously anywhere between a few seconds to a few minutes afterwards

You can play one mission per session or how ever much you want in a row.
Every map is unique (procedurally generated), there are several types of mission objective and various other things that make every mission feel unique and refreshing so you won't get tired of playing.
Not to mention the different classes and their own unique and varied arsenal to choose from and customize.

One of my favorite things is actually the community, very friendly and good to newbies.
There is a button to salute, and it is used very frequently by everyone.
Players barely use the chat to communicate, there are very simple & useful contextual pings instead.

I keep playing even after achieving all the mechanical upgrades that exist, I'm not even playing for the cosmetic upgrades, this game is just so great and has perfected its genre.

Deep Rock Galactic is the co-op FPS you never knew you needed, featuring space Dwarves with more attitude than a supernova. Grab your pickaxe, call dibs on your favorite class, and get ready for a wild ride through procedurally-generated caves filled with destructible environments and enough alien monsters to make even Ripley blush.

1-4 Player Co-op:
You and your buddies better stick together like beard hairs in a minecart because these caves are no joke. Team up, dig deep, and fend off hordes of extraterrestrial nasties. Remember, in space, no one can hear you scream... but your fellow Dwarves can definitely hear you if you don't share those valuable resources.

4 Unique Classes:
Whether you're mowing down enemies as the Gunner, scouting ahead as the over-enthusiastic Scout, drilling through rocks like it's your day job as the Driller, or engineering the heck out of everything as the wise-cracking Engineer - there's a Dwarf for every personality, and they're all ready to bring the boom.

Fully Destructible Environments:
Who needs a carefully paved path when you can make your own? Destroy everything in your way, whether it's rocks, alien critters, or the Engineer's questionable taste in music. The cave's your canvas, and your pickaxe is the brush.

Procedurally Generated Cave Network:
Every cave is a new adventure. With procedurally generated caves, you'll never get bored. It's like playing hide and seek with aliens, except they're not hiding, and they definitely want to seek you. Good luck!

High-Tech Gadgets and Weapons:
Dwarves don't mess around. Flamethrowers, gatling guns, portable platform launchers - it's like an interstellar Home Depot on steroids. If it doesn't explode, is it even worth using?

Light Your Path:
In the darkness of space, you're not alone. Equip your own lights because these caves make the abyss look like a cozy campfire. Remember, if it's not illuminated, it's probably hungry and coming for you.

In Deep Rock Galactic, the only thing deeper than the caves is the camaraderie among Dwarves. It's a riotous journey through space where the only thing more explosive than the alien onslaught is the banter between friends.

There is always some combination of challenging terrain to traverse, unique enemies to ward off, varied challenges and objectives to focus on, and strengths of my chosen class to play around with.

There is a near-perfect balance between butt-clenching tension, grappling away from a hoard of bugs with just a sliver of hp and the faint red glow of healing sugar in the distant tunnels, and between peacefully picking away at some gold veins, exploring beautiful and diverse underground ecosystems, and petting lootbugs of course. It never gets stale, and I find that I actually play because the game is fun, and NOT because I'm grinding to unlock some item that'll only give me +0.02 defense against poison damage when submerged in water.

So Pizza! Last night we did an escort mission. I am riding Dorretta as she gets to a wall that looks open at the top. I braced for her to start going through the wall and looked around at where some bugs may come from (as they seem to always appear as she goes into a wall) then suddenly I realized I was not moving. I looked around and didn't see a hole where Dorretta was going. I look up AND THERE SHE IS. GOING STRAIGHT UP THIS WALL INTO THE TINY OPENING IN THE CEILING. I rush to jump back on her and finally get on top of her AS SHE SUDDENLY WHIPS ME OFF AND starts down THE WALL. LIKE SHE GOT TO THE TOP JUST TO DRILL A MASSIVE HOLE THROUGH THE TOP. I rush back jump back on and I'm standing straight up on her butt when SHE STARTS GOING BACK STRAIGHT UP TO THE HEARTSTONE.



(My friend, an absolute legend of unrecognized comedic talent):

Good day Miner, and thank you for contacting the Miner Support Team here at Deep Rock Galactic. After reading your concern and opening our investigation at 1:44 GST (Galactic Standard Time) and after reviewing your concern as well as your team's employee records, we have closed our inquiry at 1:44 GST with zero liability found on the company's part and immediate action required of your team.

Through our quality control unit headed up by Karl, the company's position is that the firmware for the DRG Drilldozer (what you miners insist on calling Doretta) is flawless and takes the path of least resistance to the objective Heartstone targets. If operated properly, the missions have an exceptionally high survival rate of all involved of 78.43%. If the Drilldozer took a path that you question, it's either operator error or the Drilldozer's firmware is more intelligent than the operator.

Our records of your various and frequent incidents of misconduct as well as your report that the Drilldozer was ""drunk"" are indicative of operator error. As your part-time engineer (Employee ID: PIZZANECKPILLOW) has found out on numerous occasions, operation of the Drilldozer is impeded by the use of alcohol and that is not an acceptable fuel type for the machine to operate with. Your filed complaint and a corresponding Missing Equipment report now explain why the Drilldozer Reacquisition Pod arrived back at the company warehousing moon empty following your assignment.

Please reacquisition the Drilldozer from this place you call ""home"" as soon as possible and return it to the Heartstone for Company pickup to minimize the fines the Company will assess as these compound by the hour. Upon return and mandatory Company reinspection (which will take 4-48 weeks) your pay will be unfrozen and your Abyss Bar privileges will be restored.

Thank you as always for filing this complaint.

Rock and Stone!

In Deep Rock Galactic you role-play as a dwarf miner, and you have to mine ore for management while fighting hordes of monsters in the depths of procedurally-generated caves. 'Deep Rock Galactic' is a competitive multi-species company that uses dwarves as cheap, disposable labor force for the dirtiest, most dangerous jobs. We also know that other mining ventures deemed Hoxxes IV “too dangerous” to be profitable.

Pros:
- Fun game-play loop
- Friendly community
- (Completely optional) modding support
- Knowledge is rewarding and powerful (although there is a steep learning curve)
- Character customization available in terms of visual looks and gameplay
- Variety of different mission styles
- Fun ingame voice-over character that reacts to gameplay
- This game actually puts role-playing in the genre""Action ROLE-PLAYING Game""
- Seasonal rewards can still be earned even if the season has already progressed - and this is a play 2 earn mechanic!
- All in-game content can be purchased via credits as a PLAY 2 EARN mechanic! You do not have to worry about having to spend more money to actually play the game. Looking at you, Destiny 2.....
- Remember to ROCK & STONE and drink your BEER!
- We're rich!

Cons:
- The promotion system can be exhausting. If you want to main a particular class in this game, this is discouraged. You are forced to play other characters during your promotion, as you do not gain experience on the class you are currently promoting. Playing 5 missions on the promoting class is really not efficient if you could be gaining levels on another class. It's understandable that this is implemented so that players rotate classes and experience the full game, but this could be enforced in a more main-alt friendly manner.
- The grind in this game can be tedious. Leveling up and promoting your dwarf can take a huge amount of time. There are achievements that require high ranks on every class, essentially forcing you to play hundreds of hours if you ever wish to obtain these achievements.
- You'll be spending at the least 5-10 hours or so on each class unlocking every weapon option. This is can be fun. What is less fun is having to buy the same cosmetics for each class individually. I've totally bought plenty of cosmetic items thinking I could put them on each character, only to be disappointed that I have spent all my resources and credits on items I can only use on a class I didn't intend it for. This is totally a valid excuse to continue mining for another 10 hours though...
- This game is cursed and ever so often the game will greet you with the 'Lost Connection To Server' error and you will lose all progress in your active mission. If you were almost back in the drop pod, say goodbye to your credits, experience and materials!
- When hosting a mission, a single player can completely sabotage the run. If you are alone and one miner joins, Bosco will no longer accompany you. If you are down and your 'friend' dwarf decides to leave the game, your mission fails even though Bosco would normally be able to revive you.
- Unlocking matrix cores, which are used to create very powerful weapon upgrades (absolutely mandatory for end-game content), is time-gated by a weekly deep dive mission. As you can only receive rewards once per unique weekly deep dive, this is not farmable without waiting many weeks. You could theoretically farm them by promoting classes, but this is not realistic to be doing every time you play. Leveling up and promoting takes a lot of time.
- The forging animation, that will play when forging using matrix cores, plays every time and cannot be skipped. It can easily take a few minutes if you saved up some cores.
- Even though the procedural generation of levels in this game is really good, I wish there was more gameplay variety so a dwarf could take a break from mining once in a while. Of course, management would never agree to this.

The atmosphere is rich (but not in the ""makes your voice high pitched"" sort of way). I'm always intrigued by the flora in the biomes and it always makes you feel like you're diving into an alien ecosystem. All four classes looks unique and fun to play ...but I'll always be a Driller at heart. There's also many different builds you can make and you can play the way you want since pretty much everything is viable. 

Very rarely does it feel repetitive due to the procedural generation, random events, weekly stuff, and seasonal events. There's also new stuff to look forward to since the devs consider the game a labor of love. They listen to the community and they still update and add new content to the game even to this day. Plus, playing with company always makes it better. It's a great game to mess around with friends. I wouldn't sleep on randoms either. The community is so close that it's almost like a cult, which may sound bad to say but it's hard to compare close everyone is otherwise. For example, every dwarf knows that when find Compressed Gold you have to ping it repeatedly, exclaiming ""We're Rich!"" maybe until mission control yells at you to stop. Even though it's mostly a multiplayer game, going solo is also still a blast with Bosco, the bestest boi in the game probably next to Lloyd. 

I think the only gripes are RNG for getting the overclocks and cosmetic cores you want (I always end up with other stuff for other classes except what I want for Driller) and small stuff like how each class is mostly forced to have a color, like Driller is stuck with yellow a lot (which I don't mind but someone else might).

Points to add:

No Endgame - Certainly for Vets like me.  (Certainly more so now). 

Some levels on Haz 5 don't even feel like Haz 5. All depends on if you have to carry other players. 

Since the beginning, there have been some weird add-ons that people have demanded instead of just grinding - e.g. cores being added to promotions. I have like 750 now. 

Flowers like Bulbs etc are kinda useless after you research all the beers (which provides nothing but humor?)   

You can accomplish everything in less than 500 hours. (If you're decent & speed run xp missions). 

Community - Positive all in all however you get the odd person or Russians that don't like vets/ can't take advice or kick for no reason. 

People need to learn from pure Vets with actual hours in the game rather than using Mods that give you 9999999 xp. Yes this is the mechanic and is how this works.  

Grey beards (Ruby Class) should get a separate section.

Recommended by one of my friend on Discord. This game is very fun to play, has great gameplay and amazing co-op experience, although best enjoyed in multiplayer but one always able to experience it in Solo mode.
[hr][/hr]
[h2] Pros & Cons [/h2]
[h3] Pros [/h3]
- Surprisingly very welcoming community and they all friendly during mission, something i rarely found in other game that require teamwork. In my 800 hours of playtime i'm only came across 1-3 toxic player, which is incredible!!
- The game aesthetic really match with the artstyle, love it.
- Gunplay feel so good and each gun feel unique, can be customize with frameworks and paintjobs (also that M1000 ""ping"" sound)
- Mood-boosting soundtracks especially on the right moment like swarm and mad dash during extraction.
- Support tool that actually can be use for teamwork.
- You can drunk during the mission. 
- Procedural generation mean different experiences and feel less repetitive.
- 4 different flavors for the dwarf with their tools and weapons unique to each class.
- Performance pass are free, no need to spend money to finish or to unlock extra reward mean no microtransaction. Previous season cosmetic still obtainable too, by finding Lost Equipment and Cargo Crate (based GSG).
- DLC only contain cosmetics, buy it to support the Dev.
- If you want to immerse yourself to breathtaking view of some planetary region like Azure Weald but didn't want to bother your teammate. Don't worry, Solo mode in this game isn't harsh, and you will be accompanied by a drone that has puppy-like personality Bosco.
- Lots of enemies variety.

[h3] Cons [/h3]
- The Rockpox Corruptor has too much particles that cause FPS drop, it's also bit hard and annoying to fight in Solo mode.
- Sadly, unlike weapons. No customization available for support and traversal tools, if the Dev add this it would be great.

Well that's all my opinion in this review for DRG, best co-op game i ever played.

Has a ridiculous amount of grind that doesn't even unlocks anything interesting,  a dozen insignificant upgrades, skins, and a few hats/beards that are mostly invisible under the blocky armor.
The game thinks it is a MMO, and starts on a ""season"" page that gives nothing, it uses the same cheap tactics as a MMO or gacha game, with multiple currencies, diminishing returns grind, timegated events and drops, while offering only maybe 5% the content of an average MMO, and not being free. And you can't encounter other players with your team, you either play together on your own server, play solo with a bot, or join a team of randoms on a public server.
Even if your group of friends have a passion for digging and mining, good luck keeping them invested in this boring game for longer than 4/5 missions. That's the number of different types of missions, and you'll just be doing the same sh*t/different day on progressively more difficult maps, killing the same boring waves of insects coming at you every 5 minutes like clockwork.
The levels are pitch black with splotches of light in the distance, and it's often difficult to visually process what's on the screen (just look at the screenshots) and you lose sense of depth. The semi-cartoony WoW-like graphic style didn't help either, but that's just personal preference.
The overwhelmingly positive reviews are probably due to a toxic juvenile audience. Just go play a MMO instead. Or literally any other coop game.

If you like swarm shooters, even a little, buy this game. You will not regret it. Even at full price. The Dev’s of this game, somehow, have not given into modern corporate greed, and continue to churn out amazing content for this game that can be unlocked… Get this… By. Just. Playing. The. Game... Unreal. 

Rock & Stone Miner!

Pros - 

You are one of four hilariously voiced dwarf men. A Scout, Driller, Gunner, or Engi. All of these classes play exceptionally differently, and are ALL an absolute thrill to play as in their own rights once you get used to them.

The music… It’s so catchy and iconic.

The UI and controls are pretty much all very intuitive and simple! The gunplay is just, fantastic.

The upgrade system… The overclock system… The dwarf customization… *Chefs Kiss*

Hilarious joke Beers in the hub. Not even to mention all the random garbage lying around in the hub that you can mess with that will either scratch your ADHD riddled brain or make mission control pissed at you.

This game is EASILY enjoyable in just about any mood, at any level of soberness. You can play it seriously and sweat your balls off in Haz 4 - 5 missions or an EDD, or, you can be drunk as all high hell IRL and play Haz 1-3, laughing the entire time at random crap, and still win… Or hilariously lose.

The rando’s that you can queue up with in this game are some of the best rando’s in the entire gaming community. Nice people, helpful people, meme lords that just, kill you with laughter… All sorts.

Karl. The Dwarfs. Mission Control. Bosco. Lloyd. BETTC. Dorretta. Mini-Mules. Molly… Steve. Even the Bugs. There is SO much character poured into all the models, animations, voice lines and characters. It’s really awesome, even after roughly 500 hours in DRG, I find myself chuckling at certain voice lines or animations I’ve heard / seen many times over.

The map generation system ensures that every mission always feels slightly different than the last. Enough different biomes and mission types to keep you quite interested.

Mod support. Official mod support. There are TONS of really, really good mods for this game that will not disable progress or achievements. 

Nearly EVERY item (Bar some seasonal stuff that you can get during the respective seasonal events that come around every year) that has ever been added to this game can be obtained simply by playing. No extra money to buy previous seasons passes… None of that. Just play the damn game and earn those old cosmetics.

The install size is sub 5GB, and can be run on potato devices at decently stable frame-rates. The optimization of this game is INCREDIBLY well done.

Great mod support from the Dev's!

Mids - Having to redo the Promotion missions every time a Dwarf reaches level 25 can get old pretty quick. 

Some mission types can wear on you, making you want to avoid them. Morkite is one that wears on me.

I originally got this game to play it with friends, and since then I have learned so much about this game to the extent that I love just playing with randoms or even getting a chance to teach new players how to play. This game has some of the coolest PvE I've ever experienced, with interesting weapons and classes that all work fit together to make for a powerful unit to face any opponent.
The dev team is also super dedicated to updating the game, so if you want a game with staying power this is definitely the game for you.
There is so much love and charm poured into every aspect of this game, and it's all backed by a community that loves and appreciates it in every way.
Worth every penny.

If you embrace the premise, and view it through the lens of a co-operative game, you will quickly learn why the missions can become so fun. Each dwarf has advantages and weaknesses, and each dwarf can cover eachothers weaknesses. Missions require very active participation from everyone in the cave. The scout needs the engineer to make platforms, the gunner needs the driller to create pathways, etc. The more thorough a team is about collecting resources, the more everyone benefits in terms of currency, materials, xp and so on. These resources serve as the players progression, weapon unlocks, cosmetics, everything that matters is 100% accessible through gameplay- no real money needed. You can unlock everything yourself, in a timely manner, and you can always have something to do, and the game doesnt gouge or entice you into doing it like a second job. there is no FOMO, no predatory daylies or battle passes, there is just gameplay and then rewards for gameplay. 

But most importantly? it's a FUN game. the dwarves can interact verbally, they can reach insane topspeeds and they can do insane damage to the enemies, environments or their own teammates. It is a game that approves of any playstyle, the objectives are diverse and challenging but not frustrating (mostly- save for korloks and corruptors).

For a laugh, I had AI write a review for this game with this prompt: write me a game review about ""rock and stone"", dwarves, mining, bug shooting, dancing and beer. Make it comical and use ""rock and stone"" as many times as you can.
Here is the AI review:

""Rock and stone my fellow gamers! Have I got a game for you! Imagine a world where you can live out all your dwarf fantasies (and no, I'm not talking about those tiny garden gnomes). I'm talking about a world where you can mine for hours, shoot bugs, dance like there's no tomorrow, and drink beer until you can't tell the difference between a rock and a stone.

In ""Rock and Stone: The Ultimate Dwarf Adventure,"" you play as a stout and sturdy dwarf on a mission to collect as much precious minerals as possible. But don't let the simplicity of the premise fool you, this game is anything but dull. From the moment you start, you'll be chanting ""rock and stone!"" along with your fellow dwarves as you embark on your epic journey.

The graphics in this game are as solid as a rock (pun intended). Every mountain, every cave, and every bug you encounter is beautifully designed, making you feel like you're actually in the game. And speaking of bugs, get ready to shoot them with your trusty pickaxe. Nothing says ""rock and stone"" like taking down creepy crawlies with a good old-fashioned mining tool.

But let's not forget about the real highlight of this game - the dancing. Yes, you read that right. These dwarves know how to bust a move and they're not afraid to show it. Whether you're taking a break from mining or celebrating a successful mission, the dancing in this game will have you laughing and grooving along. Just make sure to hold onto your beer while you boogie, we don't want any spills now.

And speaking of beer, it's practically a currency in this game. As you progress through levels and complete tasks, you'll earn beer that you can use to upgrade your gear and abilities. Because let's face it, what's a dwarf without a good supply of beer?

Overall, ""Rock and Stone: The Ultimate Dwarf Adventure"" is a hilarious and addictive game that will have you shouting ""rock and stone!"" every chance you get. So gather your fellow dwarves and get ready to mine, shoot bugs, dance, and drink your way to victory. Just remember, in this world, there's no such thing as too much ""rock and stone"". Cheers!""

There are way too many high level yet thin skinned ego maniacs that can't be asked even a basic question without pulling out the ban hammer. While they are less than the average game about (15%) of games. They're still enough to leave a really toxic vibe in the air after you've carried some jackhole 25minutes for them to ban you without any consequences to them. There are consequences for miners in public games to lose their time to a powerdrunk host but there is nothing that stops the Host to think if there won't be blowback for them being reckless.

C'mon, you know the one... 'That feeling' back in highschool, perhaps middle school. Back when you rolled with a chronically-online clique. You met at the lunch table to discuss the night, rushed through your homework and scarfed down your dinner, then you grabbed soda and some snacks as you marched to your computer. That's where your REAL day starts...

And even when I'm playing with randoms, it feels like I've always known them. That's how strong the community is here. We have unspoken rules, compassion for rookies, a refusal to leave your coworkers behind, a favorite beer and a setup 'you just GODDA try it!'

Nothing short of a culture.

We can talk about what we like and dislike about DRG without a hint of tribalism. Some people hate certain mobs and objectives, others hate aspects of [strike]Random Number Generation[/strike]  luck during key moments, while I just say ""Thank Karl, I was getting bored!"" instead of ""You hear that?

This game is great, please play :)

Massive mini-gun, turrets and nukes, huge drill and literal flame thrower, grappling gun and an attitude. This is the core of deep rock galactic's 4 classes in no order. These are great, but i think the game really shines through its world generation. There is several biomes, all with unique procedural generation, and may have status modifiers that amplify your gameplay experience to a new level, with games ranging from peaceful excursions to an alien planet, to clawing for your life as 3 bulk detonators swarm you and your teammates. Truly an experience of a lifetime, and one that will last a lifetime as there is simply so much stuff to do. I have 140 hours and havent even scrtached the surface of potential for this game.

If you're reading reviews, you've probably heard about DRG before. In my opinion, here's what you need to know.

There is no P2W or predatory micro-transactions, never has been, and never will be. You buy the game and you have everything needed to enjoy it to the fullest, no DLC content expansions or locked content. Each season has a battlepass with no premium or real-money version to get more loot or accelerate your progress, it isn't even an option. Once the season ends, all rewards from it are put into the game's overall loot pool, so you can still obtain anything you missed. The only exception to this are some (always free) holiday cosmetics which can only be obtained during the game's seasonal celebration events, but I do not fault the game for this. Otherwise, everything is 100% obtainable and paying isn't an option. All DLC listings in the store are cosmetic-only if you want to support the developers and look super cool. Overall, the monetization of this game is 100% consumer-focused which is incredibly rare these days. 

The class design and balance were built from the ground up to facilitate teamwork and camaraderie. In my 700+ hours, the vast majority of these were spent joining lobbies with random people I don't know. Of those literally hundreds of lobbies, I have encountered 3 rude/unpleasant people. Others may not be as lucky as me, but my point is that this game's community is famous for how wholesome and welcoming it is, and this is due to the incredible design efforts of its developers. 

The scout has a grappling hook to reach ore on walls and ceilings. The engineer has a platform gun to give scout and the team more ground to stand on. The gunner has ziplines for faster traversal and a bubble shield for protection. The driller drills real good and sculpts terrain which is essential when you're mining in a cave. The game has an intuitive and simple ping system, so it is very easy to communicate without voice chat or text chat. There is a dedicated action, set by default as the V key, where your dwarf raises their pickaxe and yells some form of ""ROCK AND STONE!"" in an arbitrary celebration that still makes me chuckle. If your squad does something cool, ROCK AND STONE! If someone falls off a ledge and dies, ROCK AND STONE! before reviving them. If someone clutches a swarm and then revives the whole squad, ROCK AND STONE! If a teammate blows another teammate up by accident, ROCK AND STONE! You cheer for the stupidest stuff constantly, it's amazing, and it never gets old. 

It is very hard to ever be toxic when playing DRG. With the aforementioned ping system, (just hold ctrl and click on something), there are also funny voicelines when you ping a fellow dwarf. ""Engi, do you sleep with your sentries?"" (Engi has turrets) ""Did you borrow my underwear?"" ""Gunner, are you compensating for something?"" (Gunner's guns are huge). The classic and brief, ""You're cute!"" and the list goes on and on. 

Each mission type has voicelines unique to its objectives that gives the game so much personality and makes everything lighthearted. When you're in the hub space rig selecting a mission, you can dance to a juke box and drink beer while you wait for people to finish their builds. Beers have goofy effects that may or may not persist into the mission itself, and there's always a featured beer that does bring a buff into the mission. 

The gameplay loop and progression is good. Each class currently has 3 primary weapons and 3 secondaries, which each have their own traits you can select based on your preference and playstyle. Each weapon also has several overclocks which can completely change its behavior and open up a new playstyle that wasn't possible without it. Guns and traits within a class or across classes can have interactions leading to synergies that are fun but never required. If scout uses his grenade that shocks enemies, engineer can select weapon traits that deal more damage to shocked enemies. If engineer chooses to bring 2 turrets instead of 1, with the right overclocks he can shoot them with his SMG and arc lightning between them, or trigger an electricity explosion. If you enjoy the core gameplay, the build variety and progression will only deepen your experience. 

Overall, this game is a rock and stone/10. If you think you might like it, buy it and try it.

Picture this, lad. You, me, and a bunch of other dwarves, armed to the teeth, descending into the very belly of Hoxxes IV. The camaraderie, it's like nothin' else, forged in the fires of the caverns. ""Leave no dwarf behind"" is more than just words; it's a way of life down there.

The mining, aye, it's hard work, but the hauls are shinier than the gems we dig out. The aliens, though, they're nastier than a gang of soused orcs. Every swing of the pickaxe is a dance with danger, and ""Rock and Stone"" becomes a battle cry, echoing through the tunnels to keep our spirits high.

Now, when the work's done, we gather on the Space Rig. It's a giant metal beast hurtling through the stars. We hoist our mugs, shout ""Rock and Stone"" again, and let the stories flow like a river of ale. It's a celebration, aye, but there's always that shadow, that weight on the heart.

""Leave no dwarf behind,"" it's the creed, but the reality is harsh. Not every dwarf makes it back to the Rig. There's joy for the haul, but also a direct hit on the heart. I've seen mates get devoured by Glyphids, Gruffnir, right in front of me. It's a nightmare etched into the very core of your soul. The darkness takes its toll, Gruffnir, a constant battle between the riches and the cost.

So, me lad, as ye embark on this journey, remember, the Space Rig parties are grand, the riches are sweet, but the darkness takes its toll. Rock and Stone, Gruffnir, Rock and Stone.

The game is BORING.

The initial gameplay is pretty fun. Leveling up, getting new weapons, getting to know the enemies and procedurally generated maps. It is all pretty fun. But after that as with every horde-shooter there is not much to do after you hit the level cap. Yes there are deep dives, but they are just harder and more meta-focused levels with pretty much same enemies and objectives, so you know what to expect.
This game suffers from lack of diversification, even though maps are random their layouts are similar. Enemies are also theoretically random but they just have different names and do slightly different type of damage.
That being said I would not recommend the game for its price. In the limited genre of horde shooters 25 euros is not a bad price, but the amount of very limited (not short) quality of content is too weak compared to other games that offer the same for less. Warframe is free and although it is scammy-grinding it offers so much more in terms of different levels, types of enemies + has a story. Vermintide 2 is pretty much same price but graphically and gameplay-wise much better than Deep Rock.
Each to their own, I just wish people would stop having a stick up their asses. Yeah, AAA companies are bad, we get it. Does not mean all indie games are way better,",1704453308,1704453308,False,4,2,0.49628758430480957,0,True,False,False

Positives I have experienced:
-Incredible art style and game atmosphere
-Fantastic movement feel
-Every class feels important and down right mandatory for higher hazard levels
-The community feels like a breath of fresh welcoming air compared to other co-op PvE games I have played in the past
-Customization is out of this world and literally everyone, given enough hours in gameplay time, will look totally different
-BOSCO!!!!!!!!!
-MOLLEY!!!!!11!!!!!!!1111!!!!!!
-Weapon design and feel is better than 80% of shooter games I've played in the last 5 years
-Sound design is TIGHT as HELL
-Getting plastered with THE BOYSSSSSSS
-Fat Boy :))))))
-Neigh-infinite replay ability
-And the Soundtrack is phenomenal

(The few) Negatives I have experienced:
-RNG turning me ass-down and just having weird spawns for objectives or infuriating modifiers
-Not being able to abandon assignments sometimes
-Dreadnoughts feel dated and more annoying to fight rather than difficult
-AI pathing being super jank and sometimes getting me killed
-Lithophage.
-Dash being a perk and not a mechanic (just a lil pet peeve preference and my Scoutbrain wanting more general schmovement in the game)

Overall 8.75/10, definitely worth playing for well over 100+ hours, maybe into the quad-digit zone if my hyperfixation tends to stick like the glue it is

10/10 - One of the greats without a shadow of a doubt.

^ That was 146 hours. I now have almost 700 and I'd like to touch on a few points from the perspective of a true Greybeard, here since the beginning (or super close I don't actually remember).

What Greybeards LOVE
1. When you press V
2. When you use brain.exe
3. Pissing off Management
4. When team stays close together and no one wanders off.
5. Being recognized for playing game way too much (We Greybeards are very proud of our stars)
6. Buying beers for team (We are literally millionaires, let us buy you nice things bro, don't be weird.)
7. Annoying management by pinging gold or Bittergem chunks
8. Showing off our totally un-called for ability to absolutely SHIT on hoards of bugs for Greenbeards
9. Flexing our frigging SICK overclocked gear
10. Stunting on Greenbeards with our overwhelming and totally overdressed dwarves clad in the shiniest gear known to all 9 realms.
11. When Drillers actually drill for team to get from A to C (Skipping B).
12. When Gunners use their shields and tank for team (Your a Gunner, don't be a wimp)
13. When Scouts use their flare guns and actually mine the ores high up and grab the things the rest of us can't or would struggle to obtain.
14. When engineers throw platforms under ores, secondaries etc for scouts

What Greybeards HATE
1. When you don't press V
2. When you don't respond to constructive or informational chat
3. Drillers who C4 engineer platform fortresses (I will nuke you into oblivion including anyone who tries to rez you until you apologize to me, Karl, and Molly. We do not care.)
4. Greenbeards who run off all alone (like Karl) and get downed 347 meters away bc they can't kill bugs on low haz missions (or high haz tbh).
5. Greenbeard Engineers who DON'T throw platforms for scouts
6. Greenbeard Gunners who DON'T use their damn shield when it is warranted, or at all. 
7. Greenbeard Scouts who don't use their frigging flare guns or mine/grab the ores, objects etc.
8. Greenbeard Drillers (General blanket statement. Driller has like the highest skill cap in game if you know what you are doing. If you don't you just suck and your playing the dumbest dwarf so your gonna get bullied, *spits*.)
9. Greenbeards who call the drop pod before we complete an event (Omen or Kursite or Tritilyte etc etc)
10. Greenbeards who DON'T drink the beers we Greybeards buy for you (You suck)
11. Greenbeards who do the things we Greybeards hate joining any deep dive or elite deep dive (Go back to haz 2 you gutless mud miner).

In Summary, I have sunk far too many hours into mining Hoxxes V. I have platinum and gold for all dwarves, my lowest being Scout @ Gold 2. So yeah, don't be shit, and if nothing else press V to keep from being harassed by disgruntled Greybeards. If you are a Greybeard who does not press V (Yes they exist) F**K YOU!

Rock and Stone you damn leaf lovers. Now get back to work before management hears about our huddle

The artstyle is fun. The jokes and voicelines are gold. And when those crazy bug waves hit the blood starts pumping. Nothing beats a final stand with 3 downed teammates on HAZ 5. There is unlimited replayability. The caves don't get stale, because they are never the same. Every cave is a surprise, and that makes the game even better. 

You can play alone, with randoms and meet some new friends. Or play with friends you already have. The community is mostly very friendly to new people. Just don't join the Haz 4 & 5 missions when you first try the game out! Start at lower levels and work your way up as you gain experience with the mechanics of the game. Trust me, Haz 5 when you start off is not a good idea.

The guns are also very fun. The variety is good. And some guns are really creative. Sure, some of the weapons probably violate the Geneva convention. But that does not count here. We are slaughtering bugs here. Who likes them?

* Mods that are not supposed to be game-changing are being allowed while a simple mod like a slightly-improved flashlight is considered game-changing and gets blacklisted, which limits the lobbies you can play in
* The flashlight in the game sucks and the dark nature of the game can cause your eyes to irritate if you're not used to it. When one of the most common suggestions is to increase the gamma of your game, take the hint that the default flashlight sucks.
* No chat sound notification so people aren't aware when others are trying to communicate with them
* Friendly-Fire is enabled and it creates more in-fighting than it actually affects gameplay
* The mineral deposit (Molly/Mule) has no queue system. This means means you can be stuck waiting for a long time before it arrives to you even though you called for it first, which can get you killed if you're in a bad spot, and it can create in-fighting when players are trying to call for the Mule at the same time
* The game's replay value is largely based on grinding
* The game is very grindy by nature; items and upgrades are locked behind RnG or timegated with no way to purchase them outright
* The game's highest difficulty is generally a joke
* No option to leave immediately after game is over; most people leave after the game is over, but you have to wait until the end-of-game review to wrap up before you can actually leave the lobby.",1671743723,1704324498,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Dort wartet ein Mission von 8 Missionstypen auf einer prozedural generierten Karte in einem der 10 Biome von Hoxxes IV auf uns Außerdem erwarten uns (je nach einem der 5 Schwierigkeitsgrade) einige bis Horden von ausgehungerten, blutrünstigen Hoxxes IV Einwohnern auf uns.
Jedes der 4 Team Mitglieder bringt einzigartige Fähigkeiten mit sich, um die Mission zu einem erfolgreichen Abschluss zu führen und letztendlich das nächste Bier an der Abyss Bar auf der Raumstation zu genießen.
Neben der eigentlichen Mission gibt es dann noch eine zufällige optionale Zusatzmission von 8 Zusatzmissionstypen, wobei sich 7 von diesen auf Sammeln von Materialien beschränken.
Für noch mehr Varianz ist dadurch gesorgt, dass Missionen mehrere Mutatoren enthalten können von 13 negativen und 8 positiven Mutatoren. Diese können einen großen Einfluss auf das Gameplay haben und für zusätzliche Schwierigkeit sorgen.
Es gibt dann mitunter schonmal Missionen, bei denen man auf dem höchsten Schwierigkeitsgrad nicht mehr als 3 min überlebt, auch nach mehrmaligen Versuchen. (bei jedem Versuch ist die Karte neu generiert).
Die 4 Zwergenklassen sammeln permanent XP an und können auf einen höheren Rang leveln. Durch die XP können Waffenupgrades freigeschaltet und mit den im Spiel gesammelten Resourcen bezahlt werden, sowie Perks. Es können auch neue Waffen freigespielt werden.
Nach der ersten Beförderung werden dann auch die Deep Dives freigeschaltet, bei denen man mit dem gleichen Team hintereinander 3 Misssionen spielt (soweit man kommt). Für diese erhält man dann auch besondere Belohnungen in Form von starken Waffenmodifikationen und kosmetischen Items.
Das Spiel wird momentan aktiv weiterentwickelt in Form von Seasons mit neuem Content.

Fazit: Den Entwicklern scheint ihr Spiel sehr am Herzen zu liegen. Es macht Spaß, als eingeschworene Gemeinschaft mit seinen Zwergenbrüdern in die Schlacht auf Hoxxes IV zu ziehen. Rock and Stone!",1704309223,1704309223,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

The gameplay is quite good and while it is better to play with friends, there is a solo option where you are given a semi autonomous drone to help you through missions. Each of the four classes has a selection of different weapons to unlock and multiple modifications to each weapon which leads to a high variety of gameplay. There are also various mission types and secret challenges within the missions to keep players on their toes.
The character customization in this game is okay. Most cosmetics take quite a bit of playtime to unlock and what you are given to purchase at level 1 can leave a lot to be desired.

Deep Rock Galactic is a PvE shooter that pits you and up to 3 other dwarven brothers up against an endless horde of entomological horrors, whether they crawl, burrow or fly, in 8 different mission variants. 4 classes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses in what they can do both combat and movement wise, be it the lightbringing grapple hook shooting scout, the zipline flinging lead slinging gunner, the platform launching sentry dropping engineer, or the driller who also has bricks of plastic explosive to go with his big drill hands.

Progression is dependent on 3 things: your credits, your precious minerals management lets you keep, and your diligence in completing your assignments. Doing mission will give you credits and precious minerals, assignments will allow you to unlock new weapons, their respective upgrades and customization options for your dwarf by completeing a string of missions. Run enough missions and eventually you'll be up for a promotion, in which you cough up some minerals and minerals and you are sent back to level one with not only a shiny star, but a key to the late game content that you can't interact with until you have it and access to the weekly Deep Dives; three missions wearing a trenchcoat that reward you with upgrade cores that you can use credits and minerals to craft and even further upgrade (usually) your weapons to do even more neat stuff.

Your Possible Doubts:
""Buuuuut Womp I don't have 1-3 friends to play this with and i hate queuing with randoms!!!""
In most games like this I would sympathize with your plight, but not here. You are never alone on the Space Rig, you have BOSCO. Thats right, instead of playing with random dwarves or even the other three classes propped up by braindead AI and half function navmeshes you get a little flying robot buddy who will accompany you on your solo endeavors. Not only can he mine or that you can't reach and provide you with some targeted light, but he can also revive you, shoot missiles at targets of your choosing, and carry heavy objective objects or mineral deposits. Your loyal companion will even dig them out of the wall if you tell him to.

""Buuuuut Womp I bet this game has a battlepass and exploits FOMO and has an in-game currency to leech money out of my wallet like every other game that has come out in the past decade!!!""

No in-game currency, no FOMO that i can be bothered with, and a free battlepass that goes with the seasonal event. If you want to support the devs beyond your initial purchase there are bundles of cosmetics that you can pay for.

""Buuuuuuut Womp that progression system sounds like it will bore me and I'll stop playing it!!!""

Yeah maybe, but Hoxxes ain't going anywhere, it hasn't over the years i have been playing and i don't foresee it going anywhere either. I have put the game down a few times before and won't lie and say that I won't in the future. That's the beauty of it, DRG is always there. The Space Rig is always waiting for you to come off your sabbatical and get back to work. As long as you enjoy the game, there is no shame in putting it down and coming back at a later date. 

In all seriousness, buy the game on sale or not. It is one of the most fun PvE horde shooters to play even solo where most games of this style falter massively like Payday or the Fatshark Warhammer games. Hopefully the spite fueled tirade about a game that should have won Labor of Love 2023 will convince you, the reader wanting a reason to buy the game, to do just that.

I strongly reccomend you buy it

Ofcourse you cant have an orchard without some rotten fruit, there are people who take the extra effort and do not learn from their toxic ways, dont worry, they have the entire rigs suply of Leaf Lovers Special to drink, and they deserve it. These pointy eared leaf lovers are rare, but not unencouterable, they are so early as the first mission, too blind to see the Assigment Board, calling the game boring becuase of their own hubiris. Feel free to order them a Leaf Lovers Special as a reminder of their failure to dwarf kind, ill owe you a Blackout for that :)

It is best experienced with friends, up to 3 others, or many more if you choose to dabble in mods, although it is not hard to find games with randoms, and everyone, in my experience, is super chill and friendly.
If you can't, or don't want to play with randoms, single player, while not as rewarding, is still very fun.
Even the lobby (known as the Space Rig) is fun to spend time in, with many things scattered around, such as the arcade games, the dance floor and bar, the no-gravity switch, and let's not forget all the barrels. You know you love to kick the barrels.

DRG features 4 main classes, each with a uniwue play style. They are extremely well balanced with respects to one another, and although it may not be as fun as a team of all Scouts, generally speaking most missions will work best with all classes represented in your team. The mechanics of the game are easy to master, and the ability to ramp up or down the difficulty of each mission ensures you'll never get bored. Weapon combustibility, as well as many extra 'overclocks' to boost certain stats of each weapon, mean there is a million different ways to play each class.

This game has  had a lot of love and care put into it by the devs to. It's obvious when looking at the Space Rig, as there are so many tiny details, easter eggs, and hidden interact-ables everywhere. Missions are no different, with tons of different types of enemies, biomes, events, mission types, available weapons and weapon mods, and the fact that every cave is unique, meaning you will never play the same mission twice.

Really the only reason I'd recommend against getting this game, is if you have a fear of spiders, or bugs, as most enemies resemble these, albeit very stylised.

If you're worried people might kick you (never happened to me, as long as you're not explicitly griefing people are rather accepting of mistakes), there is always an option to open your own lobby, type in a funny game server name and eventually someone will join you.

Oh, did I mention mod support? Yeah this game has mods raging from QoL, joke mods, model and sfx replacement, and even content mods.

I seriously cannot recommend this game enough, please give it a try. I recommend buying it on sale without any dlcs, as they are cosmetic only, Maybe buy them later, all but the 2 newest dlc go on sale for pretty cheap",1679775915,1704108204,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This is the kind of teamplay game that rewards drop in, drop out gameplay comfortably. With four distinct roles, there won't be overlap in what you can do compared to the others in the party unless you actively try to overstack - and even then, each dwarf has three unique primary and secondary weapons with their own playstyles, each of which can be further modified with unlockable and craftable Overlocks that are Clean, Balanced, or Unstable and either are flat buffs, trade offers, or entire playstyle changes respectively for that weapon. No two engineers will feel the same by luck alone, nor driller, scout, or gunner. 

That said, hosts have the ability to role lock and require one of each, further distancing players from one another and assuring that a full party has all four support equipment that each class would carry, and no dwarf is truly alone even in the depths of a solo excursion with BOSCO, a helpful drone that can perform nearly all tasks a dwarf can but can [i]fly[/i] to make up for it! BOSCO's revive reserves are limited unlike players', but the little fella can be upgraded like any equipment Management has sent down. While the drone can't supply barriers, ziplines, and the likes, it can fly to your waypoint and mine, light up the area on command, and fire missiles on cooldown at designated targets as well as supplement your own firepower with light machinegun fire and take the load off a mission that you can't or won't find help for.",1704033841,1704033841,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is just *fun*, the dwarves are interesting despite being fairly static, and it's not hyper-serious. The learning curve is not too steep and the player base is generally very friendly - if you see someone doing something weird, just join them in it. Someone spamming their ping tool on something? Keeping up the traditions!

Deep Rock doesn't lack in variety - weapons and builds for each of the 4 dwarves, with 3 primary weapons, 3 secondary weapons, 4 grenades, and plenty of customization options makes for a multitude of flexible loadouts you can bring to any of the 8 mission types in the 10 biomes (tilesets) available. There is a rotating maplist to play through each cave generation, plus Deep Dives to expand the challenge later on.

The game is non-exploitative in its DLC/microtransactions, providing a small set of cosmetics that cost a specific and defined amount of money, as compared to other companies playing games to obfuscate how much you're actually spending. It's a breath of fresh air in the heavy haze of today's gaming environment, and I sincerely appreciate it.

I know I can always come play DRG if I feel like it, and they don't pressure me to play every waking moment via excessive missions or exclusive ""get it now or it's gone"" battlepasses. The devs are expanding their franchise, so while updates have slowed, the game has still been receiving new enemies, weapons, or other content as time goes on. I look forward to returning to Deep Rock every time I've put it down. It's still my favorite game in the genre, and one of my go-to answers when people ask for my favorite games or recommendations.",1703951815,1703951815,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The world generation, different types of environments, different Dwarf classes and weapons and upgrades, objectives, and enemies all come together dynamically for repeatable fun.

Drop-in and out co-op works great! I rarely leave an incomplete mission, but when I do, I know the difficulty will scale and it won't be too long before someone else drops in to replace me. Along those same lines, if I open a public game, I know it will only be a few minutes until someone joins or I even have a full party.

I don't know how they do it, but I pretty much never experience griefers in Deep Rock.

While I find this game very enjoyable, especially when played with friends, I can't help but feel it's a missed opportunity to become the game of the century. 

It offers a decent amount of content that can keep you engaged for hours, but it falls short in terms of weapon variety and enemy diversity. The talent tree, identical for every class, is tediously monotonous, possibly the worst I've ever encountered. It quickly becomes repetitive and grindy without providing enough satisfaction.

Each upgrade simply means more damage, more ammo, or more of something without introducing interesting combos or special abilities. Resources are predominantly spent on superficial aesthetic features. Increasing mission difficulty only adds challenge without providing sufficient incentives to keep playing.

Even the classes feel artificial. They're essentially the same hero with different loadouts, having a hook instead of an excavator doesn't make a class. They lack unique abilities or distinguishing characteristics. Once the initial fun wanes, the game reveals its emptiness, repetitive nature.

This game could be an absolute masterpiece if it adopted a weapon system akin to Borderlands/Diablo, incorporated enemies with diverse abilities and random traits, and introduced more mission types and mechanics. As it stands, it's a solid game for $10/15, enjoyable for a laugh with friends, but not much beyond that. 

Considering the plethora of trash games out there with overwhelmingly positive scores, this one at least has some valid reasons to earn its rating. However, the reviews are still overinflated, for sure. So, expect a decent 7/7.5 out of 10 game, not a masterpiece",1703937902,1703937902,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

there are only 6 guns per class (3 primary 3 secondairy) and the way they have you grind for overclocks is just bad and rng and could take like 50 hours to get the one you want. there are also only like 2 major updates a year and the gimmicks each season brings last 2 seasons (season 3 aded rockpox and 4 expanded on it) however becouse this lasts a full year you can get very burnt out on it very quickly seeing the same events over and over

DRG is the first multiplayer game I've played in over 10 years. The game is well designed to encourage cooperation; it's amazing how much you can communicate just by using laser pointers! The mix of classes are fun to play; the customisation on offer really allows you to tailor your look and build to your own personal style. 

The community is great; new players are customarily greeted with a ""ROCK AND STONE!"" Veteran Greybeards will often drop into new players' missions to help out. It's typical for you and your fellow dwarves to all cheer at the end of a mission, you might even hit the bar afterwards to grab some virtual beers! 

The procedural generation and variety of missions keep the gameplay loop feeling fresh. You can scale the difficulty of missions to your ability; which is great when you're a fresh Greenbeard, new to the game, or when you're playing solo, or crank it up if you're looking for a real challenge. The assignments, levelling system and seasonal events keep you invested, it's not plagued with microtransactions and paid lootboxes; you can really feel the love the DRG devs have for their game.

With a nice 300.0 hours on DRG so far I can definitely say that this game is absolutely worth both your time and money.

One of the biggest surprises for me personally was that pretty much every bit of customization is available for free, that goes for guns skins, colors (both for the guns and for the armor) and different outfits for your dwarfs. You won't get everything for the start, of course there is grinding and rng involved, but you don't [b] need [/b] to buy battle passes or skin bundles at all.((unless you want to support the devs))
And I believe that it's genuinely cool and very admirable to not put useless premiums and battle passes, which only give you items if you pay, into your game. Exactly because of how easy it would be to add. 

Gameplay, guns and of course [b] The Dwarfs [/b] are all also absolutely brilliant, but this review is already long enough.
The Devs deserve all the love in the world for their hard work and dedication. 
Can't wait for the future of DRG and all the other projects related to it!

- four thoughtfully designed classes that work together really well and are written as very likable characters
- One of the best and friendliest communities in all of gaming
- Great support and communication from the devs with said community
- The most player-friendly monetisation system I've ever seen in an online multiplayer service game (30 bucks for the game, regularly on sale for about 10; free battlepasses for everyone every season; huge pool of cosmetics that can be unlocked by working for them instead of paying money; no fomo bs because every cosmetic that you miss in the battle pass enters this pool of unlockables and seasonal events always let you unlock every item that was in a past event; paid cosmetics don't really look better than stuff you can get for free, acting more as a way to support the devs)

I literally have nothing do critique about Deep Rock Galactic.
It's my favourite game to play with friends.

Deep Rock Galactic has been a necessary gaming staple for me for years now. Starting DRG in the days of early access and watching it grow from it's very solid but simple base game to what it is today has been one of the most satisfying early access experiences. The now diverse and complex collection of objectives, biomes, upgrades, and gameplay elements all started from a simple core game that was always good for those that like the basic premise of hoard fighting + Minecraft style cave exploration.

The ways the team has filled out the game since then has allowed me to still find reasons to keep playing even after promoting all 4 classes and unlocking every weapon. Endgame content will take at least as much time as the pre-end game stuff. Combined with Deep Dives (special missions that are persistent and the same for all players online and are updated live) really add challenge and fun reasons to get in at least 1-2 games a week with friends. Doing so awards players with ""Overclocks"" changing weapon styles and adding new abilities.  

Even after unlocking all Overclocks, there are tons of cosmetics to unlock, Seasonal events and cosmetics, as well as relatively regular new content in season updates a few times a year. DRG has never been bigger or better, I recommend it for anyone that wants to find a game that plays really well on mic with friends, or even a game to find new friends. DRG has one of the best online communities I've has the honor to be a part of.

How does this game have such a great community? There is a video on YouTube that already explains all of it, but in short: It's the way the game works. It discourages toxicity and encourages team work. You get nothing for fighting with your teammates, and complete the missions faster when you work as a team. But why would that be important? Well, the longer the mission lasts, the more enemies will come for you with every wave. 

If you're a new player and you join a game with OGs, they won't see you as a waste of space that could be used up by another, more skilled player, But instead, they are eager to help you out with the game. All you have to do is ask in chat.

Even randoms are surprisingly attentive, knowledgeable, and competent considering my prior experiences with other FPS games where randoms are practically a toss-up between toxic flamer, drunk troll, and *[mute]*. 

Short story - I once got downed on my way to the escape pod during a mission with 3 randoms (I was clueless and wandering). Despite all 3 of them already being at the escape pod well before me, and neither them nor me having anything to lose (I would still have gotten all rewards even if they left me to die), literally all 3 of them left to locate, revive, and escort me back. This was in spite of the massive horde of enemies that autospawn along the escape route once the escape pod is ready. There was no material benefit in it for them, but they did it anyway for a random noob. Why? Because Leave No Dwarf Behind. Plus, you don't treat a new player like that.

I have not encountered a single flamer yet, and I hear from veterans that even they are surprised to encounter the (very) rare toxic player after thousands of hours played, which is a testament to the quality of community this game fosters.

The dev team is no less worthy of praise - no microtransactions, no paywalled content, no keys + crates, no artificially lengthened grind just so they can sell you XP boosters and shortcuts. Everything is free, forever. Even the seasonal pass is free and if you didn't manage to unlock all the rewards this season, no problem! Get them next season for a paltry amount of in-game currency. The only things you pay real world $ for is the base game and a handful of optional cosmetic DLCs to show your support to the devs.

I heard tons of high praise for this game, and while it lived up to the hype for the first few hours, by mission 4 or 5 I couldn’t help but think: That’s it?

Don’t get me wrong. The gameplay is fun and addictive, and the sound design especially satisfying. But despite the variety of mission types and biomes, it all feels extremely samey. When I finally got the hang of perks and weapon upgrades, I realized that this is all I can look forward to. Thousands of tiny, barely noticeable upgrades. That, and the same lines of dwarf banter, over and over.

And somehow, despite being a coop shooter, I felt very little incentive to stick with the team. In my time with the game, people generally went wherever the heck they pleased, and as long as you have a decent grasp of the movement abilities, there was almost no punishment for doing the same. Compare that to L4D2, where separation from the group for longer than 60s or so gets you incapacitated, which forces that stick-together camaraderie that I look for in coop shooters.

Speaking of L4D2, somehow that game still holds my attention to this day, and it does it without currency, weapon upgrades, cosmetic upgrades, character leveling, promotions, or any of that stuff. It holds my attention because the gameplay is fun and tense all on its own.

Here’s the thing, though. This game nearly hooked me. I found myself itching to get that next upgrade, to get that next level, to finish one or two missions before bed. I stopped playing when I realized that urge came from the game’s uncanny ability to scratch that psychological itch for arbitrary progression, rather than simply because it was fun.

I honestly felt a little bad for the level 1000 dwarves, with their master chief armor and guns that fire blue lasers instead of red lasers. I was able to hang up my pickaxe and leave Deep Rock Galactic, but it’s probably way too late for them!",1703778243,1703778243,False,34,2,0.534850180149078369,0,True,False,False

We were able to get most of the missions done on either the first or second try depending on what luck we got with some random grabber, but overall it's a really rewarding game. The mechanics, art style, and sound of the game all compound with each other to make it a really enjoyable experience. 

The one gripe I have in any capacity is that the extra risk curve in terms of difficulty feels REALLY steep. We did one of the missions where you follow the drill on the +75% and failed 3 times in a row, barely making it past the first couple stages of the final drilling. After that we switched to the +50% difficulty and breezed through it with little to no sweat. It's probably just a skill issue and partially due to still having early-game equipment, but that seemed pretty extreme.",1703750324,1703750324,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My daughter got this game for Christmas in 2023 from her uncle, so we installed it on her computer and she started playing. By the end of the week she had 40 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my daughter, as she is always out with her friends or just watching overweight men eating large amounts of food and crying on YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside her. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my daughter for help and she hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my daughter since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my daughter closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my daughter many happy memories.",1703747717,1703747717,True,3,0,0.3735848069190979,0,True,False,False
