Great game but has a very big learning curve, like REALLY BIG.

Detailed review:

I love this game, if you like the vibe of it, you will absolutely love it. The problem, as I stated before, is that the learning curve is as exponential as a turbo charged car. When i first played the game, I didn't know much about car stuff, still managed to build the car with tutorials. The hardest part are what I would call ""getting started"" and ""building & tuning"" the car.
Every updates have just made the game harder and harder, so the first couple of hours in the game are very tough...
There are few possibilities on what to do at first, I go more on a ""speedrun"" aproach to it with the moped and few items, but it is probably easier with the tractor (takes more time tho).
That game made me fall in love with Finland aswell, it's the only game that can make me rage quit and still make me launch it again 5-10min after.

Tips:
- Go get the bonus money at the Uncle house (house behind yours)
- Install the driver seat in the car so you can get the uncle's van faster (be carefull to not break the windshield)
- Check if you can spot used pistons (they look more toasted than the others) and buy some new ones at the mechanic shop in Loppe, you better buy a new headgasket
- Your water pump, alternator and starter are gonna break probably soon, so it's something you need to look forward to change
- Same with the fuel pump and perhaps the clutch
- At the teimo shop, buy oil, new oil filter, spark plugs, a box of fuses (very usefull if your fridge fuse breaks), a fan belt, 3 bottles of break fluid, some food
- Put the food in the fridge (except chips)
- If you need to change fuses in the house, first turn off the main voltage or you can get shocked
- Don't answer the phone when it rings only 1 time during thunderstorm",1520455573,1708904720,True,3,1,0.565217375755310059,0,True,False,True

Käymisastia, johon kansi: (tässä tapauksessa 10L sankko, voidaan myös soveltaa, mutta raaka-ainemäärät huomioitava)
Hiivaa: 2 palaa leivontahiivaa, tai 25g kuivahiivaa. Myös ns. ""Super Hiivaa"" voidaan käyttää, jolloin noin 1/2 pussia hiivaa ja hiivaravinteita
Sokeria: n. 2kg, mieluiten glukoosia, tai taloussokeria


Seuraavat välineet eivät ole pakollisia, mutta ne helpottavat ja parantavat lopputulosta
Vesilukko: myydään suurissa vähittäistavarakaupoissa ja kotiviinin erikoisliikkeissä (hinta noin 1-2€)
Lappo: myydään yleiskaupoissa/rautakaupoissa, kuten K-Rauta, Tarjoustalo, Halpahalli

Valmistaminen: 

Päivä 1.
1. Ota 10L vetoinen käymisastia, laske sinne hanasta 8L kädenlämpöistä,- eli n. 38°C vettä
2. Lisää veden sekaan sokeri sekoittaen
3. Odota, että vesi on noin 30-34 asteista (palahiiva kuolee 36 asteessa, kuivahiiva kestää 42 astetta, mutta 45 sekin kuolee varmasti)
4. Lisää astiaan hiivat, sekoita
5. Tee astian kanteen yksi reikä, halkaisijaltaan noin 1,5cm (Jos tätä kohtaa ei tehdä, käymisastian sisällä muodostuu noin 80L hiilidioksidia ja muita kaasuja ja astia räjähtää paineen seurauksena) älä tee liian suurta reikää; käyminen on an-aerobinen prosessi, joten liika hapen määrä astian sisällä aiheuttaa etikoitumisen ja kiljun pilaantumisen.
Jos sinulla on vesilukko, kiinnitä se tähän reikään, tiivistä vesilukon ja kannen reijän välinen alue kuuma,- tai pikaliimalla. Kaada vesilukko noin puolilleen vettä.

Nyt odotellaan 7-12 päivää (jos käytit Super Hiivaa, niin 3-7 päivää)
Tällä ajalla voi vaikka kerätä kavereistaan porukan nauttimaan kiljua, sitä päivää varten, kun se valmistuu :).

Päivä 7-12 (tai 3-7).
1. Tähän vaiheeseen päästään, kun vesilukosta ei enään pulputa, kuin pari satunnaista kuplaa minuutissa, tai kannen avattuasi neste on kirkasta ja ei vaahtoa
2. Ota suuri lusikka/kauha, sekä pulloja tai laseja joihin haluat annostella valmiin kiljun
3. Ota lusikalla/kauhalla hyvin varovasti kiljua aluksi pinnasta, sitten keskiväliltä, mutta kun nestettä on enään noin 3cm pohjan korkeudesta, niin et ennään koske siihen, koska se on hiivasakkaa, joka pilaa kiljun maun.
Jos sinulla on lappo:nosta astia varovasti korkeammalle, kuin pullo/lasi mihin aijot kiljun siirtää. Pistä lapon pää astiassa olevan kiljun pinnalle, ota pullo/lasi valmiiksi viereesi, imaise voimakkaasti lapon päästä. Kun teet näin, kiljun pitäisi imeytyä lappoon ja sitten sitten siirrät nopeasti lapon pään pulloon/lasiin. Kiljua alkaa siirtyä nopeasti lapon välillä . Varo ettei käymisastiassa oleva pää missään vaiheessa mene liian lähelle (noin 3cm) lähelle pohjaa, koska muuten sakka sekoittuu kiljun ja joudut odottamaan sen tasaantumista tuskallisen hitaat 5-7 tuntia :S.


Tällä ohjeella saat itsellesi n. 8L kiljua. Tämän kiljun kirkkaus on parhaimmillaan luokkaa 5/10 (kelvollinen)

Kuoritaikina:
1½ dl vettä
1 rkl öljyä
3/4 tl suolaa
3 dl ruisjauhoja
1 dl vehnäjauhoja

Täytevaihtoehto 1:
2 ½ dl vettä
2 dl riisiä
7 ½ dl maitoa
1/2 tl suolaa
1 kananmuna

Täytevaihtoehto 2:
8 dl vettä
2 dl riisiä
2 dl (laktoositonta) ruokakermaa 10% tai 15%
1 kananmuna

Täytevaihtoehto 3:

2 dl vettä
2 dl esikypsytettyjä, kokonaisia ohrasuurimoita
1,5 l maitoa
1 tl suolaa
1 kananmuna

Voiteluun: voita sulatettuna ja vettä

Valmista ensin täyte:

Täytevaihtoehto 1 ja 3 valmistaminen:
2. Sekoita kiehuvaan veteen riisi tai ohra ja keitä 10 minuuttia.
3. Lisää maito ja anna puuron kiehua hiljalleen 30 minuuttia välillä pohjaa pitkin sekoittaen. Jätä täyte hautumaan kannen alle 10 minuutiksi.
4. Mausta valmis puuro suolalla ja jäähdytä se.
5. Sekoita jäähtyneeseen puuroon muna.

Täytevaihtoehto 2 valmistaminen:
2. Sekoita kiehuvaan veteen riisi ja keitä noin 30 minuuttia. Sekoita välillä.
3. Lisää joukkoon (laktoositon) ruokakerma ja suola. Anna puuron hautua noin 10 minuuttia.
4. Kaada puuro laakeaan astiaan ja kaada tilkka kylmää vettä päälle, jotta puuron pinnalle ei muodostu kuorta.
5. Sekoita jäähtyneeseen puuroon kananmuna.

Piirakoiden valmistaminen:
1.  Sekoita  kylmään veteen, öljy,  suola ja jauhot puuhaarukalla. Vaivaa taikina sileäksi ja kiinteäksi.
2.  Ripottele pöydälle ruis- ja vehnäjauhoseosta ja kaada taikina jauhojen päälle. Kaulitse taikinasta noin 1/2 cm:n paksuinen levy.
3.  Painele levystä juomalasilla kakkaroita.
4.  Aseta kakkarat kuuden kappaleen pinoihin, etteivät ne kuivu. Peitä pinot muovipussilla tai kulholla.
5.  Kaulitse kakkarat piirakkapulikalla ohuiksi pyöreiksi tai soikeiksi kuoriksi. Lado kuoret päällekkäin ja ripottele ruisjauhoja väliin. Peitä kuoripinot muovipussilla. Täytä kuoret mahdollisimman pian, jotta ne eivät tartu kiinni toisiinsa.
6.  Ota kuoret leivinpöydälle, levitä lusikallinen täytettä kuoren keskelle (1 cm paksuinen kerros täytettä) ja jätä kuoren reunoilta noin 1 cm tyhjää tilaa.
7.  Käännä vastakkaiset reunat täytteen päälle ja rypytä piirakat etusormilla.
8.  Siirrä piirakat uunipellille leivinpaperin päälle.
9. Paista piirakoita 275-300°C lämmössä noin 15 minuuttia.
10. Voitele piirakat  sulatetulla voilla, johon on sekoitettu tilkka vettä.
11. Lado kuumat piirakat kulhoon päällekkäin ja peitä leivinpaperilla ja liinalla. Tarjoile perinteisen tai munattoman munavoin kanssa.

Perinteinen munavoi

4 munaa
2 dl raejuustoa
100 g voita tai margariinia
(4 rkl persiljasilppua)

Laita munat kattilaan kiehuvaan veteen yksitellen ruokalusikkaa apuna käyttäen ja keitä 8 minuuttia.
Nosta keitetyt munat joksikin aikaan kylmään veteen, jolloin kuori irtoaa helpommin.
Kun kananmunat ovat jäähtyneet, kuori ne.
Laita kananmunat isolle lautaselle ja hienonna ne haarukalla tai käytä munaleikkuria.
Sekoita joukkoon raejuusto ja huoneenlämpöinen, pehmeä rasva.
Jos haluat, voit lisätä päälle hienonnettua persiljaa.
Munaton munavoi

 Who rebuilds a whole car engine with out a auto manual in their garage no one and this is just poor game design.  We do not want everything given to use but we mostly don't want to go to steam for a guide to how to rebuild your automobile.  ""THE GARAGE SHOULD HAVE A MANUAL GUIDE TO EACH CAR YOU GET TO GUIDE YOU HOW TO DO IT.  ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOT"" having to write down things that are so extensive to do in a game from steam just to play the dam game you made.  
Thank you for not reading my review because if you did you would of responded to it.

Everything will kill you.
You cannot shave time off of anything.
You have to drive a moped ten minutes to town to buy one thing and drive it back for ten more minutes.
If you die you take the bus for fifteen minutes back to an intersection kind of close to where you died and walk.
Walking is crawling.
You can only hold one thing at a time.
You can drop items through the map.
You can die by crouching near parked cars.
You have a very limited time frame to do everything.
Pressing the wrong button at the wrong time like ""f"" instead of ""g"" is completely devastating.
Everything drives like hot trash.
You will do very mundane things tens of times before you are even close to ""driving your car"".
Drive to town for gas, batteries, food, fuses, beer, more batteries, more gas, an alternator belt, more beer.
Drive them back one at a time.
Getting to the car solves it all because you now have a trunk. Then there is nothing really left to do and the car drives like such hot ass, basically it's a ton of work and upkeep before you can drive around this ugly landscape in a nicer car.
This game is built specifically to annoy you.

The leaning system is horrifically disorienting, all the nut/bolt heads have NO SENSE of consistency across the game. One bolt will LOOK massive, like a size 15, and another will look tiny, like a size 7, and then they're both size 11 for whatever reason. Leads to a ton of unnecessary trips to and from the toolkit and it gets extremely old extremely fast. Also why the f**k is scroll wheel the only option to fasten a bolt/nut? Also the audio? Loud sounds like the engine absolute buttf**k your ears and make it impossible to hear important, but quieter sounds in the car.

Another part of this game that annoys me is how difficult it is to just place shit on the car. You are left essentially trying to line up pixels so you can get the little check-mark just to accidentally bump the car and have the dogs**t physics send you skyward.

The raw idea of the game is fantastic, a life simulator where you gotta build a project car and modify it as you please, but this game is so buggy,  its been years its on early-access, plus nearly everything seems to be specifically made to screw you over. No fun is allowed, you will waste a >LOT< of time in this game, you will be forced to reset saves, you will die because a bee crashed on you while you were driving, people will touch your car while you're parked, die, and you will go to jail for that (jail time if often ridiculous like 10 irl hours, yes, 10 irl hours.), every trip to the city will take a ridiculously long time because the only convenience store HAD to be on the other side of the map, the driving physics are very meh and if you decide to walk anywhere at all, good luck, everything is extremely far apart, the map is pretty much empty and your character dies of thirst comically fast when walking unless you bring a whole pack of beers with you

Driving with a keyboard sucks, obviously, but it feels like the game was not made for a steering wheel either. Setting one up is pain, the customization and tweaking is extremely limited and buggy, it seems like the only way to get a wheel working decently is via mods.

I wanna play this game because its premise is fantastic, but everytime I do its mostly just frustrating simply because the devs decided to design the game to be frustrating, to be full of RNG and deliberate design choices that makes your life hell.

Prepare to dive headfirst into the Finnish countryside of the 1990s, armed with little more than a rusty car and a basic set of tools. The game's unique selling point lies in its detailed and realistic car building and maintenance simulation. Every bolt, screw, and component matters as you meticulously piece together your vehicle from scratch. It's a refreshing departure from the hand-holding prevalent in many games today.

The open-world environment adds an extra layer to the experience. Beyond the garage, you can explore the charming countryside, engage in odd jobs, and interact with eccentric NPCs. However, be ready for the survival aspect, as hunger, thirst, and the possibility of deadly car accidents add an intriguing challenge to the mix.

While the graphics might not appeal to everyone with their intentionally dated, low-polygon style, they contribute to the game's nostalgic atmosphere. The visuals, coupled with the quirky Finnish humor, create a unique ambiance that sets ""My Summer Car"" apart.

Buckle up for a steep learning curve; this game doesn't hold your hand. Understanding the intricacies of each car part and the overall mechanics takes time and patience. Yet, for those willing to invest in the learning process, the sense of accomplishment when your hand-built car roars to life is immensely satisfying.

""My Summer Car"" might not cater to everyone's taste, but for those seeking an unconventional, challenging, and immersive experience, it's a must-try. It's a testament to indie game development, offering something truly distinct in the vast landscape of Steam titles. So, if you're up for a one-of-a-kind journey into car-building realism with a touch of Finnish eccentricity, ""My Summer Car"" is well worth adding to your Steam library.",1638023610,1707757337,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I have been playing this game for years now - I didn't buy it on Steam first, but now that I have the money I decided to buy it, and I'll put more hours into this game than I originally had.
This game is hard - sometimes irritating, spontaneously filled with mistakes, but despite all of this it really stuck with me. Even though I had difficulties building the car at first, and after dying multiple times due to the game's stupidity, I still enjoy this game (sometimes). It has a very nice mood - building your car in the finnish countryside, the life survival aspect of the game really puts you in the role of a finnish car obsessed teenager in the mid '90s. Really reminds me of my home country, even though the fact that I wasn't alive during that time!

I was initially warned that the game has horror elements, so upon launching the game I proceeded with caution. 90's Finnish family house threateningly welcomed me, with it's purposefully unpolished graphics. Then I took a look around and noticed the Satsuma itself, in front of the garage. In the garage I've realized what could be the horror of this game - hundreds of little parts that I had to assemble to make the car run, with my zero knowledge of the car and engine anatomy, apart from lights, doors, hood, wheels and windshield.

 It quickly turned out that the game was pretty unforgiving. First of all, you have needs that you have to take care of: thirst, hunger, stress, fatigue, URINE (you click P to relieve yourself, how cool is that?) and so on and so on. If full, few of those will get you killed. Your character on top of that is slow as fuck, like he never ran more than 100 meters at the time, so even though he has unlimited stamina, you will need some kind of vehicle. Fortunately, before you assemble Satsuma you have few options to choose from: the boat, which of course you can only use to get around on the lake, Kekmet tractor that is fuel inefficient and is pretty slow and finally, Jonez scooter, which I chose for my temporary mode of transportation. On my way to the shop I was jumpscared by the dirtroads' green menace, almost killed on the highway by ignorant drivers, but finally arrived just fine. After the visit in the shop to buy sasuages and frozen pizza, the little money I had at the start of the game quickly depleted, putting me in the position of looking for the job. 
 
 See, this game is not only about driving vehicles, it's more of a Finnish countryside in the 90's simulator, so with that you can pick strawberries, deliver firewood or empty sewage. There are also few other jobs that you should discover yourself, I'll just recommend you to go pick strawberries first for good lubrication into how this game makes you earn money and generally how it rewards you for doing something (note, it's a mental battle).

 As you may have already noticed, I have 200 hours into this game and I truly love it. The point of this game is to make you suffer, but you want to suffer with it. You will get through the painful process of picking strawberries, you will get used to Pena jumpscares, you will finally build and run the satsuma (I've only managed to do this after 50 FRICKING HOURSE OF PLAYING!) and then you will even attempt to participate in the rally or even finish the game's plot (yes, there is one)

 You will have fun and you will cry.

Ok bad jokes aside yes I like the game a lot despite the very frustrating glitches you sometimes get. Many very funny moments like having a drunk driver chaise me and the moment I look back he gets flung across the map by the train. Another time I saw my uncle who passed out in the bar and i wanted to help him get home so I dragged him into the back of the van and drove him all the way home and pulled him onto my couch to sober up. The next day he was still passed out and on the floor. Atleast I tried lol.

Its taken a while but i've changed my opinion. Also, You save the game by going to the toilet. Just an FYI.
I'm addicted.
The game is jank, unforgiving and doesn't hold your hand at all but manages to be charming as hell. If you are like me and have no knowledge of how to build cars can be an extremely frustrating time, yet enjoyable.
After all this time, I've only just managed to get the engine together and in the car. Then I went to bed with a lit cig and burnt my house down. Which I will agree is entirely my fault and certainly made for a ""WTF!"" moment. 
All in all. Its a quirky, irritating fun time. 
Maybe one day i'll have the satsuma up and running and not burn the house down or die by urinating on electrical equipment.
Give it a go.

The concept is great, build a car, make money on the side, and do whatever the hell you want to do! But- there are so many bugs that get in the way of such a great game, it pains me to give a negative review. I've had a lot of fun, and put a lot of hours into this game. But the bugs are just too much. I enjoy the occasional non-game breaking bug. I think they can be hilarious. Like glitching into your car, and being launched 50 feet into the air, or, well that's really the only bug in the game that isn't infuriating. Here is a list of some of the painful bugs I've run into:

Moped disappeared, what can you do about it? Shit if I know.

Paying for Fleetari (The Mechanic) to do work on your car, get home, answer the phone ""Fleetari here, your car is done."" Drive back, no work has been done. Wait two or three ingame days. No work has been done.

Getting ran over by the yellow Assho-I mean racer. Not really a big deal. Load the game back up (after saving when I died) And I load back on a previous save.

Parts dissapearing. Hooked up my exhaust last minute before sending it off to the shop, get back, Fleetari has punished me for stealing his car, by dumping my car in the swamp, aaaand snatching my exhast pipe.

Sewage truck stuck? Oh well. Your bitch arms can't push it, Quit without saving.

Ordered a package, paid for it, turned around to pick it up. No package. 

These things really suck. But would I pay for the game again, and play it all over? Yep. It really has a certain charm about it. It has a lot of fun aspects to it. Like giving the finger to that God Da-I mean yellow racer. Pumping and pouring sewage wherever you please. And tuning the car to your specific specifications. 

It really pains me to give this a negative review, especially it being an early access game. Because it's an early access game. But I'd suggest holding off for a little bit until some of these bugs are sorted out. 

Right now, I'd give it a 6/10. If you can look past the game breaking bugs, Which is difficult, I'd give it a hefty 8.5/10, because it still is a blast to play. And once these bugs are sorted out, I will happily give this game a positive review, because I can tell the game has taken work, and it is a really great game, deep down.

EDIT: I get it now. It all makes sense. I'm at peace with My Summer Car",1492753068,1706779535,True,0,0,0.555026829242706299,6,True,False,True

Developed by Amistech Games, this title offers a blend of simulation, survival, and open-world exploration. Released in 2016, it has garnered a dedicated fanbase due to its realism and unapologetically challenging gameplay.

At first glance, My Summer Car may seem like a simple car-building simulator, but it quickly becomes apparent that the game is much more than that. The experience begins with the player inheriting a decrepit Satsuma, a fictional Finnish car, and the task of bringing it to life. From assembling the engine to adjusting the suspension, every detail of the car demands attention, making it a gearhead's dream.

The game's setting, a rural Finnish village in the 1990s, contributes to its distinct charm. The open-world environment is vast and filled with quirky characters, each with their own peculiarities. While the graphics may not be cutting-edge, the attention to detail in the surroundings and the realistic day-night cycle create an immersive atmosphere.

Survival elements add an unexpected layer of complexity. The player needs to eat, drink, and sleep to stay alive. Balancing these basic needs while fixing the car can be challenging, creating a sense of urgency and forcing players to strategize their time effectively.

One of the standout features of My Summer Car is its learning curve. With minimal in-game tutorials, players must figure out the mechanics, tools, and car parts on their own. While this can be frustrating for newcomers, it rewards perseverance and patience. However, the lack of guidance may be a turn-off for players seeking a more casual gaming experience.

The game's humor is another notable aspect. The eccentric characters and unpredictable events inject a healthy dose of comedy into the gameplay. From navigating the perils of Finnish bureaucracy to unexpected encounters with drunk NPCs, the absurdity adds a layer of unpredictability that keeps the experience fresh.

However, My Summer Car is not without its flaws. Bugs and glitches are prevalent, and the game can be unforgiving, leading to moments of frustration. Some players may find the lack of clear objectives and structure to be a drawback, as the game relies heavily on player-initiated goals.

In conclusion, My Summer Car is a unique and challenging experience that caters to a specific audience. It's a love letter to automotive enthusiasts and those seeking an unconventional open-world adventure. The game's realism, combined with its eccentric charm, creates a memorable and unpredictable journey. However, its steep learning curve and technical issues may deter more casual gamers. If you're willing to embrace chaos, endure setbacks, and revel in the absurd, My Summer Car offers a truly one-of-a-kind gaming experience.",1706523331,1706523331,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Multiple ways to be softlocked. How do you fix things? Start over or install mods which is super lame. 

I love tedious games I have several of those types of games in my inventory. I spent most of time putting together the car and didn't have too much of a problem but a couple things happened. Followed several guides exactly, car doesn't start. So I learned that the starter and the battery I started with were broken with no fix.

Can't buy a new one because the uncle literally never spawned even after checking about every in game hour. I got him to spawn once when I started the game... So unable to buy new parts. Couldn't earn money to live because you're dependent on one game mechanic that is basically a soft-lock. Can't recommend it. There's a lot of joke reviews with people with less than a few hours and I think a lot of people truly play it for the meme vs actually playing it to enjoy the core mechanics.

As a suggestion just to make sure you get a refund back. Really pour into the core mechanic of putting together the car in a couple of hours and truly look into the experience.

I understand this is still in early access, but nevertheless at this moment I cannot recommend this.

The game is far too janky. And I'm not talking only about the physics - everything about it, the mechanics, the way things handle, the gameplay, seem to be improvised and held together by duct tape.

Nothing is intuitive. There is no information provided on anything - no tutorial, not even a single tip on screen to explain how anything works. One of the first things I did was having to comb through the 3 separate pages of keyboard control binds in order to figure out how to even play (which is not a good sign for [i]any[/i] game that isn't a hardcore flight simulator), and after 30 minutes of trying to figure out how to install car parts in the vehicle you start with, I had to consult google to find out the very basics of the game. Yeah, it's one of those games which are unplayable (at least at first) without online guides and/or wiki.

Nothing is explained. Small example - in order to assemble car parts, you need to use tools. How, you may ask? Well, assuming you know which one to use to begin with, you need to find a tool case in the garage. Then know that you need to open the tool case (not with the left click but with the ""F"" key), then press 2 to go into ""tool mode"", and finally click on the screwdriver to take it out. There is no information about it in the game and you need to look it up online.

Interactable items are often very picky about how you aim at them, sometimes requiring a very specific angle and distance in order for the cursor to recognize them as something that can be picked up or used.

Another example of clunkiness is driving vehicles. There is a moped outside the house, so I've tried to drive it - another task that needs consulting an online tutorial. You would think that you just click it to sit on it and start driving... but nope. You need to first carefully position yourself over the bike - during which your character sometimes jitters chaotically because of janky physics (occasionally this may topple the bike over), and only then press return key to ""Enter Driving Mode"". Oh, and you also need to know that in order to start it, you need to open the fuel tap located low on the left side, and only then click repeatedly on the jumpstart crank. Of course, none of this is explained in game.

In short, very promising concept, got my hopes up because the idea of satiric role playing as a finnish beer-chugging, cigarette smoking teen assembling and driving an unlicensed car hobbled together in a garage seems very entertaining, but the execution is poor, too crude, too unfinished, and very much not accessible to a new player.",1705632808,1705632808,False,2,2,0.421806275844573975,0,True,False,True

The game is a lot of fun once you get the hang of the janky physics and controls and it can also be notoriously difficult and frustrating to learn if you don't know what to do starting out.  Thankfully, there are good guides to tell you everything you need to know.  The Steam discussion board is still going pretty strong even now and there's some good guides in the MSC Steam Community and the game wiki that can also help a lot here:

https://my-summer-car.fandom.com/wiki/My_Summer_Car_Wiki

You start out in your house and you need to build an old car (the game's main objective if there is one) starting with some basic tools, a chassis and a hundred different parts laying around your garage (some you need to buy from the store) but you also need to learn to survive hunger, thirst, etc.  All the places you need to go in game are scattered all over a large area requiring lots of driving to get there and there is no map to show where you are.  There is one hanging on the wall in your house you can study you can't take it with you so you need to learn to navigate the roads and figure out where you're going by memorizing the terrain & buildings visually.  You can't tell time except by trying to determine the position of the sun (there is a way to get a watch eventually though).  You need to know the time because stores and events are time dependent.  In the country, stores and businesses close very early.

There are jobs you can do to make money like pumping sewage with a poop truck for people and there are events like rallys you can participate in.  There is no saving except in your toilet or if you find an outhouse.  You can even go to jail for various reasons which is extremely boring, there's no way to skip time in jail so you just have to sit there and wait (like in real life!).  The game is basically like living the life of a poor country boy in a very sparsely populated area, building an old car and go driving it around doing stupid things.  I grew up in such a town in th US and the similarities is amazing.  The developer hit the mood just right.  The Finnish are not so different from us in the US.

I'm glad I bought this game finally and I can easily recommend it.",1690927013,1705373946,True,2,0,0.537572264671325684,0,True,False,True

The game itself feels like it was created by a 14 year old.  Needlessly crude humor, borderline imbecilic gameplay and functionality, and a community that genuinely feels like they live at the compound in Waco, TX.  There is a nugget of a potentially good game hidden somewhere deep within this disaster but it's not worth wading through the garbage to find it.

I do NOT recommend this game.  In fact I'd like to make a plea to steam to remove it because it is JUST. THAT. BAD.  If you bought it and it's still in the refund period, do yourself a favor!

Now, minus the fact that this game basically is not about cars, and you will spend 80% time playing a life simulator (and a very shitty, poorly made one at that), even with mods that take away ALL of the survival aspect, it is not fun. Why?

This is one of the worst programmed games I have ever played. I understand it is an indie developer, but there are bugs that make this game unplayable (such as the engine hoist glitching out to the point where it flings your engine off of it)

This game has no redeeming qualities. It is not visually appealing, gameplay is shitty without mods, gameplay is shitty with mods, the cars don't look good, handle good, or do just about anything good.

The only saving grace this game has is how in-depth the parts are and car building is, but the execution of that is sloppy to say the least as well.",1633400857,1704749356,False,0,0,0.439297139644622803,0,True,False,True

At times VERY frustrating or difficult, but this adds to the charm of it all. There's something special about this one that I can't really describe. Highly recommended.

POSITIVES:
- Rebuild the car. As in all of it. The sheer scope of the car rebuilding is mind boggling. You have to torque stuff properly. You need to manually do a wheel alignment. You have to adjust your air/fuel ratio. Forget a piece in the engine, and well, maybe it will run for a bit. And then suddenly explode. Incredibly in-depth and surprisingly realistic/accurate as well!
- Get drunk, punch the car and swear at it. Don't bathe for a week. Use your parent's bedroom as the designated pissing room. Brew moonshine, then sell it while driving blind in your tractor with Viper playing on your boombox. There is so much goofy crap to do in this game and you will be discovering new activities and oddities for hours.
- Charming art style. Let me be honest: this game looks like ass. But a what a wonderful piece of ass it is. Character models look iconic. Satisfyingly janky animations. Lots of jaggy polygons and wonky textures. But it genuinely works so well with the game's humour.
- Huge modding community filled with tons of quality tweaks, new vehicles, weird things and enhancements. I highly recommend the body pillow mod and the one that adds Maxwell the cat.
NEGATIVES:
- This game is really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ HARD. I found Elden Ring an easier game than this. Unless you want to make tons of run breaking mistakes or literally sitting in prison for maybe real life days at a time, you'll probably be following a guide or two. Personally I dont think there's much shame in checking the wiki occasionally. This game is very unforgiving when it comes to mistakes. It will PUNISH you. It will make you regret what you did. Whether or not this is a negative is up to you, but be warned!
- There's bugs sometimes. Game does weird ♥♥♥♥ or crashes, not that often though. Really I can't think of many negatives for this game. It's really really good and worth its full price.",1702356120,1704724061,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Has amazing atmosphere that I think mainly scandinavians, eastern europeans and people living in small towns in their late 20s+ would appreciate. It creates scenarios that just feel strangely nostalgic.

Overall the gameplay sometimes feels like an Ikea furniture, it's shit garbage but you are building something yourself so it feels good and so then it becomes good. The driving however feels great, it's some stuff around it that's janky shit. At times it makes me want to gouge my eyes out but it just feels so satisfying and rewarding to play I just want to continue.

This game doesnt hold your hand,rather than that,it pushes you, like you are running,or in this case,driving for your life.
In a way or another,thats what you do.
Before building the car, you need to go to the shop,buy stuff that is necessary for you and the car.
You have to check either you got or not the bills.
If yes, pay them, cause if you dont, the electricity stops, and the food rots, and you starve, and you die.
This game is beautiful in its complicated way.

As of my 45 hours in this game, i found myself dying 2 times, first by thinking i can push the boat towards the city (in the lake) and drowning, and second time rolling with the van.

Its funny at first, i personally got very happy thinking about the adventures this game will bring me.
Reality is i didnt even get to drive the car, only a little bit toward the garbage dumping place and that was when i built the car with MSCEditor.

After the 1st death,it was like the fun went away.
I knew i had to spend another day to build a car,this time i also needed a whole in-game day to get the wheels.

The last time i manually built the car was exactly after the 2nd death, i speedran the whole built, and finished it in some hours.
I even painted the car black, as i knew i would like it.
I started the car, waited, and then the engine came off.
I tried another time, on another save, the same exact outcome.

I was frustrated, to say the least, hating the game from the depths of my heart (even if it wasnt its fault, but rather mine).

And then,once again, i decided i wanted to build it again.

And maybe this is the beauty of My Summer Car? The stress, frustration, anger and i dont know what else will pay the player with the satsuma, a reward, almost as if saying ""You didnt give up? Here's something to make you give up.""


However, the game itself is...well...kind of too rough, either you play with permadeath or not, you still lose, the moment you die, the game saves, no matter what.
Its up to you either you want to start over again,or maybe spend some more hours searching for a fucking piece from the car.

But i suppose thats how you play the game, from the start to finish, an unforgiving road of obstacles that might, or might not, reward you with beautiful memories and fun.


This game is not for everybody.


If there was a way to describe this game, i think it would be that you are not the only idiot in town.

Unfortunately, as of today, in my opinion, the game has become overly complicated and off-putting for both new and returning players. In my view, the 2016/2017 versions of the game were the best and, interestingly, more vibrant.

The game wasn't artificially made more difficult by hiding crucial parts needed for the car in those earlier versions. However, newer releases have somehow disrupted the NPC system, causing many NPCs to appear very rarely or not at all compared to the 2016/2017 versions.

In summary, My Summer Car is a great game that, in my opinion, has been ruined by unnecessary complications and a lack of valuable updates. For those interested, I recommend playing the older versions, which can be downloaded through the console built into the Steam client (after purchasing the game).",1704383366,1704383366,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True

The style of gameplay, the mechanics and the difficulty can not be """"enjoyed"""" by your typcial gamer. But in my opinion that is one of the most integral parts of the game. Because the game isnt made for everyone its has a rather not too big not too small comunity. The community of this game is like a small cult-following of some sort. The modding and the YouTube community around it always produces new content to be consumed and enjoyed. The modding community is can be rather menacing to say the least. Also because the community is always open to new players you can find a tutorial for almost everything in the game. It might be for mods, or vanilla stuff. 

As I said, the game is not for everyone. You should get this game if you have basic knowlegde on how engines and car systems work. Also you should be always ready for the worst case scenario. You should always have a plan B. It might be too hard on a average person for the first time. So if you want to buy and play this game, dont expect it to be easy. You should learn to have fun from suffering. 

If you coulndt keep up with the game, or if its not for your taste, PLEASE dont write bad reviews full like ""tOO hArd 0/10 dOnt bUy iT iTs a wAsTe of mOney"" because you might actually scare of people who might enjoy the game. When you play the game and write a review remember that MSC is not for everyone. And if its not for you it doesnt mean its a bad game.

Not because it gives you almost no help or because you have to pixel hunt screws into their threads but because it will take everything from you. The idea is that it takes a long time to do things and that's why you need a car to speed things up, but the game will crash or glitch or not tell you you need to save and ruin all the progress you made on its long, long days. It's very cool. If you have a mechanical mind or interest in doing small things like pulling the string on a motor to start it it's great. And honestly really charming despite some pretty dated humor. I've tried rebuilding my car three times after losing it to bugs and I'm done.

But some things are a broken or hard to do or understand in the beginning. For example, it's very hard to hit the water on the burner in the sauna. It took me an hour of frustration until I realized that if you sit on the bench in front of the burner it's much easier to hit it. The motorbike is also very hard and unpredictable to drive. Overall it needs a lot of work, but when it's released it will be on my top 10 games list for sure.

Edit: After playing it for a while, I still agree on how fun it is, but the game has the worst driving physics and Force Feedback of any game I have ever played. And I have played many games with driving. The game is still in early access and I really really hope that they fix that, but seeing as the game is 8 years old but still is very broken, has very bad force feedback and driving physics and pretty bad graphics, I'm not even sure if it's still in developement

After 59 hours of playing the game I tuned out my Satsuma and for the last 4 days I've been trying to do rally racing.

Now with my hand broken I am off to the hospital and it'll be a funny story to tell my doctor. I still hate this game yet wanna keep playing it.

You play this game until you die then never touch it again. Until you want to give it another try after months then repeat.
Game physics are buggy. You go flying into space all the time. Items go flying / missing too which are lost forever. 

The game needs a lot quality of life features.

The default setting should be permadeath off.
Need a system to buy or recover important lost items. Like when your car is unrecoverable or fish trap is at the bottom of the lake. 
Way Too dark. Good luck when you wake up in the middle of the night because of the phone. 
Pausing the game, I understand it is a mechanic that you can't save everywhere but just give me a breather when I need to quickly step away from the game.

I understand what makes this game hard makes it ""fun"". 
Just when something catastrophic happens makes the game un-recoverable. 
Go into the game folder and copy it to manual save the game. If you die you can at least you can restart from your last manually saved folder save.
It is open in the community that the only way to play this game is with mods. I know most of my complaints are fixed with mod.
I wish it was just included in the base game.

My Summer Car is an utterly amazing game. Survive in 1995 Finland, earning money through odd jobs, spend it on alcohol, food and, obviously, car parts. Restore your father's 70s compact car, take it to rally or to race, or just about run your everyday errands in it.

The graphics look a bit PS2-ish and old at first glance, but playing the game that is quickly forgotten, as even visually it makes up for that with a good attention to detail, as well as the way it kind of fits the faux-retro vibe and 90s theme.
The gameplay is quite open and free, but the same attention to detail is what makes it stand out among 'open world survival' games. The titular car is modelled well, of course, and within hours you will know all the parts, bolts and bits of its engine as you assemble, repair and diagnose it. Everyone who knows their way around an engine is a bit at the advantage here, but frankly, those who don't could learn a thing or two here.

The 'proper' way to play My Summer Car of course is with permadeath, where you start entirely over when you die. I am convinced this game has done more for seatbelt awareness than decades of PSAs ever could.",1703329393,1703329393,True,68,2,0.851723015308380127,0,True,False,True

If you like cars, or mechanics in general then I think this game is worth the price.

The game doesnt go on sale so there is no bother waiting for it to go on sale you might aswell just buy it as the pricetag goes, for the game it isnt as expensive as some other mechanic games out there.

This game really does mix storyline, mechanics and survival all in one due to the stats that you have to keep track of, the mechanics of building the car, and even up to the end of the story. (which I wont spoil.)

This game is quite difficult to learn but over time you will remember off muscle memory and remember how to build the car and what to do et cetera.

This game is probably a 8.5/10 it can sometimes get repetitive but then you can just switch games.

Pros:

Realistic Simulation: My Summer Car excels in its realistic simulation of daily life in rural Finland. From chopping wood to purchasing groceries, the game captures the essence of the mundane yet essential tasks that make up everyday living.

Cons:

Steep Learning Curve: The game has a steep learning curve, especially for players unfamiliar with automotive mechanics. The detailed process of building and maintaining the Satsuma may be overwhelming for some, requiring patience and perseverance.

Lack of Tutorials: While the realism is a strong point, the game could benefit from more comprehensive tutorials or guides to assist players in understanding the various mechanics and activities. Some may find themselves lost without sufficient guidance.

Occasional Bugs and Glitches: Like many simulation games, My Summer Car is not without its share of bugs and glitches. While updates aim to address these issues, occasional frustrations may arise from unexpected in-game occurrences.

Send piston 3 to the moon
It still ran on 3 cylinders, but had a massive hole in the block and oil pan
So, the race to Fleetari was on. I grabbed the main cap and off I went.
Watching the oil pressure gauge like a hawk.
Pressure dropped too far. Pull over, fill with oil, continue on a few hundred feet...
Rinse and repeat
Run out of oil halfway there
Sent pistons 1 and 4 to Mars and Venus respectively
Middle of nowhere, the tractor is MIA, all my modded in cars are at the house, Pena's dead, the Van is at Fleetari's waiting on me, I don't know where the shit truck is...
The walk to Fleetari's to pick up the Hayosiko took like 45 minutes real time.

Imagine a mix between a survival game and Car Mechanic Simulator. Not only do you have to build and upgrade your Satsuma, but you must also take care of your character by keeping factors like; Thirst, Hunger, Stress, Fatigue and Dirtiness in mind. If not, your character's health will slowly deplete until you die. The challenge with My Summer Car is that it is a perma-death game. You die, you lose everything. (Though perma-death can be turned off in the main menu at the start of the game)

What also keeps this game challenging is the fact that when you build your car, every single screw and bolt must be torqued and well adjusted, (Ex: You must adjust each of the engine's valves one by one) and every single part is prone to breaking at random. To me, it's the total randomness that keeps the game fun.

 While some people will say My Summer Car is a tedious and over-complicated game, others will argue that it's what makes it fun. In my personal opinion, My Summer Car is well worth the price, considering there are tons of fan-made mods available if the game ever finds itself to be too boring or challenging for you. You can really make this game what you want it to be, though the vanilla experience is also very fun once you get things up and going. 

If you're looking for a realistic, yet humorous car-building game that never gets boring due to all the curve-balls it throws at you, My Summer Car is the perfect game for you.",1702617885,1702617885,True,1,0,0.513888895511627197,0,True,False,True

It's probably the finest computer game ever made.


----


This game was great in 2017 / 2018. But a number of patches and updates since then have taken all the fun out of it. While the game has always been trying to 'troll' you; it used to be balanced - you could survive and thrive in the game if you knew the pitfalls. Now, EVERYTHING you do in the game appears to have negative affects. Take the Johnny ES bike for example; it's terrible mode of transport now made worse by the fact that you are guaranteed to fall off at least every minute. Difficulty and challenge is one thing, but this masochistic game is quite another.

If you like being mentally anguished, frustrated and angered, you'll love this game.

EDIT: December 2023

I decided to give the game another go as I wanted to re-setup my old driving hardware, which works great with this game once you've fiddled a bit. I spent several hours building the perfect Satsuma, then on the very first drive got it wrapped around the train. That was funny for all of 5 seconds, when I realised that the game defaulted to Permadeath mode. But you know what? I'm just about to start it all again.

Oh, My Summer Car, you magnificent, infuriating beast of a game! It's like a love-hate relationship that keeps me coming back for more punishment and joy.

Let's start with the love: The attention to detail is nothing short of mind-blowing. From building your own car piece by piece to the immersive open-world environment, it's a car enthusiast's dream come true. The satirical humor and quirky characters add a unique charm that makes every moment memorable.

But oh, the hate: The unforgiving mechanics and the brutal learning curve can make you question your life choices. One minute you're tightening a bolt with a sense of accomplishment, and the next, you're stuck in the middle of nowhere, cursing the Finnish countryside and wondering why you ever thought building a car from scratch was a good idea.

The permadeath feature? It's both a blessing and a curse. The sense of danger and consequence keeps you on your toes, but losing hours of progress due to a silly mistake can be soul-crushing.

And let's not forget the notorious AI drivers – they're either your best friends or your worst enemies. One moment, they're offering a friendly ride, and the next, they're causing chaos on the road like it's a demolition derby.

In conclusion, My Summer Car is a masterpiece that tests your patience, resilience, and sanity. It's a wild ride that will have you laughing, crying, and questioning your life choices in equal measure. Love it or hate it, you can't deny its unique charm and the satisfaction that comes with conquering its challenges. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go rage-quit and then come back for more punishment – because, deep down, I can't resist the allure of My Summer Car's twisted embrace. Ps I hacked up the neighbors with an axe, womp womp.

Mods I have used:

Item rotation
Chase Camera - External View
MSC Editor
God Mode - for fun.
Paint anything mod - Can paint the engine.
Mini Map - Can help when getting lost.
Mosquito kill - Stop that annoying sound
MSC Duper mod - Duplicate items, when you need more than one.

Tutorial is borderline non-existent, I like how the game doesn't hold my hand while building a car but how tf am I supposed to know that this dude has a cottage on an island with a fish trap on the porch???? Impossible to navigate in the game without googling the english translation of the map, never know what the time is, some dude calls me to pick him up from the pub I drive there to the other side of the map took like 15-20 minutes irl and he's not there. The camshaft that was bolted in, had a timing belt on and the timing cover on top of that somehow shot itself through the timing cover when I placed the engine on the workbench now I can disassemble the whole front end bc the camshaft is apparently a ghost that it can move through solid objects. I was riding the moped straight on a straight road and it decided to make a 90 turn at max speed multiple times, ""pls be gud dis a early access gaem"" my ass, it was released in 2016, waste of money, should have bought mechanic simulator.

Day 2 of losing my mind: 
So I really want to build that car, decided to give the game one more chance. Went to the store to buy cigarettes and alternator belt, also bought food, beer, oil and some other stuff. For some reason the game gave me only one shopping bag so I had to carry most things individually to the boat, took like 8 trips between the boat and the store and then 8 trips between the boat and the house kms. Had to reload the save multiple times bc things kept on messing up, but the game doesn't save state of things like the engine hoist or the car jack so if you have your car jacked up and the hoist lowered and you save your game be ready to do that again bc they'll go to their default position. Took me an hour to figure out how to put the engine on the hoist at least I knew I wasn't alone reading the comments on reddit and everybody raging. Ran out of fuel in the middle of the lake, turns out you can't just pour in oil and then gas into the two stroke boat engine, you have to buy the two stroke fuel. Took a bus but while the bus was still at the bus stop cars kept on crashing into the bus bc the drivers are blind and can't slow down so the bus had like 6 cars piled up behind it, the bus driver got up and fking left and got stuck in the ditch by the road walking on the spot. The phone keeps on ringing fk off grandma I'm googling how to take the helmet off. I spent more time googling and watching youtube tutorials than playing. No tutorials for the engine building that's easy, but tutorials for random bs the game fails to explain like how to deal with stress, or what to do when you accidentally flip the car on its roof by brushing against its fender while working on it. Tried installing the dashboard and it kept fking falling apart, watched a tutorial on youtube just to confirm that yes I was doing everything correctly, works in the youtube video doesn't in game like wtf, then I tried to put in the dashboard one more time and this time not only did it fall apart but it also broke the fking windshield fk this game. I'm not a rage quitter, the last time I rage quit a game was probably like in 2013 playing cod, usually I make fun of rage quitters for taking games too seriously, I just wanted to relax building a car after work while I wait for parts for my real car. I rage quit two days in the row fk this game.

Day 3 of losing my mind:
Built the engine, wired everything, built the suspension, had a good time playing the game for the first time. Then I decided to head to the store for oil and gas so I can try to start the car up for the first time, crashed on the way and died. Turns out perma death is on by default so lost all the progress seriously fk this piece of sht game what rtrd came up with default permadeath ffs you gotta be kidding.",1701581381,1701715300,False,1,2,0.39205053448677063,0,True,False,True

The Good:
-Fairly realistic mechanic functions.
-It's hard in that weird sort of way that i like?
-It's a progressive car game
-You have a boat, mini-bike, and a tractor.
-Alcoholism galore.

The Bad:
-You get punished HARD for everything.  you have a drunk ass cousin that will ram right into you on the road, and if he dies? you got to jail for 5 days, which is 10 IRL hours.  Gotta hack your save file to delete it.
-Don't have transportation stored everywhere? get ready to die bitch.  you'll thirst to death before you get anywhere.
-Mechanics are wonky as fuck.  you can lean into your car to tighten a bolt and it can go flying into a wall leaving it unfunctional and needing thousands of dollars to fix.
-money's dumb.  you get a decent job every once in a while and everything takes forever.
-foods wild. your house is a good ways from the only store and it only restocks once a week, not a huge deal but at first it takes a long time to get there.
-mechanic shop can even mess up your car.  took my car there, running (albeit on choke) and asked him to tune it.  now it's sitting there, body panels multi colored and it doesnt run at all.

all in all, fuck this game.  that being said, i'll keep playing it.  when it's going good, it's fun.  but it'll fuck you in ways that make you think dark souls is fucking pokemon.",1700714768,1700714768,False,60,21,0.709483146667480469,0,True,False,True

Dropped into a reality that might resemble one of your own as a youngster (at least parts of it heavily reminded me of my own, growing up poor in a small village living off of farming, chasing many of the same hobbies).

Your main objective and source of entertainment (but absolutely not only), will be fixing your dads old junkyard car.  You do not have to be a gear head to find enjoyment in the rather cathartic process, it is much more of a hobby kit for a age 9+ kid, but dad better read the instructions to make sure everything works properly.

If you find zero value in the car process, you can take part of day to day life, helping your neighbours and family with odds and ends.

Charming at its core, and that is such a hard aspect to capture for most games that end up feeling soulless.

There are so many unnecessarily frustrating bugs with the game, like physics making your car do circles in your garage after you properly jack up the vehicle to remove the tire, essentially ruining your mortal life save game after 20 hours (playing it vanilla, not using 3rd party save editors to fix the game ruining bugs).

You will never run out of things to repair, replace, upgrade or tune on your car, you will never run out of quests to complete or groceries to buy or places to explore. This is one of those games where you have to read the wiki to understand its mechanics and make progress but it's fun nonetheless since it's very rewarding to finally hear your car idle, or installing a new part and breaking your previous speed record. The mechanics of this game are complex, not just the things you do with your car but just about every other action you do in the game such as brewing homemade alcohol, pumping septic tanks, grilling sausages or delivering fire wood. Npcs have surprisingly complex behaviour, voicelines and the game world offers a great level of detail and immersion despite the low level graphics which (to me at least) has a certain charme. Driving physics and having to acitvely shift your car or truck is super fun. But to use a gamepad effectively, you have to use Joy2Key to map your right analog stick to mouse movements to move the player camera which is a big deficit, however there are tutorials to setup joy2k. Also, playing without MSCEditor (to edit save files) is a pain but i dont have to use it very often.

ALSO, this game is fucking hilarious: Brutal car crashes with your drunk cousin, pissing on people, drunk driving and flipping of  cops, boxing drivers, dumping a literal load of shit onto someone's property... the list goes on.

This game from the start, is designed to be difficult for new players. If i were you, i'd first watch somebody play this game, exactly how i managed to find this game. Do not go into permadeath mode for your first playthrough. I have died about six times trying to rally in permadeath. only to literally be met with a second place finish. If you find this game boring after while, like right after you're done building your car, i suggest tinkering with mods. A must have, no matter what kind of player you are is MOP. It optimizes the game, although at a risk because it is not being supported anymore. Once you have finished building the car multiple times, you can start to shave off and cut time to become faster at building, this is when, if you want to be a permadeath player. Do remember that this is a game, and only curse out the game when something physics breaking does happen. 

Like my first review, you can roll over 5 times doing highway speeds, but hit a tree at almost a crawl can kill you.

In this game you build a Good Car, you tune it, upgrade it, drive it into oncoming traffic, go to the local rally race, and hopefully with some luck, Win.

This journey you are about to take, is very hard, Don't use permadeath unless your a true chad

You're first day would probably go something like this considering there is no guide,

Inhale eight beers,
Watch Topless Gun
Piss all over the hot rocks of the sauna

Instead you should go over to teimos and buy shit

for starters, back in late 2016-early 2017 when all the updates were big new features or fixes to massive issues and the core content of the game remained untouched it was great, you had a van and truck from the start, the wheels were in the garage, and the oil filter, battery, and spark plugs weren't replaceable items (although i don't mind the fact that they are now).

However, this game has slowly suffered from the dev wanting to make it seem like progress is being made and it's just on a back burner compared to my winter car but it's been done in a way that, in my opinion, sacrifices some of the enjoyment. the van and truck are no longer in your hands the moment you hit new game, instead you have to install certain parts on the car, then wait a random period of time, then sleep and check your uncle's house every morning for the van. if you find it there, great! ask your uncle for the keys (knock on his door) and drive off, but he takes the keys back after a while and you'll have to ask again so you're completely out of luck if you cant drive the satsuma for whatever reason. sure the tractor and Jonnez (and the boat but i havent touched it in years due to this games janky physics) exist but none compare to the van.

As for the truck it's a similar situation, after enough time of you using the van has passed your uncle will lose his licence for drunk driving and for whatever reason decide to hand the keys to his truck over to you, the truck is now parked in the town's sewage treatment plant, so good luck getting there if you cant use the Jonnez (or boat).

Next is the situation with the satsuma itself, firstly was wiring, which many found annoying but it's relatively simple (just remove the headlights and one of the starter bolts and then spam f randomly until the car starts again) then they added consumable batteries, spark plugs and oil filters, which again wasn't too big of an issue in my eyes as you need to get to the shop (problems with that somewhat discussed above) anyway.

The true issues come with what extra content HAS been added relatively recently, mainly the new jobs, haybale and strawberries, the haybale job is a one-off you do for a farmer who cant work himself, but the haybales are scattered about the map and the only vehicle you can move them with is the tractor, making it incredibly tedious. the strawberries job is simple, go to the strawberry farm and harvest the strawberries, but (i've been trying to avoid swearing this whole review but since it's an 18 rated game anyway and im making a point) you get FUCK ALL in terms of pay for doing it, and it takes ages so it's completely pointless effort that could've been spent developing parts of the game that are more important.

something that was added that many do find useful was the Ruscko, another means of getting yourself from point A to B, you can steal it off this weird pig-guy (not making that up) or gamble your car (yes, the satsuma, the entire reason you'd play this game) away in hopes of winning his instead (shit deal) however it has a wasps nest in it, the simplest solution to that is wait until after 8pm (when it's dark basically) and use the tractor to drown the wasps (will take a while to get there) or use the fire extinguisher on them (can be done with Jonnez and is faster but costs money) and your reward for this? the worst car in the game. the Ruscko:
1: cannot start properly
2: has broken electrics
3: wiper switch is broken
4: dead wasps nest permanently there
5: horrible fuel economy
6: looks ugly as hell (but to be fair that was the whole idea for the car)
7: has next to no fuel in it when you first get it
8: if you steal it, the horn blares when you go over bumps (lmao)
9: cannot be repaired (without mods)
10: isn't road legal, and the police can catch you driving it on the highway
so while it may be better than the tractor for those first few shop runs while you're getting started, beyond that it will end up sitting in your driveway rusting away, screwdriver in the ignition (unless you seriously gambled the satsuma for it)

If you call that ""survival"", you apparently have stopped living already. So forget about that. 
Also a lot ppl say ""you die fast"" in this game. Another bs. If you're not a crazy idiot who takes a shower while outside is a thunderstorm or other stupid stuff like driving on the tracks just because you're too lazy to take the longer way and things like that you won't die. Just don't do things you wouldn't do irl unless you're somehow mental.

Building The Engine:
      Building the engine had to be the BEST experience in the game for me. Just the feeling of finally getting it running is amazing. There is a limited number of upgrades, BUT, you need to work hard to get them, tuning also adds more to it (mentioned later).

Breakage Of Parts:
      I love and hate this, the realism is great, but, also, wants to kill you (literally). I think it involves a interesting experience for working on and fixing cars. A weird part is, you break piston 1? Boom, Fleetari magically has it! Its neet that you can repair parts with the ""Dingging Bar"" that let's you ""fix"" (kinda) body panels, etc.

Tuning:
       Tuning provides a lot of preformace, especially further in the game. The littlest turn can change your engine completely. Or suspension! It's awesome!

Earning Money:
      You can do multiple things to earn money, for example, you can chop wood, do sewage stuff, delivery jobs, gambling, and more!

Buying Upgrades:
      You can spend your hard earned money on parts to win the local rally! That's literally it. Tbh it's a status thing lol.

Overall:
       My Summer Car is a life simualtor disguised as a car game, you are a guy in your 20s in the Finnish countryside, and you have to build your parents car while they are on vacation (they never return, it's not a story thing, it's just not a story game.) over the summer. While having to survive the harsh Finnish countryside.

Also, the controls to assemble are the same to drop an object, so when trying to assemble your car you just end up throwing the object half the time.

""My Summer Car"" is a wildly unique and oddly charming simulation game that invites players to dive into the eccentric world of rural Finland, where you'll assemble a car, manage your daily life, and navigate the quirks of Finnish culture. Developed by Amistech Games, this game offers an unconventional yet surprisingly engaging experience that combines automotive mechanics, survival elements, and open-world exploration.

At its core, ""My Summer Car"" revolves around the simple premise of building and maintaining a car from scratch. You begin with a disassembled car and a cluttered garage, and it's up to you to piece it all together, bolt by bolt. The attention to detail in car assembly is nothing short of impressive, as you'll need to use tools, read manuals, and troubleshoot issues, creating a satisfying sense of accomplishment when your car finally roars to life.

Beyond the garage, the game immerses you in the daily life of a Finnish teenager during the 1990s. You'll need to manage your character's needs, including hunger, thirst, and hygiene, which adds an intriguing layer of survival gameplay. Venturing into the open-world environment, you'll encounter quirky characters, explore the scenic countryside, and engage in activities like fishing, drinking at the local pub, and even participating in the infamous rally races.

The game's realism extends to its driving mechanics, which accurately simulate the experience of operating a car. Navigating the challenging Finnish roads, especially while intoxicated, can be both hilarious and maddeningly frustrating, making for some memorable moments.

One of ""My Summer Car's"" unique features is its brutal difficulty and lack of handholding. The game doesn't hold back on its steep learning curve, and your character can meet a variety of untimely and gruesome ends if you're not careful. This unforgiving nature may turn off some players, but it also contributes to the game's quirky charm.

The open-ended nature of ""My Summer Car"" means there's no traditional storyline, and the game relies on player-driven experiences. This can be both a strength and a weakness, as some players may miss the guidance of a structured narrative.

In conclusion, ""My Summer Car"" is a game that defies easy categorization. It's part automotive simulator, part survival game, part open-world adventure, and all wrapped up in a charmingly eccentric Finnish package. The level of detail in car assembly and the immersive rural setting make it a standout title for those seeking a unique gaming experience. While its steep learning curve and lack of traditional storytelling may not be for everyone, those who embrace its quirks will find themselves immersed in a wonderfully odd and engaging virtual summer in Finland. Prepare for a summer you won't soon forget, filled with cars, saunas, and plenty of surprises.",1642780259,1696525526,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I made the unfortunate mistake of showing Pena the middle finger and got run over on my moped, dying.

I took a bus to the spot. I pissed off the bus driver causing him to kick me off the bus and starve to death in the thick Finnish wilderness.
I respawned in town.
I took the bus again, this time not pissing off the driver.
I got to my moped and recovered it.
I ran out of fuel halfway to home, thirsty and starving.
I stumbled my way home with my bike after 3 real life hours.


After 150 hours, I managed to get the Satsuma working. On the first ride to refuel I made it to the highway just to realise that one of my tyres have popped. Shortly after I ran out of fuel and had to push the car on the highway all the way to town for the refuel.

Eventually I made it and refuelled my car. I went home and spun out of control and crashed myself into the tree at 120 kmh. 

Second attempt, I made it home. I decided to smoke a cigarette which would prove fatal as despite knowing you can ignite your house if you sleep with a cigarette, I acted too quickly and went to sleep with my cigarette, causing my room to ignite and burning the whole house down. I did not save before going to sleep. 


By making me walk for 2 hours, having to do something 100 times all over again, flipping the van over 5 times in a row, spinning out of control and crashing into a tree at a speed of Mach 2, losing several hours of progress, this game has made me scream.

As you can imagine, the 4-years of owning this game had taught me a lot. Prior to playing this game, I had a very limited understanding of the manual transmission from the few games I played that had them, such as Need For Speed Carbon on the Wii, and CSR Racing on the phone. Even then, those games didn't have clutches. But My Summer Car does! This game simulates all the components you'd be using in a late-'70s car.

I like the aesthetic of the game, while I was not alive in 1995, I do think it succeeds in portraying the look and feel of that year. (It is a lot more believable than Yandere Simulator's ""1989"", might I add.)
I also like the controls of the game, it works well even with a keyboard, although I wouldn't recommend doing the rally with it, as you'd lack the analogue brakes needed to not under-steer into a tree at 120 km/h.

I really like how hard this game is. If you thought Street Legal Racing: Redline was punishing. This is a whole other level... If you crash, you have to painstakingly tighten each bolt after putting the parts back on, and that's the best outcome you're gonna get for a crash. Usually, you'd die, and have to walk back to the wreckage to reassemble the car, in a ditch. Even after that, you're not out of the woods yet; the fuel has all leaked out, the windshield has come out, you've got to limp to the fuel station with the last fluid ounces of fuel left in the tank to buy more fuel, and a new windshield. To get the money for that stuff, you work. Namely, manual labour.

As for what I don't like... I don't like how hard this game is to run smoothly. It isn't the best optimised game out there, nor is it the least buggy, for that matter. (Don't tighten either of the Disc Brake Rotors' 14mm bolts until you have installed the halfshafts, otherwise your car won't put the power down.)
This last point is gonna sound like a nit-pick... The bolt sizes in the game are so impossibly small, notably the hood and bootlid's 6mm bolts.

In conclusion... If you've a car enthusiast, looking to go back to the '90s, and you've got a deeply beefy CPU, with heaps of RAM, you can't go wrong with My Summer Car.",1695003588,1695003588,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I don't play games like I used to when I was a kid. When I start up one of my games I usually mess around for 30 minutes and get bored but somehow my summer car seems to be the one game that will keep me entertained for hours. keep in mind I have 1200 hours on csgo, 1000 hours on gmod, and hundreds of hours on a bunch of other games but nothing keeps my attention like this game does anymore.
Just tonight I found out this game has a quite alot of mods for it too so when you do run out of things to do there is plenty to do with the mods you can get from the nexus.

Or more accurately, rebuilding it from a pile of parts left in the garage. The engine needs a complete assembly, the suspension is in pieces and the interior and wiring are in a similar state. Perhaps there's a consumable part or two missing as well? And where are the tyres?

You will need to use other modes of transport available to go out and complete odd jobs around the local area to raise funds to repair your car and buy enough food to keep yourself alive. The jobs are quite varied, but might become repetitive after a long playthrough. To alleviate this, you can find some more interesting ways to make money one-off, which I'd recommend you hunt for as they can be quite fun.

The game does require a base level of mechanic knowledge, or the willingness to follow a guide (unless you want to spend hours figuring out how to build and engine on your own) so be warned going into this one that it doesn't hold your hand one bit. There are some simplifications of processes, but otherwise it's surprisingly authentic in terms of putting a car together from scratch.

Once you've got your car up and running, you may want to make some less-than-respectable modifications to it to get it ready for rally or drag racing, or you might just want to get it in good condition and take it out on regular drives. It's up to you how you play this game. Aside from making sure your needs are met, there is a lot of freedom in how you play this game.

An easy game to recommend, so long as you're aware it's very slow going and can be frustrating due to the numerous ways you can die (and potentially lose your save if you play on permadeath!)",1694878417,1694878417,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I'm not one for difficult games and I couldn't care much about cars either, but for some reason this game speaks to me.

It's far from a cinematic gameplay experience. There is no background music and you spend a lot of time driving down the same lengthy routes to carry out chores and shopping runs.

1)  If you play on a keyboard - keyboard keys are either pressed or they are not pressed - there is no way to activate a key 'a little bit' or 'half way' - therefore there is not a good way to simulate the use of a vehicle's clutch on a keyboard.  Sure you can rev the engine to max and pop that clutch and just hope for the best, and sometimes it will even work, but is this really a good thing to have in a game?  Not for me.  
When I saw that the dev had done this, it brought up so many questions for me, like:  When I build a car later , will I be expected to link the steering wheel to the carburetor or will it have a normal steering components?  Am I going to be required to do some other impossible-to-accomplish-on-a-keyboard task that I cannot find a way to sometimes work around?  This is a game about building a car and driving.  American Truck Sim, Farming Sim, most every other game dev gets that you can't expect folks to operate a clutch normally with a keyboard.  If I'm missing something here, please point it out.  I am having a hard time believing that this is an actual game mechanic; start the vehicle, stall it, start it, stall it, start it stall it, and at some point, maybe if you are on a hill, you'll get rolling.  
2)  For me personally, a valid game challenge is something like:  How do I get more money?  How will I assemble this machine?  How do I obtain a resource with which to finish this task?  These are the challenges I expect.  The challenges in this game are of a different type.  They are like:  which mystical combination of buttons is going to allow me to close this door?  Which, seemingly arbitrary, combination of buttons would allow me to dip water out of a bucket with a ladle?  Why does the motorcycle make a crashing noise every time I figure out the mysterious series of buttons that would allow me to sit on it?  I know how to close doors, dip water out of a bucket, and sit down in real life, so a simulation should not make these into major obstacles to overcome.  For me, this makes it no longer a simulation, but a puzzle of the type that does not appeal to me.  (After 40 minutes and a tutorial, I still could not dip water out of that bucket.)     
These type of obstacles ruin the immersive quality of a game because they force one to focus on the keyboard and not the game.  I look at this type of thing as a very cheap way to challenge players.  It requires no creativity, no thought - and it inspires no further interest from the player.    
I'll save you the cost of this game - just do this:  I'm thinking of a random combination of buttons on a keyboard and mouse - can you guess what they are?  It's like code breaking, but I'm not telling you how many characters are in this code.  I'll give you some clues in the form of noises that won't make any sense within the context of your task.  If you guess right, you'll only accomplish something small, like closing a door, so there is virtually no reward for getting it right.    
That is what this game experience was like for me - even after mapping custom controls, even after watching youtube vids, even after reading info here and on reddit.  It was a good idea in theory, but so poorly executed as to be unplayable for me.

You build and maintain your own car, get to interact with finnish culture in the mid-1990s, fall into sewage wells and take a drunk guy home from the pub. The possibilities are endless. Never before have I played a game where I took a break from rebuilding the engine out of my car to trickshot piss across the kitchen into the sink while drinking my own homemade sugar wine. Or taken a break from trying to learn a virtual computer OS to drink booze and accidentally hit myself with a hatchet while drunk.

I really wanted to like the game, but this is more tempermental than building an actual car in real life.

I've played for 14.5 hours, I've died 10 times (mostly due to physics glitches) and I've had to restart the game three times due to various issues.   I finally got to the point where the car had tires, the engine was assembled, but the final nightmare was trying to get the motor into the car and that was a whole fresh heck.   How in the seven worlds do you manage to get a car SIDEWAYS IN THE GARAGE?   I don't know, but that thing was in there sideways thanks to the glitchy as heck engine hoist.   It's like the game was intentionally made to be punishingly difficult.

I've built cars before, it's not easy.  But at least you don't have to worry about the engine clipping through the subframe, or suddenly deciding to launch itself through the firewall, or FLIP THE ENTIRE CAR OVER!  I just gave up at that point. 

I tried to do the haybale task with the tractor to get more money and even that was complicated to all heck.  I used to spend my summers loading haybales for my uncle's ranch, it's not anywhere as difficult as the game makes it.  I had to resort to modding to be able to load the hay bales and then I couldn't find where to drop the bales off at because no map to reference!

I shouldn't have to resort to mods to make this game even vaguely playable.  I shouldn't have to constantly refer to google searches to figure out how to do various basic tasks.  This game was a promising premise, to build a car, but in the end it just ended up being torture.  I think I'd rather play in the road and wait for that guy in the green car come by and mow me down than continue playing this game.",1692325850,1692325850,False,8,11,0.4846668541431427,0,True,False,True

Recent development has taken a turn towards the worst solution. This game is just not fun anymore, all the fun ways to play have been patched out, but all of the major frustrating bugs like parts falling through the world or falling off the car between saves still exist. Every aspect of this game has gone from good to poor, it has plenty of detail, and posed a nice challenge. But I finally am uninstalling this game and won't be buying the sequel because everything I loved about MSC got ruined by a developer with a different vision for a game based on F***ing unity engine. I'm sorry.

This ""life simulator"" is one of the most ""fun"" games out there, but also one of the hardest ones out there ( That's what She said!!). Like, one minute everything is fine, you driving on a road with 90ish Km/h wich has the speed limit 60Km/h with a vehicle with a speed limit of 80Km/h, everything is fine until one noticeses that if you perform the ""gutter run"" you  can take a corner at higher speed, and next thing you know; you are on your ""one-way trip"" to heaven (or hell, depending) with the fist stop being a tree. Before you can press ALT-F4 you see blod al over the screen and Routainen maa playing.

Just for context, I am not talking of personal experience (JK I am, and i hate this game with every quark of my body, but i also love this game because it's diffrent form other games, that give you everything from the start , and always droping tips and hints, and we don't want to forget about the ""ruberband effect"" in other games. Cuz this game dosn't Help you in any way. It just want's to punish you for EVERYTHING that you could and will do.)

In short: This game deservs some hours of your life if you like automobiles and engines, you either Love or hate it, OR even both at the same time, it's at least like that for me.",1690795548,1690795548,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

But if you play long enough, it might just be acceptably fun. There are of course problems, like the final thing you can gamble at the Ventti hut being a crappy 50s station wagon with a wasp nest inside of it.. Speaking of wasps, wasps follow you forever after you make them angry, which it pretty infuriating. There is also a pretty annoying bug which, if you press ESC twice, the pause menu will be permanently displayed on your screen without you being able to interact with it. The only way to remove the menu would be by painstakingly making your way to a toilet and exit with saving, or to manually close the game from steam.

1. The game is out to punish you from the start
2. The jobs are tedious and repetitive
3. The food spoils to fast and keeps you from focusing on building the car
4. The physics are bad
5. Some AI buses/cars go around you and some just crash into you just to punish you

The only reason I like the game is to build the car and customize it but the dev/s has taken the fun out of that with constantly forcing you to do repetitive tasks. I will not be purchasing my winter car if it come out unless it changes and allow you time to enjoy your car building without all the non-sense.

With all that said, the game is funny and you can use mods to make the punishing stop.

Edit: After learning more about the game, I am changing my view on it and do recommend the game.

A lot of people complain that the game is too punishing, and while I agree it can be unfair when the police jail you when a drunk driver crashes into you and kills himself, the game forces you to be careful on the roads, follow traffic laws, plan for food and tanking up fuel just like you would in real life.

Other games have uppdates that improves quality of life. This game has updates that decreases quality of life. By design.

It has the physics of Goat Simulator, the boringness of Euro Truck Simulator, the annoyingness of Getting Over It, the dull mechanics of House Flipper, the controls of QWOP, and requires the time investment of a major AAA role playing game, and the graphics are super ugly.

There is no core gameplay whatsoever. The whole game is just a bunch of accidents and circumstances. It literally takes hours to learn how to even use basic objects and drink water. Then your house burns down and you start over.

Actually building the car - you know, the main point of the game - is super boring and stupid. Again you are just spending your time trying to use the worst controls ever to find some super secret screw hidden in a super awkward angle.

There is no progression, no improvement. You can't learn new skills, and build your character. You are just stuck playing the village idiot, in the slowest moving place on earth.

No sane person with a life would ever play this game. Why on earth did they make this game?

so much garage games on steam and heres another one to add to the shit pile
my summer car opens up in the dumbest and strangest way, you are born as a baby but fast forward to young or older adult years, you can drive and even drink but NOTHING FUCKING WORKS!
the hit detection for the mouse to interact with things and objects is total ass.
the game doesnt explain shit. you have to kneel down to grab objects on the ground.
many objects dont even make a sound. im clicking on the fucking bike and i cant even get going and thats what you're supposed to do because the very car thats in the opening is fucking dismantled... why? the game is called my summer car, not my lazy ass summer that i got robbed. what the fuck is this bullshit? 
years of game design and nothing fucking works in this game besides moving around, flipping off and swearing with other random actions. any other game with driving, you get in or on a bike and start driving. NO BULLSHIT. not in this game, its either heavily cryptic and puzzling or fucking stupid and broken. ""entering drive mode"" is  misleading because NOTHING FUCKING HAPPENS. another game i watch a youtube play without flaw and once again i play it and its total shit 
and if the bike fell, tough shit, you cant pick it back up. wtf",1688835746,1688836312,False,0,2,0.388601034879684448,0,True,False,True

Here's a heads up this game can be funny and goofy, doesn't matter if its due to a bug or a feature this game can be super funny. But on the other hand it can get very dark (both in tone and lighting) If you are not in a clear head space I would say avoid taking the drunk guy home until you have a clear head space (this is due to how his story ends and it takes some time to do as well). Also this game is really hard even more so when you are new to the game so don't play on perma death. Also don't worry if you don't understand things (the game does a poor job of explaining some things like how to get the blue van or even wheels) that's normal and I was the same way starting off just pull up a guide when you think you need it. That said over time as you learn the game it does get easier I myself rarely die or have issues driving, It just takes time and practice to get a handle of the game.",1687764821,1687764864,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Hei, soittaja, haitarin soida suo
Säkkijärven polkkaa
Nuoren ja vanhan se tanssiin vie
Ei sille polkalle vertaa lie

The game doesn't give you any help for your first car build, making it the most frustrating thing ever. After seeing the fan base simply fawn over it, I can't understand why because it gives you all of the parts but none of the knowledge. You are basically sitting there fumbling in the dark because it somehow gives you too much but also too little. Not to mention, simply surviving makes it even more difficult because you have to take your focus away from the build. It could be great, but the lack of accessibility for newcomers is too big to ignore and thus made me hate playing it. An optional tutorial in game would fix this, or even better, a manual for the build. I should not have to rapidly search all over the internet for guides after only playing for 2 minutes. I really tried to like it, as seen by my 33 hour playtime, but I simply cannot play it without wanting to throw my desk out the window. If you are looking for a semi-relaxing and pleasant experience, you will be very disappointed, and more likely to be frustrated out of your mind. Not to mention that while it is an open-world game, there is no 'design' at all. You are basically meant to stumble upon things at random from what I can tell. It doesn't work, especially when your uncle's house is right behind yours, but it's hidden behind trees and hedges. You most likely wouldn't know its there unless you randomly walk out that way, which is how I found it. You also have to find wheels for the car, and the game tells you absolutely nothing. They are just in some abandoned mansion on the other side of the map. Literally everything in the game I either stumbled upon or had to look up in guides. It makes progress incredibly slow and annoying because you have no idea where to look for anything. Last, but not least, death. I don't mind the death mechanic, but the fact that if you don't have permadeath on, you respawn at a church ACROSS THE MAP from your house. Chances are, you will die trying to get back without having a vehicle there or something. Why don't you spawn back at home? That would save a lot of headache. And that's what I would call this game, a massive headache. It could be incredible, but the bad design and annoying decisions the devs made had created an unpleasant experience.",1685487006,1685487006,False,4,2,0.471105486154556274,0,True,False,True

There are many words to describe this game: frustrating, slow, ridiculous, and tedious. But this game always has me coming back to it. It can be somewhat of a rage game at times, but there's something fun and charming about this game. If you're expecting awards for doing things, this game isn't for you. The only awards are the achievements and your own feeling of accomplishment. Knowing that you worked hard on something can be very rewarding. And you will have to work hard. Very hard. This game removes most remnants of sanity.

On top of that, you can't pause the game and places you can save at are scarce. You need to have a large time frame in which you can play this game. You can't just have 15 minutes to do something, because you won't be able to do much in 15 minutes. And even if you do, it's unlikely that you will be able to save your work. 

MSC Editor is also EXTREMELY necessary. It is a free program that allows you to edit your world. You WILL flip your Gifu at one point and you WILL NOT be able to flip it back up on its wheels. MSC Editor saves what little sanity you have left after playing this game.

It may seem like I'm just ranting about this game, but I do legitimately enjoy it. It has some more frustrating aspects, but that's what makes this game what it is. You don't expect to play My Summer Car and have an easy time doing things.",1685462306,1685462306,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Me personally? I played it because of the memes, I played it because it was popular and I just.... didn't like the game. It is easy to end up in a dead man walking state so easily. What is dead man walking? It means YOU ARE IRREVOCABLY ****ED. I wouldn't mind that, expect it can happen easily to a player that is unaware of the consequences of what they're doing. 

I played the game when it came out, I played it years later and it is STILL a janky mess where I basically have to youtube how to do things and read guides nonstop. Making a trip to the store? That could take about 8 minutes real time and you better not get lost, and you better have enough gas, food, water, etc etc whatever because if you don't you will lose your boat, your car, and have to remember where it was last and if you wreck your car, you gotta fix it. 

Ok, not a problem, I have 100's of hours in car mechanic simulator. I love car building games. This one though is PURE torture. I have to follow a youtube video step by step and its just not fun. I built the car twice. First time I built it I got it running, felt happy, took it for a spin, crashed it within an hour or two and uninstalled the game. Came back years later, rebuilt the car, then saw that now I have to do wiring, and uninstalled the game. Knowing what piece to connect and the *VERY SPECIFIC* magic pixel to look for is a frustrating experience and detracts from the experience. 

I wanna be Finnish, I wanna build a car, I wanna pick up my boy and drink and drive but nothing is intuitive and the consequences are so severe. Some people will tout, ""yeah but thats what makes it fun!"". Is that so?

Cutting the B.S this is a very fun game if you have the patience to build a car as well as dealing with some of the jank that comes with it (the jank is pretty much seasoning to this fine finnish dish though). You can always watch tutorials or walkthroughs of building the car for a bit of an easier experience as the building CAN be a bit tedious switching between spanners to find the correct size for screws, finding the screws, and or knowing how to properly ""tune"" the vehicle to get it functional.

The premise of the game is building the car to participate in the Rally. Or you can make it a disco on wheels, or factory restore it. Up to you. There are tasks to make money. Game details on the store page goes over all you can do in the game.

Its a fun time for 15 dollars, and especially for 5-10 when on sale. Again. I only recommend if you have patience and can handle some jank physics cause if you bump into the Satsuma oddly, either you or the car will become superman.

Chopping firewood and sucking sh*t with the sewage truck are time consuming and every bolt will frustrate you as you look for the correct sized wrench. 
     With all of that said, eventually the physics of the world and your interactions within it will just start to click, and you will enter into a flow where you really do feel like a young Finnish hooligan in another era. This is where the game shines the most as there is a ton of content hidden behind the initial tedium of surviving and progressing in this world. It is a game for those who are patient and willing to laugh at their failures as they learn the rules of the game. That patience will be rewarded however, as the game oozes humour and satire while feeling like a genuine slice of life in a small rural community. There are numerous achievements to seek and stories to follow which will inevitably make you laugh and maybe even cry.

OK. So this game does a pretty good, but not great, job of simulating what you need in real life to troubleshoot a broken car, after you assemble it from... I dunno, 100 or so parts? Feels like it, at any rate. The only problem is that you don't get the real visceral feeling of what's really happening with the car as you wonder what's wrong, nor all the real tools and references. It could perhaps use a little more ""gamification"" to hint at things, but that would likely detract from the pure simulation of it.

For example: The car is assembled and the starter runs and the choke is being used, but the engine doesn't fire, and the dash eventually fails to light. Is the battery dead? The charger says it's not. Do I have a voltmeter to check where something is not connected? Nope. Do I have a (insert popular name here) reference of wiring diagrams? Nope. Do I see empty wire connections? Kinda.

I'm not really trying to pick on what's lacking or overbearing. I'm simply stating that this game is difficult and will eat your lunch. And yet you will likely come back for more, because it's still entertaining... and you want that d**n car to run so you can drive it into the f***g lake that occupies most of the map, which makes you run in a big arse circle for several kilometres any time you want to go somewhere. F**k the boat, but don't because it actually helps. F**k the Jonnes, but don't because... actually, yes, to heck with the mostly useless, but fun to drive, Jonnes. There's a van... sometimes.

And then you find that mods are available to make you foam a bit less at the mouth. But the game still eats your lunch, unless you insist on super cheating, but then that would just make it all completely pointless.

So you go back for more.

Oh, make sure to use at least a game controller for driving, because keyboard driving a Jonnes on bumpy-ass back roads for 15 minutes, just to get a pack of smokes, sucks donkey...",1684208672,1684208672,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Pah

Complete the rally, then we can talk.

Postmortem edit: Since the game is now more or less complete, I would like to add onto this review. I still enjoy it, but there are some severe issues within the game and a hefty amount of ""dev says no"" syndrome. 

A lot of this game has changed over the years, and honestly, not much of it was for the better. This game has always been a challenge to some degree, but recent updates have turned these challenges into chores. There is a lot of this game that exits just to be a dick, not to offer a challenge. 

The blue van on loan from your uncle no longer spawns in front of your house. This means getting to the store just to buy food is now a chore. You either have to make hour long trips into town with your moped or take the boat and leap frog items back and forth because you still cant carry more than one item at a time. In order to get (temporary) access to the van, you have to talk to your uncle. Your uncle may not spawn for days or even weeks at a time. To even trigger his spawn timer, you have to attach certain parts to your car. That means if you arent in the know, you may be waiting around for him to spawn...and he just wont. Thats just bad game design. 

The Ruscko, an already terrible car, has a patch note called ""made Ruscko worse."" The car is now effectively useless. It cant be used for store runs because its both unregistered and adding any item to the car, excluding the player, causes it to stall constantly. Why? Why do this? This seems especially dickish because you have to bet your own car in a poker game to get it. Why would you risk the Satsuma? A fully buildable and tunable potential race car, against a car that cant even start if you place a grocery bag on the passenger seat. Oh, and as a act of pure malice, even if you win the car, theres a bees nest inside it and your character is deathly allergic to bees. So fuck you. Better bring a fire extinguisher. 

The Satsuma now has to be inspected more than once. Before, once you got the car inspected you were good to go. Now, every couple weeks, you have to take it to the shop. This doesnt sound so bad until you realize that most of the aftermarket or racing parts arent road legal. So every couple weeks you will have to tear down your car, put standard parts in it, inspect it, then tear it down again and rebuild it with race parts. Now, this is nonsensical because to take part in the rally...your car has to be road legal. But to be road legal, you have to remove all your rally parts. Thats just being a dick. 

The Satsuma's windshield is always filthy. Always. Even if you get the car to mint condition you will always have a filthy windshield. Apart from looking terrible against a fresh coat of paint, this also hinders your view. You used to be able to simply remove the windshield but a new death type was added where you can have a bee hit your eye while driving...killing you instantly. That is intentional and of the many reasons why Im starting to lean closer to a thumbs down. 

You can lose your house through no fault of the player. House fires can just happen now, sometimes without any input on the player. Every time you use something electrical, there is a chance to cause a house fire. Cooking sausage on the stove? House fire. Start up the sauna so you dont have a random heart attack from stress? House fire. Turn on the TV? House fire. Thunderstorm? House fire. Once you lose the house, which mathematically will happen eventually, you lose access to a TON of content and jobs. 

The Gifu had an update that made it harder to drive, as well as a visual change in which the truck looks worse. Why would you do that? 

Fuel oil was added but this is essentially useless. Its cheaper than diesel but the fine for using it is colossal and you risk outright losing access to 2 vehicles. You CAN put it in the tractor, but ONLY during one job. Speaking of...

A new job was added where you collect hay bales. This job can suck a cactus. Its extremely long, difficult and pays less than some other much easier ones. It can mercifully only be completed once. I dont understand this job. It is beyond not worth it, its almost comical how not worth it it is. 

While building the Satsuma you will quickly notice that parts that used to spawn in the garage, no longer do. You will have to make a trip to town, which Ive already explained has become a chore, to buy several parts. AND, for some reason...your tires have been hidden in a mansion filled with bees on the other side of the lake. Why are the Satsuma's tires in the random attic of a random house? Was the dev high when he made this change? Its completely nonsensical. 

A computer has been added and unless you are fluent in Finnish, you cannot use it. Nothing on the PC is translated. I honestly can't tell if this was a slapdash addition or just another middle finger toward the player. 

The game finally received an ending that sets up the next game that the dev says will have even less freedom and more restrictions. This, I cannot fathom.",1509353327,1683747102,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,True

Below are things this game could add for me to consider recommending it (not all but some at least);

- More intuitive menu
- In game pause
- In game instructions
- Fast travel system (at bus stops perhaps)
- In game map or at least a compass (not just the poster)
- Inventory system
- Slower draining needs bars
- To be able to jog for more than 10 minutes without dying.
- An indicator to when a red bar is about to kill you
- One-click tighten\loosen nuts and bolts
- Gamepad support

Stole Uncle's tractor and went to town for parts. Got to Telmo's after hours. Went to the pub and had a few beers. After the pub closed, almost died of dehydration twice with nowhere to go.

They weren't lying when they said this game wont hold your hand. Unless you are willing to succumb to the fact you will have to learn A LOT of $hit in order to gain stability in this universe, you will hate your life. The fandom wiki is your friend, it has a comprehensive build guide that WILL allow you to build your SATSUMA 100%. It also has the descriptions for how to get jobs and successfully complete which is very very important for maintaining and modifying your SATSUMA.      

HOWEVER

Not known to the player is you may spend 40+ hours (As I did because of work limitations and not wanting to rush and make mistakes) to fully build your little car to learn that every new game has randomized car part integrity. My first game ever was such a struggle to get the car to run, Eventually because of sheer frustration and not wanting to just simply quit playing, I opted to use the EXTREMELY convenient tool/mod MSCEDITOR. Turns out my 4 tires, water pump, starter and alternator were essentially TRASH.  (0-5% durability.)

PROS: 

-You get to enjoy Finnish lifestyle at its greatest
-Mad fun car tuning and building, no joke so addictive.
-Wacky sandbox/ life simulator that makes me laugh often.
-Driving 200MPH into a tree and dying instantly.
-Getting that damn car to run is truly org@smic 


CONS

-Inherently buggy at times. :(
-Mosquito sound will genuinely make you question your sanity.
-Lack of direction is harmful to new player in my opinion.
-Lacking proper optimization.

MODS

Getting outdated but still active MOD community. Use MSCloader and not MODLOADER PRO as the latter has depricated and is no lonfer supported. I waited to about 80 hours until I started modding and I have no regrets. 

Definitely a banger in my books!

My Summer Car is an absolutely fantastic game that provides a truly unique gaming experience. This game is not only incredibly fun and addictive, but it also provides players with an amazing level of depth and complexity that is rarely seen in other games.

One of the things that I absolutely love about My Summer Car is the incredible attention to detail that has been put into every aspect of the game. From the car building and maintenance mechanics, to the various mini-games and activities that you can engage in, everything has been thoughtfully designed to ensure that players are fully immersed in the experience.

The graphics and sound design in My Summer Car are also absolutely stunning. The game's visuals are incredibly detailed and realistic, and the sound effects really help to bring the game world to life. Whether you're cruising down the highway in your car or tinkering around in your garage, the game's audiovisuals create a truly immersive experience.

Another thing that I really appreciate about My Summer Car is the game's sense of humor. The game is absolutely loaded with hilarious jokes and Easter eggs that will keep you entertained for hours on end. Whether you're playing alone or with friends, the game is sure to keep you laughing and smiling throughout.

Overall, I would highly recommend My Summer Car to anyone who is looking for a fun, engaging, and immersive gaming experience. The game's attention to detail, stunning visuals and sound design, and hilarious sense of humor make it an absolute must-play for anyone who loves video games. So what are you waiting for? Get behind the wheel and start your engines today!

Over the years, the dev has added a lot of content, and as someone who got this game many years ago, I think it hasn't been an improvement like one would think.
The game was notorious for being a pain, however there is a difference between a game being challenging, and then just simply tormenting the player. I think a prime example of this is the jail mechanic. The maniac in the green Fiat slammed into you on the back roads and died? Too bad, you're going to jail, which can't be skipped and the sentence takes a few real life hours. Think you're smart and cheat your way out of jail? Too bad, if your sentence isn't finished, then the cops will be waiting for you everywhere and put you in the slammer again. 
Other than that, the player character just developing an allergy to wasp sting to stop the practice of removing the Satsuma windshield was a bitch move, as well as adding the moped helmet.
The addition of house fires also made the sauna pretty much obsolete, because why risk your house permanently burning down when you can smoke a cig instead? All of the cool things people did were in some way patched out, because the dev decided that no fun was allowed.
I understand wanting to like challenging games, and I liked the challenge of old MSC, but right now while the game is still challenging, all of the old fun seems to have been leeched out of the game.
I hope that My Winter Car will be a way for the dev to address some of this, and perhaps from the experience gained from this game he will make something truly to look forward to.",1555243840,1683222298,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

From the moment I started playing, I was transported to a beautiful Finnish summer, complete with stunning lakeside scenery, endless sunshine, and the sound of cicadas buzzing in the background.

But what really sets this game apart is the attention to detail. The gameplay is incredibly realistic, and every action you take feels like it has a real impact on the world around you. Whether you're fixing up your rusty old Datsun Cherry 100A, stocking up on groceries, or just hanging out in the sauna with a cold beer, every moment feels authentic and immersive.

The car repair mechanics in the game are particularly impressive. It's incredibly challenging to repair the car, but the feeling of satisfaction you get when you finally manage to do it is unmatched. You'll spend hours tinkering with the engine, fixing various parts, and replacing broken pieces, all the while feeling the frustration of not being able to get it quite right. But when you finally get the car running smoothly, it's a truly magical experience.

Of course, things don't always go smoothly in My Summer Car. There are plenty of moments of frustration and despair, like when two of your pistons blow holes in the engine block, forcing you to start from scratch. But even these setbacks are part of what makes the game so immersive and rewarding.

Overall, My Summer Car is a must-play game for anyone who loves immersive, realistic experiences. It's the perfect way to escape from the real world for a while and live out your dreams of becoming a typical Finnish person – beer in hand, in a sauna, fixing up your beloved car.

When you are creating a new game, you fill out a driver's license where you can import your own mugshot by modifying the game files. There is a permadeath option, though this is not recommended for people who get frustrated quickly. After creating your save you are dropped in your house. You have a van, a sewage truck, a tractor, and the shell of a project car (your summer car). Past the driveway you have a garage, containing many of the components to build the car. You have to completely build your engine, from block to air filter, with no ingame guides to hold your hand through the process. Alright, back to the real important stuff. In the top left hand corner you have your needs. They are as follows: URINE, HUNGER, THIRST, FATIGUE, and DIRTINESS (Stress now, too). If you don't take care of these, you will die. To get food, you need to drive to a store, which is along a dangerous road where driving into a tree will kill you. You save the game by clicking on toilets. 

Dying in this game fucking sucks. You generally always spawn back at your house and the gmae saves a few seconds after you die in the game so you dont have much time to ALT+F4. Also, if you crashed in your satsuma you might just end up restarting because the car is GOING to be totaled. Also, the car you died in remains where you died so you have to go get it with the tractor or another vehicle. I one time had a loop of dying trying to retrieve my vehicles so i just restarted. Also, theres a permadeath mode in this game, and dying one time in that mode deletes your save!

After you are finished with your engine, you need to insert it into your car. Before you do this though, you need to install the suspension. I'm not going to go into that, but instead tell what you're supposed to do next. In order to make your car have the best performance possible, you need to tune the carburator to adjust your air/fuel ratio. This is not recommended until you get the air/fuel gauge in the magazine, as you can (sometimes) permanently fuck up your engine, where it will backfire and die as soon as you start it and blow up (literally) if you put too much pressure on the engine (i know from experience as all that is currently happening and am attempting to fix it.) 

After you've gotten your car ready to go, you aren't done. While you were busybodying on your car, a strange letter came in the mail. Opening it up and finding strange scrabblings on it that looked like someone sneezed onto the page, you notice a big bolded number preceded by a dollar sign: 3,500 MK . Shit, you've got to pay your bills! And even worse, you don't have the money to pay for it! What could the remedy be?

SUCK SHIT! no really, you are given a septic truck by somebody (idk man u got it when the game starts) and your main method of getting money in this game is to perform sewage jobs for people. There are other ways to get money, too, but shitsucking is definitely the premier way to rake in the eds.

But yes, once you have amassed a small fortune, you now have the available capital to upgrade your car. Pretty much every part of your car can be upgraded, and you generally need most of these upgrades if you want to succeed in the rally.

What was that? The rally, I said? Yes! The general point of this game is to win the rally race. It is really hard to do and that's why everyone strives to do it (200 hours + no rally win sadge), but it is generally considered the endgame final boss. Be sure to install your rollcage and enhanced bucket seats before you do it, because one wrong turn or drift and you'll find yourself headfirst in a tree. There IS a real ending to the game, but I'll let you find that for yourself :)

Anyway, I give this game a 9/10. It's genuinely one of the most fun games I've ever played, and I can't talk enough about how much I like it. You will definitely not regret this purchase, unless you arent a fan of silly games like this, in which case, at least try it.

I enjoy Car Mechanic Simulator, but after awhile, i wanted more than the mediocre racing and the same loop of restore and sell. I saw some vids on this game from a few Youtubers i follow and the game looked just like what i was looking for. I finally tried it and can confirm my suspicions of: ""Its a lot more fun to watch than play"". 

I didnt spend much time playing MSC but i also didnt want to. I played long enough to build the engine and realized i would be fighting the very stiff/un-intuitive  controls all game and couldn't do it. Dont get me wrong, in 2016, a game of this calibur by a married couple is outstanding. However, in 2023 it very much shows its age and limits. I respect this game for setting the genre but i wouldnt recommend it today since its ""children"" (Mon bazou, Junkyard tuck, ect) are more refined even though they are just learning to walk.

The game has no direction what so ever, so its alot of trial and error. This can build up the sense of accomplishment, but also spawn unholy frustrations. If i wanted that, i would just play Darksouls/Elden Ring. I read that the dev himself said this game wasnt made to be fun, and he's right, it really isnt (to play at least).

Qucik Pro and Cons:
P - Survival gameplay loop thats naturally addictive
p - Very detailed car mechanics (especially for the time)
P - Has mods on nexus
P - Though niche, it is the foundation of the genre

C - The sound quality is pretty awful. I thought someone was crashing miles away but it was just me bumping the parts on the table in front of me.
C - Very stiff controls that takes time to get used to (they can be remapped but the extra mouse buttons cant be mapped which was a big deal for me)
C - Absolutely no direction in any capacity
C - Physics can bug out usually in a devastating way.

I could of sat down and just powered through and learned to accept my purchase. But steam thankfully is generous with refunds and my time in Mon Bazou was much more pleasant. This game isnt even a Gig which i now can see why.

 Lastly, the dev is apparently working on ""My Winter Car"" so i would rather see what he has learned with his time spent on MSC and hope it is  all it could be and more.",1681334213,1681334415,False,2,2,0.483123719692230225,0,True,False,True

Ingredients:

6 tablespoons unsalted butter

1/2 cup white sugar

1/2 cup brown sugar

1/4 cup water

1/4 teaspoon cinnamon

1 pinch salt

5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced

1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).

Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.

Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.

Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.

Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.

Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

So to those who see this here is how to drive the tractor and motorbike. So for the tractor you need to first get in it by walking into it like how you walk through the doors of your house. Then you want to enter drive mode you can do this when it says to enter drive mode in the middle of your screen, then once you've done that look for the ""hand throttle"" lever and pull it back just a bit with left mouse. Then look for the ""ignition switch"" which should be right next to it and hold that down with left mouse and at the same time hold W or whatever your throttle hotkey is. Then the RPM meter should start moving then you can let go of W and left mouse and pull the hand throttle all the back the same way you did early. After look for the ""parking brake"" it should be to the left down next to the door then click it to put it in the off position, or when it lowers. After you turn off the brake press G to go into gear 1 then you will start moving because of the ""hand throttle"" which you can raise and lower with left and right mouse buttons till you find a good balance and once you start moving go in front of the trailer then press B twice to start backing up. You want to back into the trailer hitch. When you here a click press G twice to start moving forward again the you can press R to change your range to high to move faster now this mechanic only apples to the tractor and sewage truck. Then you can drive the tractor with a max of 3 gears plus neutral and reverse you have 5 gears its G to raise gear and B to lower on default. The only thing i personally recommend changing is the ""rangefinder"" to ""keypad 9"" instead of R in the controls but that's your choice. 

If you want to use the motorbike you must first turn the ""fuel tap"" to make it be vertical (Up or down is your choice, I recommend down for speed and up for dependency) Then you can hop on the bike and enter drive mode the same way you did the tractor then once you do that move around a bit on the seat till you can use the ""kick starter"" and ""kickstand"" without having to lean over. (Note you will have to repeatedly enter and exit drive mode to do this) Then you want to raise the kickstand and after press the ""kick starter"" till the engine starts working then you want to hold down W while pressing G if you don't your engine is going to shut off. Now you can drive the motorbike which has a max of 4 gears that progressively get better as you cycle through them, also warning i'm a skilled driver (somewhat) in this game and the motor bike has claimed my life 5 times. So be careful on turns, and that's the end of My Summer Car how to drive by Professional Dumbass

""We follow twists and turns, only to find / That it wasn't worth it at all""

My Summer Car is kind of like this - both in a positive and negative way. It is a superb simulation of a tedious and misery-inducing experience where everything is always against you. It is designed to troll the player: you may or may not find this enjoyable. It has no respect for your time. It kind of is funny ... but also kind of dumb.

The general feeling I get from the game is a constant sense of 
""lol wouldn't it be funny if...""
Wouldn't it be funny if the shop was as far as possible from your house, literally on the other side of the map, so that it took 30 real-life minutes to drive there? Wouldn't it be funny if the janky physics engine meant vehicles got stuck in the ground mesh every few minutes? Wouldn't it be funny if the jobs you had to do to get money were really boring and tedious? Wouldn't it be funny if there wasn't an inventory and you had to carry every single object one at a time?

The thing is, it IS kind of funny, to a point. The parody of Finnish rural culture is spot-on and hilarious, right down to the strange ornament someone bought on a holiday in Spain which will live forever inexplicably in the living room. It's funny when you go out to buy some sausages but get knocked off the road because you forgot the rally was on today, or how the only drinks in the game are milk, beer, and water straight from the tap. 

Or when you get to the shop late, just before it closes, but you can't fit everything on your crappy moped, so you have to drive home in the dark, except every time you get on the moped the janky physics ejects all of the cargo, and it's pitch black, and the stuff you bought flew into the trees and is impossible to find, and suddenly it's ... not so funny.

Because there's the real world. We have to do menial stuff every day. We don't get much time to play games. And after a long day of the real world, a challenge can be enjoyable, but this is just ... frustrating.

I built most of the car properly - and I have to say, it is mostly great fun to put the car together and hear it start up for the first time. Still, I ended up using a save editor at points to tighten some bolts and fill up fluids because I couldn't bear the tedium of doing it the ""proper"" way. After tuning the car, I was all ready to go, except to find that the steering is totally off. It's another ""lol wouldn't it be funny if the player had to scroll their mouse 120 times (!) to fix the steering rods"".

Before you buy this game, keep that in mind. The developer does not want you to have fun playing this game. It is expressly designed to be as tedious an experience as possible. It is designed to waste your time and infuriate you, and it's because the developer is an """"""""artist""""""""  who likes to frustrate people in a similar vein to all the dumpster grool that Bennett Foddy squeezes out, like Getting Over It and QWOP: Bad games that try to play off their shitty design as ""quirky personality"" or ""artistic messages"". The developer has gone on record expressly saying that he does not want the game to be fun, so here's my warning to you, in bold;

[b]The developer of this game has gone on record expressly stating that he does not want the game to be fun. It is not fun. Do not buy this game.[/b]

The main problems with this game is that it is both tedious, and unfair; and not the kind that might make the game challenging in a traditional sense, but the kind which should have it removed from the Steam Store, because the game borderline does not function in a playable state. 

For example, this game doesn't save when you sleep, only when you go in the game world to a toilet, which are few and far between in the game world. It can sometimes take upwards of 20 minutes to get to one, so if you have to step away from the computer suddenly, your progress is GONE. You can play for 6 hours, and then have to quit, and if you didn't use one of the toilets to quit then, congratulations! You just lost 6 hours of progress! The insulting thing about this is that the developer could put a functioning save system in the game, but he deliberately does not want to, because he knows about this, and he thinks it's hilarious that people playing his game will lose their progress like this.

Another example is the logistics of the game world; The player's house is at the opposite end of the map from all the stores you need, and the path that you have to take to get there is deliberately long. It will take you upwards of 20 - 30 IN REAL LIFE MINUTES to get to either the town or the repair store every time you need to go there. Your choices of transportation are a slow tractor, and a slower boat. You can't use your car until the late game. You MIGHT get a van, but the van takes upwards of 12 hours of real life gameplay to spawn, and it disappears randomly until several weeks of playing your in-game uncle gives it to you forever. This is another intentional design choice specifically aimed at frustrating and annoying players with no real benefit. This philosophy is best demonstrated by the developer's choice to make the player unable to move any items in bulk; you can't pick up more than one item, so 80% of your time spent playing the game is spent painstakingly taking 1 item at a time from place to place. This is especially bad when you try to use the boat to go grocery shopping; You have to take every individual item you purchased all the way from the grocery store on a 500 meter hike to the dock, put it in the boat, then go back to get the next item. 

The game has been deliberately filled with a lot of little things that together are only added to screw with the player. For example, the train crossings are all heavily obscured by bushes, so you can't actually see the train coming unless you stand on the tracks directly and look -- And if you stop on the tracks, the bad vehicle physics engine will immediately get your vehicle stuck on the tracks and cause your death. The game is also very dedicated to trying to kill your player with fire, as all the heat sources you can use for cooking take up to 5 IRL minutes (which is an hour in game) to get hot enough to start cooking. Yet despite these timeframes, if you look away from them they instantly burn your house down. 

While the car building segment of the game is entertaining, it itself has many large flaws which ultimately ruin the experience. There's no way to tell what the condition of a part is until it breaks, and a broken part is usually not identifiable as broken: The difference between a broken part and a fine one is that the broken one is a slightly darker shade. It's easier to tell when you have other parts to compare with, like the cylinders, but with other things it is impossible. What this means for your gameplay is that the engine will be broken when you build it, and there is no way of knowing why it's broken or what part needs to be replaced without using third party save editors made by modders to view your save file. Furthermore, many of the car attachment parts, such as the exhaust pipe, cannot be attached until you try twice, then restart your game, and then try a third time. And remember, if you didn't use the toilet to save and exit, you just lost your savegame as well! 

Really, the core problem of the game is that you need to perform a lot of different tasks ancillary to building the car before you can actually build it, and these tasks are all a long distance away, and your transportation options take an EXTREMELY long time to get anywhere. So you end up spending 40 minute IRL round trips getting things, frequently having to go back when you need something else for the car, or something goes wrong, etc. And if anything, ANYTHING goes wrong during any of these trips, you make a single mistake, or happen to have to step away from your computer during these trips, you INSTANTLY lose your entire save game and have to start again from the beginning. That's what's wrong with this game. 

And it's because the developer wants it to be like this. He could fix it, but everything I've described above is how he wants the game to be. Do not buy this game.",1652587336,1680849890,False,2,0,0.5152091383934021,0,True,False,True
