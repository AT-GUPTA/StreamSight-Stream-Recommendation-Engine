Like many similar games that support matchmaking, the timers are oppressive when it comes to making fully informed decisions, particularly as a newer player, and particularly when there's so much more to process here than most. There's little hope of me ever touching matchmaking, and I say that as someone who would like to play against more than bots.

But unlike many similar games, it is possible to play Co-Op/Solo vs AI, and some effort has been made to keep this experience varied - at least until you reach an intermediate level of play and have to play against bots with massive +income advantages, which encourages cheesy play to counter. However, the ability to pause the timer freely in PvE makes up for a lot, so long as you're not taking over [strike]an hour[/strike] 90m total to play a game typically meant to take 20-25m. The server will disconnect you with little warning if you're as reliant on pausing as I am and don't know about the [strike]hour[/strike] 90m limit.

There is 90 seconds of setup time, then a game flow of variable time battles -> placement (typically 20-30s, with extra on one specific turn to choose a bonus spell) -> repeat. During this time, one must evaluate how to spend two different-yet-related currencies, evaluate the lanes of other players to know when/how to attack/defend them, and calculate placement locations for an increasingly complex board state, without extra allotted time to do so. In fact, the game's economy is linked to real time, with your primary currency-generating unit generating currency-per-10s. Instead of them generating more over a longer time, they generate faster over the same time in later waves.

If you're not willing to do significant out-of-game study akin to a MOBA or RTS, you'll be at a huge disadvantage when it comes to the timers, and that's if you don't have APM limitations like I do.

So, its only a PvE game for me, but there's enough meat to the PvE that by the time I'm stuck playing against heavily handicapped bots, I'll have gotten my money's worth. And that's fine, but add this to a growing list of games I wish I could play PvP in that aren't tailored to slower play.",1706497590,1707232165,True,2,0,0.53820490837097168,0,True,False,False

UPDATE 2023 ; since a few patch i have a app hang problem : no crash nothing app just hang at starting screen. i was playing it well before . 
i send all report  i can to devs (debugger, process activation list in order when exe start etc etc .... dll called list etc ... ) event report everything i can . 
but they put nearly zero effort to help and say it is my computer . 
all other unity game works . all games i own works (+600) 
debugger say maybe a loop somechere in code . i even found dev forum with similar issue and solution but with no effort from them they just say it is my computer and now i have a useless game ! 

Please be aware : in case of problem you are alone ; tjhey will not really try to help you but just act like they will : send you faq and never help to even digg a bug in his code. 

i have a gae i can not refund and that i can not play . HO YEEEEEEEEEEE

so after many month of investigation it ended that they use old legacy plugin for the game . they have no access to it . so nobody can help cause the problem come from one of those plugin . so they can not investigate and cause we are not enough to report the problem they leave you like that and they don't really care . you can not even obtain a refund even if i buy right at start of the game to help them and support them ! 

amazing ........ 1st time of my all +400 games i own that i encounter such a problem to not being able to play a game i buy . 

WOOOOOW

update 2024 : i am still stuck at 1st loading screen no matter what i try ... i still try to digg out the problem",1514593289,1707183479,False,1,0,0.50563204288482666,0,True,False,True

This game has an insane amount of depth and keeps me wanting to play more. There are so many things to manage and keep an eye on that the game never feels boring. The devs are also super active and constantly trying to improve the game. 

I like to compare the knowledge aspect of this game to Starcraft 2. I've always wanted to play Starcraft 2, but the sheer amount of information needed is so intimidating that I didn't have the drive to pick it up. LTD2 has a nice balance in that regard. You will have to work at this game if you want to keep playing. Luckily, the community is very welcoming and always ready to help new players out. The casual game mode is also a lot of fun and a good way to get a feel for the units/mechanics. They have comprehensive charts and graphs of every aspect of the game so you're able to go back and review why the game turned out how it did. There is certainly a learning curve, but if you can get past that you'll feel yourself improving each match. 

If you're looking for a strategy game that will take some studying but not so much that it's intimidating, I'd highly recommend giving LTD2 a chance.",1644027151,1707172347,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'll start with the gameplay, all the units have their specific purpose in the game and while RNG appears in various aspects of the game (not only what units you get to use for a match but also things like AoE having random secondary targets) you have control of your lane and your placement and economic decisions will always be the most impactful factor in how the game turns out.
The UI looks very clean and there are tons of tools for learning more about the mechanics with statistics and metrics that measure your gamestyle (do you play agressive and try to leak ennemies or do you focus on income and holding for example).

In terms of the community, the devs are awesome the game is regularly updated/patched with both new content and balance changes, the in-game shop is purely cosmetic and provides no gameplay advantage and you can easily earn both the free currency and paid currency by playing the game (joining a guild helps with the paid currency). What I like the most is that they're actively trying to improve the game and involve the community.
Some players complain about toxicity and bad apples do exist but I rarely find anyone with malicious intent. There are pings that facilitate strategizing with your teammate without having to type so language barriers are not a problem.

I have a lot of fond memories and nostalgia for those old days. I love to see concepts from those days updated and evolved over time! I always thought, when I was a kid, that those custom games were super sophisticated and fun, and it's nice to see that even as adults and as an independent game, this complex and rewarding game is continuing to evolve and entertain thousands of people across the world.

I think some of the updates from the original are amazing, and I'll outline them below:
- Different game modes can be accessed in the lobby, which is obviously a major UI improvement over the original mod.
- The graphics and models are also a lot better than the old mod
- The game is as new player friendly as it could possibly be, given how punishing this game can be for new players. There are prompts suggesting which units to buy, auto-send, roll recommendations, and more that make it easy for new and returning players to pick it back up.

Generally, I'm just impressed with the continued development for this game. I wish that more devs from those devs would come back to make their own games.

I get make it challenging, but cmon.

also not everyone enjoys ranked games against strangers.


*EDIT IN RESPONSE TO DEVELOPER*

First and foremost, thank you for stating that the bots do in fact cheat. If I am understanding you correctly, your intent on anything platinum and below is for not cheating, however it randomly can send you over 1500 mythium (even if they only saved only 1 round, when they do actually save) after sending 500+ just to wipe you out and prevent you from winning. This can happen on several rounds after level 13 when *I* have more workers than they do and cant even send the amounts they are, even if I saved. This is very random, and consistent to happen weekly and on multiple rounds.

I find it amazing how every day the game play is different (love that honestly), however one thing has remained; playing platinum and below games with bots the math still isnt mathing with how much they send vs the workers they have to me.

its very very unbalanced and saying that platinum/gold doesn't cheat is unbelievably false, because of the math. 

I have a love hate relationship with this game, but I will say I absolutely hate the change in the mastermind ""reroll"" just let us pick our teams as a mastermind; not one or two locked in.

Just wanted to add, I just played a platinum round, added up the thousands of mythium that was sent per round, and compared it to the end game results with the mythium amount vs workers they had and they sent me MORE than what they actually made. So, again, platinum not being intended to cheat is all good, however it is cheating.",1702386942,1704914903,False,13,3,0.568983793258666992,0,True,False,False

- No working MM or Balance System
- brainless stats, rank and pointsystem, forcing lone wolf instead of teamplay
- Skill (Rank) depending onto Lose/Win (game mechanics, team play etc. completely ignored for ranks)
- They´re ignoring Community Feedback
- They´re ignoring issues
- 80% Griefer, Troll, Toxic mates
- no Balancing (they force new META with every Patch but no base balancing tweaked)


This is a self destroying game. I dont think it will least long, for the most players. It will become one of those Hardcore try harder games.

It honors only the Hardcore players. Average and new players get wrecked, while the new players, trolls, griefers and toxics destroy the Ranks and Games of the Average players and the average players just get punished for loosing with them. (and when you loose you will get matched with more abusive ppl. in your team and so on... it is a hell trap)

Again it DOES NOT matter how good you are. You can make your opponent leak 11x and hit the enemy King for 50% and get MVP in the end - you get punished when your mates arent good enough.

The new Updates in 2022 drops the option to play your own playstyle. You just have to behave and play like .... a BOT. Always the same standard stuff.

Imagine a tower defense game with the attention span of a goldfish and the strategic depth of a black hole. That's Legion TD. Matches are shorter than a TikTok dance, meaning you can squeeze them in between loading screens, bathroom breaks, and existential breakdowns. Perfect for filling those awkward silences in your Discord calls when everyone's pretending to be AFK.

Here's the deal: you plop down towers, they shoot stuff, you win (or cry, depending on your opponent's RNG). It's about as simple as tying your shoes, except with less frustration and fewer laces to trip over. But don't let the ease fool you. This game has more layers than an ogre's onion, with enough unit combinations and strategies to keep even the most jaded tower defense veteran entertained.

Plus, it's the size of a hamster on a diet. Takes up barely any space on your hard drive, which is crucial in these days of AAA games that require you to mortgage your firstborn just to download. This bad boy runs on a potato powered by hopes and dreams.

Pros:

Matches shorter than your attention span: Perfect for the ADHD gamer in all of us.
Easy to learn, hard to master: Starts simple, then kicks you in the shins with strategic depth.
Fills those awkward gaming lulls: Like a digital fidget spinner, but with more explosions.
Tiny download size: Doesn't hog your precious storage space.
Community surprisingly chill: No screaming kids or salty tears, just good ol' fashioned tower defense smackdown.
Cons:

RNG can be a brutal mistress: Sometimes the dice hate you, and that's okay. Just blame the dice, not your lack of skill (like I do).
Learning curve can be steep: Don't expect to be a tower defence Einstein overnight. Be prepared to get stomped... a lot.
Can be addictive: Just one more match, I swear...
Overall: Legion TD is like a delicious slice of pizza: quick, satisfying, and leaves you wanting more. It's not gourmet, but it hits the spot every time. So go forth, ye brave tower defenders, and conquer those waves (or die trying). Just remember, the only thing smaller than the download size is your margin for error.

Edit 2: The balancing issues remain glaring and continue to get worse as the game rewards mindless strategies. Reached 2260 ELO and the most prominent thing to do is eco every wave. Not to mention the terrible targeting consistency.

3rd Edit: You'll have those usual American-centric fans who blame players from other countries (with fast connections) running into server issues. Then there are also trolls who cherry pick issues while insulting others who bring up valid criticisms.

If you are interested about the why you may read on. Regargless though, you will need some further videos from youtube or elsewhere if u want to get into the pvp aspect too.

So then... can we talk about the god awful descision to make hard modes have god rolls every single time? The tutorial teaches you nothing about how to deal with the campaign, the balance bar of ""you got enough fighters, build workers"" doesn't work in 9 out of 10 waves even with type advantage and the player advice popping up on the side is absolutely worthless. So what I've over/underbuilt, I didn't have fighters with the perfect cost for wave 1&2.

""Build fighters when the enemy is saving myselium"" when monkey doesn't want to build in the first waves. Let me just pluck gold out of my own butthole when I can not have gained any scaling yet.

""Enemy is weak on wave a, b, c and d"" yeah sure, so very weak that he clears 100% even when I do save up to send big big type advantage over jacks units all match. God what a waste of my time to even attempt this.

""15 minutes efficient"" tutorial - yeah, except you gotta go on youtube after to get any meaningful ideas on how to comp or ecnomy 'cuz putting tanks in front and listening to your green income bar does nothing. Even! Looking at old guides. They are outdated and as comments say do not work anymore for campaign. If you balance your game to death then at least make sure your AI is still beatable without looking at a tierlist of currently busted units and restarting mastermind until you got them in your team.

""Don't do ranked! We recommend you do camapigns first!"" Only thing tutorial and campaign is teaching me is how to alt F4 and never return to this game. And going into ranked?

In Classic, you can opt/vote for Income and Chill every game, which of course everyone votes for every time.. this 'bonus' to the Classic mode forces you to spend all your mythium every round and then you receive bonus gold. They recently added Bankers which benefit from that particular game mode by an inordinate amount - specifically because of this ""income and chill"" functionality. Bankers are fine in ranked mode, since Income and Chill doesn't exist there,  because you can save up at least one extra round and then send a reasonable force to wipe them, but with Income and Chill turned on that forces you to spend all your mythium each round or else miss out on the extra gold. The reasonable DPS and gold income from bankers sets off a snowball effect where they basically determine the winner of the game if a player on the other team knows how to exploit bankers in Classic. The more bankers you build, the more income you receive every round and you get decent DPS along with them the more you build. In order to mitigate this, the opposing player needs to wipe your defenses and kill off the bankers at least once every few rounds. Unfortunately in order to do this you would have to turn off Auto and save for at least one round or more - and sacrifice getting the gold rush bonus every round you do that.
The other reason for the thumbs down is that the game play becomes stale very quickly in Classic for casual players. Every game is just deciding when to send as a group on level 21 or 22, sometimes people try level 20. That's it. Building cool combinations of units is interesting but ultimately has no effect on the Classic end game since it's just about everyone picking a level and sending everything at the same time. 
So unfortunately, as a casual player who has played the game for lots of hours I can say the end result is very mid and they don't seem to be doing anything about improving Classic mode or making it more interesting. They introduce new units and even though people complain about the new units being broken in Classic they won't fix it since they seem to focus on their ranked and hardcore players who don't see any problem with the new units since those players don't bother with Classic.
Lastly, the UI is sluggish and quite often when you stop your mouse over something it won't show the tooltip - until you slightly move the mouse again. The game takes tons of CPU and GPU power for being a relatively simple game. I have a 13th gen i7 and RX6600 GPU that plays MW3 fine and can tab in and out easily, but Legion TD 2 bogs down the entire system if you try to do other things while playing..",1701521353,1701522556,False,13,0,0.636400818824768066,0,True,False,False

PREP TIME: 15 minutes

COOK TIME: 20 minutes

COURSE: Appetizer, canape, starter

CUISINE: British

SERVINGS: 4 people

CALORIES: 281 kcal

INGREDIENTS

155 g panko breadcrumbs
1 teaspoon garlic powder
½ teaspoon onion powder
½ tsp smoked paprika
sea salt
black pepper
2 eggs beaten
55 g flour
20 button mushrooms approx 350g
2 teaspoon olive oil

Quick Chive Dip:
2 teaspoon cream cheese
1 tablespoon plain Greek yogurt
½ tablespoon chopped chives
black pepper

INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat the oven to 200˚C/ 392˚F
2. Drizzle ½ teaspoon olive oil over a baking tray and spread it out with a piece of kitchen towel.
3. Tip the flour onto a plate or shallow dish.
4. Whisk the eggs in a shallow dish.
5. In a shallow dish or plate mix the panko breadcrumbs with the garlic and onion powders and season with salt and pepper.
6. Wipe the mushrooms with a damp cloth or piece of paper towel to clean. Make sure the mushrooms are dry.
7. I find it easier to do the mushrooms in 4 batches - take 5 mushrooms and roll them in the flour, then egg, then the breadcrumbs, coating thoroughly with each.
8. Place the breaded mushrooms on the greased tray and repeat with other batches of mushrooms until all are coated.
9. Spray the mushrooms with a little olive oil - if you don't have an oil spray then drizzle from a teaspoon slowly over the mushrooms - and place in the oven.
10. Turn after 10 minutes and spray with a little more olive oil if they are looking dry.
11. Cook for another 10 minutes until they are deep golden and crispy.
12. Serve straight away.

To make the Chive dip:
1. Mix everything together in a bowl and season to taste.

To think that the same ingenious minds, who were just high school students back then, have returned to give us this sequel is nothing short of remarkable. Even in their early days, they showcased an uncanny ability for game design, gifting us with intricate strategies and gameplay mechanics that captivated us for hours on end.

Fast forward to today, and Legion TD2 stands not just as a continuation, but as a masterfully refined evolution of its predecessor. Everything that made the original so captivating is here, but now it's enhanced, polished, and honed to perfection. This isn't just a revamp; it's a complete reimagining that maintains the core game loop while adding layers of depth and polish.

Visually and mechanically, every aspect feels smoother and sharper. However, what truly stands out is how welcoming Legion TD2 is to newcomers. The game seamlessly guides players, offering an ""easy to learn"" approach, but beneath that inviting exterior lies a depth that promises a ""hard to master"" challenge for those who crave it. Both veterans and beginners will find themselves immersed, with strategies, challenges, and thrills catering to every level of player expertise.

For the loyal fans, Legion TD2 serves as a heartfelt journey down memory lane. For newcomers, it's a warm welcome into a world that's been crafted with passion, love, and an intrinsic understanding of what makes strategy games so alluring.

Still as laggy, freezy and stuttery as first day. It's not your system/internet, it's the game code.

Updated review : 
As soon as you tab out from this game, some IO fuckery happens and stuttering begins. When a wave ends and building phase begins you get extreme freezes. Different system this time. not on Wifi. Lowest settings with overkill specs and limited FPS.

As fun as it is, the backend of this game is suboptimal. Warcraft 3, a game from 2 decades ago did it better.


Quality verification team for this game are the monkeys on banana heaven. They're just mashing the button that says ""yes, passable patch, there's no gamebreaking bugs in there""

[h1]The Bad[/h1] 
[b]*[/b] Freezing issues that last anywhere from 2 seconds to 40 seconds. Absolutely unplayable.I'm not exaggerating, I clocked it.  The game is 100% unresponsive and windows is ready to shut it down.
Some might say this is my system, not game's fault, but this only began to happen after a patch 2 weeks ago and I looked into every possible cause from my side but I can run every game just fine (EA Battlefront 2, csgo etc.) my specs are at the bottom. My friend also experienced a milder version of this.


[b]*[/b] Odd bugs, such as the ability to pick wave 10 skill reward on WAVE 1. This happened to me in a ranked match, thankfully it didn't actually let apply the ability on my units, but on wave 10 I didn't get to pick anything, basically handicapping me.

[b]*[/b] Toxic community. Now there are exceptions if you're playing in canadian timezone (duh) but generally speaking your teammate will screw up their gameplay and it'll all be your fault because you didn't do their bidding. People just can't take the blame. They're not nice to newcomers either. This is especially bad because it's a teamwork game and to win you MUST communicate but so many people will tilt, point fingers and whine instead of try to win.

[b]*[/b]  B R U T E  Imagine this, you're protecting the king as well as you've been protecting your virginity. Suddenly, 2 brutes appear on your melee attack wave. EVERY ENEMY, except the BRUTE gets targeted and your last few units are destroyed by the green chad. This boils down to units not prioritizing between targets. Warcraft 3 also had this, but it atleast targeted lowest HP unit. So brute would be prioritized after a certain wave there. Meanwhile this game's targeting system is as follows : ""TARGET ANYTHING BUT THE BRUTE""

[b]*[/b] Fighter value system : Very poor indicator of your teammate's ability to hold the wave. When calculating your fighter value the game takes into account your damage/shield types and gives you a decent value you ""should"" reach but it's a very primal indicator that's often misleading. If it wasn't there at all and people manually kept track of sends everyone would be more aware.

[b]*[/b]  The bots. Maybe you don't intend to play against bots, but the game has co-op and every single bot in this game is dogshite. Need I mention if you disconnect you get replaced by a bot until you return? There's around 6 difficulties and the first 2 makes you yawn even if you're new to gaming in general. The 3rd aka medium is serviceable. The 4th and the rest is absolute destruction. There's no balance here and the difficulty should be a lot more gradual than this. The bots are also predictable in their building and mercenary patterns.

[h1]The good[/h1]
[b]*[/b] It's legion TD, I guess? Good game to play as quick distraction as every game takes around 30 minutes or less. UI is good and more newbie friendly than warcraft 3's but that doesn't say much for 2 decades old game comparison.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
The game is decent, but its bugs and toxic players  might ruin your fun. They don't have an effective solution to this and I've teammates leave as early as 1 minute into the game. This game WILL test your patience for all the wrong reasons.

Like Dota 2, this games balance changes are absurd. They make something OP and everyone in ranked will play that one unit for every match until its nerfed. They really don't test their balance changes well enough.

Don't buy full price unless you're desperate for it. In its current state, it doesn't deserve full price.",1618360188,1700799295,False,4,1,0.524494946002960205,0,True,False,False

Like Dota 2, Legions TD 2 started as a Warcraft custom game and from there expanded to a standalone release, and despite not having the large financial backing of Valve, the quality of Legions TD 2 is just as good as Dota 2. The game runs wonderfully, the UI is easy to tell what's going on despite being a fairly data heavy game, and even the post game infographics really helps you to get a sense of how you played and why you won/lost. 

[h2]The Good[/h2]
It's extremely easy to pick up and play. PVP consists of you putting down a tower and then sending mercenaries to your opponent's lane as they'll be doing the same to you. From there you develop an economy and place more towers and send more mercenaries to your opponenent. This continues the mercenaries break through either yours or your opponent's towers and then attack the king at the end of the lane. Once the king's HP drops to zero, it's game over. Simple right?

[h2]The Bad[/h2]
The single player campaign is fun, but lord is it tough on the hard difficulties. You pretty much have to resort to some sort of cheese tactics to beat the ai on hard. From what I understand, a large part of this is due to the constant balance patches which tweaked some of the single player missions into absurd territory. 

[h2]The Summary[/h2]
Legions TD 2 is a hell of a fun experience. There's a real sense of personal knowledge progression the more game you play as you develop ways to optimize the placement of your towers, when to send mercenaries to your opponent, and which boons and bonuses to take as the game progresses.

Basically, you build an army that comes to life when each wave begins. You ration some gold to hire workers, who gather mythium, while building towers. Use the mythium to send monsters at your enemy, increasing the chance of their defenses failing that wave. This ensures that if they spend too much money on gem production, you will make them leak. It comes in 2v2 and 4v4 modes. After you clear the wave, your towers teleport to a spot standing in front of your king, until everyone clears the wave. If an ally leaks, your towers attempt to prevent them from reaching your king. Enemies gain gold from monsters leaked on opponent's side. 
 You can also spend mythium to upgrade your king, increasing their ability to survive when reached by leaks. The ultimate objective is to increase your mythium production, allowing for bigger offensive sends to your opponents, causing them to leak, defeating their king.
A wide variety of ""perks"" to choose 1 of at the start of each match. different perks added after wave 10. The game has a wide variety of towers, receiving a different set every match. Each tower has a different attack/defense type. These matter as each wave has a different attack/defense type, and they each have their strength/weaknesses. for example pierce does 85% damage to fortified armor, but 120% to swift armor.
 Highly recommend the game. Devs are very active and open to feedback. Can see them in game and friendly, as well as on discord and forums. Regular updates modifying towers based off of usage/win rate. if towers arent being used often by the general population, they will get a slight upgrade to increase frequency of use. If a tower is chosen too often, with a high win rate, they will give it a slight nerf to balance it out. this is then monitored to see if the tweak needs adjusting.

Simple to start and learn TD type game where your 'towers' come alive to battle with waves of enemies. 

There are different type of damage and armour for all units, and your job is to find the perfect balance between those to clear all waves.

PVP is based on sending mercenaries to the enemy lane, but you need to monitor and cohort with your team on which wave they are weak to break their defences and kill their king. All leaks go to kill the king(that you can upgrade)

Game is well balanced and the playability is endless due to various possible builds. Downside is that they currently only have 21 fix waves (after wave 20 units are the same but stronger every wave) and 2 different modes (2v2 and 4v4).

Legion is at it's heart a resource management game, but it resembles a real-time chess match or heads up poker game at the higher levels of play. The number of combinations of units you can use and the number of opening strategies you can employ are virtually limitless, and very fun to play around with. That said, I am continually impressed just how viable different playstyles are! You can approach this game so many different ways and still find success, as long as you're communicative and cooperative.

The devs are extremely attentive to the community, and continuously patching the game for balance and adding new units to explore. On that note, the community is international in scope, and on the whole very friendly. To be successful at a cooperative game in which you really depend on your partner, you really have to be a team player, and it's good that most folks are. I am impressed that the devs are committed to holding free prize tourneys every month that are open to all players, and because of the tiered system, everyone, even newer players, have a chance to win their bracket's cup.

11/12/23 Update - I have noticed drastically less chain rerolling of griefers, etc. Because of that and their continuing honoring of regular updates and community interaction, I am flipping this back to recommend.

So, you have to go into this with far more of an auto-chess mindset than a TD one. If you are looking for that classic WCII:ROC mod game type, this is not for you. You don't have lanes in the classic sense, and the odds of things hitting and the order is chaotic to say the least. If you invest significant time in the minor nuances (unit movespeed per round, the assumed ""melee"" range vs melee range, etc.) there is a universe of a game here. Is it worth shoveling a couple hundred games of potential shit to uncover it? Maybe!

I DO NOT recommend ranked play. Simply because there are SO many problems with this game that I honestly don't know where to begin. I guess, WILDLY INCONSISTENT gameplay mechanics sums up most of it. Along with technical issues with matchmaking + elo system.

It's literally just a game. You're gonna be alright. Anyway, these are high rank players, gold and above, so they've 100% been around long enough to be toxic many times before, but I guess the ""report"" function in this game is just there to look nice while serving no real purpose. BTW there is no real casual mode in this game. 

Fortunately, usually the games are chill enough to be fun. HOWEVER- for some reason, the game will randomly crash out of nowhere after an extended period of playtime. This crashing is especially bad on classic mode, where it will permanently lock you out of building with your teammate and just instantly destroy the match for you. WHY is such a bug still in this game? I have literally never had this problem with any of the hundreds of games I've played before. Even if they couldn't fix the crashing for whatever reason, they should have at least fixed the classic mode reconnect bug, but nope, it's still there, and has happened to multiple people I've played with, including myself. 

Game-breaking bugs, toxic community at higher levels. Unfortunately, while this game can be very fun at times, I can't recommend it.

I have been playing strategy games and Turret Defense games in particular for a long time, 20+ years. This game is extremely simple in that once you learn how to win you can win every time BUT there is no alternative way to win. There is no different strategy that works. 

However I think the thing I like least about this game is that it's a money grab. For $23 if you paid full price you get an extremely short campaign with little replay ability and if you want any other campaigns you have to pay for the DLCs but the DLC is just as bad. This game counts on you wanting to play PvP or else you will be done and over this game in about 6 hours.  Oh and btw, if you do want some options for your avatar or other embellishments they try to force you to pay. How? The game gives you very little for free. For hours of playing you will get enough currency to most likely get a fragment. Oh which you need 10 to get anything but most likely the thing you get will not be something you want.

Honestly one if the best games i have ever played, the game is super fun. There are so many interesting strategies in the game and the devs frequently listen to the players and constantly comes out with improvements unlike some other games... (Looking at you Overwatch). The concept and the game itself is pretty easy to understand, but if you want to climb the ranks it gets more and more strategic and challenging. Having a perfect game is the best feeling ever. Getting a perfect split is just beautiful. (Splitting is a technique in the game where you split the damage from the wave across multiple units)",1696945352,1696945352,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros: It's a unique spin on tower defense or strategy games. It's a great second monitor game while working.

Pros:
- Years after release they keep adding new units, skins etc.
- Microtransactions are purely cosmetic

Cons:
- Occasional performance issues
- 4v4 is degenerate queue now
- Hybrid is banned in 2v2 ranked
- Autosend takes away half the game and rather than fixing it they basically force you to do it

It used to be a flexible game where the player gets to build various combinations and worry about the economy, now ever since the unit ""dwarf banker"" has been introduced people just spam it the whole time and use it every single game of 4vs4 (which is the default unranked game mode used for relaxing). Put the dwarf banker, forget about the miners you dont even need them til later, spam that one unit and use some tanks, just use whatever, and that's it, you win. Unless both teams use the same strategy then it becomes a closer match).

Either sweat in ranked, the gameplay there is fine, bankers are risky there because the playstyle is much more agressive, not for them; or play the 4vs4 game mode but everytime you face the same identical strategy which gets boring, at least to me.

BUT!
My friend was playing a lot this week and he gets banned every time he is doing some cool things, even if he solo winned a match due to supports or devs don't understand that if he got 18k networth instead of 10k from guides, but plays agressive and got reported from guide-reading noobs - it is solo play against 5+ guys and false-positive reports from noobs.
So he is banned right now for 34 hours for real play and real deep dive into game mechanics.

Not rewarding at all! Game needs improvements in devs or supports team. Impossible to play if you are not guide-turned useless dog :(

The only info is generally how different units work individually. There isn't any in depth guide about mastermind and what makes for a good pick over a bad pick. It also seems that you're punished for not going mastermind via testing with other factions. Which makes me wonder why even offer factions? The game doesn't feel balanced around factions but individual units so it's completely pointless to have factions other then flavor. 
The game is fun but the amount of effort and time it would take to enjoy the game just doesn't feel worth it especially when what info I'm lacking isn't available. Why do some units perform better when placed just one square over? No idea. 

To summarize if it's your game or type of game or if you played the original then I think it's for you. If you're new to this style of game I can't recommend unless you're willing to spend hours and hours just learning the game before you get to start enjoying the game. Having to spend 15 hours just even figuring out how to properly play the game makes, in my opinion, for bad game design.

I enjoyed it since times of Warcraft 3 mod.
I personally would like the game to have x5 mode, but that's fine. 
It is obvious that the developers are monitoring the game and improving it over time.

Now, why I don't recommend this game:
its infested with russians, really INFESTED. Like every 2 or 3 games one of ""them"" is in my team. Not even counting when ""they"" in opposite team.
The last drop for me was when i decided to post suggestion in official Discord for banning russian and belarusian players.
And response was something like: oh stop this xenophobia towards poor little russians, they just victims of the regime and bla bla bla. And, of course, they muted me)

So this game is endorsing russians with all theirs well documented war crimes and taking pride on it.

I get it, even Steam itself didnt ban ""them'' but i really didnt expected answer of poor little russians, they just victims of the regime.

It's really sad because the game itself is really cool.

I think the game shines as a PvP thing, where you get dynamic back and forth.  I'm not sure why you would play this over a MOBA though, but at least it's not instantly stale and predictable.

PVE wise, the first couple hours of free trial suckered me into buying the game, but the following 1.5h just left me uninterested (20 minutes beyond the refund window :P).  The campaigns are basically just fixed puzzles which can't be solved with every faction. So you can basically grab a guide, pick the best faction for each challenge, and complete it without thinking.  Or you can just do trial and error until you find something that works.  If do what I did and try to stick to one faction throughout the campaign, you basically hit a wall at some point... that wall simply evaporates when you pick the ""right faction for the challenge""... disappointing.

Skill is expressed in the game in a variety of ways that are ingrained in the fundamentals of the game in a way that no other strategy games have been able to do.

It doesn't need to refresh sets, or release expansions of units to keep the game fresh, because the game isn't just the units in the same way that other strategy games are the units, or the cards. And as a result, you don't have to spend money on the latest cards, you don't have to re-learn the entire meta every 3-6 months, or when you return to the game after a hiatus. 

You aren't 'playing the units' like you'd 'play set X', or 'play X expansion' of other games. You're just... playing the game, and using the units in different ways every single game. You can come back to the game time and time again and have just as much fun and be able to showcase your skill just as much without having to spend a day learning the current meta.

Great alternative to ""Tropical Tower Wars"" - its almost the same without the TD mazing part (wheres my W3 TTW crew at?! :P)

+ Nice graphics
+ Very smooth gameplay
+ Rly easy 2 get into but requires tactics and skill to get rly good
+ Very nicely balanced
+ The right amount of build defense, buy workers and send attack waves
+ Short tutorials to learn 2 play (~10mins to complete all)
+ Multiple game modes
+ Campaign and AI to get to know the units and improve so u can face real ppl (or those hard AI levels)
+- Campaign on hard is sometimes a great challenge to improve but sometimes (last 3 fights) its a cheap cheat where u have 2 rely on special tactics that u will probs never use in ranked cos ppl won't cheat like the game did on hard xD
- Dlc with a new campaign (1 campaign was enough noone needed a paid DLC for another one, spec since this is a MP game. Fear a 2nd DLC is coming cos a 3rd campaign is ""coming soon"") - can rly be ignored unless ur achiv hunter
+- At first the game can be a bit overwhelming as u have to learn tons of units in order to compete (8 races with 6 units + upgrades + in ranked u play 'mastermind' which gets random units). Usually not a problem since most players will try the campaign or VS AI to try the game before playing MP
+ Very nice credits screen/POP up

Based on the very simple premise of: protect your king and kill the enemies' king. Build fighters in your lane to defend enemy waves that get stronger and stronger and hire mercenaries to attack your lane opponent. On top of that coordination with your team mate is key to winning so the game really shines when playing 2v2 with a friend.

While the basic concept is relatively easy to learn and understand the game gets incredibly complex and tactical very fast and no two games will be the same. But if you are into that kind of niche this game really ticks all the boxes. You will either love this game or simply hate it.

Which also leads to one of the bigger downsides: The player base is relatively small resulting in the usual problems for multiplayer ranked games. The skill range in match making can be pretty big to make sure queue times are not too long. Since I only play 2v2 with a friend I only get flamed occasionally by my team mate (joking) but I imagine coordinating with a random team mate can be a tad frustrating sometimes.

Devs are generally pretty active with balancing patches and communicate updates and their plans for the game regularly.

So after having played for over 200 hours Legion TD 2 has not become boring one bit and definitely keeps feeling fresh. If you are into this kind of genre you should definitely give it a go.

UPDATED: 
November / 2021
November / 2022
May / 2023
Game is fantastic for a LANE semi auto-battler.
""Semi"" as defense unit placement is just as important as unit level or unit type.
Units that mesh together to create strength is a must as knowing what to level or when.

Teamwork in any team play style is a must! 
No, you smart a$$, 1 versus 1 clearly there is no teamwork, but we are sure that you will be wishing you had a teammate.

If you build, and place, with no reason, method, or wit to learn the game, you will lose many many times, and begin to falsely hate it. 
Better yet, rage, claim it is not balanced, broken, cheaters... which would all be completely wrong. This team is very active in all aspects. Freaking cool actually.

There is method, a process, and its always changing with new units, unit improvements that are constantly monitored, and human change of tactics, let alone, many game variations.

ONCE AGAIN, THIS IS NOT AUTO CHESS, NOTHING LIKE IT.

This is a lane auto-semi-battler. What does this mean?

Its one, two, or four lanes.
Place Units, Upgrade Units, Send Units.
The lanes are occupied in a one versus one, two versus two or four versus four lane ratio.
The object is simple;
1. Do not leak, or invest in pampers.
2. Make your enemy leak, perhaps, offer them some pampers.
3. Grow workers to create bonus income for each wave.
4. Keep your King alive longer and buff your King too, its ""Good to be the King"".

So many people say ""Oh, this is or sounds boring"", until you lose 20 in a row and are angry.
Then the ""boring"" turns into prior stated, rage of imbalance, scream in cheaters, and then start watching videos on how to play while trolling and rage venting, all for nothing.

The growing process continues with a ""light-bulb"" that actually comes to life in ones head, proving everything we have written here, is true and rage is foolish judgement.

NOTE TO EVERY PLAYER;
You don't know it all, won't know it all, and after 1800 hours of play time, I am only Platinum level player and one with years of experience. 
The best in the game have played 3000 hours and upwards.

To put it in scope, that is only the third level in the seven levels there are.
So take it from 1800 hours of play time, its not a grind, its how much time you learn mastering and learning from mistakes of others and your own.

In my case, as I am a visual learner and do not excel in reading, playing with trial and error.
My learning style I was born with, a slow process, but its gets steady results and improves like fine wine over time. 
(ADD or ADHD users, will understand a bit more perhaps) 
There is no sprint to the finish here. 
""Slow and steady, wits at the ready.""- ab

IN CLOSING;
Not all YouTube® videos are current, many game changes monthly, super balanced and active small team. 
MOST YouTube® videos are not good advice or guidance, playing is the only way. 
Videos only good for tips.
Most videos are outdated, or just made by players who think they are good, and just are desperate for content. Many of the videos, the game mechanics have been completely changed or improved.
There is only two or three players worth learning from, and they do not stream.
Play, play, play and challenge yourself.

Good luck, have fun, as losing is a must, even close games.
You will win some too and spoil overconfident foes. 
Wear a hat if you will be prone to pulling hair out, otherwise welcome to the bald club.

Its the best feeling in the world to watch your opponent not leak the entire game, over-send extra units to me every wave and be cocky, then you suddenly smoke em' because they did not build defense, are ranked higher, and I played smarter. Makes the ten prior losses that much more tolerable. Get In here already!

Tip: 
""Leaking"" around here... is NORMAL as it is inevitable. 
DO NOT make a habit of it, because it gets harder on your mates, even if you are in a Fiesta build where leaking pays you more each wave, still can hurt your team if done without coordination.

Teamwork is strongly encouraged, in a diplomatic, majority vote, play style.

Dictators DO NOT do well at all in this game. Try to tell anyone what to do, and you get less cooperation. Since bully dictators do not get it, they will rage themselves right out the door.
Many dictators will rage in chat because they can't accept this fact and attempt to force their will, futile as it is, just to ruin their bonus, behavior score, and quit. 
No worries, they will then make a new account in shame, just to do the same.
The ""Does Not Play well w/ Others"" achievement does not exist yet, we lobbied for it to tag all bully accounts, but its still in production or deep thought.

So be a good teammate, as choices are by majority vote in team games, and with fast discussion, plain and simple. 

Yes, you will get the occasional AFK and those who disconnect. Don't forget the rage quitters in team formats from time to time, but don't worry!!
They have hardware for them too and they wont be around for long when its a habit and the developers do monitor it and have closely monitored it for two years.
If you do not wish to team play, then play one versus one or the campaign and save your access to the game. There are no cheats for this game, so any you may find are scams.

Definitely worth picking up if you enjoy trying out tons of different strategies. GREAT game if you have a duo queue partner to mess around with, but not required by any means.

While the learning curve is steep, the sandbox mode and statistics breakdowns are very well made. They aren't required by any means either - if you are fine with losing some games, you can get started in competitive play quickly, and learn by doing.

Your opponents totally creamed you? The post-match breakdown lets you view 10+ different graphs of statistics, plus each players' build on every single wave. This means you can understand and put together WHY you lost way better than any other tactics game I've played. You can even copy and try out the opponent's strategy in your next game to get a handle on it - maybe it's actually op, or maybe there are weaknesses you didn't know until you played it.

5/10 Perfectly acceptable game without a ton of competition. That is to say I would give serious consideration to playing something else should it become available. I tried Dota Underlords for a bit, but that game feels like its dead for some reason. I started with this franchise in Starcraft 2's arcade mode. Which, in my opinion, was a better game. There was just more you could do. Plus. I loved the Nature builder and almost nothing from that builder found its way into this game. 

Pros:
-Decent strategical layers: 4 types of offense and defense, decent combinations. 2 game modes. Varied ranges and conditions. I.e. Flying units decreasing crowding and switching up targeting priorities.

-Graphics and sound: They are clean and fun. Solid U.I. 

-Campaign mode: Fairly challenging while highlighting key aspects of game play.

-Bots: Where I spend the majority of my time. I went 10-0 in my ranked placements (check my achieves, hard carry.) Then my next 2 games I had a bronze teammate vs a gold and plat player. I had a teammate underbuild only using one type of unit placed very poorly. He leaked 60% or more on the first 4 waves while asking me to leak to feed his units. Even though I declined to leak we lost by wave 7. In ranked. Its a waste of time unless you want to babysit your teammates. Luckily the bots are well tuned and allow you to explore the game at your own pace.

The Cons-

Updates: Game has very little direction going forward. They love releasing broken towers that don't fit well into the game and end up scaling them back. Cough. And the also will completely destroy a towers functionality on a whim. Because they are literally that clueless and they want to dumb their game down to increase their player base. Cough, cough. They are going with the sensationalist strategy of hype over everything. Keep chasing the high instead of developing the game into something truly special that would organically bring in more players. The few years I have been playing this game they have only ever subtracted from the tactical layers of the game. And there are some glaring issues they refuse to fix which turns this game into more of a gambling simulator then a tower defense game. 

-A.I. Targeting RNG: Sometime the Wave will switch targets randomly, sniping you dps melee unit as the lines meet. The RNG aspect of this isn't a major issue, but it can cost you games. Which is frustrating. And if you are going to try and deny this as a fact, all I'd have to say look at the weekly challenge. You can use the same build vs. the same wave and get wildly different results. The main issue here is the fragility and inflexibility of formations. For example. If the send a snail your formation meets the wave too quickly and you and your dps gets sniped as the wave registers it as hitting the wave before your off tank. And ranged waves.  These are major problems that expose certain towers and builds. 

-Game pacing/balance: Now. The game is designed for you to say: ""Ok, I'm going to be weak on these waves. But I can gain advantage on these waves and push harder."" That's a cool idea. And in a perfectly balanced game that would work. But this isn't a perfectly balanced game. And some towers are simply that much better then others. For example. The seahorse. Gives its health to the frontliners while dishing out small amounts of damage. Its broken. And how do the devs respond, the only way they can. Damage, cooldown and health nerfs. Creating a seesaw of overtuning or underperforming with no clear middle ground. Adding a merc who disrupts healing, or adding a merc who spawns at the end of the lane and pushes up. Not even an option for these people as it would undermine certain towers. Do you see the problem. They already have mercs that counter certain towers. Like safety mole, who counters Aoe or brute who counters high single damage towers. Methodically unbalanced. The more variables you have to work with the more ways you have to achieve balance, but also the balls you have to keep in the air. Turns out the most import aspect of balancing a game is balance itself.

-Placement, Placement, Placement: The most important part of the game. Literally. And yet. There is no way to preview late game tower placement. No blueprint mode. No way of knowing how the tower will react to the wave. Made worse by the fact that you cannot adjust your towers placement without a hefty loss of money. Putting a tremendous emphasis on game knowledge to the point that knowing that sending a brute and snail against a nightmare on wave 6 will cause the brute to insta focus the nightmare. Boom. Game won. While that specific example may not be true, the game literally is that niche and ridiculous.

The ranked game mode is exclusively 2v2 so takes some co-operation (You can still queue up solo, and there are casual 4v4 modes). The game has a great community behind it and the official discord is particularly helpful towards new players, I've personally seen 0 toxic players in game as of writing this.

If you're not into competitive PVP games it's probably not for you, don't expect more from the campaign then a string of fairly underwhelming vs AI battles. But if you are fan of auto battlers, tower defense and/or auto chess, aswell as competitive mobas, you are in for a treat here.

I LOOOOOOVE this game, been a fan since WC3 and Sc2 (+10 years). MY ONLY COMPLAINT in an otherwise flawless and painstakingly well balanced game is NORMAL MODE. As a competitive person I took the time to grind alllll the way to diamond, where strats start to matter. The current Normal mode DISINCENTIVIZES users from learning to send by FORCING AUTO ON and this is suuuuuuper frustrating as it makes you loose out on gold for not having auto on. This doesn't just provide an option, for new players to keep auto on while they learn, and allow for more experienced players to gain or show advantages with knowledge of the game (IE resistances and send types). Consequently this effectively SLAUGHTERS any hope or way to practice ranked worthy builds or learn in real time vs humans without risking mmr on ladder to learn or try new things. BIG nono in my opinions to lessen the learning curve so much that it PROHIBITS regular players from using their knowlege of the game to either grow or seek advantages through tactical sends based on opponents resistances.

After about 20 hours I got mentally stun locked by just how much stuff there was to learn about the game and I put it down. Fast forward a few months, seeing content being made about it and frequent updates to the game it got me interested again and this time I wanted to really give it another try.

After a dozen or so games VS bots and watching some YouTube videos, I felt much more ready to jump back into ranked (the standard game mode). I was constantly getting wins and not just by getting carried either, I felt like I improved my skills and was better at the game.

I'm not going to lie, the depth of the game with the lack of fine guidance was a big quit moment for me initially. Yes there are tutorials in the game, and honestly they are pretty great at teaching the fundamentals. But there is a lack of specific tutorials to teach things such as when to hire workers and what units are good to build when. Viewing the unit roster is a fine bandied fix but it's a bit of a stat dump when it comes to interpenetrating what you are looking at. 
There is a link you can click when viewing the unit to learn more about it and some general tips on how to use them. But the link is kinda hidden and pretty small in the unit card among the sea of numbers. Not sure why it can't just be made more obvious and not send you to the wiki, Having to tab out over and over to check multiple units for their tips is pretty tiresome after a while.

With all of that being said. This is one of my new favorite chill PvP games to play. Each match feels pretty unique with it's play styles and diversity of units. If you decide to give this game a go, don't hesitate to check out some basic/ advance guides on YouTube by different content creators, and be patient with the game as there is a ton to learn. With my current playtime of 122 Hours as of writing this, I'm still learning new combos and strategies with units and merc sends.

TLDR: The game is very fun, but extremely deep and complex, give it time and patience and you may have a new fun PvP game to play!",1683938936,1683938936,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My first recommendation was negative, due to the average graphics and the feeling of ill-matched character models. But giving the game some time to get used to it, I started to see its better sides. So what do we get for this paid version compared to free versions like the one for Dota 2.
pros:
- speed of the game, we are able to play 2 full games during one.
- we get a whole lot of small changes that significantly improve the comfort of the game. (combat stats, practice sandbox, unit positioning grid, attack range view)
- we get a lot of small changes that increase the depth of the game (better balance, game modes, more interesting approach to leaks)
- an internal store that does not affect the win, but gives us the opportunity to build prestige based on the results in the game.

What bothers me is the graphics.
cons
- heavily simplified character models (needed for the game to run smoothly with a large number of players and heroes)
- heroes detached from time and place and statistics not corresponding to the model (attacking overgrown plants next to spaceships, archers, elementals and mechs or anti-aircraft guns)
- a bit high price in relation to the size of the content

I think that the game has amazing playability and will surely provide a lot of fun. The price could be a bit lower, but juxtaposing it with the time you will play with it, I think it's worth buying.",1680602529,1680682801,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I find the game interesting and enjoyable. I often play it during meetings (when I am not expected to present). I find the community to be pretty friendly for the most part (I only mute my teammates like 25% of the time). You can very easily mute pings, text, or suggestions so it becomes easy to just enjoy your game and not worry about others.

The only frustrating thing is I don't seem to be getting anywhere in the rankings. I find myself pushing 1800 every season, but for every game where I feel challenged by the teammates or pushed ahead, there are five or six games where the lack of placement, use of the 'auto send' button, or understanding of the wave strengths/weaknesses is abysmal. All in all, I have fun playing this game and will continue to do so. It's a low-time investment skill-based strategy/autobattler that is never the same game twice.

The game has 2v2 ranked, and 4v4 unranked. Sometimes it has 1v1 events for the weekend.
There is also a campaign now, I guess? Never bothered to check it out.

Buuuuut, so after playing a bit more and just playing a bit casual to get into it, I'm growing to really enjoy the game. Also almost all games I'm getting now feel very fair, so my original issue was probably just from starting out and having some higher ELO fluctuations than normally.

At this point I'm really enjoying myself and can definitely recommend it :)

Just got this game, been playing for the last 3 hours. Not a SINGLE decent match. 5 out of 6 gotta play vs a duo (yes premade duos vs single random thrown together players), where there was always one high silver or gold with his unranked buddy. Playing vs me and another random guy both in low BRONZE.

What a stupid friggin waste of time for eveyone. Would love to get a refund now, but it's too late of course. what a silly ripoff.

It starts relatively easy..as a noob you can put units anywhere, build workers whenever, send mercenaries whenever, and you CAN still win. ONLY as a noob though... 
This games mechanics run mad deep, and each unit has incredible potential. I am hundreds of hours in, at my peak top 1k ranked top 200 classic, and I'm still not good compared to these dudes at the top with these wild strategies. 

Ranked is a decently balanced 2v2 mode (I recommend for new players, as you get matched with ONLY new players); until you hit diamond you don't really feel stuck in elo hell. However, as an expert+ player..some diamond players should not be in diamond, even expert lol..either way, if you really are better than the rank you're playing, you should be able to win even with a bad teammate.
However, classic is an intense difference. Because this game is heavy on economy flow & synergy in builds, 4v4 becomes infinitely more difficult and MOST people that play it don't understand that. You can still have a solid time in classic when you queue as any rank, but personally (as a Legend classic player), unless you queue 4 stacked you inevitable have gold-plat players on your team that have no idea how to play the way classic is intended to be played..which is essentially crank to 19 and send 21+.
I don't queue classics at all solo, they are mad frustrating and so many people are completely non-receptive to criticisms which inevitable throw the game.

My last comment is the price..I understand this game is created by very few people and maintained by them, (whom I commend greatly and they are incredible at keeping this game afloat) but it is more expensive than it should be. I understand $20 as a base price game, but in order to get in game aesthetics you have to spend money.
I have helped cast multiple Nova Cup tournaments, spend over $250 on in game essence, and you can see my play time in this game...I'm still at ONLY HALF of the in game aesthetics overall. It's not the biggest deal, but if you are a collector (as I am) you should be weary that this game can become a money pit.

However, this game overall is incredible and I paid full price for it when I bought it. I am not upset with the money I spent in this game by any means, its just something to take into consideration. 
As a new player, understand it is ONLY aesthetics that you're spending money on; most people don't spend money in game, which I respect their patience and ability to stay withdrawn from it. I personally love them lol, I have all but 6-7 skins & half the cards.

This game is a 9.5/10 in my eyes, and only getting better as the devs keep it pretty balanced and add new units, modes, and campaigns. The .5 off is the price & ability to gain essence in game for more in game aesthetics, which I know isn't really important to many people.
I highly recommend this game!",1679151064,1679151064,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I had to fight 3 months from April 2022 to June 28 2022 in order to post this truthful review because the developer took issue with it and used steam's 'guidelines' to silence me and my review for not being slavishly praiseworthy.

I played legion td in WC3 over a decade ago from it's very earliest iterations, and when I found out Legion TD 2 was on steam, I was positively over the moon. I immediately bought a copy for myself and for my significant other to support the developers and enjoy the game.

We began with AI and played AI only to become competent, unlocking all the AI achievements such as campaign on hard etc. so we felt confident we at least had a basic grasp. I found the game to be extremely similar to the original (even using many of the same models, similar voice clips and dialogue, and unit names) and quickly became almost as obsessed with the game and community as I had been with the original.

Pros
NONE! FLEE THIS TRASH HEAP OF PEDOPHILES, CORRUPT DEVELOPERS AND ABUSIVE BULLY MODERATORS LIKE IT WAS HEROINE WITHOUT THE HIGH.

Cons
-Childish developers will personally harass you with their administrative powers if you don't slavishly shower the with enough praise while speaking in chat
-Developers will give you 0 warning and a 500 hour mute on your account (with a little note that says first ""warning"" as well as penalties and negative points against your account if you talk to them in General Chat, or suggest they made a mistake with a patch, or ask when they will be fixing a known issue
-Know issues that devs refuse to fix include but are not limited to
*The game not connecting you or kicking you out and then giving you leaver penalties and punishments even if you made it back into the crashed game within 1 minute and began building, TOO BAD.
*Mercenaries will QUITE OFTEN sit inside the fence and NOT SEND on the round you sent, even though the tooltip in the bottom left will show 0 mercenaries waiting inside the pen.
*Minions will often line up at one gate and not the other. There is NO CONSISTENCY regarding this. At first I thought the last team to leak would have their minions move through after, explaining why one side is usually let through before the other. But as I continued to play I noticed quite often I would be the last in the game to leak, but the enemies minions would line up long before and still be standing lined up LONG AFTER even if both enemies leaked, and an invisible gate would hold the minions back while letting my partner's leaks through, costing us the ""base race"" every single time it happened. There is no discernable reason for the inconsistency in the invisible 'king gate.'
*As demonstrated in the weekly challenge, the exact same set-up in the exact same locations is so powerfully affected by RNG it can make the difference between a full leak and a full clear. You can use the tutorial tool or just run a weekly challenge to see this for yourself; reset the wave but change NOTHING in your set up, and run the same wave again. If you do this 20 times you will get 15 different results on average. meaning that even with perfect towers and perfect positioning and perfect minion control, you will quite frequently be screwed over by RNG and BAD CODING.
-But all these cons pale in comparison to the personal behaviour of the 4 developers of the game.
-For example again, if you say in global chat ""Hey I see you guys made another patch. That's great. There are some big issues still not fixed, do you think you guys could fix it soon?"" you will get NO WARNING, FIRST OFFENCE a 500 hour mute on your account, as well as some weird 'penalty points' that say ""afk or leaving games"" on them even though you didn't leave a game or afk. (In this specific example. no games were played where a mute could have happened in game.)

Now, when my S.O. and I jumped into a ranked game, we came across fellow Canadians in our game, and used the in game cross-team chat system to cheerfully greet one another, and upon discovering we were from Quebec, Alberta and Saskatchewan, we joked ""Trudeau is the only thing that can unify our provinces"" and all agreed ""Mad Max Bernier for PM"". There was no cursing or unpleasantness. I myself made 3 comments, the ones above and ""Freedom Convoy, honk honk!"" for a total of 3 comments over the course of the game, all totally within terms and conditions and violating no rules. Friendly, polite, Canadian banter.

Seeing as those were my only 3 comments, you can imagine my surprise when after the game I had an account penalty and had been ""muted"" meaning I could not speak in party, I could not ping in the game, I could not talk to my S.O. in the game, I could not use the general chat. I couldn't even ping what waves I wanted to send or anything. I went to the forums and made a 100% no violation post explaining the situation that had occurred and how I didn't see what I had done to warrant these absurd, ridiculous penalties when I had done nothing wrong. It was not venting, or flaming, I was reaching out to the community to say ""Hey, this doesn't seem right. Is this a one-off?""

This is where the problems started FULL FORCE. A developer of the game removed my post and gave me several day suspension from the forums with no explanation. I went to the review section and wrote a nice review about how I would have LOVED to recommend the game, but I could not based on this horrible practise of censorship for absolutely no reason, and that if they stopped censoring I would change my review.

The developer escalated the situation by having my review censored on steam. This made my review invisible and locked it from being edited. I opened a ticket to steam support, who said ""The developer has done this, we can not help you."" I took the screenshots from steam support which said the developer was responsible for the bans and suspensions, not steam, and posted them in a forum on the Legion TD 2 community on steam, with proof.

The developers permanently banned me from the Legion TD community sending me 1 small, poorly written message which said ""we had an internal vote and permanently banned you for conspiracy theories."" despite the picture proof from steam they called it ""conspiracy theories.""

When I opened tickets about this, Steam confirmed once again that ""The developers of the game had made these bans"" I spent 3 months opening Steam Support tickets and steam placing 100% of the blame on the developer. Last night I finally convinced steam to delete the review entirely so I could write a new one.",1649870964,1677891337,False,2,0,0.444444417953491211,0,True,False,False

fIrst of all, this game is NOTHING like Legion TD of WC3

King is completely AI controlled
King spell can not be chosen
King upgrades are shallow

Units are extremely limited
Unit upgrade Paths are limited
Unit balance is poor (and got worse with the last few patches)

I played it a few times a day always but it was never really fun. You see the same stuff every game.
I had hopes that the last updates would change a bit, but the introduction of new OP units just broke the game more and the last 3 patches to ""fix"" them, made them even more OP.

My prefered way of playing it is as a duo in ranked mode but alone it's also very acceptable since you can ping about everything in the game incase your 'solo'-ally doesn't talk back for whatever reason.
The game also has a 4vs4 mode for those with bigger groups of friends.
Plenty of small updates and fixes which shows that the developers care about the state of their game.

For those interested in tournaments, they also have those going on for different levels of player skill so a bit of everything for everyone! 
The game also has skins you can buy with earnable ingame currency or for which you can pay real money. 
You can decorate the side of your playing board with statues of minions/enemies you can earn through playing which adds another layer of costumization. That never hurts! 

There are guilds, weekly challenges, solo campaigns, bot matches of different difficulties, global chat, etc etc.
I have met people from all over the world being them japanese, brazillian, german, south african, ... Everyone plays!
Queue times are very short. Usually less than 2 minutes and a match can take 20 minutes so it's really great.
Rarely do I meet a toxic team mate but it happens as such is the nature of human kind unfortunately.

All by all, my favourite multiplayer game which rewards knowledge, teamwork and skill. I keep coming back for more even if I take breaks now and then. I recommend it to everyone who likes a tower defence kind of game (the minions being your non-stationary towers) and for those who enjoy auto battlers.

It's the spiritual successor to the SC2 mod, but has its own set of unique rules and play-styles. With this said, I found this game to be rather pigeon holed in terms of min/max optimization. Certain play styles exceed far above others (as to be expected). However, in a game where there are literally minutes of down time, and very few ""optimal"" ways to build and counter at every given round, it doesn't reward creativity or uniqueness with its various approaches to the game in ways which ever feel rewarding or novel to each match-up. The ""skill"" is in how, when, and where you set your pieces; not exactly like Chess. That's not to say that deeper mechanics don't exist. In fact, this game has grown rather well over the few years since it's initial release. Rather, I find that certain tried and true builds/guides will champion ingenuity and to me that makes competition a slog and a bit of a ""skill-based"" joke. If I can watch a video on YouTube highlighting optimal starts and sends - which will outpace any one person's own research into such a topic - and it's still tactically optimal against most match-ups and through most updates, then why not just replicate this every match? This may be less of an issue at higher ranks, but again (for me) this ladder just doesn't reward skill in anyway that feels unique. The matchmaking is all over the place. Sprinkle in toxicity, and it just doesn't feel worth the time to grind as the ""fun"" aspects of Legion TD 2 can result in instant snowballing losses which lead to chain harassment from both teams.",1673170952,1673173291,False,1,0,0.472972989082336426,1,True,False,False

This is worth buying just for the matchmaking.

That said, I also like the way playstyles both encourage you to do things differently and reward you for playing how you happen to enjoy playing. The recommended value and being able to easily check how your fighters, mercs, and so on are doing also makes learning much easier than in the other games. I do however, wish they actually pointed out to you the screen with all the information on how your stuff is doing, how much damage are your tanks eating, how much damage are your DPS dishing, how about your mercs? That all of these are on the same screen off in a corner is sometimes annoying.

I did have some performance issues in the main menu when the Background was the default Earth King, swapping that to Beta King mostly solved them, and the actual game runs fine, it was literally just the animated Earth King made my FPS tank.

Pros:
+ it take very little time to learn
+ plenty of different modes
+ easy to play, hard to master
+ a normal game takes between 15-20 minutes and feels satisfying
+ good and at the same time light graphics. The game is tiny
+ great User Interface and overall design/usability  of the menus
+ good communication/ping options in game
+ easy and quick matchmaking
+ good statistics

Cons:
- gets repetitive quite quickly. After some time 60-70% of the game is the same
- campaigns were a bit disappointing for me. Colorful different maps and in the end you play on the same terrain as always

The ranked play is where this game truly shines - the decisions you make throughout the game shape your defence. You are rewarded for playing strategically, without having to micromanage anything. It's got a variety of helping tools to suggest builds and units for beginners, and experts can always look further ahead into the game, to optimise their build, predict dangerous levels, defend when they're weak, and capitalize when they're strong.

The game swings heavily in the favour of the winning team, but there's always a chance for the losing team to save up resources to make a final desperate attack, allowing for some brilliant comebacks.

Core concept is fun, enjoyed campaign enough but for multiplayer you're forced to do a draft that includes every character in the game. Make the barrier to entry much higher compared to single player since you have to essentially memorize every single character in order to start playing multiplayer. 

I like games in this genre as a chill podcast game that adds some challenge, but multiplayer makes it a total sweatfest to even participate. 

Also, no indicator on timers while picking the starting loadout in multiplayer. First game I was reading unit descriptions and got kicked for being AFK, no warning or timer. 

Sadly the single player is very, very short with no sort of progression system and very little reason to play. After finishing what felt like the first tutorial levels, you're immediately prompted to buy DLC to continue the campaign.

Edit: Forgot to mention that the game doesn't have a comfortable resolution for the monitor I use (4k tv), UI scaling feature is bug ridden, and alt+tabbing makes it so none of the controls work anymore.

EDIT: The playerbase somehow got worse overtime, the low-mid elo is flooded with trolls that only want to ruin your match or toxic losers who sell their whole field and forfeit if you dont do exactly what they tell you to do.

What makes this worse is that the admin team dont admit this is a problem, instead if you report someone who behaves badly in game YOU are blamed for it and YOUR behavior score goes down in game. Ontop of that you cant report even half of the toxic russian trolls you meet because the game restricts you to like 1-2 reports a day or so.

The meat of the game is in the combat phase, but it does feel its lacking a little ""oomph"". Each hit on a critter is like a feather tickle, not like an army of soldiers fighting. Since so much time is spent on looking at the creatures fighting, how about getting it more enjoyable? Via selected sound effects, screen effects and hit indicators for example. Such as that not every hit needs to produce a sound, but when it does, it's meaningful to the user.

Take a look at Hearthstone for example, when a creature on board hits another creature on the opposite side of the board, theres a whole bunch of stuff happening FX-wise; shakes, indicators, shattering, ""ramping up"", particles and debris flying around etc.. it makes the experience more enjoyable.

No - because the community is often just as salty and hate-fueled as League of Legends and insists you keep their chat on. I play a lot of Call of Duty, Apex Legends and other high-salt-content games and let me tell you...

I have been called more slurs, seen more people at a higher octane of angry on this game than any of those FPS sess pools. There's basically no moderation and it really sucks the fun out of the game completely for me. Maybe you won't have that problem, but I still won't recommend it.

i brought the game on two separate occasions, on both times i opened the game, played 10 minutes and then refunded it. twice. now for whatever reason i brought it again and after about an hour of figuring out the basic mechanics i found myself 28 hours deep 2 days later. I couldn't be more wrong about a game.

at its core its a tower defence, 4 players fight the same waves at the same time and each aim to build the best team out of a group of characters picked at random. while defending against AIs standard waves you have the ability to buy mercenaries to push the enemy, imagine clash royale or minion masters.

All of them share the same issues minus one.   That one difference?  Those other games were free (assuming you owned the primary platform WC3/Starcraft 2).  You have to pay for this version but you gain no real benefits for doing so.  Honestly, you're better off playing the custom maps in Starcraft 2.

That said, another major complaint about these games which this version hasn't solved either is the fact that economy is all that matters.  If you don't build ""perfectly"" or if you start to leak, you fall behind and unless your opponent makes some massive mistakes you've already lost the game and are just dragging it out.

I personally haven't experienced any versions of this cloned game format where people who leak, have a slower economy early on, or otherwise make a few mistakes are able to come back and win (all things being equal).  I expect the typical argument here will be ""But if your enemy has a leaver you can maybe win!""  or  ""Maybe they'll hit a special wave or two that they aren't prepared for!?!?!""

I played Legion TD in SC2 a lot and I have to say this reminds me a lot more of Squadron TD beta than that.

Currently there is 1 campaign with 2 more in development. That's 7 pve battles that can be played on normal or insanely hard difficulties. You also got pvp and generic pve. You get to choose from 1 of 8 factions. You can roll a dice to get 4 random units available to you. You can trade 0-4 of them for 0-4 of your own units to mix things up.

That's it.




What the game could need is custom factions. If you're gonna copy Squadron TD, you may as well copy its best feature.",1656100222,1664204179,True,0,0,0.498721212148666382,0,True,False,False

EDITING MY REVIEW

SO i am editing my review as I now have more hours. If you are looking for a casual game this is DEFINITELY something worth playing. If you are looking to get into ranked just dont. HERE IS AN EXAMPLE: 

You WILL be matched with a teamate who is possible MULTIPLE divisions below you. (Me diamond, teamate gold, enemies both plat). When you lose for obvious reasons you will then lose more ELO because well you were diamond and your enemies were plat. The dev team needs to look into REAL matchmaking and realize that the skill gap gets EXPONENTIALLY bigger the higher rank you go.

I know this will not change as many games have a failed ranking system, but here is my reasoning why I suggest avoiding the game if you are into ranked. I will probably continue to play it as a decompress from work but go play league of legends or something, at least its free.",1653977301,1663986290,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

To make the game better, I wanna give some suggestioins just from my view. Btw, i usually play 4v4(classic) and have reached highest rank, so my suggestions will be more about 4v4.

1)The matching mechanism maybe not so good. Bilateral strength gap is so big that I can foresee whether I will win at waiting page in 60% of the games. So just don't disguest some guys who always win and carry the last name. I know it's elo and common in other games, but i regard it as goddamn shit.

2)Reporting needs to be more useful. Some guys always say some shit even do literal racist, but I even met them in the next game after reporting.

3)Maybe the company needs to give more effort to promote the game and let more people know about it. I always think that the game is worth having a try, but just in China, nobody knows it, and they only play some boring shit. 

The suggestions above are that I am concerned with most. All in all, I love the game and hope it can keep going for ever.",1662711509,1662711509,True,1,0,0,1,True,False,False

I get bored with most games fairly quickly, but I've put well over 1,000 hours into LTD2 since it was first available on Steam many years ago. I still return to it almost daily for a game or two - obviously, LTD2 is very well designed.

There's a wide range of units and not a single one feels useless and there's a good balance between risk and reward, leading to a lot of variety in terms of play styles and strategy. There's 2v2 ranked play if you want to be very competitive, and a more laid back 4v4 mode for casual players like myself.

With the addition of weekly challenges (solo content), a campaign which can be played solo or with a friend, and a sandbox mode for testing builds, this is a fully fleshed out product. The amount of polish from such a small development team is commendable.

The community used to be extremely toxic but over time that problem seems to have resolved itself; much of this probably has to do with the FairPlay system which punishes poor behavior and auto-mutes people who've been reported frequently.

WC3:
- Beautiful! You have the feeling that it is a Legion TD, but in the same time, it's like playing something else with the designs, colors and music.
- Some new things that did not exist in original - Mastermind class! Nice way to play something completely different than rest of the classes.
- Campaign! Even as Co-Op!

New People:
- Don't give up and don't stop learning. People from the original know the point of the game and you might find yourself overwhelmed by the amount of things, but game is easy to learn!
- Easy to get in Lobby with your friends and play together!
- A really nice learning curve from the Campaign, however, you might loose yourself when you switch from classes to Mastermind

Message to AutoAttack games:
- It would be great if you can add more classes. I know it's hard to maintain the balance, but I really believe that the community is the same as before and will provide a massive feedback!
- More mastermind options!
- More campaign options! (I know they are coming but I can't wait! :D )
- And this is just my honest opinion: x10! Remember it? I do. I would love to see x10 version of LTD in this game!

Endless replay value. There are aspects that are better in the Warcraft 3 custom map versions of the game (where the game originated). Although those are negligible, and I choose to play the Steam version over the currently supported Warcraft 3 versions (There may be a few versions, I believe team Oze is doing a great job with it though).
I like that the dev keeps releasing new units to keep the game fresh, as well as skins, however that brings me to my main criticism.
Skins are too costly/hard to acquire for free. The game already costs money, but the skins are priced like this is a free to play game. VERY expensive for a tiny skin you can barely see, and 95%+ are just recolors/textures, and not actually changing the 3D model in any way. The only ones that have any sort of change to the actual 3D model are I believe Fission Atom, MD Safety Mole, and Friendly Brute. Apologies if I missed any. I’m at about 960 hours in game, I’ve currently bought 2 skins without spending additional money (green and a blue value which are not the highest) and have enough for 1 that is orange rarity (highest value). I dislike how you need a guild to acquire the premium currency for skins.
The card system is also very fun and a nice touch, you can unlock cards from playing and by going to the card shop where you have a chance to acquire rare cards and even the ever illusive secret cards (finally got one at 955 hours…), once you have a card you can put up a monument of that character on the side of your lane or use the character as your profile picture, this is an incredible idea for added flair and customization for players that does not affect power level or offer any actual gameplay advantage.

The game desperately needs a ""keep playing"" button if you are playing the AI and win, I just want to relax and see how far i can go past lv 20 sometimes without it being cut short...",1563470149,1659974273,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

* If you like auto battlers this is a good one.
* there are several game styles that you can choose, from some that are random like other auto battlers to more strategic/planified ones.
* the depth of this game is INSANE, it is easy to learn but extremely hard to master
* this game is very rewarding when you learn how to properly play it.

Learning how to play each unit and how to play economy is crucial to win the game. This is one of the most strategic auto-battlers that you can get. The price barrier... about that you have to understand that the developers took a huge risk in this game and also is in constant content patches and balancing is constantly happening, I would recommend this game if you are:

* Looking for an alternative to other auto-battlers like tft, or hearthstone battlegrounds (or not even an alternative, this is a great 1st choice)
* You like certain amount of randomness but not chaotic levels of randomness (that also is a possibility if you are willing to)
* A young but active competitive scene where there are actual cash money rewards.

Since the WC3 TD mods I'm in love with the TD genre and am always in search of games that give me similar feelings to that (for me) good ol' ""WC3 TD mods- time. Legion TD 2 comes in closest for me. The game is already fun, but gets with every update (so far) better and better. 
The units feel unique and fun to use. Overall everything is relatively balanced and it seems that the devs have an eye for overused or overperforming units needing some tweaks and act accordingly through their patch releases.
The graphics are good, but nothing too impressive. Don't expect some fancy light show like on TFT maybe, but a pleasant view for the eye.
Also the game is beginner friendly with an extensive tutorial and many easy-to-understand tooltips - not like some other auto battler-TD's (looking again at TFT). You quickly get an understanding on what every unit does and what's recommended to use. The game practically looks out for you and even tells you after a loss where you might have decided wrong.
There are different game modes, like Campaign/Custom against AI/against other players or the ""Weekly Challenge"". The campaign isn't fully released yet, so I can't say much about it. So far it's fun, but short. You can get different/better ratings on how well you do. Custom against AI are just games. You can choose the AI-difficulty that applies to all AI players in the game. Right now, you can't choose for every AI individually. If you choose hard, every AI is on hard. Custom against other players is the online mode. You get it. The ""Weekly Challenge"" is just beating someone else's score. This is interesting for learning other people's strategies and having some sort of ladder/ranked/competition place.

So what's not to like or rather not (yet) to my/your/our liking?
The AI:
If you play with or against AI, some choices it makes seem kinda random and inconsistent. There are games where you get swarmed with stuff they send against you or where they are practically a better teammate than you. I remember one or two games where a silver (=easy-ish) AI gave me more pressure than some gold (=shouldn't be as easy-ish) AI. You can somewhat take it with a grain of salt that the AI isn't that consistent and forth not that easy to read/predict.

The enemy waves stay the same every game:
This is somewhat of a 50/50 nice/bad thing. On one hand you can ""learn"" the waves and develop your perfect strategies against the enemies every round. You know what to expect every round (you can even see it in a small preview at the top of the screen). On the other hand this may get a bit boring, especially if your enemies - may it be real players or some player-AI - don't send extra stuff over to you. Here I'd say would be some more variation welcomed.

There is no endless waves mode:
The game always ends/wins with the enemy team losing their king unit if too many mobs broke through their defenses and depleting the king units health to zero. For me that happens usually in the 15th round (if I'm playing against AI). This is sometimes really annoying, since around then you may really love your army and have developed some awesome strategy to defend for days. Here I'd appreciate it if there was some new mode to come in to really deep dive on strategy stuff.",1659389350,1659389350,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Its very challenging and while the original had ""infinite"" waves, i am using the infinite part loosely here, since i never got to that part. this one stops at Wave 21, which is perfect, especially for those who just wants a quick match and see how far they can push their potential.
i love its challenges and the way it can provoke you to either better utilize your units or be better at doing the placement of the units. The battlefield has a grid, that makes it easier to figure out, where the center is and how much space there is to each side. Although, mind that you won't be able to fill it completely in before wave 21 and using low-cost units isn't gonna cut it, since they can't carry that far into late-game.
However, i do have a gripe with its match-making, where i tried to do a ranked match with a friend and we couldn't get to play together, which is really annoying and the match gets cancelled with out proper reasons.

But the new way the ratings work seriously depresses me. No other game punishes you for losing, your rating shouldn't change when you lose only when you win.

Your rating should be based on how many games you've played, win or lose, failure is just as important as success. I have been chasing my rating for months now and it goes up and down so drastically based on a bunch of factors that it feels like one step forward 3 steps back.

If this was fixed it would just be that much more enjoyable having a rating that reflects your hard work and hours of game play.

      like all games you need to learn a few things before you start having fun, all the different ""towers"", waves, mercs, how agro works, ect. but you can play and win some games at every skill level. seems to match you fairly well against people in the same rank.  i believe it has a pretty high skill cap.

Playing duo with a friend is the best way to enjoy the game. Solo is also an option, but a way lesser one, imo.
Devs are very active.

What is this game anyway?
The basic game loop is:
Purchase towers (units), purchase mercenaries, purchase 'King' upgrades, invest in workers -> your units defend your lane from current hostile creature wave and enemy player mercenaries -> repeat
In case that you fail to defend yourself, your 'King' will be attacked by leaked units, he is the last line of defense and once he falls, you lose.

What makes the game interesting and fresh is the fact that your tower choice is always very limited and random; the random part is fair, it has a rules that it uses to give you random units, so you generally have something that works.
There is, however, a non-competitive tutorial mode, either a campaign, or regular vs AI mode, that you can use to get hang of the game with pre-selected units.

There is an economy that you also manage, so apart from being able to think of a build from random selection of towers, you need to minimize your spending on towers, maximize your spending on workers (that help you get more money in the long run).

Once upon a time there were TD games. They got boring because the towers were all the same.
--Then came MOBAs and they were great, but very stressful and involved, also require clicking at exactly the right minute.
 --Then came the autobattlers. Which were awesome, had a variety of units, but very RNG heavy.

Along comes LegionTD2:
All 4 players play against 21 standard creep waves and do your best to farm/repel the waves. using your autobattler units. Use $ to add creeps to waves of your choice to make your enemy's job harder(impossible).

Pros: 
-Not Pay2Win. The purchase of the game covers everything, except skins.(a few options vs bots unlocked with in game free currency, but not needed for MP)
-15~60 second to find a ranked match.
-Excellent AI. Gold plays as well as a 1400 player.
-Diverse units that each play very differently.
-Tons of strats and synergies, no perfect META
-Very little ""Luck"" most plays are math, not RNG.
-Decide how much RNG you want in your unit selection. A. choose a FIXED set of 6. B: Pick 1 and 5/9 randoms. C: to pick 6/10 D: Random 6 every turn.
-Game lasts for 15-30 minutes.

Cons: 
1. My friends are mad that I stopped playing other MOBAs and mods of them.
2. I want skins for my units and mercs!

For those new to the game:
Legion TD is a co-op competitive tower defense game. In the standard multiplayer modes you and 1-3 others all have a lane of incoming enemies that all join together and attack your ""King"" - if your King dies - you lose. On the other side will be an equal sized team of opponents doing the same as you.

The game is round based, every round a wave of enemy units with various strength and weaknesses will spawn and attack your towers (which respawn with full health every round). Any enemies that you fail to kill will go and try to attack your king but if you clear all the enemies in your lane then your forces will teleport in front of your king to protect him from any ""leaked"" enemies from your allies lanes. The enemies in each round are the same but your opponents (and you) also have the options to send various extra enemy units with the wave to try and break through the defenses.

The main complexity of the gameplay is balancing the two resources in the game - Gold and Mythium. You spend your gold on building all of your Towers but you can also spend gold on Workers - these are non combat units that mine Mythium and increase your rate of Mythium acquisition. Mythium is used only for sending extra enemy units with the wave to attack your opponents defenses but this also provides consistant Gold income every round depending on the enemy you choose to send (generally the more Mythium it costs - the more Gold income it provides). What this means is that you always want to maximise worker production while building just enough towers to not allow any enemies through - the more efficiently you do this the more exponential your income growth can become. There is too much strategy to really get into too much depth here but this game has some serious replayability compared to other TD games due to this design.

For those who have played the Mod enough to know what to expect:
Everything you expect should be here - most of the units from the original game are here with several interesting changes and additions that allow for new strategies. Mastermind or randomised towers is the most common way to play as you get an additional bonus you can pick from 20 or so options including things like ""+3 income and +3 rerolls"", ""+5 income and 1 reroll"", ""44 income after wave 10"" and all sorts of interesting things.

The game seems pretty active and only takes a couple of minutes at most to find a game, all in all I have nothing to criticize.

-Classic mode is very fun because its 4v4 which is the core gameplay of the original custom map in WC3, Ranked is only 2v2

-A varieties of units you can choose from and mix and match to create powerful combos

-Basically the same mechanics from Legion TD on WC3 (building towers, making workers and sending for income)

Con:
-The units you can send to attack your opponent in the game isn't balanced because you can send any of the higher cost units early which will have very high stats if you just save mythium. This means that some guy can save mythium from round 1 all the way to round 9 and send anything with very high stats on a boss wave with only needing to invest a few workers. Weird thing is I remember the original Legion TD game have a way around this by not letting you send high cost units until after wave 10.

-Shutdown mechanics is a joke, a majority of the players either don't care to use it to their advantage or straight up doesn't know what it is. When the enemy team is already ahead and this mechanics take effect you would still need a good amount of workers combine with saving for a round or two just to try and attempt to leak the enemies. Which means you only get rewarded after you manage to leak the enemies, so unless you constantly leak them when the bounty is at 100 golds or higher it won't do much to help you catch up.

-The game is very reliant on having good teammates. The opponent that you are sending units to aren't the one sending stuffs to you, so if your teammate won't send auras and strong units on important waves to force them to not go all in on income you will just be forced to just build units to try to prevent leaks. If your teammates won't help then the only option is just to watch yourself losing slowly the game because your income isn't up to par to build more units in late game.

-The game doesn't have a match making system in place to prevents better players from being matched against new players and those who are trying to learn. So matches are often just one sided, very rarely will you get in a match that will have most players on the same skill level. This is terrible if you are new to this game and are trying to learn how to play and what to do. 
Edit: The new match making system is terrible it will match you with any players from any ratings so its basically nonexistence.",1638925250,1656807589,False,3,0,0.484308779239654541,0,True,False,False

Gameplay takes about 15 to 30 minutes per game and while it can get rather formulaic tactics wise especially once you start getting into Gold Ranked matches, there is enough variations that you need to start playing a lot of games to feel like you've seen everything before. 

Matchmaking is quick, most of the time I can get a match within two minutes and it is extremely rare for matchmaking to take longer than three minutes. The server connection is astonishing to me, I'm from the USA and I've played with Germans, Canadians, Danish, Australians, Argentinians, Brazilians, Czechs*, French, British, and even a few Russians with very few game ruining connection issues. Most of the time I don't notice a thing or the fighters are just a little out of sync for a bit.

*No idea what the proper term the people of the Czech Republic is so I just went with the ethnic group.

I'm not too active in the community but most people that I've run into are communicative and willing to work together to secure the win. The pinging system works pretty well for general communication so that you typically don't need to make use of the ingame chat.

I would note that the first match after booting the game up always takes far longer than normal to the point that I've often just left the game running in the background so that I won't have to wait through the load when I'm in the mood to play again that day. Also there is some sort of bug with closing down the game itself because exiting the game will cause it to freeze and stop responding, usually requiring me to hard shut down the game with a few rare times having the game shut down after a while frozen.",1656716099,1656716099,True,0,0,0.498406916856765747,0,True,False,False

This makes building very boring and repetitive when every unit literally only has 1 upgrade... and that's it

They've fixed all the issues I had with it earlier, and it's a fun game now.
This is not a typical TDS game though. It's a unique beast.
Essentially, you're playing solo or with a team against other players (AI or human), and trying to balance your resources between attacking with mercenaries and defense with a number of units. The game is played over a series of rounds, which typically do not last past round 20. 
Your goal is to get past the other team's defenses and defeat their king.

x the pace of the game : each game is around 20min and it feels like the right timing. 
x the community and all the ressources to learn. 
x the soloplayer campaign in solo and hard mode.
x all the subtleties and complexity of the game. 
x games are super explosive, and can blow up at any time. 
x game overall pretty well balanced, a lot of viable comps.

What feels a bit harder :

In 2v2 as a total noob, I progressed up to nearly 2000 ELO / Expert rank. After 500 games I have a lot of knowledge, but get stuck in Platinum forever despite a positive win rate, because I play with random teammates, and 9 of 10 matches against 2v2 parties are losses. It's extremely unfair.

Long Version:
The only competitive mode is 2v2, but it totally gets ruined for me, because random teams must play against premade party teams all the time, and it's extremely unfair, there are 100 reasons why 2v2 party teams have a clear advantage. I'm losing 9 out of 10 games when I play with a random teammate against premade parties, I could just alt+f4 and leave, it wouldn't change the outcome.
Especially on Saturdays, when people play for guild rewards, there's more than half of the games against premade. It ruins all the fun and I can't progress. Teammates also get toxic, and frustrated. 

Then, the whole learning curve and rank progression does not make sense at all. It goes downwards. The more I learn, the more I lose. I came to this game with zero knowledge, no guides, no builds, no Twitch/YouTube, not splitting, not knowing all auras, not even reading the special abilities and spells of units. I only played auto-send and only saved if my teammate made a call, but I did not even know what good sends are.

Yet it took me less than 100 games to hit Platinum rank, about 150 to be Diamond, and then around 200 games I was close to 2000 ELO / Expert rank, or in fact it said my rank was top 1.2%
However, from then on, I had some technical difficulties, lots of disconnects, and I went down to Platinum 4, and then I never made it higher than Platinum 1 again. That's 300 games stuck between Plat4 and Plat1, and this is mostly because 90% of the games against parties are losses.

There's no way to properly learn how to play this game, when parties are completely unpredictable. They might have a special strategy / build prepared, that they will perform, no matter what. They might save 4 or even 7 rounds in a row... You can't exactly predict what they have in mind.
I've played lots of competitive multiplayer games, and I usually hit the top 2% ranks in every single game that I stick to, but on this game I just don't know what to do anymore, it all seems random, and the matchmaking is unfair which prevents you from learning and progressing.

Btw, the release date of this game says 1st of October 2021, I started playing early 2022, and thought this is a new game, and that I'd meet lots of new players - but it's not! Steam Charts tells me, there have been players in October 2017 already, and in game you can see that this is the 9th season already! I thought I'd buy a quite new game that is growing, but it's the opposite. There've been lots of toxic old players, who were raging at round 1, just because they've checked my profile and raged that they were teamed up with a new player, despite my always positive win rate.",1653159383,1653159383,False,11,5,0.519814193248748779,0,True,False,False

 There is a reason I have these hours. The original creators are back, and have created something that far surpasses the original, minus the awesome original wc3 graphics. (Although most people will probably find the new graphics to be better, but im just a sucker for wc3 specifically.)

 There is faux progression, collectibles, different game modes, and most importantly:

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

- The countdown for mythium is still 0.5-1.0 seconds delayed, after all of this time.
- The fighter value-counter, which measures how well you're doing round-to-round, is still not even remotely accurate five-ish years after the Beta was released.
-  No way to make sure a toxic player isn't in your next queue; you can only mute them whilst in-game. 
- The XP counter takes ages to ever go up. I play a lot, and getting far in the levels (and with little-to-no reward, too....) is time-consuming in a manner I've never witnessed in other games. 
- No way to give feedback, even for an indie game. That's always been odd.

High potential game with tons of strategy, nuance, and mechanics that doesn't have the population for fair match making in any mode.  In addition, they make incomplete changes to units such as nerfing units but not nerfing their costs.  I'm the type of player that doesn't read patch notes.  I like to sort of figure it out and make mistakes on my own.  So obviously some frustration I bring on myself.  But the way they make changes make virtually zero sense.  For example, they will nerf the power of a unit but not the gold cost.  They will buff the power of unit without increasing its gold costs.  So you basically have this weird situation where some units are more powerful per gold than others.  Power doesn't translate perfectly either b/c there is sort of a strategic set up required.  Where you place units matters.  So if they do a small buff without increasing gold cost on a high utility unit then it's broken strong.  People will gravitate toward that unit or series of units in matches.  It's horribly unbalanced, inconsistent at times, and the matchmaking is designed to rapidly make games as opposed to focusing on quality.  Most people I speak with don't mind the difference between 1 min and 5 min in a queue for a match in any game.  What's 4 more minutes for quality.  I found myself going back because it was a great way to pass the time but I'm just sick and tired of the game at this point not having the consistency from developers that it should.  High potential game with low investment from developers for quality.  

I don't recommend the game as there are many better strategy based games out there that are more polished and offer better pvp matchmaking options.",1652081637,1652081637,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

This is not really a tower defense game in that you don't place pieces to ""intercept"" a coming wave.  It is a grid of pieces you place like chess.  But you don't really play against your opp characters. There is this ""middle-ware"" layer (for lack of a better term) that you attack your opp with.

It would have been much simpler and better IMHO if it was a just single vertical or horizontal lane that your game pieces fought directly against their game pieces.  I think it would have been much more exciting and much more variant.

Also,I have to say,  I got really frustrated toggling between my ""defense"" lane and my ""offense"" lane to see what fighters vs. mercs I should (have) pick(ed).  The only way to see your opp characters is during fighting, yet you can't really see how to develop your defense without seeing the mercs they picked.

In the end, it wasn't fun anymore, because the game is all about this very nuanced balance between leveling up your ""defense"" and buying your ""offense"".  In order to learn nail that subtle nuance, there is an extreme amount of mind-numbing reps to put in first.

It rewards lower tier players by giving them an unfair advantage. For ex. During a classic game, as you progress throughout 21 waves, you obtain income from the monsters while defending and attacking. It costs gold, achieved through income, to purchase monsters that you place to attack. So, if I start wave 1 at 5 income and player 2 starts wave 1 with 32  income. By the time the wave 10 comes around. They've already compounded their income to the point where they can purchase an extra few monsters to defend and workers to attack with. Just causes a very unfavorable gaming experience. Especially, if you're playing against multiple players like a 4 vs 4. Not enjoyable when 1 game can take up to 40 mins. Game mechanics require a more level playing field.

4-14-21 edit. Creators have implemented a rebalance which makes the game a tad bit more favorable and ""fair"". There is a hint of unbalance still. However, with skill and a little bit of luck. You can over come the adversity. Which really bumps up the thrill and excitement of coming back and winning a game. Still a few things I'm sure will be tweaked over time.

Terrible design, which has already been done right in Direct Strike in sc2, right next door. How could they fail to copy and paste that?

The art is very ugly. They brag about hiring an art director in the reviews, but the fact is that half of the units are straight-up unpleasant to look at.

Lastly, there are some major red flags in the reviews, which imply devs ban people as retaliation for bad reviews. And it's not clear if those people get refunds afterwards. The devs' responses are also deliberately vague and dodgy on the subject, which makes them look immature and unprofessional.

===
Edit: After further research, it appears that the devs are happy to ban people for:
- leaving the game
- not talking to teammates
- talking to teammates too much
- writing bad reviews
- the devs were just on their periods that day

Do they actually think that players will buy the game on a second account and give them more money? How delusional are these retards?

=====
Edit: Steam support denying me a refund 3 times now, one day after the purchase, because the ""playtime"" shows as 3 hours (2 of which are afking in the menu). This is what I deserve for trying to use up the remaining funds in steam wallet after they refused to refund an old purchase to my card.

-Campaign stuck in starting mission screen for quite a while until it finally loads after 5 min, not saying I got the best device but this ain't 3A game, definitely don't feel normal
-Unable to simply use steam account name
-Not sure why there is discord and twitch stream button in game

Things that I think can be better:
-Don't like the earth and sky king wallpaper
-Recommended value can be very deceiving depends on the faction and unit synergy
-Need more detailed stats which displays constantly like attack speed, damage per hit etc
-Can we leave social feature to steam?

Game itself is fun, like the map on war3, strongly advise tutorial 
Review to be adjusted base on future update, I do expect it to get better and unless you already love the map back in war3 no harm to wait a mth or 2 before buying

Update 1: Tried first custom game, UI is not easy to use. For example, when assigning certain player to targeted slot. Reconnect can be an issue as it seems to lack rejoin mechanism. Also unable to leave game after a server found but before it starts

Update 2: 
- Sandbox can't really test desired legion spell and combination, waste time rerolling
- matchmaking skill level feels a bit off, single digit win players are matched with experienced players with hundreds of wins
- There is beginner/easy/medium/hard AI in custom map while in VS AI there is bronze/silver/gold/platinum/Diamond AI, not sure why the difference

Update 3:
In new patch devs said they want to balance certain wave because people don't send, which I think is not sufficient single reason. Need to keep an eye on that 

Update 4: 
matchmaking still functions weirdly, people without rank can match with masters
Also a cancel button is really needed when match is found - to clarify, not when searching for games but when the game is found page pop up

Update 5:
Need a block player mechanism without reporting

Update 6:
Can't agree with decision to allow one player unpausing when someone DC, should be team vote
Also if someone DC first round and does not reconnect in next few rounds, let people leave game freely

[b]TL;DR:[/b]
[i]""Players are going to find abusive mathematical strategies over and over, despite you taking the time to properly play and learn the game, you're still the one setup to lose if you don't abuse mathematics.""[/i]

Before you jump in to trash a down vote review, this is to get your attention, you have to respect the issue I would like to present you with this game at the time of date mentioned above.

The good/great thing about this game:
Despite the small budget the devs had to work with, they made a good product visually and mechanically it's almost bug free & it is engaging. Now you're wondering why I'm down voting. What ruins a potential fun match is simply because there are too many mathematical loop holes that players are abusing and it's a little difficult to fix this sort of issue because it seems to be a complicated math problem (specifically with abusing resources by withholding on myth and releasing powerful units at early levels). This is a math problem devs need to look into.

[b]Practical example:[/b] More often than not, I play against opponents holding back on sending with mythium but release all they got on level 10. I received today a kraken on level 10 and my allies received something not far from that. I've had similar experiences cause us to lose with even less powerful units at the same level stage.

[b]You're unfortunately setup to lose regardless how well you play the game's intended mechanics.[/b] Players are going to find abusive mathematical strategies over and over, despite you taking the time to properly play and learn the game and read up on forums, you're still the one setup to lose if you don't abuse mathematics. Not because your allies are bad or because your opponents are good players. Rather because you can abuse math to your advantage. Making this game... a mathematics focused game (regardless of dev intentions) with a facade of 3D modelled characters, animations, sound effects, etc... that may make us feel that there's something more going on.

It's not poorly designed product in any way and obviously most games are based on this fundamental.

But what I'm trying to articulate for you is, more often than not, you will face matches where there's nothing you can do, your opponents are not necessarily good at playing the game's intended mechanics, rather they just found a loop hole with mathematics to survive long enough to unleash an end game unit on to your lane from the very first boss (lvl10 - I received a kranken, like what?).

I've been putting the time to learn strategies, different damage and armor types and positionings and auras and units to send on what units and analyze what my opponent is building... all of that just for me to deal with a kraken on level 10...

If the devs genuinely fix that, I will review this over time if I don't lose my temper due to this none sense math matches, I will edit the post and recommend this game when the time is right.

A great mix of RTS and tower defense with tons of strategic value.  There are tournaments (at the time of writing 2022) with real cash prizes, and constant balance updates.
8 different families of creatures to cast and mastermind options from YOLO where you just get a random set of creatures to Greed, where you are limited to one reroll and get a little extra starting cash.
If you get into the competitive Esport stuff, there's practically endless replayablity.  And 6 tiers of bots you can play with.
It is a team game, so whether playing against AI or ranked matches, you will always be paired with a friend or random (or an ai if you are playing against the bots alone).  You can play with up to four players on a team, but that's more a fun feature and not super balanced.  It is made for two vs two.
The AI is competent (depending on the tier of bot) and challenging until you learn the really technical stuff, like which wave has which weakness and which creature is good against it, how many you need to clear it, whether you should send mercenaries to your opponent, whether you expect them to send against you, and of course balancing economy vs attack/defense strength.
Quick tip: learn to split and when to buy workers from youtube.  It's really helpful.  At the end of the game they display the grid, the creatures on it, money, power, ect for each turn of the game, to learn where you made mistakes, or when the opponent tricked you to push when he had a long send stashed away.
Like I said, a great and strategic game (based on a warcraft 3 mod (like dota) at a very reasonable price.  They have monthly tournaments.  Prize pools are small for now, but you never know when an Esport is going to be popular.

It's fun to play with friends, it is a challenging game and it has a different experience with each match. The changes they made to choose different play styles at the beginning of each competitive match rather than have to purchase them was cash money.

My only complaint are the changes with the new season and it seems there are more changes happening more frequently. Games change and it's just something I have to adjust my play style to! But some strategies are broken at the moment.

Good part: (since Legion is PVP based)
* It has single player even with implemented campaign which is neat and regular bot games with various difficulties.
* Coop (with AI) against other two AIs

However, this coop feature is bullshit and you can actually play with a friend except, it does not work for searching for random player as teammate and it will always give you the AI teammate instead if you are selecting it to play against AI, unlike any other game.

Now, you would think that playing solo is okay and everything should be as it is? Well, no, why on earth there is not PAUSE feature for solo games? Sure pvp games it does not have to be there but SOLO? I have to go away for 2 minutes and i can't pause and instead of pause there is AI that takes over your lane, on paper it sounds okay but in reality AI will ruin your strategy by either upgrading current ""towers"" or placing new ones that you didnt want to place at all + in wrong places and/or sending cheap mercs to opponent.
Apparently this has been issue for some time and devs dont bother to implement PAUSE feature.

I find hard time to understand how much of value each ""tower"" adds if placed on field and top of that how much value it adds when upgraded because tooltip does not show it, how on earth new players can learn the mechanics then?

PVP: It seems that even if you play for the first time or hundred of times you will be matched together which makes it imbalanced match making. 

Game itself is quite short compared to warcraft3 legion TD with only 21 waves why there is not an option to have more waves than 21? It is kinda short for my taste.",1644156816,1644156816,False,0,0,0.456408470869064331,0,True,False,False

While many players no doubt will remember Legion TD the popular tower defense game set using old Blizzard assets in custom game modes, the owners of this IP have indeed finally moved out from this bloated shadow and into the light as their own product. Featuring a few new gameplay options of 2v2, 4v4, and previously for limited time, 1v1. 

First of all, this isn't a tower defense game. Originally it made its entrance as such in Blizzard but the new game features a total of 2 towers. This is better classified as a competitive tactical autobattler, which leads me to the second major problem, the lack of gameplay. Due to this being a port with little design effort, Legion TD 2 is unfortunately a small group effort, and while its developers do still put in effort on development, it can be said at this point they spend more time on hype and attention. The basic fact of the game is that there's only 21 rounds, and due to the lack of unit flexibility and importance of placement, you really don't have much interaction with the game itself. You will often find issues with the AI units on both sides outright ignoring your tactical placements, poorly balanced units that serve no purpose other than to detract from your teams strength, and frequently encounter both graphical issues and gameplay hang-ups where waves get stuck resulting in all players waiting nearly 5 minutes for a background timer to notice something is wrong. Oddly for an autobattler, units excluding a few all follow the same path of a single upgrade. There's little to no unit customization in a genre that calls for adjusting and tuning units based on the wave battle system. Resulting in the entire gameplay loop being building more units rather than having any further unit improvement options. Even compared to its fellow Blizzard tower defense games, Legion TD is quite empty for upgrading. This may be in part due to the small team and attempts to balance gameplay further or part of their own design.

Secondly, it's now a fully competitive game. This is different than launch as originally the classic mode was essentially unranked and they had 2v2 set specifically for ranking. Now regardless if your a casual chill player, you are ranked in every game mode. This is extremely problematic when your rank will enter the top few thousand just by occasionally playing matches, [b]even by losing[/b]. Within a matter of hours you might well be fighting the top few hundred people in this games community who no life this game and live off of spreadsheets and patch notes. This is the real problem since gameplay swings heavily based on the economic situation you maintain via sending units and building workers. Once you reach this point you'll often find yourself inexplicably outclassed by various meta strategies, outright cheese, and people who risk their entire team just to build workers in order to destroy you. Gameplay choices where you'll find your own teammates griefing in order to build up gold, playstyle Fiesta, as it's called. Along with a host of other numerous small frustrations that leave you pondering the actual thought that made it through. 

However again, this is a small group effort project and they're bringing us this specific vision of a game. When the entire project team is less than a dozen people it's far easier to end up with glaring blind spots in design. As such if your interest is in a competitive autobattler that contains co-op elements, this is for you! I highly recommend bringing at least one, but for reliable gameplay I'd advise bringing three. If your interested in this if it was a tower defense, I recommend wishlisting this game. The developers have stated towers might be the way of the future unit releases. If you aren't a big fan of either, I highly recommend you don't buy this game as it's quite niche and you will not find any unique or exciting gameplay originality here.

I for one don't regret my purchases, as an old player of Legion Td I can say the price I paid covers the fun I got out of their original game. I am however sad to see it left this pale of a shadow from what used to be a unique and interesting game, something that seemed to promise at more potential if it could finally be free of Blizzards old engine and assets. Well this is what we got, the exact same garbage pieced together with new assets and next to no new ideas.

Pros: 

Great gameplay
My favorite type of indirect PVP (defend and send)
Depth of strategy and unit interaction (placement is VERY important)

Cons

Slightly dated graphics and UI, but I personally enjoy it
Difficult learning curve for new players (join the Discord and watch FlightTV to learn!)

The community is much smaller than many other games, but with a very active base I think this game fills a much needed niche in the currently oversaturated market of Autochess/TFT type games, autobattlers, etc. None of those games have the consistency of carry over game-to-game that Legion has and personally I think the balance of RNG in the form of randomizing but allowing for selection of units is a great mix to allow for skill expression while introducing enough variety to keep you coming back.

Maybe frigging Test of Survival, or Crash RPG in a map that doesn't suck, Dragons RPG and the original Aeon of Strife maps that weren't just DoTA clones and thus actually good, not to also mention the idea behind the numerous really good DBZ maps (tho maybe balance them all out properly, idk just a thought) and tbh I always though Squadron TD was overrated. It's good, but overrated imo.

This game is just Legion TD and Squadron TD that doesn't require a copy of Warcraft 3 or Starcraft 2 respectively, to play.

You just need to fork over 30 CAD for another game, have a constant internet connection, and you also need to deal with the existence of MTX ontop of that, and, get this, after every match it has to relog into the game and delay the player further from getting into successive games, it generally feels unpolished as a whole in my opinion.
Oh, and there's no way to delay the first wave, whether people are ready or not, the game starts which is just plain awful design, so if you're starting the game and trying new factions, there's a lot of tooltips to read in those 60 seconds it gives you, in my opinion, nowhere near enough, it's pretty damn awful.

Honestly Red Solstice's developers have higher standards than this, the UI is clunky as hell and takes up way too much space, I feel like I'm playing a 90s game in 800x600 despite being in 1366x768 and when you click on the minimap, the camera doesn't even view where you are clicking, it views the crap ABOVE IT, and turning off the coach tips doesn't disable the ""you built too many workers/fighters dude"" popup that appears once every game and it's. Just. Annoying.
Even Crystal Clash respects the player more, atleast the time inbetween games can be literally 1/10th the time because the game atleast fucking remembers if the player is logged into whatever cringefest of a server they're running, even starcraft 2 and Warcraft 3 also do this, like come the fuck on guys, seriously, how does THAT survive past Beta?

Honestly? I'd rather play an MTX-less Lottery Defence standalone game for 40 dollars than play this. Online only? Here's a thought, if you want to be reliably paid for your work, make a fucking patreon and get a grip. There are a million better tower defenses online right now with better UIs and almost no problems and a LOT of them are free. Hell, Bloons TD6 has some Pay to Win elements, but it still works as it FEELS like it should, unlike this game, but that's just my opinion. It'd be fun if not for the problems outlined, not a blast, but just fun.

The developers and their team are awesome despite being only a small team of 4. They consistently communicate with the community and listen to suggestions regarding balancing, game modes, and anything related to the game. They host tournaments with prizes for players and even host lower ranked divisions so everyone has a chance to get involved. 

The player base is not huge as it is a pretty niche game/genre, but I enjoy that aspect of it as the community is smaller than usual at the higher ranks and you get to know the community more personally. Player base is generally incredibly friendly and it is rare to encounter toxic teammates in this game.

One bad leak on a crucial wave and thats pretty much GG and I really don't feel like playing after that because its probably a loss. The loss of money and income from potential workers is staggering and snowballs hard. 

You can build more workers and leak or build more fighters and forget about income. You could save all your myth and try and force them to leak while they have the gold advantage. God I'm tired of games like this. 

Another thing I don't like at all about the game is forcing me as a single player to play against a duo lane. In the end it just lowers the chances my fighters are going to leak them, plain and simple.

The game is good, but the Matchmaking is hell. 
You tend to get grouped with new players in ranked and because of how the game works it's hard to solo carry a game if your teammate is new to this. 

You can use the chat and ping system but appearently most players just ignore it and refuse to communicate.

Worst part is that there is a report system, but you are limited in how often you can report (I think 2 reports per 8 games), and with how many players just afk or troll if you don't surrender when they want to, thats not enough.
thats probably also why there is so many toxic players, because you can't even report half of them...

If you have friends who play this or don't care for ranked modes/losing because of trolls go for it but otherwise its a hard NO

P.s.: It wasnt that bad in alpha. All the new players coming from other games, that joined on full release (with a lot more streamer coverage) just ruined the experience with their toxic behavior",1642576751,1642577224,False,8,1,0.487908393144607544,0,True,False,False

Again.  I assume this was sent as a mass message to all the players in hopes of drumming up positive feedback.  Beware what you wish for.

I have been playing Legion TD since it was a WC3 map and the steam version since before it was paid.  If I was required to pay for the game today, I'd simply uninstall it.  It's tollerable as a free to play game, but if I wanted to pay for toxicity, abuse and frustration I'd look at Blizzard products.

Primary reasons for changing my previous positive review to negative:

- The toxicity hasn't gotten better.  The higher you climb in the ranks, the worse it gets.  The lower ranks are filled with great players who are just there to have fun and don't really care much about winning big or progression, or are just learning still.  Manage to win too much though, and you'll be faced with a barrage of bs that will remind you of the worst of Fortenight or Rust.

- The new 1v1 match is a great concept, if matchmaking wasn't completely cluster-f'd.  Over the few days I've played, there have been multiple instances of going against the same player several times in a row.  Which is fine if you are evenly matched in skill, and better if you're winning, but to the one who's losing to the same person over and over, it just makes it not worth playing.  Eventually your ranking drops so low that you'll start playing other people who are supposedly closer to your level...till you start trouncing on them over and over, then go back to the same person who was just beating on you before.

- A lack of autotranslate or more robust communication feature.  With a game that is this global with so many players in other countries, the very limited in game flywheel communication system doesn't allow much in the way of strategy or understanding between a very diverse player group, and will usually lead to misunderstanding, irritation and repeated lack of victory.",1601426357,1641765055,False,0,0,0,0,True,True,True

WC3 custom maps were often these wild and crazy things for of all sorts of stupid ideas. You'd have 300 towers with all sorts of crazy synergies, you had no idea wtf was going on half the time, and you'd do something new every other game just to explore the game.

This game has none of that. There are hardly any ""towers"" (or auto-battling units), they rarely have abilities and when they do they're not any exciting. There are almost no synergies to speak of. Every game would be identical if the game didn't have completely-RNG ""rerolls"" that let you randomly roll available towers to build, another terrible idea that makes the game extremely boring after a while. You get like 6 available towers, and while you can choose some ""masterminds"" to allow you several rerolls, but even with the RNG, because the number of towers is so low, the games all feel the same. You use the strategy you've learned to be best so far, until you learn a better one and then you use that one instead, no real thought behind it, with the RNG ultimately making it less varied and more frustrating as you keep rolling shit lineups that aren't fun to play.

Game would be more fun with ten times as many towers five times as many available to build at any given time, with more mechanics and abilities than you can keep track of. Of course, that would be borderline impossible to balance. Which is what makes ""professional"" games so fucking boring. They have to be balanced to be good and serious games.

I think that compared to most auto-battlers, Legion TD 2 is the most dynamic. You control what mercenaries to send over to your enemies along with the mobs in the wave. You have to mind your workers because they give you mythium, the currency that allows you to buy & send mercenaries. If you purchase too many workers and spend most of your funds, you will be left with weaker defenses for the wave. If you don't buy enough workers, you won't have enough mythium to reach your opponent's King and win the game.

It's very strategic and you have to constantly read what your opponent is doing and adapt accordingly - there is no unique composition build that wrecks all others, and there's no single strategy that you employ all the time and it's infalible (veterans with 2k hours in the game might disagree but whatever). The balancing is also decent, and every unit plays out differently with their own gimmick - they're not just stat point sponges that are better than the cheaper stat point sponges.

That may sound daunting, but the matchmaking of the game has been quite good as far as I've played. You can always practice against bots or jump to the ranked play that will put you with closely ranked players. The newbie ranked players I went up against seemed to know as little as I did, and the higher I went (from bronze 4 to gold 3) the tougher the opponents were - with some being better than me, but not *that* much that it felt unfair and unbalanced. That said, of course players in a voice chat will have an advantage, but the matchmaking gives them opponents of a higher rank to compensate.

There isn't much content to learn about the game, but what we have is very detailed and thorough. I learned to play from reading the Steam guides, watching youtube videos about the basics from veteran players, and by playing the game itself & watching what my opponents were doing.

In-short, it's an easy to learn but complex, hard to master game due to mechanical complexity (splitting, sends, econ builds, damage resistance similar to Warcraft 3 etc.). It's a game that requires patience to learn and acceptance that you'll fail and misplay a lot until you finally start getting the hang of it, and even then you'll keep on failing. But for those who appreciate the strategic value and complexity of the game, it's very worth it.",1641055793,1641055793,True,2,0,0.509979784488677979,0,True,False,False

This is my first game I have every played with match making services ( I prefer to play single player or online co op with friends only). Overall this has been a pleasant first experience with a good game play loop. It requires a lot of thinking and teamwork to win if you want to go with the co op experience. I have never encountered anyone who was slaying slurs or being toxic. The worst most people can get it someone who does not communicate at all or someone who just leaves. The bots will take over for them which is nice. 

Pros:

Solid devoted community
Polite player base
Not pay to win (you can buy skins for certain units but it is only cosmetic and not forced upon you)
Nice and hardworking devs
Really addicting gameplay loop
Solid single player campaign
Sandbox mode to test out builds
A really fast, easy, and simple tutorial

Cons

Matchmaking can take up to a unit
Not a huge game like Dota 2 (1000- ~2500 in game at a time from what I have seen)
Ranked is frustrating because the only way to go up is in duos and partners can be non communicative and make you lose a match because you don't coordinate sends and king upgrades
Sometimes the match up can be a bit unfair (Two Gold 2s VS Gold 4 and Silver 1)

The servers are stable and people from all over the world can play and enjoy the game. I have really enjoyed my time in it and met some really awesome people. The game is worth a shot if you want a laid back tower defence strategy experience. It is very well made and has a great non toxic community with hardworking devs. The game would really benefit from adding new players into the mix so definitely go buy it and check it out!",1640014851,1640014851,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Theoretically you could play for the rest of time and never have two games even remotely similar, and I do have to admire the commitment from the devs to make something DEEP. Coming with that territory is of course the insane learning curve. I barely scratched the surface in about a 6 hour grind session. I was instantly intrigued, but I also haven't really felt the need to come back.

It has deep strategic elements and keeps it fresh through the mastermind mode (ranked) were you get random towers to choose between. You can never figure one strategy out and go with that every time. Instead you need to constantly adapt your plan, both to the towers available to you and to your opponents playstyle and stratey. Once you really start to see the depth and complexity needed to balance between safety and economy it gets very addictive and fun.

I would compare it to auto battlers like leagues TFT and add that its simply better. While auto battlers put you at the mercy of RNG through which heros you can buy and what items you get there is no RNG in Legion TD, you never feel like you got screwed by bad luck/or other people simply having better luck. I noticed other reviewers complaining that its a team game and will also add that in 2v2 I have solo carried many games were my partner underperform. The game is almost always in your hands.

The game has a ton of potential but also some game-breaking issues that need to be fixed before it becomes a truly phenomenal title. 

--------------The Good Stuff-------------
-Gameplay mechanics are very well made and designed. It is mostly a spiritual successor to Legion TD (HellHalt) and not like the DotA -> DOTA2 transition. That said, I personally love it. 
-There is a lot of relearning of timings involved as well as synergies, but once again the actual gameplay is extremely polished and I consider this a major plus. 
-If you are coming from Legion TD on Warcraft, after a learning phase of maybe 10-15 hours. You will absolutely love the game. 

--------------The Bad Stuff-------------
-Ranked matchmaking is ***COMPLETELY*** broken. The game only plays ranked mode in a 2v2 scenario and you are entirely at the mercy of your matched teammate (most of whom will suck). The game is so designed that there is absolutely no need for a 2v2 ranked mode and could easily have been a 1v1 mode as well where you could climb only on the basis of your skills. 
-Ranked matchmaking does NOT take into account your skill difference even though it is calculated. The end screen shows you how skilled you were (power score) compared to your team mates but will NOT take that into account while deducting points or handing out points in ranked play. It will only look at the win or loss status of the match - even if you drastically outperformed your teammate (or your team mate carried you through the game). The problem with this is that very good players can get stuck in bronze if they continously get mated with bad players during the calibration matches.",1639155227,1639155227,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You can see on your first match that there are some really cool unit/ability synergies that require experimentation and experience to fully explore and make yourself a better player. 

This is not a straightforward thumbs down. Looking back at where I started I can see how my skill level and understanding of the game has increased, and that's exactly what you want from a competitive multiplayer game. Looking forward I don't see a way to get better and climb the ladder without memorizing build lists/orders/wave mechanics and it feels so bleak. 

If you are matched against a team with more experience or knowledge of build lists, you will lose. If you are teamed up with a newer player who hasn't memorized some kind of strategy, you will lose. One of the worst design choices is displaying how many wins each player has while connecting to the match server. Seeing someone on the other team with a four digit win-count is instantly demoralizing and matches where you can overcome that experience gap are extremely rare. Having to sit through an entire match knowing you are under-powered and will never catch up is an awful feeling and sucks all joy out of playing.

The developers want people to learn the game by playing the single player ""campaign"". This whole side of the game looks and feels unfinished. The music for the campaign map is shockingly awful - a mismatch in tone for the game, and the music is mixed in way too loud. Some of the 2D art looks like its from an old flash game. The tutorial was helpful and I think the developers should scrap the campaign mode to expand the tutorial further. Maybe even add a practice mode where you can pick a wave and units to test things out. I learned best by watching my teammates play and copying them, again reinforcing how much power experienced players wield in this game.

My last novice opinion is that the overall game design is held back by how much it has preserved from Warcraft III. I never played the original mod, but as a former DoTA masochist I can see some obvious holdovers - the overall level design (lanes), the visual representation of the mythium miners (pointless and a waste of map space), and how the camera functions (snap to commands aren't robust enough for the huge maps and the movement of units) stick out the most. These things and others I can't put my finger on adds a clunky, work-around sort of feeling that smells of ""mod"".

I would like to come back to this game someday and I hope the developers will continue their work. Getting out of the Warcraft III mod mindset and exploring all the opportunities a stand alone game provides could go a long way to show off the passion put into this game and the competitive multiplayer potential of the design.",1638381147,1638381147,False,92,4,0.676664590835571289,5,True,False,False

[h2]Stop waves of enemies! [/h2]
In Legion TD 2 (LTD) you have to stop enemies that spawn in waves on your 'lane'. The enemies give a bounty for each kill, and with that gold you can buy new fighters in between the waves. The game gives a recommended value of your fighters for each wave consisting of the total possible value that comes spawning. Depending on the type of units you have put on your lane with all their synergies and positioning, this value can be either too high or too low. For instance, a collection of only tanks (units that soak damage well, but don't deal much themselves) will probably not clear a wave. 
The units that you 'leak' will attack your king! But not before your teammate's fighters that survived his wave have a chance to attack your leakage. The bounty now is shared between the both of you, and your opposing team also gets a cut! 
Units have one of four types of attacks and one of five types of defense. The types have bonuses and penalties towards each other, as seen on the ingame diagram, and these values aren't linear. A magic damage dealer will struggle against arcane armour, but will melt through nature armour!

[h3]Mythium and workers [/h3]
There is a second resource, called mythium. Mythium is used to hire mercenaries that will join the next wave of the opponent! Hiring mercenaries raises your income that you receive after a wave is finished. The mercenaries are dependant on the amount of mythium you spend how powerful they are. You can also choose more powerful units at a reduced income. And in this part is where most battles are fought. In recognising your opponents build to choose a wave to enhance. And of course synchronising your sends with teammate, however his opponent might be strong on that wave, so that may not be the best tactic. Another tactic is just to go for the best possible income, and deal with any opposition by shear value. 
You start with two workers that gather 1 mythium every ten seconds. New workers can be bought for gold. Your game is a balance between your workers and your fighters. It may be worth it to go a bit too lean on your fighters, and ahead with your workers! Purposely leaking one or two units gives you more juicy mythium, and if you are ahead on worker count, you will gain an advantage! 

[h2]The Legions & Mastermind [/h2]
The fighters belong to a Legion of fighters. There are Antelean, Divine, Element, Forsaken, Grove Mech, Noomad and Shrine, each with six tiers of fighters. Originally in the predecessors of this game you chose one Legion and battled with those. But this got a bit boring, so now you play with selected group of fighters from a random selection of all Legions. This makes for much more variety in the games, and less repetition. 
You can still play as a Legion in non-ranked modes. 

[h2]The history of LTD[/h2]
LTD was originally a custom map in Warcraft 3. I personally only knew and played the version of Starcraft 2: Squadron TD. I remember that I returned at some point to that game, and it was significantly different, with more 'Squadrons' and at some point a leaderboard. Very fond memories there, and I wish that map-layout gets implemented in this game, because I loved the shared buildingzone! 

[h2]Game modes[/h2]
Ranked - 2v2 games for an ELO rating. You can queue with a partner. 
Classic - 4v4 mayhem! There are more selections possible of fighters, such as the fully random 'hybrid'! Can be queued up to eight people! 
Custom game - games can have adjusted rules, such as high income 
Campaign - very challenging bosses which cheat! 
Vs AI - of different ladder rankings 
Weekly challenge - very hard puzzles to defeat a wave with selected fighters. The solution with the least gold value wins! 
Furthermore there is an extensive tutorial, you can browse top games of the best players, and can test builds in a sandbox.

[h2]My experience [/h2]
When I saw this game arrive on early access four years ago, I immediately bought it, which is rare for me. I have such good memories of STD, playing so many games without even a ladder! But nowadays I'm not really looking for an endless game, and not just ladder for ladder's sake. So the game shifted to my backlog. Now that the game is fully released since two months, I've got a clear goal in getting all achievements! The biggest part is getting 100 wins in one season in both ranked and classic! I'm practically done with the ranked one, and felt it was time to review this. 
The ladder is quite special. My first games weren't very good, so I got to bronze ELO (below 1200). Now I got to around 1600-1700, maybe I will try for Diamond 1800. For a physically handicapped player I'm satisfied, because some waves I don't have enough time to do the things I'd like to do. 
The players are generally kind. Every now and then you encounter someone who rages when you don't execute his plan. You are obviously the reason he isn't on top of the ladder, hehe! 

This game is a true gem! With a dedicated development! Do I have anything bad to say? Yes I don't understand why creating a guild is behind a paywall. They say only cosmetic items are available for money,  but in that case it's untrue. Yes you can also grind like 400 games to create one, my point is that a social feature doesn't belong behind any wall whatsoever. 

Play this game!!

Part of the reason I got it (and paid full price rather than waiting on a sale) was also just seeing the devs respond to peoples complaints, offer tips on the forums etc. Good on ya, saw mention it's probably very hard as a new player but big marketing coming and that came a few days later with full release, look forward to an influx of new players more at my level. 

I still personally find the campaign and AI battles fun. Learn, learn, learn in time for full release :) Competitive play will really have a high skill cap but you can still play lower levels and AI to learn and work your way up.

Update a couple of months down the track and now released: Great, enjoying competitive play, at around diamond 3 now and still so much to learn. Not really had any toxic players. Still a great game and good updates getting released.",1631426741,1638254455,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Because of that, I will be breaking this review into two sections catering to each audience.

TLDR: For first time players this is going to be a bit of up front work to get into but is a blast if you really sink your teeth into the competitive play, for returning players it is a refreshing look at the same formula with some significant changes that you will need to adjust to before you will feel comfortable with it again.

First Time Players: The game is on the surface fairly simple, each player is responsible for building units to defend their lane and sending units to attack the opposing players lanes. The game takes place on teams of two with each player being responsible for a single lane but being able to help clean up ""leaks"" from their ally and vice versa. If both players fail to stop the leaks then the creatures will continue on to fight your king and if your king dies then you lose. You gain gold by killing the creatures which attack your lane and through passive income which is increased by sending mercenaries to attack the enemy lanes or by using the same resource to boost your king's strength. This all sounds simple and digestible, but the level of depth and complexity in the strategy is immense and could easily be overwhelming to brand new players. Should you save your resources giving up future income in order to send a big wave of mercenaries to cripple the enemy team's economy or send the most efficient resource building units to out-macro them instead? Should you invest in your defenses to prevent leaks or build more workers? The game gives you enough tools to interact with these questions meaningfully, but it is a careful tight rope to walk and a few key missteps can easily result in a loss once you get to the higher ranks. For brand new players I would suggest leaving mercenary sends on automatic and just focusing on managing workers/defenses until you are more comfortable with the game, then start exploring options for optimizing the effectiveness of your offenses. I think that this is most of what should be known to brand new players but I would caution anyone who is not particularly drawn to RTS games or tower defenses specifically as there is probably not enough PvE content to satisfy those not interested in the PvP aspects of the game. That being said, if you have gotten this far and are still undecided you will probably be able to glean a bit more information from the next section, though it may refer to some things that you are unfamiliar with.

Starcraft 2 Players: For players coming from the Starcraft 2 custom map version of the game there have been some major changes that will significantly impact the way you play the game. First off, most of your knowledge about specific units will not be helpful as the units are mostly radically different in this version. For example Proton in the SC2 version of the game did pure damage and built up mana by attacking in order to temporarily increase it's attack speed but in LTD2 it does typed damage and instead has a near infinitely ramping damage that does not go back down until the round ends. There are other changes that have made the game a lot more user friendly though. For starters, they added a recommended value which allows you to have a pretty good idea about how much gold investment you need on the board in order to prevent leaks. You will have to deviate depending on what the enemy is sending, but for the most part the recommendations seem to be good in a vacuum. Another huge change is that ranked play no longer allows you to choose a race. Instead, you select a ""mastermind"" mode which determines how you build your team of defenders. The default mode, and so far the one I prefer, allows you to select one unit to lock and gives you five other random units. You are then allowed to draw four more random units and swap out as many as you prefer ending with a total of six units to play with. You can either do this right away, or wait until later if you want to swap out units that are good early on for better late game options, though I am not experienced enough to offer meaningful advice to that end. Most of the other changes are quality of life improvements that make the game feel a lot smoother than its predecessor. A good example would be that they have tweaked the way leaks work to make them significantly less punishing as long as they don't make it all the way to your king and instead of you losing loads of resources when you leak, your opponent gains resources instead. This goes a long way towards preventing the death spiral blowouts that were so common in the SC2 version.

All in all, Legion TD2 is a significant evolution over it's predecessor and if you are a returning fan or a fan of competitive TDs in general then it is a no brainer purchase for a relatively low stress and high fun competitive experience. If you are not a fan of TDs or don't like RTSs then there's a good chance you will bounce off of this particular offering.",1638082668,1638084305,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

with each update from the developers to change/balance meta it really doesn't feel like much but at the same time you can tell they are putting a lot of effort with each patch. the seasons feel a little too long and earning cards (cosmetics used for profile pics) is really rare. they don't have a currency that can be exchange for tower skins which is unfortunate but I get it.

The basic premise is 2v2 tower defense where you fend of waves of enemies and simultaneously can send monsters into your opponents waves. Very fun in coop. At the time of writing this, I have only played a single match of PvP. The core campaign, coop, and ai battles are plenty for me. I think one the reasons for this is the nature of the tower defense and intermixed rng lend very well to playing and optimizing your own game without worrying too much about what your opponents are doing. Given the rng nature of the game (you can start with start random units and select from a random pool for example) give the game lots of replay-ability. This is a prefect game for coop and for hopping in solo to play a game or 2 when you have like 30 minutes to spare.

Again the game has a shockingly high skill cap. To really climb ranks or play against harder bots you will probably need to look up guides on how the game is best played, it has tons of depth to it. To start though, playing through the campaign and some of the easier bots is very new player friendly and enjoyable.

I personally think 2v2 is more fun as it allows for more impactful and informed decisions in the game. 4v4 is still around as a casual game mode, though! Finding matches at the average elo range does not take too long. The Devs are steadily releasing patches and new content, the pace is a bit slow maybe, but it is a small team of 4 people so it's understadable. All in all I recommend this game as it already came a long way since the early access release here and there is still lots of potential.

It´s Early Access, but if you can´t predict how many people want to play and only have servers with very low capacity it´s a big disappointment for the player who is waiting for month. Thumb up, if you fix this quickly.
21.11.2017: Update: Game works now (hopefully for a longer time). Played two games. First game unfortunately with lags, second game very smooth. Very quick fix of the Server Problems and nice game.
21.11.2017: Few hours later there is no server connection again. Good game but don´t buy until there are less/ no server problems.
22.11.2017: Added login queue to the game, but it still doesn´t work. In rush hour you are only able to log in after several attempts. If you are able to play it´s very nice. But if you realy want to play don´t buy it yet.
23.11.2017: Game works better now. But sill waiting half an hour for one game and after that game crashes when i want to start a new game.
25.12.2017: The queue works pretty good now and you can play very good when there are not to many people on the servers.
I reccomend the game to Legion TD beginners and Legion TD (1) players, who have no problem with losing all the games and playing with very bad beginners. 
Explanation: If you lose the first games, when you are still looking how to play the new builders your rating falls down, then you play with some others at your rating, these are normally players who leak from wave 5 onwards or send even when the others want to save. Thats like a trap, beacause there are other good players, who fall down, so you can hold yourself on a very low level, but it´s very hard to get up again. You have to tell your team how to play good to win, but they won´t listen, and still do what they think it´s the best so that THEY get mvp or don´t leak or something else, and dont play for the team.
Nice game, but matchmaking must be improved.
03.05.2018: The game works fine, but I don´t like the new 2 vs 2 queue. They designed a good map, but the game was fun because we now could play a game, we could play only on lan partys with friends before, with friends against other players from all over the world. But with 2 vs 2 we can only play with 2 freinds together. That´s not close as much fun, than playing with 4 friends. And if we create a custom game to play 3 vs 3 / 4 vs 4 with 6/8 freinds we can also play LTD 1. The spirit of the game shouldn´t be that the most players hate 2 vs 2 and play custom games istead of ranked or casual, because they want to play 4 vs 4.",1511202687,1637868158,False,0,1,0.475208848714828491,0,True,False,False

If you haven't played either of those maps from the aforementioned games then allow me to explain.

Legion TD 2 is a tower defense (duh) that utilizes a defense and offense mechanic in that you can influence your income per wave by sending mercenaries to the enemy team's lane.  This improves your income between waves and allows you to field more ""towers"" which function like units and turns into an autobattler each wave, each unit has its own strength and weaknesses, allowing for varied styles of play.  The game boils down to managing your income with building your towers while sending mercenaries that counter the enemies towers.  The game has a surprising amount of strategy involved instead of just vomiting units at the enemy blindly.

The game is designed in a way to be entertaining to newbies and tryhards alike and involves a lot of improvement by the individual as a whole, there is always room for improvement and the game gives you every opportunity to improve with the various tips, hints and general information given to the player.

If you enjoy tower defenses I'd suggest trying this out, it's well worth the $$$ for it and if you're on the fence for the game then I highly suggest you check out a few youtube videos regarding the game.  It has a learning curve but it's still enjoyable while being on said curve.

Sure the game has its issues here and there but I haven't run across any personally and I really enjoy everything (so far) being obtainable with ingame currency and not locked behind any paywalls, everything is obtainable via ""essence"" and includes exclusively cosmetics currently (huge plus imo).

I would highly recommend the game if you enjoy any kind of tower defense or autobattler style game.",1637550670,1637550670,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is based on an old Warcraft 3 custom game before Blizzard destroyed that fine old game. It has been floating around in various forms for years and has even appeared on the Starcraft custom scene. 

As a result there is decades of game play balances and feedback which has been distilled by the devs in to what is one of the finest TD games ever. The  matches themselves are short affairs lasting no more than 25-30 mins but there is always plenty to do in terms of tweaking your build and looking at the enemies to figure out how to take theirs apart. 

All of this comes in to make an almost endlessly re-playable game which is great fun, even more so if you can recruit a friend/family member or pet to play a duo lane with for some fantastic double builds. Top game.

Leaving the old review below since some people found it helpful:

Definitely recommend this game if you're a competetive type of player that played this game in wc3 (or sc2 for that matter) and is bummed out about the Reforged fiasco. I myself was thinking damn I wished this game existed, then I found it a few months later. For me it's definitely a steal, especially right now during the sale. However, I wouldn't recommend this to you if you're just looking for a normal chill tower defense.

As far as the toxic community goes, im 15 hours in and I didn't meet a single toxic person yet, even though I basically ruined everygame I was in so far, nobody flamed me and everybody tried to help so far...",1588611482,1636913089,True,16,0,0.607490241527557373,0,True,False,False

It's not because people may have reported me even though I use in game comms/chat and they didn't but we lost and it must be my fault. It's not because ranked can match me with a random against a duo with significantly more ranked score than me. It's not because of RNG. It's not because of being matched with people having negative winrates against people with significantly positive ones.
     It's because of the crashing. I have done everything on the discussions forums. I have moved it from my HDD to my SSD, then to my M.2. Reinstall steam? Shouldn't fix it, that sounds like bogus IT Help Desk bull, but I did it anyway. Still nothing. Lowered my graphics to null. Have nothing running besides the game and a CPU/GPU monitor to ensure my $3000 PC isn't the issue somehow. The ""solutions"" are all completely unrelated to the issue. Update windows? Really? I don't even have this many issues with Escape From Tarkov. My PC bricks, the game bricks, the game bricks after I Alt+F4 and try to load back in. My teammate bricks/afks then constantly reconnects.

The developer banned a top player because he wrote an honest review and gave it a negative rating.  The proof is the fact that the review happened before the ban.

Also, the game is completely random.  No strategy or builds like the WC3 version had.

But I quickly found out this is less of a TD and more of an Autochess like Riot's Teamfight Tactics, which is not a bad thing but is quite misleading. I would say it's around 70% Autochess and 30% TD.

As for the actual game, it has a lot of complexity and mechanics that keeps me interested in playing, with a wide range of game modes from ranked to campaign. What I liked the most was the massive number of unique ""towers"" each with their own abilities, strengths, weaknesses, and synergies. This game is clearly designed by gamers. 

What I did not like was the team-play aspect, and this is really the game killer for me. Although it's 4v4 (2v2 in ranked), it does not feel like I'm playing in a 4-man team. It's more like I'm playing solo on the same side as 3 other people. You can't build ""towers"" with your team mates. You can't actively help each other. The only team play is if you leak, your teammates can kill your leaks (at which point you are just dragging everyone down). This might as well be a 1v1 game... or a 1v1 round-robin like TFT or Hearthstone Battlegrrounds. 

Sounds, Graphics, and UI is beautifully done. Nothing wrong here. Reminds me of Dota2 blended with League of Legends.

I would give this a ""Maybe"" score, but since Steam has no option, it has to be a No. I will check back on this game in the future.",1635690812,1635953989,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Games alot of fun, classic Legion TD in a nutshell. Played it way back in the WC3 days. My only gripe is campaign is more of a ""puzzle"" mode than a mode to playing with fundamentals of legion TD as a whole. The bots get super powers basically and you're stuck racking your brain over and over again to make something work. While I'll admit it has gotten me way up to par compared to how I was back then when I played this game.. It's definitely rough for newer players to differentiate the difference between actual smart plays and just a puzzle style system. 

I've 3 starred half the campaign so far. Tommy was by far the hardest because I feel its COMPLETE RNG, sometimes he just dogpiles you so hard its not even funny other times you can really pressure him, and pray he doesn't send the best units with the myth he just found on the ground. Mama Mayrna is pretty difficult because it shows the scaling difference of Income and she has some tight windows to really hurt her kind. The rest are just generally going against the grain to really flesh out a strategy to beat them, (I try my hardest to stick to fundamentals and not cheese the AI too so it makes it harder in general for me.)

But nonetheless I seen the premium currency can be earned via a little description on the shop, I do hope thats true. Would feel pretty bad to play the game religiously and never have cosmetics because people refuse to open their wallet for a game that already yielded $20.00 just to play, when they can play at any time on WC3. Hopefully not too many hoops just to get a couple cosmetics.

Other than that, its Legion TD with some additions, Round 20 is the max (as far as I could tell so far), Has a nice little rating system like the WC3 model had, has a campaign, vs bots, and other game modes which people didn't have access to in the past. Was really rough for new players to learn this game on WC3 cause it was a very hardcore, cutthroat community that didn't care to teach people and played solely to win.

It's easy to get into and relaxing as a newbie, but the game has a lot to master and seems concentration-intensive for high-end gameplay. 

For example, you get 40 sec between waves to upgrade towers, build workers, and send attackers to your enemies, which is a lot of time to do them at a basic level. However, to build the maximum amount of workers while spending the absolute bare minimum on towers to not get breached and determining which waves your opponent is weak against so that you can send attackers to breach your opponent, 40 sec + the battling time is a surprisingly tight time constraint. This high-level play is made difficult because each tower and enemies have damage types and armour types that works in a rock-paper-scissors system, which requires you to have knowledge of every unit in the game and to have quick recall/reflexes to exploit your strengths and your opponent's weaknesses.

You can also play more casual and just experiment with builds which can be rly interesting. There isn't much guides on builds online so you gotta figure out something yourself and if it works stick with it.

they added matchmaking, which seems to mean it tries to give you a 50% winrate. Meaning every other game, you'll fight some guy in diamond with 700 wins vs your 50.

The game was MUCH more fun pre-matchmaking (save that for ranked where people want to tryhard), where you were much less likely to get a GOD tier player, and if you did they likely had random normal players mixed in.

The game is very fun with lots of variability in the way you choose to play. The concept is pretty unique and refreshing and it is easy to pick up.

That being said; I am not a fan of the fact that your game is reliant on other people failing instead of you failing. The idea of a tower defence, at least is my eyes, is defending your kingdom, town, city or home. I often find myself in situations where I fight back from 4 waves of leaked enemies, finally getting my power level and gold growth back up to par and getting excited for the next few rounds to see if I can fight it back just for the idiot on the other side of the map too let too many things through and getting their king killed. All of a sudden my amazing comeback is pointless and my victory feels hollow, rather I would like to be able to play an endless wave for as long as I possible can manage after my opponents die, not only for some extra XP or in game goodies but also just too see how well the build that I envision will hold up.

Sure you automatically win when your opponents in the game die, but why should that end my run? At the very least I would like to be able to keep playing that game until I fail as well. Maybe this could be an extra game mode added in future updates? Or maybe I am just too new at the game to have found it yet, either way those are my thoughts.

The gameplay feels like Starcraft without micro.  There is still macro, economy, build decisions and build orders, unit positioning, and decisions on when to push economy and when to send units at the enemy.  

But you do not have to control your units in combat, no need to have high APM, or wear out your hands clicking a million things.  (That said, unit positioning is a very big deal, and controls how your units take aggro, so it is still quite skill based).

Alternately, you could describe it as autochess/teamfight tactics without the set collection minigame, and instead more focus on the economy side of the game, and when to use the ability to put extra pressure on your opponent by sending extra units.

The 4Vs4 is now 2Vs2 what kills the teamwork aspect that i rly appreciated.
Then they changed the Eco System so havy that the balance of the game hardly struggle now.

Besides, the cheater plague that once crippled the game seems to have been resolved, as I only encountered a single one in the 40+ additionnal hours I recently played, making the game much more pleasant.

I don't recommend this game for everyone. The game is nice, but things get boring pretty fast: apart from a couple units, most of them are used the same way and feel pretty generic, and the strategies available are pretty limited in number.

Pros
The mechanical game play of the units are fun to watch 
The Game has a Type system where certain damage types or defense types are wave by wave based are are stronger or weaker than others
The game has a unique currency system for during the in-game process where you need workers, mythrim, and gold to grow
The game has multiple decks to choose from each with their own unique types and play style
The Game has a 2v2 and a 4v4 game mode which is INSANELY COOL along with actually challenging bots of various difficulties 
The game has a up to 8 player party system

CONS.
When you are playing in a party with a friend and the game is over it disbands the party so you have to re invite friends which is just inconvenient 
other than a random 4 extra unit pool there is no actual ""deck"" building or customization
The game is a bit repetitive since the waves dont switch up or change
The store has literally nothing worth purchasing other than bot handicap match perks

Other than that the game is solid enough that I'd say it's worth getting

To the Devs if you do read this and think there may be a way to innovate game modes and a system for these suggestions
i'd like to see more units for decks and a actual custom deck builder in the game
also 1v1's and 3v3's would be super cool to introduce with bots customs, and 1v1 ranked
The store has literally nothing worth purchasing other than bot handicap match perks
so if possible input some new units you can use the ingame earned currency to purchase along with decks
The mercenaries are super well put so i couldn't think of anything to switch them up. maybe a upgrade after lvl 10 as a chance like the how theres a perk for the snail maybe there is one you can introduce for specifically mercs.
i'd definitely say that different waves of enemies {Except Boss Rounds} would be nice to introduce so the waves and types dont feel like i have to play in a repetitive fashion which in the event of custom deck building you can have a system of how expensive a deck is or what types a player may or may not have resistances or advantages against.
I'd say may in the late future have custom skins for units and mercs. in game currency

I was on the fence to purchase this after researching it and wasn't quite able to grasp the flow and control of the game. There's a ton of nuance to each turn and units you need to learn. I love tower defense, but am not a fan of RTS at all. I decided to take the plunge because curiosity got the best of me and I saw it had a well established following with the potential to grow. Also had growing FOMO about this becoming the next big new genre and wanted in on the first wave. 

Incredibly happy I took the plunge, this game is a ton of fun. I don't think this would normally be my cup of tea but so much about the gameplay works so well. I'd say there is a moderately steep learning curve to it, and after a week I'm only slightly starting to feel a little more comfortable understanding what I'm doing (and why). Something really interesting to me is that the waves are static, so opening strategy and placement can be optimized, but there is still tons of strategy and skill required. There's a lot factors to evaluate each round and each game feels different.

The launch product is very stable, has great newb friendly features (excellent tutorial/campaign, UI guides and references, well written in-game codex, etc), and dev team is super active in the community.

You can play it solo or with a friend and its a really nice game to chill and have some fun.

Its polished, and if u played the map on wc3 and enjoyed, u should buy it, since its a lot better and improved.

I do also belive the price is more then just, I'd pay even higher for this game.

But leting the wc3 fan base aside... Legion TD2 is a great game with one huge problem. Its very non-intuitive. 

Its really hard to understand the positioning sistem of the game, and units dont respect it, moving over one another because they have no collision, making kinda of a messy battlefield witch for me is a huge downside in a TD game and almost an unforgivable one.

The economy part of the game is also non-intuitive but a little easier to understand than the unit placement process.

The game competitive cenario could be better, because it does not have a single player Ladder match, and since the game is very complicated to understand, many, and seriosly... MANY people screw it up. From rank 4000 to 1000 u still find people who did not got how the game works exactly yet, and I dont blame them since those things are not very well explained inside the game or even showed properly by it on the screen.

If u really want to master it, u probably will need to read some guides or end up like one of those that think you got it, but did not.

The game has a lot of decisions for a TD game, making you think a lot if you did learn it and are facing someone that also learned it. Saddly this does not happens every single match yet, but its amazing when it does. 

Altho if u do take your time to learn the game, and if u do manage to understand it, I think its worth every penny. No other TD offers the amount of strategy and moves inside its mechanic that this one does.

I've only encountered two toxic players in 60+ hours of play, so the community seams polite enought, and should reflex that the atmosphere of the game itself is chill and fun even in competitive scenarios.

Sugestion for the devs:
-Add a faction ladder match, factions are fun, and would be nice if they made their way to the competitive part of the game.

-Add a single player ladder match. I know the game was designed to be a team TD game from the scratch, but some people do like single player matches (myself included) expecialy in ladder scenarios and I do honestly think this would make the player base grow and survive longer

There is a very big learning curve in the game which is maybe a little too much for a ""small"" game like this.
You have to learn:
- Overall the flow of the game and how to build an economy since it's unlike any other game.
- All 20 waves. Which are easiest, which are hardest.
- All 6 of the units for at least 1 faction. Their strength, weaknesses, synergies, ideal positions, possible upgrades etc..
- Probably repeat the last step for the 7 other factions.
- Learn all the mercenaries you can recruit. (There are 16 of them I believe.) Especially the expensive ones because some of them will specifically synergizes with a wave or counter an opponent's setup.

The game gives you a lot of help to go through that but it's still a lot and won't happen in less than a few hours.

And you can absolutely enjoy the game without doing all that, it's simply what I foresee myself having to do so I won't keep spending half of my games reading description.

And if you're like me, you're asking: ""Wait so a factions always has the same 6 units and always receives the same waves? So you just have to pretty much know the best setup for your faction and you're good?""
The answer is... pretty much yeah. You have to play around the mercenaries your opponent is sending but it might not change your core setup that much.

And that's where mastermind mode comes in. It's the ranked mode, the way I see it, the way the game is intended to be played. Instead to having a preset of 6 units, you get a randomised selection which forces you to improvise and adapt to what you're getting. To me that sounds very fun but it makes that learning curve all the more important to properly be able to play mastermind.

Anyway. Very unique game and fun to learn. Maybe a little too rigid in the way you have to play and learn it and very PvP/competitive focused.",1633995147,1634014026,True,1,0,0.507521510124206543,0,True,False,False

Gameplay is great. It has a lot of depth and room for minor optimizations, whether that's learning tower-to-unit match ups, synergies between towers, mercenary-unit synergies, mercenary-tower counters, mythrium and gold management. And while the depth is there, it doesn't feel like it gatekeeps the experience from new players. Its complex, yes, but also easy to pick up. Though, this is coming from someone who has played a lot of these types of games. The depth also lends to the games replayability, which has kept me entertained thus far. The number of towers and the randomization between them every game lends to matches feeling fresh while still feeling like you have control of your fate.

The general polish its pretty good for a game with this price tag. Has an (incomplete) single-player campaign, which is great to learn on without having multiplayer stress. Finding a online game has little resistance. And no pay to win or pay to unlock mechanics separating you from other players.

UPD: played it a lot after a year-long break, but it stopped working with update 5.0.0, just doesn't work on Linux via Proton anymore? Why doesn't this have a Linux version?

UPD2: It kinda works, turns out it is a server problem. After all I am still playing it, the game got better over time.

UPD3: I've sunk in over 500 hrs into this game by this point. It is significantly improved over last 2 years, works perfectly fine on Linux even on AMD iGPU. Highly recommend.

UPD4: Patch 8.0 ruined classic to cater to noobs and to reduce the load on server side. I'd say they need to revise the code or something and not to scale down the game. Shutdowns are stupid, if you're at the bottom of the list the game will still put you on fire and you'll feed extra gold over your leaks, this is just stupid.

UPD5 - 1 day before release:
I've played this alot over the years and it was quite enjoyable and it got much better with time, there are no more technical issues, but now it looks like it escaped from a cellphone app market and somehow ended up on Steam. The launch trailer is cringy af. I don't like frequent character rebalancing with constant nerfs and ups, and the fact that they've cut down workers in the game, so it doesn't reach the same huge and fun scale. There was a moment when it was very fun and resembled crazy games I've had in the original Warcraft 3 maps 1-2 years ago, but it is not fun anymore and looks like crap.

*competitive
*Td
*Armour types and attack types that can be the difference between winning and losing depending on how you build. Also worth noting that every wave changes the armour and attack types that you'll be facing.
*Teamwork and cooperation requirement
*8 play lobby based, two teams of 4
*Elo mm system that puts you on the leaderboards for all and for your country.
*Developers who love their own game, and play it. Who communicates(via discord) and uses feedback. 
*Playing the game hard isn't bad since there isn't a set way to play unless you decide to.
*Actually takes some getting use to. Have to put some thought into what you're doing and when you do it. That said, don't expect to just jump in and be gg. Let the game sink in. Don't rush it and don't expect to win all your games very early on without some knowlede or experience playing it.
*This probably shouldn't be a point but, Boss Fights.
*Amount of life for your team left does not matter., If you've played any TD before. Instead the game forces one of the teams to win, wave after wave until a team wins.
*Helpful community, most of the time x)
*Satisfies my cravings from way back, Warcraft 3 days custom tds, though legion was my favorite since then.

Pros:
+ Very addicting
+ Great unit diversity among the teams
+ Units working with other units abilities to be even more powerful is a nice touch
+ Great tutorial that teaches the basics of the game
+ The in-game coach actually does a really good job to help people learn
+ The campaign is actually very neat and a very pleasant surprise in this type of game genre
+ Mama Mayra's theme slaps

Cons:
- I don't know how to come back when i'm falling behind as it always seems near impossible to do so. You need money to buy workers to generate more income. It also leads to the enemy that you're attacking to have more reign to do as they please since you can't keep up with workers to do any real damage anymore, unless you save mithium for a few waves which only hurts more of your gold income and causes you to start leaking for just about the rest of the match
- Unit recommendations are sometimes more harmful than they are helpful
- Some teams you can choose are just greatly surpassed by other team options
- Some units have to be upgraded to be of any use or they are just a waste to put down in the first place
- If one side's king takes damage early on then the other team has practically already won with such a large lead

It's a great game and I would recommend trying it if you love games kind of like TFT or Dota Underlords, but it takes some getting used to before you can really start enjoying it.",1633853474,1633853474,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

PROS
I can go on about the games balance and visual design, which I thoroughly enjoy, but I want to emphasize two major points that secure this game as my current game of choice for relaxing with friends.
I) The Coop environment and accessibility - Want to run a competitive game? Bring a pal along. Want to play in Classic? Bring 3 pals along. Want to play the Campaign and practice up? BRING A PAL OR FOUR. I love this. I appreciate it. I am grateful it exists and gives my friends and I a multiplayer game with a lot less toxicity than our past titles. Thank you.

II) The Dev Support - Between REDDIT and in-game support, I think this may be one of my favorite dev-presences in an indie-title I've ever seen. I truly appreciate the availability and transparency of the Dev's, and I hope it brings more to this game and gives them the success they deserve. Keep it up, Devs, you're awesome.

CON
Mild Con, on my cabal of friend's computers, including mine, the main menu seems to crash on exit 90% of the time. I don't REALLY care, as I'm exiting the game anyway. But I feel like I should put in a CON and that's all I got. That should tell you enough about this game.

This game is closest to the auto battler genre, games like auto chess, TFT, etc. It feels really good juggling your own economics, making judgment calls on the units you place down and the units you send to your opponents. It has a lot of good systems here and it's incredibly replayable. I bought the game expecting to return it in the 2 hour refund window and at the time of this review I'm at 25 hours+.

Would highly recommend this game to those looking for an excellent cross between tower defense and auto battlers with plenty of room for strategy and tactics. For everyone else on the fence, use the 2 hour window; you'll get an idea in the first hour if it's your cup of tea or not.",1633780565,1633780565,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is good and polished competitive skill-based game. 
This is not exactly the same map from WC3. The developers have improved the game well and it is much better than its predecessor.
There is a wide variety of statistics and graphs, the ability to view the formation on each wave in the match history, etc., which is very cool.
Not as much customization as I would like, but with the release of the game there will likely be more in the future.
The game has a couple of bugs, but the developers are actively working on this.

I struggle to refer to this as Co-op. Sure there is another player on your team, but your actual interactions are minimal, in fact the only way you can contribute to the team as a whole is by upgrading the king, that is the only thing you share with your co-op partner, no resource share, no resource gifting, and the only way you can help with your allies defence if they let units leak. It feels less like co-op and more parallel play, you interact more with your enemy then you do with your partner, and even then, only one of the enemies, this is a 2v2 game where you barely interact with most of the other players.

Also with only one very plain map, and with the enemy waves always being the same (barring mercs), the gameplay quickly gets repetitive, especially after you figure out the order of purchase for your chosen faction. maybe some more map variety might increase the replayability, like some where the build areas intersect, or with only one build area you share, so as to make the game more interesting and co-operative, perhaps adding a bit more variability to the enemy waves, so you don't just autopilot through your fighter placement, and actually have to strategize about what to put when.

The first several hours of this game are by far the most fun. Experimenting with the different races, units, and exciting combos of these units can be a blast. You can almost always find a new combo of units that you didn't think of before making the game continuously exciting and engaging.

As you progress further and further the game then becomes more about optimizing the amount of workers you can reasonably buy while still being able to hold the opponents ""sends."" This is also means having a plethora of knowledge about what units are considered ""good"" or ""viable,"" while also having an understanding of what other units go well with those. Knowing what certain units are good and bad at so you can make up for those weaknesses with other units is a big part of the game. This ""meta"" part of the game is still fun and enjoyable in its own right to me. Knowing and understanding the meta, tends to separate the good players from the bad ones and I don't think having a meta is a bad thing at all for a game. I think it is actually quite healthy for a video game in fact.

Please keep in mind that I do truly believe that the developers put a lot of time and effort into making this game as good as it can be. This is by no means an easy thing to do and I would like to give them credit for that, as this is truly a great game.

NOW having said all that, this is a point I've always wanted to talk about for a LONG time. The content releases for the game are sometimes extremely slow and can make the game stale really fast. There aren't really any units that get added to the game on a regular basis and it seems to me like its been an eternity since the last new race came out. Maybe I'm just spoiled by other big game companies that can release plenty of content month after month but that doesn't change the fact that I don't feel like enough new units/races are being added to keep me playing the game constantly. I would love to see more content releases if at all possible on a fairly regular basis.

This brings me to another point. The patch notes in this game are sometimes the most boring thing I've come across. In other games like league of legends or something like Path of Exile, patch notes are something that a lot of players look forward to. Seeing a whole list of new changes, including some that can be meta breaking, even, is super exciting. The patch notes for this game tend to be something as follows: X unit is over-performing so were gonna take a little bit of power from it -40 HP from a unit that has 3200 HP..... Or even, were gonna give Y unit some firepower that we feel its been lacking +.02 attack speed to its .70 attack speed... I understand that some of these changes can be the difference between a unit holding waves 1 and 2 or not being able to hold them at all. That doesn't change the fact that I feel as though balance changes don't rough up the meta or try to make an drastic changes that shift the meta dramatically. Even for the highest level of play, being able to adapt to a constantly shifting meta is super important and I think the game would be more exciting if larger changes were made each patch. (even if it can be a little scary to add more than .02 attack speed *winky face*)

The game begins to stale out once you start climbing the ladder and you start to learn that the game requires some pretty insane positioning knowledge and memorization to perform the best you can. There is a unit in the game called the ""Priestess of the Abyss"" that heals for a large percentage of its HP over time whenever it casts its special ability. This unit plays a hybrid role of dealing damage while also partially being used to soak damage considering its healing ability. This means that to use this unit perfectly, you have do hours of testing and trail and error with different waves, other units, and such so that you can maximize the healing aspect of the Priestess while also making sure it doesn't die. Not that this doesn't separate the bad players from the good players, but I just want to point out that the game can feel really tedious after a certain point if you want to climb so keep that in mind.

I know I went on a really big rant about the stuff that I don't exactly like about the game but overall I think the game is 100% worth buying. Its super fun and will keep you entertained for hours on end.",1633557703,1633558228,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

[*] [b]Teaches you to play the game and helps you improve[/b]. This game has plenty tutorials and an ingame helper that gives tips on how to improve. This is a great feature for both newcomers and players that want to improve.
[*] [b]Party system[/b]. Queue up with friends for some 2v2 ranked or just 4v4 with the boys.
[*] [b]Better balancing and game pacing.[/b] There were some cheesy strats in LTD1 (mass sending on wave 7 amrite?) and the game ends earlier, meaning you can more ;)
[*] [b]Great devs that respond quickly.[/b] I talked a bit on the offical discord server, and the devs are quick to recognize problems and are quick to solve them. It's rare to see passionate dev teams sometimes, so I thought it was worth pointing out.

All I got was a SivHD recommendation and decided to try it out. Picked up on the logic pretty quick and the tutorials helped immensely. If you don't know anything about the genre or never played it, I recommend trying the tutorials, campaign and a couple of casual games and seeing if it will suit your tastes. If it does not, you will still have time left over from the 2h refund window.

I have only one very small issue -> When I started playing ranked, I was bombarded with too much info - pick a character, then form a team, and start your turn in 1 minute. I didn't realize I had to actually spend my gold in the same time frame as picking my team, which resulted in the game starting, me not placing anything and being kicked for AFK-ing... Noob mistake, I know, and I never repeated it, but I would like to point out that in my sub-1000 rating games many other players were repeating my mistake. Moving from the tutorials to the campaign to a single casual game and then ranked (which is recommended) I didn't know what to do!

This is not the LEGION TD you are looking for to replace, if you insist playing this as a successor/sequel then you are going to be disappointed because there's almost nothing looks/feel close like the old mod legion on WC3. From new players perspective this looks and feel more like auto chess.

[b]Full Version[/b]
I bought this game solely because I play legion more than I play Dota/Dota2 in general, and I spent a lot of time for both game.
Legion TD is generic Tower defense game, with WC3 Interface it's really easy game to play, EASY to play, but hard to master.

It's very simple, you pick a builder, build tower/units that you can afford, a wave of monsters will spawn, and tower/units that you build will fight the wave, if your tower lose then the rest of the wave will get to the king, unless your teammates can hold their on wave and killed what you leaked.

If only they made the name other than LEGION TD, I can accept it and play it as a NEW GAME, I remember LEGION TD mechanism, all the wave monster, type or attack/armor, when the good time to send, or how many worker/wisp I can push for lumber etc. With this game I have to forget all of that because new armor/type of attack is being used rather using classic name, even on the dota2 workshop that legion td mod trying to recreate that experiences.

- No builder, you just given tower to pick from the list. 
- No Minimap or map.
- Can't control king or whatever the title/name dev game to it now.
- Can't upgrade king after wave starts, so if your team leaked hard then nothing you can do even you have lot's of lumber or whatever name dev gave to it now.
- Can't see your teammates list of towers/units (or maybe you can, but I don't know how to see it)
- There's no multiplier in gathering lumber or whatever name dev gave to it now.
- The UI is weird, instead of using classic WC/Dota2 UI for hero/units/tower that put it on the MIDDLE OF YOUR SCREEN they put tiny stats on the top of screen, and we need to hover into units ability to read what it do. Why make it so complicated???

I am completely okay if this wasn't named as [b]LEGION TD 2[/b] so I can enjoy the game as it intended to be without going back into my memory lane how I used to play legion td, but this is not legion td and that's what makes me sad. It's not like LEGION TD it self is stopped being played, regardless what people says about WC3 (reforged or not) Bnet is still up and running, you can find legion match probably faster you can find with this game.

If you new players who didn't know anything about legion td, you probably enjoy it, specially if you like Tower Defense genre.",1633424195,1633486114,False,4,2,0.442694365978240967,0,True,False,False

Honest opinion : You might think 20$ is a steep price for a TD but if you're new to legion its not exactly a TD its more of a strategy real time pvp game and the devs have put in alot of effort into the details.
If you are a fan of legion td you will enjoy it , personally i consider it as a support for the devs price and while yes there is a shop in game there is no pay to win and they care that it stays that way so i don't mind it.

It lacks some rich content and somewhat the gameplay is really repetitive BUT you can't get enough of it: like a MOBA game. Gameplay is fun and you can always improve yourself as there are different units / armor types etc...

The game itself is basicly building defenses and increasing your income by sending units to the enemy, Also you can send enemy harder creatures but this means getting less income. But if you succeed to kill their defenses then your creatures can attack their king and you can get more gold. Also on every 10th wave you can pick a bonus. These two last mechanics mentioned adds game somewhat of a strategy aspect which can make every game exciting. 

Generally players playing ranked are all try hard so I cannot blame any teammate for ruining the game. Everyone is trying their best. Also players are not toxic. Some players just don't communicate and it can be frustrating since seding units to enemy at the same time can really change the wind of battle. So playing with a friend is not mandatory, you can also meet with really good players in the game and become friends.

I find this game rather relaxing (if you are not on ""try hard, kill yourself and try to win"" mode. Since you have time to think and strategize. You can relax, have your coffee and play it. I think it is really worth the price.

To Summarize:

THE POSITIVE :)
-a really polished bug free game
-a challenging TD
-good player base
-high replayability 
-makes you think and use your brain power to defeat enemies
-game seems balanced

THE NEGATIVE  :(
-some people can get bored after grasping the concept (i did not get bored myself)
-if enemies do everything perfectly then they start to get more income then you and the game itself does not do much to help you catch up to them. I would love to see League of Legends Style bounties that can help the guy getting destroyed having a chance (there is bounty in game but it is too little and really hard to achieve)

So for the price tag is it worth it? Considering even the possibility of getting bored, I think it is worth to buy and play this game with the current price-tag. In game market is only about cosmetics and doesn't affect the game in any way and it is a good way to support these guys. These are the guys that made this game as a mode to Warcraft III for free for years and everyone played it and enjoyed it much so I don't think it is unfair. So giving them negative review only for that aspect is somewhat over-reacting.

For the guys that played Warcraft III, what has changed? The game is bug-free, balanced, there is ranked option where you can play 2 vs 2 and normal option where you can play 4 vs 4 and some other modes. Graphics are more like Dota but it is, of course, better then Warcraft III.",1633296757,1633296757,True,2,0,0.528902530670166016,0,True,False,False

A little critique is the balance between fast clicking and waiting for the same, known waves. I think a few updates of the UI can make planing during wave fights better and help with the time balance.

Thousands of hours sunk into that game and still learning more- I can't afford to do that again. The game's tutorial is short, and hand-holdy, and for something this complex, it can't stay that way. 

Did all of the tutorial and tried a bot game. Suddenly I can upgrade my King unit, choose 1 of 3 spells which I assume are permanent buffs and whenever the opponent leaked, it seemed to have some units sat between the leaked creeps, and its King. I didn't. I didn't know how to do that. I don't know what these spells are. They were never explained. I don't need to know the best one to choose, but I at least need to know when I can get these, or have some idea of when I SHOULD. Rerolling my units? I don't know how that works. I pressed it, and then whenever I try again it says it's maxed out. I presume that means I only get to use it once per match, but there's nothing that teaches you that in the tutorial. 

The tutorial bounces you between a few different teams. These influence what units you'll build to defend yourself. Okay, cool, options are great, I do like this, but since the tutorial makes you switch the team you choose, you build no relationship with these units. You're picking them solely based off of what the next wave(s) is going to bring, as it recommends you build X or Y unit based on their affinities, being attack and defense typing.

I can't tell you if a unit is good or not, because I don't know. The combat is such a cluster too that it's hard, though not impossible, to tell what on your team is doing well, or what's doing the damage to you. Creep waves coming at you seem to have enemies stacked on top of eachother, so it's hard to tell if you're even winning, or if there are other units under the Whale that you're currently taking out. The Whales are damn adorable though. 

I'm going to fall in love with this game, it ticks all the boxes for me, but judging from the people uploading gameplay videos, guides, etc, it's for nerds. That's fine, I love nerds, I'm one too, however sinking a huge amount of hours into the game isn't something I'm prepared to do just to learn it. If I do something, it should be either explained to me, or clear, whether what I did was good or not. 

Other than the lack of teaching, I have no issues it looks great, but knowing what you're doing allows for a player to feel engaged and is massively important as feeling as if I have no agency over what happens means I may aswell just be watching. This is a game that demands you to search outside the game to be able to understand it. I appreciate the Steam Broadcast being up so that people know where to look, but this should really be in game.

I noticed that I had to retry campaign levels quite often, when I missplayed, to get all the stars. Therefore it would be nice to have a retry option to restart the level. As far as I know you have to leave the whole level so you're back at the campaign menu and need to klick a few times until you can try the level again. A retry option while you're playing the level would make it even  more enjoyable. (If I just haven't found that option please tell me)

Things I think this game nailed:

Pacing of the game. Not too long, not too short. 

Ranked comp from launch

The ability to work as a team to take out the enemy team. You can really work together to call in some powerful push combos

The tutorial does an amazing job explaining the basics



A few things that I think can be improved on:

More maps or map skins. It would be nice to have different atmospheres

More cosmetics/ progression to work towards

Multiple or mix up the waves so its not predictable (in comp in particular.)

I have a decent gaming laptop, but the default settings on this game would only work on a space-age ""hardcore"" PC. Right off the bat, you load the game and the UI is atrociously small for absolutely no reason. It's not like it makes the game WOW you from seeing more of the title screen. Nothing about the graphics are even that great, but you still need the latest gear to run them. If you can somehow manage to find the options screen with a magnifying glass, you have to go through 3 menus to find the interface enlarger, you have to immediately drag it to the max to double the interface. It's actually readable now, but it's still way too small. 0 times 2 is still 0. I then went to video and dragged all of the graphics options to very low and now the game looks like crap AND STILL RUNS SLOW. Mind you, I don't have the latest gaming gear, but I can still run Starcraft 2 on max settings on this computer without any lag. The only way to make this run better is by changing the resolution which they give you 20 different options on doing. Unfortunately, all 20 options make the game unplayable because it just shrinks the screen and cuts off more interface. Also, if you click any of the options other than the top 3, the zoomed in menu covers the entire screen and you're stuck and have to ctl alt delete to get out of the game and restart.

Was excited to try playing legion TD 2 and man is it not worth the money.
Like, it's not bad considering it started as a warcraft mod, but man is the gameplay boring and kinda bullshit.
It's one of those games where you can be kicking ass on a run throughout the whole thing, but then you suddenly lose everything in a single turn because of seemingly no reason.
Like, your forces can be more powerful than the oncoming wave and you'll somehow lose even though you've been demolishing every wave prior, which is mostly a headache when you're playing the ""campaign"" (I put it in quotations because it's hardly a campaign).

So single player aspects aside, the fact that you have to pay to play this game and then they also have premium currency that you have to pay real money for to unlock cosmetics is one of those disgusting money grubbing moves you would expect from EA or Blizzard, which immediately killed my opinion of the game upon launching it for the first time.

Then there's the fact that you can play as any single faction or run with ""mastermind"" which gives you a random shuffle of units to play with and you can reroll in match if you aren't happy with what you got.
Sounds nice, but you would think they would also include the option to just play with the units of your choice without needing to rely on random chance or being stuck to one faction (each faction has its strengths and weaknesses, but the best builds are definitely a mix of multiple factions).

So in the end, it gets real boring real fast and the lack of anything to make it feel like you're actually making a significant strategy or even anything to make it feel unique ends up with this feeling no different from any other TD game that you could have found in a flash game over a decade ago.",1633173628,1633173628,False,6,3,0.407785087823867798,0,True,False,False

Overall the game is really well done. As a new player I have some minor things I feel would make getting into the game easier:

 - Hovering a unit or clicking it should more visibly show what aura it has/what it does/etc. The top left corner has the unit card with its abilities really small underneath, but it really just isn't very intuitive or new user friendly. I played Squad TD on Starcraft 2 and it was easy to see what each unit did and how it worked. This game makes it a little more difficult to figure things out regarding specific units (primarily upgraded versions of them). 

- Please fix the UI scaling. Text boxes go crazy when you use it, but without it on 1440p the UI is hard to read.

Honestly that's it. Figuring out the units is really the only thing annoying me so far, everything else in the game is pretty intuitive. I'll update this if anything else comes to mind. Still a great game though, the things above are quite minor.",1633134774,1633134774,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Great game, you know the drill though. If you've played Legion TD its largely the same but standalone. Some adjustments to factions here and there but it plays similarly. I always played the same like 3-4 factions originally so I'm not 100% sure they're all basically the same.

In my experience, this is one of the best tower defense games out there. The Warcraft III mod was great and so is this. The only downside is that it has a steep learning curve. You have to know exactly how to spend your Gold to push workers at the right time to win against everyone. It's fun to learn how to push workers and find the right minions to hold waves.

I Loved the units and all and when I saw that this was in the making I was pretty hyped for a game to play on the side. I was there for the Alpha and Beta and played it on and off and I really like what it has become. The game back then felt rough around the Edges but it gets more polish and thought put into it with each update which I value a lot.

Gameplay wise, it's a Tower Defense-ish game. You have to survive Waves, each with different Attack and Defense Types. So in order to withstand the different types of enemies, you have to build a good mix of everything. The newly added Units/Factions add a lot to the fun, each theme is cool in of itself and offers so much more variety for the Mastermind Builder, basically a ""get a random assortment of everything"" kind of builder. This is where the magic happens and where the fun begins, when you get through that initial window of learning the mechanics and get to the point where you can just try shit out. What also helps a lot is the Campaign and Build Testing Support. I am currently hooked to beating the hard modes of the Campaign, which also give you good opportunity to actually learn and try out different things.

All in all, I have been coming back to this game on a half-yearly-basis and I enjoy it now more than ever because of the new variety of Units and their potential. Great to see this game come along so well and I can definitely recommend this game for Fans of Tower Defense of the expanded kind.

This is a game mod for Warcraft 3, now professionally done as a stand-alone game by their previous creators. We don't get games like this anymore.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

The main gameplay of this game is building your own lane while sending mercenaries to enemy's lane while building your economy with spare gold. A simple concept, but it is incredibly complex to master. First, game feels like a puzzle game. Waves are always the same. You have to figure out the most optimal strategy for each wave. You can pick or roll unit roster. Each roster will have unique strengths and weaknesses. This will define how well or poorly your early game will be and vice versa, how strong your end game units are going to be. There are plenty of openers which defines how well you can scale, which are your strong and weak waves. You have to learn all of it while following what the enemy is doing and punishing its mistakes. You can do a mistake by building too much units and not purchasing enough workers. If enemy is doing that, instead of sending mercenaries, save them for a bigger wave. If enemy is under-building and purchasing workers for late-game scalling, send mercenaries. This is how you are going to break through his lane and get free gold which will allow you to scale better and to ultimately overwhelm enemies with resource advantage. This interaction is very deep, it requires you to constantly see what your opponent is doing, know myriad of viable openers and nuances to them. Then build on their strengths and exploit their weaknesses in your opponent. First half of a game is like chess, it requires figuring out the most optimal build for any key combination of units.

Second part of a game is where you get a lot of gold. Where enemy armor and damage becomes powerful. Where your and enemy will have myriad of different units, different damage types and armor. It will become up to you to figure out against what they are weak, against what they are strong. In which waves they are going to perform well and poorly. What kind of mercenaries will perform well or poorly. Game becomes a lot more intuitive as there are way too many variables to ever to figure out. Gameplay changes from a puzzle to scalling. It is up to you to make most OP lane possible in order to deal with ever more insane waves. If neither manages to beat each other and game drags out, game will be decided by most insane build as they will delay and weaken waves the most which will cause game to be lost via attrition.

[h1]AI & Solo Play[/h1]

This game has surprisingly strong AI which will help you to figure out your strategies and how to play. If you would beat all non-cheating AI modes, you will be better than 70% of all players. Game also has campaign mode to play more casual battles against AI which is scripted to go for one or the other strategy. Game has tons of solo content and most of my time spent on this game was on solo content.

[h1]The Fun[/h1]

To me, the fun part is figuring out combinations, builds, unit placements. Figuring out mercenaries and for what they are good for. Game has ton of depth and literally thousands of hours of exploration. While game is static, your opponent provides a dynamic element which makes game unpredictable.

[h1]Game is not for everyone[/h1]

Some people might not like it, because it feels like a puzzle game until 11 wave and it is true. Your valid options are quite limited and you can figure out 1 best solution to your unit combination and to counter your enemy. Only later game becomes more dynamic and allows improvization. Game feels static and limited. You have to get hooked on desire to optimize and to figure out better strategies. This game rewards players who want to know every little detail about every unit and such information is needed if you want to progress far on leaderboards. 

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

Game is not for everyone. It requires patience, desire to figure out inner mechanics, to figure out best builds. Game is a puzzle game at the start and stacking advantages at the end. Game is very competitive and requires a lot of experience and practice to play. It is fun game for people who like those kind of games and a blast from the past. I highly recommend for anyone who has interest in such games to give it a try.",1629715598,1630922702,True,3,0,0.546827793121337891,0,True,False,True

My pros for this game:
- Easy to learn
- Offers a good range of support to become better
- Matches do not take hours
- Quick matchmaking
- Different playstyles are possbile

Cons:
- Way too random
- Not transparent how some things work (Is melee actually 100% melee or not, where sends go etc)
- Not well balanced, mostly due to RNG
- Matchmaking is quick but terrible (I had many games where I played frequently against people that are on my Elo but where 200-400 points higher last season. I'm aware that there are not enough players, but still...)
- Goes against logic and therefore sometimes frustrating, especially for new players.
- Some towers are just utterly rubbish, which is sad

Pros:
- can get addictive if you really enjoy these kind of games
- fast matchmaking, even though it currently has some balance issues
- really focused on the competitive aspect, so if you are a competitive player, this is the game for you. Sadly, the competitiveness comes at the sake of sacrificing some of the fun.
- fairly high replayability IF you are dedicated to learning the game, otherwise you'll find the game stale after a few matches.

Cons:
- slow content release
We were promised a new unit every 2 weeks, yet a legion which has a total of 6 units is released like once every 7-8 months due to development downtime and other issues.
- small playerbase
Game became 2v2 because of this, a change which arguably made the game less fun for many players. (This game is fun with friends, less friends, less fun for most people). The game is also pretty much dead during NA day/EU night, as there are only around 150 players online. So if you wanna play, I'd suggest you play during EU peak time.
- really STEEP learning curve
The tutorial doesn't cover nearly enough aspects of the game. You'll find yourself getting stomped for probably like the first 20-30h without having any idea why you lost/what you did wrong in the first place. There are not enough content creators providing quality guides for new players to learn how to actually play the game properly.
- ocasional client bugs
- toxic community
I guess this can be said about every multiplayer game. You'll probably find yourself the same toxic players as you found in games like LoL, DotA, CS:GO and others
THE MAIN CON:
- the price tag.
If you are really obsessed with this game, it can be worth 20$, but for ~97% of the players, it isn't.
If you really wanna try this game, it can be worth 10$ during the occasional sales, but even like that, probably around 50% of the players will stop playing after a few hours of gameplay, so keep that in mind when deciding to purchase it.

Honest opinion, you are better off waiting for WC3 Reforged, getting your Legion TD fix from wc3/sc2 custom maps (ignore DotA 2 LTD version, that thing is trash), unless the price tag on LTD2 goes down by a lot, or unless the development of this game speeds up by A LOT.



EDIT: ********I haven't checked out the game in ~2 years, but since I got a notification because this review got a developer response, I just have to point this out :)

This review was written way before I got banned. This review was written back when I had ~1200h played and currently my account shows close to 1600h played.
""0.0 hrs last two weeks / 1,577.8 hrs on record (1,197.0 hrs at review time)""

Only you can tell if this review played a role in my account getting banned, since the devs do have a history of being quite salty and responding negatively to critics about their changes. After a quick check of SteamDB, it seems that not much has changed in terms of this game's popularity, which is sad, with better management, this could have been a really successful title.",1542239247,1628765519,False,278,35,0.798498332500457764,59,True,False,True

I promise however to be as objective as possible in this review.

TL;DR : I love this game, there are flaws, but so much fun can be had while playing and most of the community and developers are always willing to help any players with their problems. For that I recommend it for you, but I cannot decide for you. Create your own opinion.

To start by stating the facts, this game is made by a very devoted team of 4 developers. The result is not perfect, there are some few bugs here and there, but they are very open to those bugs and encourage any report of them to try and correct them in the following patch. This shows the willingness of the team to make the game better and attracting to all new players.

Speaking of new player experience, the honest truth is that the game seems pretty basic (place towers and hold incoming waves of enemies while trying to disrupt the hold of your opponent), but the skill ceiling is incredibly high and hard to reach. You need a lot of time investment to try and reach the top of the leaderboard and understand the different aspect of the game if you so wish to compete at the top. There are also some tournaments for those top players if they so wish to test themselves amongst the best. However, there are many different things a new player can do to try and improve or just play for fun, like playing the campaigns, playing against the AI, trying to beat the weekly challenge or even play a casual match of 4v4.

For those who want to improve, there is sadly not a lot of guides to go to and for that, there is two main reasons : the game is constantly evolving and the shear amount of possible combination and situations make it too large of a time commitment for non full-time content creators. Alas, do not fear, the top players of this game are often willing to answer any questions on the discord or on their streams and even analyse your previous game to tell you what you could have done or improved. This case by case approach is not ideal of course, but seems to be working well for the moment. The community will need to adapt to a larger number of players but there is already a large effort by the community (including myself) to include content on youtube to help players see the game the way top players sees it.

Also, the rate of content release is expected to be very slow due to the small team that is working on this game. However, every updates are treated with special care, often asking the opinion of the community to see if the update makes sense in term of power levels, playability and feeling. The base buffs and nerfs are however carefully treated thanks to a large amount of data including winrate and playrate. These numbers do not always tell the full story and that is why the top players often gives their thoughts on the current game state and unit state through some tier lists. This further helps the balancing of the game. 

To finish, we need to address the elephant in the room, it is a competitive game and thus is not protected from the judgement of the skills of others and sometime can lead to toxicity. There is a ban system and chat restriction implemented in the game and is reliant on the individual reports of the players. Since the community is small at the moment, the toxic behaviours are mostly suppressed at least in the range of players I encounter (which I admit is a small fraction). Online competitive games will never be fully protected from that because humans are humans and they are as they are, but the system to deal with it is implemented and well functional. I do however believe that the willingness of top players and the developers to help the community is a proof that the game wants to minimise the toxicity and do not promote it.

To the brave souls who went through the trouble of reading all of this, I do hope it was helpful to give you an overview of what the game wants to aim to be and how the community and developers are committed to keeping this game in constant evolution by doing updates, promoting tournaments and leagues as well as creating content on different platforms to help the playerbase improve and grow.

I cannot decide for you to buy this game or not, but I do recommend it even just as a casual game to play with your friends, trying combos, playing against yourselves, test your skills on the ladder or goof around in casual play while testing different units and synergies.

The possibilities only stop where the mind of the players decide to stop, thus creating a possible strategy or build to emerge at anytime if only one player decides to go further than the others.",1628656561,1628656620,True,20,0,0.694121956825256348,0,True,False,True

The majority of consumers will not have played a game like this before. In many ways, this point should be taken positively-- this is a unique experience that tries things most players haven't seen before. Very cool stuff.
On the other hand.... This game is $20. Normally, if a game so unique is only $20 I would call it a steal. In this case, the game is a multiplayer-focused play on the tower-defense genre; while there is (in my view) near endless replay value, and countless strategies to try out and play with.... 
It's going to feel like you're doing the same thing over and over. Which isn't the worst thing! Plus, they have implemented a solo & simple co-op, meaning you can enjoy the game without ever touching the multiplayer.
But it's something that weighs on me when I want to share this game with friends.

'Hey, look at this cool game; it's like nothing you've ever seen and we can play together. I've loved it since it was a custom game on Warcraft III and I backed their crowdfund. I think everyone should try this super cool passion-project.' 
But I gush knowing it just doesn't look like a $20 game. Quite frankly, I don't think it is a $20 game. I think it should be $10 tops. At a lower price point, this rec would be about how everyone should pick this up and try it.
Since it's $20, the uniqueness begins to work against the game. You're paying $20 to try something new, which is great, but because of its uniqueness I can't guarantee it's for everyone. Because it's so small, if it isn't for you it just isn't for you.
If this game were $5, I would be yelling from the mountaintops about how everyone needs to try this game; no excuses, it's $5 for something totally new for you and your pals to fall in love with.

But it's not. It's $20.

So I can tell you I adore this game, and that it's great for a few short games or a 3-hour marathon of games.
I think you should try it. You can probably do the tutorial and try a few games before the refund time runs out. If you like it, it'll be a game you can always come back to and I think you'll find your $20 well-spent.
But it is unique, it is small, and it is $20.

Squadron TD was, and still somewhat is a fun game, but the irregular updates and lack of metrics or analysis, due to the limitations of the StarCraft II Arcade, kept that game from reaching its full potential. Insert Legion TD 2.

LTD2 first caught my attention as a Kickstarter project that billed itself as ""The first ever competitive TD for PC."" This successor, being a standalone title, allows the devs to incorporate any additions or changes to the game without being limited by the mercy of the original game engine. The inclusion of a global leaderboard that tracks ELO ratings to identify how I stack up among all players really helps sets it apart from others. Skill recognizes skill: ranked badges, from Bronze to Legend, are awarded to players who obtain higher ELO tiers, and displayed for all to see next to your name; these ranks are also present on your frame for the following season.

This game has come a long way since it debuted in late 2017 when it featured only four legions. At first, I was off-put by how slow the pace of the game was. LTD2 initially promised shorter game times than the competition (https://beta.legiontd2.com/featuresgrid/). In contrast, coming from STD, the actions or animations were lethargic and felt like they were being played 25% slower; battles during waves felt like they were unnecessarily taking several seconds longer to play out which dragged matches on for several minutes longer than they needed to be. I, along with other players, expressed similar resentment in the Feature Requests board on the official LTD2. The following patch, the battles were sped up some.

Something else I wanted was post-game analysis. A way for me to get better was learning from my mistakes, but LTD2 did not have much in the way to allow for studying you or your opponents builds and sends besides tabs in the post-game screen only available after each match that only listed what towers were built, and what creeps were sent on each wave; even STD had interactive video replays. I wanted more, and posted my vision on the same Features Request board (https://legiontd2.com/community/threads/view-previous-games-history.14564/). The devs apparently listened because wave-by-wave build tables and send data were present in-game on a following patch shortly after. The devs are also active on the official LTD2 discord where they respond to any questions or issues in a timely manner.

Over the years, LTD2 has nearly its legions from 4 to 7+, and also added some new creeps that allow for greater versatility in attacking opponents. The Ranked game mode currently features competitive 2v2 mastermind (i.e., randomized, but selectable towers from different legions) play against opponents with similar ELO, halved from the original 4v4 matchups due to a relatively small playerbase that could not support a short match queue time. At high ELOs, queues can run several minutes before a match is found due to the relatively small size of the aforementioned playerbase. For 8-player games, a Classic mode consisting of 4v4 matches with all legion builders at disposal against players of all skill levels still remains. Official tournaments such as the semi-annual Master's Cup, open to qualified players, promote sportsmanship and reward special cosmetic unlockables. This is NOT a pay-to-win game.

One of my few gripes is the lack of a Chaos Builder or Chaos Mode. In STD, Chaos Mode features a mastermind builder that rotates out every 4 waves with a new set of towers which makes things more wild, but fun. In LTD2, once you select your assortment of towers at the start of the game, you can only re-roll your towers, from a reduced pool nonetheless, once more throughout the rest of the game which places a critical amount of importance on the initial selection phase. As such, games can feel a bit static as you navigate through the rest of the match with at most a dozen or less fighters. On the flip side, the addition selectable Legion Spells or in-game upgrades on Wave 11 adds some spice to the game.

Overall, the game feels fairly balanced. The devs constantly provide updates to tweak overused or underused units to ensure they are neither too overpowered nor weak. Casual players may appreciate the diversity of different towers while hardcore players will study the intricacies and synergies between towers and their placements to ensure they operate at optimal performance. Players are rewarded for strategically saving up mythium and striking during vulnerable waves instead of brainlessly sending every wave, with options to upgrade the king if they feel endangered. With 7+ different legions, 21+ waves, over a hundred towers, and dozens of creeps, there's a lot to learn, and even more to master.

AutoAttack Games is a small dev team consisting of a close group of friends, but they are as committed as they come as they regularly respond to community feedback and improve the game with constant updates. The devs are active in the community and high ELO players themselves, so if you play well, you have a decent chance of running into them as a partner or opponent in one of your matches. New content such as single-player campaigns, weekly challenges, or new towers are being added regularly. If you are a fan of STD or the original LTD, please give this game a try.

The system rewards it and you get bullied into wasting time on games that are lost because you get reported for simply typing -ff if a game is going badly and you want to move on to the next.

If you enjoyed legion td in warcraft 3, you will probably enjoy this.  It's a solid game and was worth the $20, but the report culture is so toxic that I've decided to uninstall.


Edit:

I reinstalled because it's an easy game to waste time on while feeling like you're progressing. Unsurprisingly I encountered the same BS that caused me to uninstall in the first place.

It seems to be a bit too meta/puzzle game rather than a wave brawler. The waves are the same every round, every game and only by working out the puzzle of different types of attacks and different types of defense used each wave can really get any enjoyment out of the game.

All units are static and cannot be moved unless refunded and repurchased to a different position. As previously stated, the waves are fixed not random, so it can get repetitive rather quickly. I really wish it had more randomized waves and less of a static puzzle.

My second problem with the game is that it is almost entirely decided in between waves 10-16. Wave 15 can be tough and everything past wave 15 is crazy tough. 
I think I've had maybe 3/100 games decided post wave 16 and sometimes i find myself not trying so hard just to let the enemy survive and go on to the next wave. I just think the game goes from too easy to too hard a little fast and not much in between time, so it mends rather abruptly. 

More Spells to choose from would be great, you can get sick of the same few options. Big snails, health regen, extra mythium etc.

Although it has it's flaws, it is still a fun game. But it needs something more to it and more optimisation. 
(Although it is EA still)

I'd say that defense is far too strong on creeps early in the game, making it so that your build needs to be nearly exactly to fit it or they will steamroll you in the first 10 waves. This needs some toning down. That's my 2 cents.

The game could be a ton of fun, but I want to *play* it. I don't want to figure out the exact way the devs intended for each wave to be dealt with. That's them playing and me repeating. I've seen too many TD games get ruined this way.

You have to handle resources that result in either your victory or your downfall. You can win/lose early, or play the long game.

The game, much like Shrek has layers. When you first start the game you have a pretty basic understanding. Place your tanks in front of your dps and send units for income. As you play more the game peels back the layers. If you ever watch a high elo game you'll see exactly what I mean. Placement down to the square becomes crucial, buffs sharing to 6 units instead of just 4, tanks BEHIND the dps but still tanking, splitting the wave so that ""sends"" (what your opponent adds to the wave) go to one side and stop buffing as many units. Seems like the more you play the higher the skill cap gets from you. 

If you like competitive games, and knowing your the reason your team won or lost (trust me as soon as you leak or catch 101% of a wave you'll know) this is up your alley. I think the game lacks most in exposure. It has a smaller following (as of April 2021) and currently teeters on a balance of no one online, and the servers are down because everyone decided to play to day. I hope it continues to grow as it has and gets more server help.

All in all, if you like very high level tactics, a friendly entry level but brutal ranked system. This is for you.",1618086901,1618086901,True,1,0,0.502300620079040527,0,True,False,True

After just a couple of rounds I went back to the Warcraft3 Mod because the visuals were bland and the game felt clunky. I did not touch the game for 3 years, but I picked it up again recently and already clocked in over 200 hours. 

The Devs really did a great job improving the game over the years it seems. They stuck with the game despite the massive drop of active players after the first months after release (3000 to 300). 

That being said the game has a active community and getting into games takes about a minute even in ranked matchmaking. 

The game itself is easy to learn but hard to master, which can be frustrating for newer players. 
Some reviews pointed out that the community is toxic but I have encountered only 5 toxic teammates in around 400 ranked games (2vs2).

Difficult to learn. The unranked / classic version of the game - which is the only option to play against other people until you reach level 3, is overwhelmed by premade 4 man groups. There is no option to play the game unranked vs people who are also new, you are just matched with anyone and everyone. 

If matchmaking is fixed, the game itself is fun, complex to learn with many different tactics and strategies. But unfortunately until any fix is made, I'll be constantly losing to a 4 man group of German players with 1000+ hours.

UPDATE:

The additional options of solo and co-op campaigns allow you to learn the game without the frustration of being matched against higher skilled players

Classic is still quite overwhelmingly experienced players and groups, however with the offline content, you can learn how to play to combat these individuals. 
Ranked is definitely balanced and you will play people of similar skill levels to you

At worst, it's an unbalanced turd that you shouldn't buy into unless you can get it on a sale for /maybe/ five bucks.  Even then, within about 20 or 30 games, you've seen everything you're ever going to see.  

One of the chief problems with the game is just how obsolete most of the ""towers"" you can build are.  There's a select few strategies that work, and everything else is a novelty at best.  There's also nothing, absolutely nothing, segregating experienced plays from the new ones, and because this game has such a steep learning ceiling wrought with nuance, the winner of the game is almost always decided by the tenth wave.  From there, you're simply entertaining the players that are having a blast spanking you around.

They've attempted to implement mechanics that balance out the disparity between players, but it, simply put, does not work well, in fact, in 20+ games I've played since the update that introduced the mechanic, I've never, absolutely ever seen it make any sort of different, no matter whether you're on the receiving end of the winning team, or you're the ones winning.

Do not let the positive reviews fool you - the game is fun, almost addicting even in the same way those old Battlenet custom maps were - but the reality is that people tend to review this game while still in that very, very short ""honeymoon"" phase, rather than giving it about 30-40 or more hours to adjust and learn the nuances of the game.

At the end of the day, unless you can find a full group of four players to team up with and learn the game with, I wouldn't waste my time.  Games like this -never- balance out.  When a single player can ruin your entire experience and force a loss, you know you've discovered a stinker.

I could honestly go on and on about the negative aspects of this game - but I simply just don't want to invest that much into it.  If you're reading this, chances are you've already made up your mind one way or the other anyway.  There are better games out there that do this much better.  If nothing else, wait till it fully releases and they have (hopefully) improved the game and balanced it out.  

I suspect this game will never fully release and will fade into obscurity like most games of this caliber do.  Which is why I encourage you to only purchase this when it's on sale - if you're /that/ headstrong about buying into it.

The game is very similar to aforementioned mod. 21 waves, build 'towers' to defend the waves and send mercenaries to thwart your opposition.

Game option are 2v2 Mastermind (ranked) and 4v4 Classic (unranked) and a Custom Game section
I have only played the 4v4 Classic section at this stage. A new feature is the ability to 'roll' and get a new set of towers to exchange with your existing ones.
There is also the option to play against the AI and a Sandbox mode for trying out builds.

In my experience it takes about 1-2 minutes for a 4v4 games to start once queuing. I work normal hours for the UK so this may be peak times, i can't speak for daytime queue lengths.

Game modes are unlocked by earning Essense which you get from playing the game - there is Premium Essence (which you buy) to unlock cosmetics.

Chaos and Hybrid builders are available to buy with Essense, along with Mastermind perks - one being 5 income per wave and the other 3 income per wave + 2 re-rolls. I haven't played mastermind yet, but my understanding is you roll 10 towers and need to pick 6 to play with and this is the format for ranked 2v2 play.

Another great feature is your Match History where you can see what builds people used, sends and leaks, wave by wave. 

I have not been playing ranked but so far I have not experienced any toxicity in the community.

There is a Discord where the developers are both active and extraordinarilly responsive to issues.

Not to say it's a bad game, it's just shit no matter how you slice it.

1). Horrible ratio of tutorial vs complexity.  It's like the tutorials, by design, are only meant for bot play.

2). Severe imbalance.  There are units(""Towers"") that are practically and effectively worthless.  I expect better from a game in EA for a year, let alone the 3 years this title's been milking.

3). Homogenized factions.  I don't know why they chose this mix'n'match method, but it basically makes the game get old a lot faster because there's no identity.  You play starcraft, age of empires, or any strategy game.  Each race/faction/etc feels unique.  Mix'n'match just pressures the devs too much to over-nerf certain units, over-buff others, and every single new faction introduces new broken synergies that constantly breaks what I can only loosely call ""The meta"".

Is it worth $10 bucks?  Yeah, probably.  It captured my attention long enough that I'm still iffy on whether I wasted the money or not.  $20 is a fuckin' scam, though.",1609218602,1609218602,False,1,0,0.34161493182182312,1,True,False,True

If you are looking for an autobrawler type of game to replace some thing like Dota Underlords, TFT, Dota Autochess, etc, that has less RNG mechanics and more skill based play then this is the game for you. I definitely can't go back to something like Underlords after playing this; this is just a better game in most ways. The constant battle pass update screen after a match finishes and heavy RNG mechanics in Underlords (as well as constant meta shifts and other bad changes to the game) have ruined it for me. I am glad that I have discovered this game that doesn't have battle passes, has minimal RNG, has the depth of strategy that and RTS game has, and has a mostly balanced meta. I understand why this game has 'tower defense' in the name, but its more of a hybrid between an autobrawler and turn based strategy game.
The gameplay is just a little bit stale to me. Comebacks in Legion TD are hard to pull off because falling behind means a very difficult uphill battle and since this is a team based game, one player on your team can cause the entire team to fail and you often feel hopeless in trying to help that player catch up because you can't do anything like sending some of your troops or gold to protect them like you can in an RTS game to defend them while they build their economy and army up. All you can do in this game is catch their leaks but you have no option to help the player get back to their feet. Another thing that makes the gameplay stale to me is that you can't easily rearrange your army. Once you place a troop down, it stays in that spot for the rest of the game unless you sell it and repurchase it which will drag your economy. Similar autobrawler games let you rearrange your individual unit's placement. This lets the player react to the opponent. In this game each wave is static staying the same every match, but your opponent can use their economy to send extra attackers and if my opponent seems to have a favorite attacker like maybe they love to send lizard spams or maybe Froggo witches are strong against my composition so they keep sending those every wave, I would have so much more fun if I was enabled to rearrange my units to try to make it so my opponent has to start trying a new attack strategy on me instead of feeling oppressed by my opponent doing the same thing every wave while I wait to get enough gold to add to or upgrade my army enough to overcome it. Because I can reroll my available units to gain access to some different units, I often wish I could rearrange my placement mid match and I feel like the depth of the game is retarded by not allowing dynamic repositions between waves. This servers in this game also aren't good enough to have things like leavers penalties. Too many times I have had a game lag out when the match ends and either mine or my opponent team's King will be left at 1 or 2% health instead of dying and the game gets stuck then I am sent to the main menu and get a warning about being AFK or abandoning a match. I know that my connection is fine and I don't expect the servers to be as stable as big games that have dedicated servers and huge budgets, but it is very frustrating to get penalties when I know I am not at fault. Unless the servers either become a lot better or penalties are removed from casual game mode I will never suggest this game to other people knowing that there's a possibility of them getting temporary and permanent bans for issues that they are at no fault for.",1609041397,1609041397,False,36,2,0.615381479263305664,0,True,False,True

Game Economy - Simple explanation of currencies and what they are used for.
1. You build your towers with gold.
--- Gold is earned from killing monsters in waves, and sending monsters to your opponents.
2. You gather resources similar to mineral mining in StarCraft with a miner.
--- This is the currency you use to send monsters to your opponent. 
--- You gain gold income from sending monsters to your opponents.

frequent patches and nice qol changes in between. if you liked the wc3 td maps then you will like this game aswell.


personally i like the new 2on2 mode, but i understand the people complaining about the remove of the 4on4.
these people need to understand that the game is early access and the playerbase is not big enough to provide a fair 4on4 mode YET. im sure with a growing playerbase there will be an option to switch between playing 2on2 or 4on4 both casual and ranked.

Edit (30.05.18): I was looking really forward to the updates and patches but lately they have been very disappointing. Still no 5th legion (2 units released atm) and no words from the developers if 4on4 is ever coming back, especially since the playerbase shrinks everyday. Right now i cant recommend the game for 20€ anymore (get it for 10€ max) because the replayability is lacking due to limited units and the unbalanced 2on2 matchmaking.

Balance patches happen often here! bugfixes and shit like that is always super fast too. 

theres a surprising amount of depth in strategy. passive income, workers, mercenaries, king upgrades, when and what to send change every match. The community is mostly super friendly, and muting people that arent is also super easy :D  

Its my favorite game to not only play casually when ive got just a bit of time, but to also play obsessively with friends in either classic 4v4 or the ranked 2v2 modes.

Developers try their best, to communicate with the community and give answers to questions.

 The balance of this game is still terrible. Tier 1 and 2 towers for most factions are just not good, most are either spammable or literal trash. As far as offense goes, the 40-100 tier sends are way more powerful than they have any right to be. Aura sends in general are cancer.

Improve the balance of this game. tier 4-6 towers should not be buildable in the early 2-5 waves when t1-2 towers are generally trash unless massed. There are too many tanky t3-5 towers that can carry the early game while building an economy, yet literally everything falls off in the face of the DPS of rounds 16+. The gold costs of everything in this game are completely off when a tier 4-5 unit can be build round 1 yet dumpstered in the late mid game.

I'll leave my launch review below for posterity's sake.

Do not buy this game. Go download Starcraft 2, since it is free now, then play the custom mod ""Squadron TD"" It's the same game, only with more race options, better balance, and withoutLegion TD2's terrible animations and client issues. In 1 out of ever 6ish games I played leaving the post game lobby treated me as if I had quit a game in progress. Regardless of if I had won or lost the game before it treated me as if I had quit early. I'm sure this will be a great game one day once the other races are added and balance is smoothed out.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Legion TD 2 is a game where you have to fight monsters each wave to protect the king. You do this by placing down fighters or ""towers"" in your lane. You gain 6 towers when you select your ""Legion"", your class. All Legions have their own unique towers, and some towers have special abilities like taking less damage or healing allies.
Whenever you kill the monsters in your lane you gain some gold. However if you are unable to kill all the monsters and your towers die then you ""leak"". Your monsters will go to your king. If your ally was able to kill all his monsters, then his towers are teleported to the king to defend. If you and your ally are both unable to defeat the monsters, they will attack the king and the enemy team will get even more gold.

But how can I make my enemy leak? This is where workers and mercenaries come into play. You can spend gold to buy a worker, and that worker will gather ""mythium"" over time. These crystals are used to hire mercenaries that will attack the enemy lane. Some mercenaries are simple, however others have special abilities like slowing the attack speed of an enemy tower or healing monsters that attack the enemy. Use these to your advantage to make the enemy player leak.

Mercenaries also give some ""income"", however mercenaries with abilites give a little less. Income is gold that is given to you at the end of each round. Income is important because otherwise you won't have enough gold to kill the monsters and mercenaries in your lane. However, do you save some mythium this round so you can try to send a stronger mercenary next round to make the enemy leak? [u]That's where the game starts to become really fun.[/u] You have to manage both your income and how much mythium you save to get stronger than your opponent and win the game. However, I recommend that you don't save too many rounds because then you will lose out on a lot of income.

You can also use mythium to upgrade the king. So when you leak and the king gets attacked, he will have more damage, heal more and deal more damage with his spell.

Something else you need to keep in mind is that all creatures have an attack and defense type. Pierce attacks are good against Swift and Arcane creatures, however creatures with Fortified or Natural defense take less damage. So try to make sure that you have all attack and defense types covered, and try to build the right attack and defense against the monsters that will attack you next round.

Finally, there are ""Legion Spells"". These are randomized every game and are unlocked at round 10. These can give gold, mythium, income or some neat effects. Do you want to overwhelm the enemy? Take Press the Attack or All Out Assault, which gives a big amount of mythium so you can send bigger mercenaries. Do you want your towers to heal whenever they attack? Then take Vampire, which makes it heal 20% of the damage dealt. Do you want [b]big[/b] snails to be sent to your opponent? Get Giant Snails so make these little critters a fiersome nightmare.

[h1]What makes it fun?[/h1]
This game is all about holding the enemy monsters and mercenaries, and making your opponent leak. This means you have to be very creative with what towers you use. Is your opponent mostly using Magic attack type towers? Then send on a wave where there are Arcane defense monsters and make the opponent leak, making him lose gold and giving you some extra gold. That gold can be spent by building even more towers, which allows you to hold the monsters and mercenaries in your lane. Over time you will gather enough of a lead to defeat the opponents and end the game.

Does your tower deal a lot of damage? Maybe I should place down a tower with an ""aura"" right next to it to give an effect that heals it whenever it deals damage. Or do I built a defense that is weak this round, so I am very strong next round? Do I save some mythium now, so I can send a very big mercenary next round?
These are all aspects of the game that take a little while to learn, however when you do understand these mechanics then the game becomes extremely fun.

[h1]What keeps it new?[/h1]
Probably the top #1 what makes this game good is the ""Mastermind"" legion. This gives a roll of 10 random units that you can pick from. This means that each game you play is somewhat different. You will also learn about all the towers in the game, which means that you will discover new strengths and weaknesses that give you a small advantage against your opponents. Also notice that in competitive play (Ranked) all players are locked into Mastermind, making not only your rolls but all players rolls unique and different.

Besides that, the game is constantly changing and updating. Currently they are busy designing a new legion, Divine, and whenever they finish a new tower they publish it and allow you to play it early in Mastermind. This allows you to experiment with new tower and test out new tower combinations, keeping the game fresh.

[h1]What is the game missing?[/h1]
[b]Daily/Weekly/Monthly content[/b]
This is my biggest problem with the game. Please give us some basic quests that we can complete daily, like ""Reach Wave 15"" or ""Have 100 Income at the end of the game"", which will spice up your playstyle a bit. We already have some form of weekly content, a single player mode called the ""Weekly Challenge"" where you have a set amount of towers and you need to hold the enemy monsters and mercenaries which quite a few people like. However, I think it's quite boring and usually I just beat it for the reward and I don't try to improve my high score. Instead, give us special challenges where you have to defeat monsters from wave 2 and 8 together. Or maybe we have to fight a single king-sized unit from wave 18, with increased stats and maybe even special effects. Just give us something new, not ""yes play ranked but solo and you have to win this round"". A weekly and monthly quest would also be nice, like ""Win 7 games"" (weekly) or ""Beat the Weekly Challenge 3 times"" (monthly). Maybe give a very small amount of premium currency for the monthly challenge to keep people engaged.

For me, this is the bigget why I don't play the game that much (only 750 hours compared to 1000/2000 hours played by people in my friends list).

[h1]Would I recommend the game?[/h1]
Definitely! The gameplay is fun and they are constantly adding new content and changing the game. The developers are great and I've had a few conversations with them, both on the forums and private chat. They are daily active on the forums and they have a special Discord channel where you can ask all kinds of questions about the game. A lot of players are very nice and forgiving, however like all competitive games you will have some bad apples here and there. 2020 was a good year, since a [b]lot[/b] of new content was added to the game, and it can only go up from here.",1607116051,1607116051,True,20,0,0.641543447971343994,0,True,False,True

I started playing this on Warcraft 3 custom games and recently found TD 2.

You'll have the same fun as the WC3 custom game without people leaving randomly and actual stats to look at.

For everyone that left a negative review about this awesome game.

1. Any competitive game is going to have toxic players
2. You can't except to be bottle fed Gold rank 
3. There is real mechanics and you have to play it order to understand it
4. I have not seen one major bug yet
5. The Devs constantly update with balance updates and MINOR bug fixes

To combat toxic players there is a report in game that works, and a player behavior score attached to your account. The majority of players I played with at the start helped me understand and they are friends I now play with regularly.

The pool of players are quite limited and you may play against the same opponent consecutively. For toxicity wise, I did not encounter a single toxic player from all my games so far. The gameplay is amazing, with a wide array of strategy to learn from. The UI is simple but gets the job done. 

While there is a tutorial provided for beginners who have joined the game, it doesn't really go in depth in explaining it. As such, beginners will probably fumble about in their first few games until they got the gist of it, provided that they haven't refund the game yet.

The 'store' feature has also not been implemented yet but is not much of an issue as it doesn't impact the gameplay at all.

I was surprised. Yes, the game plays like I thought it would, but there is really a good amount of strategy here. You have to learn which guys to summon at which time, where to place them, how the various waves will bend to the right or left, do AOE, fast attack, tank, or ranged, as well as the rock paper scissors game of dmg type vs armor type. Then plan on how much to invest in your immediate needs vs buying workers which give you a secondary resource that you can screw over your enemy with and boost your own long term economy with.

The game plays like this (In Ranked):

At the start you pick your roster from a random set, making sure you have different damage types and defense types covered, while looking for synergy or combos. At wave 10 you also get 3 spells to choose 1 from and which 3 you will choose from is also available at the start, so you can take that into account.

Then you place minions before the wave starts trying to have just enough offense and defense to overcome the wave, but also trying to guess if your opponent will send extra baddies at you based on what they did previously. Each minion you place costs gold, which accrues as you defeat the wave, kill the opponents baddies they send, and when your both your opponents fail to hold their waves and their king gets damaged.

You also have the option to send extra baddies at your opponent. It costs a second resource to do so, called mythril. The baddies you send have different abilities that synergize with different waves and counters different opponent setups. These baddies will also boost your economy a little or alot as you buy them. So you can play the compound interest game, or try to take advantage of your opponents while they are vulnerable. It's all very push pull timing , making judgement calls on what is going to reap you the most rewards and/or win the game and when.

You win by breaking through and taking out their king.

Oh, and they can also spend mythril to make their king stronger, so it attacks and defends better vs the baddies that break through. So that is another decision that has to take place each wave. Are they going to break through?

It really has quite a bit of decision making and working with your ally. I always say, the more decisions a game has, the better. This game is great for some 30 minutes spurts, of strategic goodness. For the price tag being so low, I've gotten at least an hour for every 10 cents. Highly recommend!",1589645527,1589681776,True,2,0,0.452081888914108276,0,True,False,True

Well, spoiler alert, I like this game. A lot. And I like it most for what it isn't: Legion TD2 is not your typical TD experience. You're not building a maze, nor are you placing static towers along a preset path. You're also not playing alone - you are but one person on a team that is competing against another team for survival.

So what ARE you doing? Making tactical decisions. Choosing carefully which fighters to place and where (don't be fooled - the lack of mazing doesn't diminish the importance of proper placement). Managing resources. Scouting your opponents to try and anticipate their next move. Losing a lot while learning, but getting better and better with every game. Figuring out when to push economy vs when to build up defenses. Sending mercs into their lanes while dealing with their mercs that were sent to yours.

The devs have made valiant attempts to make this game accessible, but there's no denying it has a steep learning curve. Expect to spend several hours across multiple defeats before things start clicking and you start building more efficiently. This game is all about nuance and has incredible depth for those who are willing to put in the time and effort. Don't be afraid to ask questions - there's an official forums, a discord server, and an in-game chat.

-match making is v fast, -pretty hard but winnable, - great pvp, -lots of builders and play styles

Coming from someone who played Legion TD on WC3 over 15 years ago for a very long time, Legion TD 2 is basically that but streamlined and refined in every way - Lumbering is more straight forward, easy to build your team, i absolutely love it and it's so addictive; 8 hrs disappeared before i knew it while i was playing with a friend that i used to play WC3 legion with back in the day. Matchmaking is super quick too. It's a more fast paced game than the original mod on WC3 as well so games do end a lot quicker which isn't bad but it's really hard to reach late game. 

There're a few things that need some work though; Late game is high skill cap only.
-the game is very unforgiving - i can't get passed wave 16 and i came first 6 classic un-ranked matchmaking games in a row; if the game allowed for at least 3-4 more waves before it hit that difficulty then you'd be able to deal with it + get a little further after that given the increase lumber or ""mythium"" as it's now called. 

The reason this needs fixing is because this pressure of maximising early really only allows for a few different builds in each builder and you can't really experiment much- padding it out and would at least allow for more variations on how/what you built in your team.

This game pace ends up making the game highly dependent on smashing your opponents with coordinated creep waves where you send like 6 brutes collectively at the same time say on a boss wave; as opposed to the game being more about your build and layout.

- Menus and stuff could do with some work - your party disbands after the end of a customer game; that being said you're waiting max 30 seconds before the end the last game and start of the next which is great.
- if the game was patched to allow for easier waves until say wave 20, games would last longer which i'd personally love because i love having a nice chunky layout build to attack with
- AI is super hard, but now unbeatable and would be great for varied difficulties; my friend and i beat them maybe 15% of the games we played. It's a good skill test but their far too perfect in lumbering and sending creeps at the right times. 

Fantastic game, needs a few touch ups, super worth buying, if you loved it in WC3 you will 100% love this

well, if you're familiar with basic concepts like maximizing your economy (which any solo or PvE oriented tower defense will grind into you), you already have your foot in the door. early on, you can probably play this very similarly to a single player tower defense, as matchmaking will pair you up with players approximating your skill. the tutorial did enough to teach me game specific mechanics (such as auras and the multiple resources available), but nothing can really replace just getting into games and seeing what works. 

my experience with the community so far has been fairly positive - i've exclusively played random matchmaking games (both casual and ranked, though leaning heavily towards ranked), and while many players are silent, i'd say that more than half of the time, my teammate has offered feedback on how to respond to what the enemy team is up to. a willingness to concede to the opinion of someone more experienced than myself has helped expose me to strategies i wouldn't have considered, which has also allowed me to see the tactical depth of the game. following their advice hasn't always resulted in a win (the advice may not have been perfect, i may have executed the advice poorly), a willingness to try new things and implement a strategy of some sort is a must in order to win or enjoy the game.

I think this game exists adjacent to modern autobattlers, but i personally find this more engaging. the positioning of my units feels like it has more impact, and not having to prepare a squad that can enter into one of 7 random matchups makes it easier for me to learn what works and what doesn't. matches are short enough that i feel comfortable squeezing them into shorter breaks i may have, but they're also long enough to feel a good variety of gameplay, even within a single match.

the size of the community seems more than sufficient for the matchmaking options the game has. i've tried playing at many different times of day, and have rarely had to wait more than 40 seconds for a ranked match. the game is fun, and i can play when i want, for as long as i want, without feeling punished for not hitting arbitrary progression milestones - a strong point in this games' favor, compared to a free to play game like minion masters. some may balk at the price, but having picked the game up on sale, i found myself wishing there was some way to show additional support for the team, like cosmetics to reskin my board or units.",1588450792,1588450863,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Would love to see that game getting a boost again, it isn't like you don't find matches or something, it usually takes like 2 minutes to find a match, but its a very small community.

Also as a player who started with the release sets and now everything is random is kinda weird and is pretty overwhelming for newer players but after some hours of gameplay it should be clear.

A note for the devs: Good game, but try to make it free to play and the playerbase might explode.

The tutorial wasn't particularly useful as it didn't so much as teach me as it instead told to put down a certain unit somewhere without actually explaining anything.

The game itself once I started playing was a long slog not really doing much mixed in with having to meticulously place units, the placing of which is an annoyance by itself as once you place a unit heaven forbid you want to shift them around or happen to misplace a unit, no instead you have to first sell a unit or units and a reduced cost.

One of the worst things about the game is that I don't know what it is I'm doing wrong when something happens and I get wiped, is it a bad match up? are some units not worth getting as a cost to unit ratio? do I have too many or too little tank units? there just isn't any feedback to my decisions and in pretty much any other strategy game you can tell if your way of building and playing is working but with this whether you win a particular round feels arbitrary and not a product of my actions.

The community and interacting with it leaves much to be desired as it seems to propagate the same screeching toxicity present in MOBA games and that is all I want to say about the social interaction with other players.

I think this is because of the smaller playerbase (something the devs have chosen to hide- you used to be able to see how many players were online, but no longer) Another problem is the rolling at the start of competitive matches likes to give you all the same damage/defense types and you often can find yourself stuck with a group of low DPS units that are impractical on higher waves. One of the other problems is the units you can send against your opponent- everyone spams brute and early on with a mediocre to bad roll it can effectively destroy your whole economy and the game just becomes a slow loss. My biggest gripe is I always get paired either with someone much better or much worse than me. It never feels like a close game like it used to.

The majority of the game seems to be about getting that balance of resource investment correct as you play. 
Unfortunately as much as I like the game and the idea, I cannot recommend it. The game is quite difficult to get in to, because there is basically nothing out there to teach new players. All of the guides are far out of date and even if they were still applicable, the information provided doesn't really help a new player understand where they are making mistakes and how to properly start. I've been to the Steam forums, official forums, Discord, and YouTube looking to improve at this game, and basically it seems that the current playerbase is what it is and is not looking to expand. 
Also I question the current format offerings. You can play unranked at 4v4 or ranked at 2v2. The problem is that a) the 4v4 format operates a bit differently from 2v2, and because it's unranked you get people trying things that have no chance of working. There isn't a lot you can do to interact with your team mates or help, so a poor or afk player will ruin the game. 
Then the ranked format forces all players to use the ""Mastermind"" allegiance, which is a random selection of units from all factions. You can re-roll to get hopefully better options, but this is really meant for people that have a deep understanding of all the units in the game. In essence, the unranked games are generally bad and the ranked format is for experts. 

There is the ability to do custom matches, but the playerbase is already so small that it can't really support this.",1579021170,1579021170,False,0,0,0.47413790225982666,0,True,False,True

What Legion TD2 does right is keeping setup and gameplay simple. It should be readily understandable and playable by any Tower Defense fan. However, the added hook of constantly finding ways to break (or leak through) your opponent's defenses gives Legion an entertainment edge not found in most static TD games.

It's simple drag and drop placement and click to send mercenaries UI is efficient. What new players will want to focus on is the build orders and defense strategies for their units. That will take some time to get used to. Once you have ""it"" though, the game really opens up. It has been a blast facing players from all over the world (player nation flags are displayed next to their name), and facing all kinds of different strategy ideas. 

The basics of the game is to overwhelm your opponent with units, to break their defenses. Each wave of enemies are of a certain type, melee or ranged, pierce/impact/magic damage, with respective defenses. Planning which mercenary (additional units you can hire to augment the incoming wave) to use and anticipating your opponents next wave is what drives me to keep playing this game.

The game is supported by what seems to be just two developers and I think they do a great job with regular updates, patch notes, and more.

Shoutout to Mr. Lisk!
Absolutely addicting game that keeps me at bay! Its very easy to understand how it works, but it’s definitely a question about skill, how far you will climb the ranks. 
Though it happens to me, that from one day to another, the 4v4 is lagging really hard (it seems to be something concerning telecom costumers only..), I can only absolutely recommend this game! 
The Devs are really behind it and try to balance the game as much as they can. They are communicating with the community nicely and bring up new content regularly. 
Buy it! The community needs to grow!
To me it’s one of those little diamonds in the gameworld, as it is cheap, easy to understand but you can still grind it really really really hard, if you like, without being bored by repetition or enraged by devs that do not care a bit about their own work.
Have fun playing!

You'll get several people in there with you, but they'll leave and it resets. Can't even play. The game has changed drastically and for the worse. Many players don't like the changes they've made and I am one of them.

I'll stick to the WC3 Mod. Every update they add just seems like a step in the opposite direction. Absolutely absurd.

They removed 4v4...

Fun in a lot of ways and the art style is very nice but it doesn't feel as good as the old version from Warcraft 3. I realize it's a work in progress, and I really enjoy it, but I feel that it is missing a lot of features that made the old game so good.

There are currently only 4 factions to choose from and one extra that combines them all. There is only 1 map/environment and the game is really only set up for competititive online play as the bots are either super easy to beat or literally impossible to outmatch.

Gets boring quickly in my opinion. I've played around 20 games and I honestly don't care to play another because it is always the exact same thing. There isn't much in terms of strategy or difference of playstyle. Some stuff works, some stuff doesn't.

Unlike DOTA however, this is a team-based tower defense, as the name would imply. It's ranked mode is a 2v2 match where you build towers in a lane that become units to fight an oncoming wave of preset creatures, both in creature type and number of creatures, but the attacking wave is also bolstered by the enemy team through mercenaries bought with mythium, this games version of lumber, a resource gathered by workers which also increases the amount of gold you gain at the end of every wave. Workers can be bought for 50 gold and compound in value over time, but this is where the game gets interesting. The game revolves around your relation between army value and worker count, I.E your standing defense and your income. The more income you have, the higher level creatures you can send to your opponent, making it more likely he will leak, however this also requires you to sacrifice army value which may cause YOU to leak instead. It creates a dynamic that leads to fun gameplay, though it might not be very exciting to watch given the incredibly slow pace at which the game is played.

While heavily disputed by some members of the community, the devs keep a constant patch cycle and always add more to the game, in order to reach a similar status of variance as there was back in their Warcraft 3 map. Yes, according to my information they were part of the original creators of that map. 

That being said, as of lately, a new major patch was deployed. By removing the supply cap, it shifted the weight from intensive planning ahead for ressources to an even more casual or arcade style of game play, which I think is a good decision to help new players getting into the game more easy. Some mechanics and nearly all units have been touched up, so that the meta game was broken and the new ranked season could start off fresh. Good thing! 

This is a game, where you are required not only to manage your own defense, but have to plan the offense carefully and in consensus with your team mate(s). You can make a lot of different decisions each game which adds to a very diverting gameplay, all the while a match rarely ever reaches 30min playtime. It is a nice game to just hop in for one or two matches, but may also lead to all-nighters.

Ranked is 2v2 mastermind (10 random units from all classes with a bit of balancing) only and classic games are 4v4 free pick which makes ranked fun and makes one think on the spot instead of spamming the same build all the time (looking at you mech players from Season 2)

Regardless, it is very fun and easier to learn. I have taught casual players how to play the sc2 mod, but they always forget how to use the ui. In this game it is much more intuitive. 
In the sc2 mod, it is not always clear as to exactly what mistakes you made during the game. In this game, it is less cryptic in that manner.

Some people complain that there no longer is legions in the game, which turns the game into a RNG party. That is just false. In ranked (2v2) it is true you no longer can pick a legion, but is it unbalanced? No. The very active devs have made the game balanced by having every damage and defense type present in your roll. They even added some AI roll helper to help new players select a good roll. +1 for that. 
However, it is true there no longer is competetive 4v4, but I see that as a positive thing, as your decision has greater impact on the game in 2v2. If you truly love 4v4 you can still play it casually though. :-) If you're a new player (which you still are, even though you played the WC3 mod) i recommend you play 4v4 and learn the basics. How to effectively push workers, good unit positioning, sends, dmg/defense types etc. 
I would say the game has a pretty steep learning curve if you want to play competetively and I love that. Makes the game more fun and strategic the higher elo you climb to :-)

Very active developers ensure that the game is fun to play and doesn't get boring. Many patches are being released. New legions are being added and filled up with new units, it is a project I have loved to follow over the months I have been playing. Look forward to many more months. I currently put 564 hours into the game, a lot of afk, but still quite a few games :p 752 games to be exact :-)

Legion TD2 is a surprisingly deep game with many layers of strategy. The different legions and the units within them all feel unique and full of character. Matches can often be unpredictable, and your decisions and knowledge of damage types, defences, mercenaries and minions will make or break you. It is a great feeling when you outsmart your opponents and work together to bring them down. 

The only issue I have had with the game is that it is quite unintuitive. Often you will have one game where you do well and sail through the match and others where you fail miserably, leak every wave and be unable to make any sort of comeback. When the latter is the case it is very hard to figure out exactly what it was that went so horribly wrong. This makes it harder to improve how you play. 

Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone who loves tower defences with a lot or character, and deep strategy. I look forward to seeing it develop further and trying out the new legions and their minions as they come out.

Because devs refuse to bang their head against a wall called balance.

I bought this game to play Legion TD. And last time I checked, I could play Legions in Legion TD. Not anymore. At least not after season 2 wrapped up.

When playing ranked, you are forced to figure out a new tactic in every game, as you are given a pool of random units to choose from, and must figure out the best combination. For the same reason its hard to come by a manual for this game, as not two games are the same. You have to rely on your own experience and calculations.
This is really appealing to me, as I hate when the pro-scene dictates whats right and wrong, and where people feel like there is no room for experimentation. Of course there are general rules and stuff to learn, but you cannot watch a replay of a good player, and just copy his tactic and moves, you need to think for your self in every ranked game! If you don't like thinking for your self, I wouldn't recommend this game.

In my opinion, although with only 10 hours of gametime so far (there will be much more to come)
this is a true successor to the original wc3 custom map. It improves in various aspects of gameplay, and will only continue to improve, no doubt.

Surprisingly well balanced, each match is completely different from the last, and you have to continuously adapt your builds and playstyle round-per-round depending on how your opponent acts, giving a more direct and deep strategic experience, this was also how the original Legion TD played out, but no where near as exciting and polished as this lovely game.

The game consists of either vs Bots, a casual 4v4 matchup vs other players to learn the game and improve - and a 2v2 ranking system that i've yet to try. 

Graphically the game is fairly unique imo, it fits what i'd expect from a modern day TD, and gives a unique feeling.

I recommend this game to anyone who's interested in competitive / casual TD games where you're fighting other players.

Almost every week a Patch
Devs work together with the Community
A very nice and helpfull Community. There are no Flamer´s if u do something bad, they wont hate u, they will help u instead (at least i met only 1-2 ppl toxic in alsmost 500h playtime)
Its fun to play, u can play every game different and it works

Con´s
Well, if u play 2v2, as a duo team, u may lose to much rating and gain not enough to compensate the loss (but its okay)
If u reached Rating: Gold, and there are some Player´s who arent playing as a team u simply lose the game. (at least its very hard to carry)

Well where should i start.
Im about to get my 500h on LTD2
And im very happy that this game was released. (even its just EA atm)
I just saw some Review´s where this game got called ""too much rng""
or, its not like legion td in wc3, its no fun to play cause there is no reward system.

hell no im not saying this game is a perfect game, there are bugs, it may be boring if u play it 24/7..
BUT there is no way u could compare a WC3 map with a own game, thats just unfair. And btw, how old is the wc3 legion td map? this game is just 1 year old and they did a hell of a good job. They listen to the Community .. they deleted 4v4, the community wants it back and there we go, it is coming back. They actually Balance almost every week the units/waves/mercs, they bring more legion´s they are working on this game.
And instead of releasing the whole Legion they add every unit patch after patch, so they can balance the unit, and we can play some units of the new legion. Thats just awesome.

- No team duels after every 10th wave
- Only 2v2 instead of going up to 4v4
- Can't upgrade the king(this makes the game more difficult in my experience so far, leaking after wave 14 is highly risky)
- New class skills(or should I say passives) after 10th wave(a nice feature but I think it needs some work, most of them feel reduntant/unnecessary)

I've been playing the warcraft version for over 5 years so I bought it without hesitation instantly and got into the game. The game-play is very similar to the original, but they made it much simpler, as in you no longer have a builder, you just select a unit and build on the tile. AOE ranges are displayed, buff ranges are displayed, and sending income and gathering workers is one click of a button. Overall, I'm very impressed with what they've done with the game, but I still feel like it's lacking. They made it so that the game is only 2vs2 instead of the traditional 4vs4, which makes it much more slow-paced and a little ""bleh"" in terms of competitiveness. Apparently there used to be a 4vs4 option earlier on but the devs thought it would be a good idea to remove it(it wasn't) and make it only 2vs2. If you're REALLY into Legion TD like I am.. I'd say buy this game.. And hope that they eventually re-introduce 4vs4 so we can play the game like it was intended to be played.

Imagine building a robot in three stages.

First you have to build the skeleton of the robot. Just like with the human body, a robot’s skeleton is able to keep it in place, as well as provide parts for the muscles, or motors and actuators in this case, to mount on.

Adding the motors and actuators is the second step. The motors can be controlled by wires and electronics.

The last part involves building the brain. The brain can be a computer or some other piece of software that’s running to tell all the motors what to do.

There are many different types of robots. Opportunity and Curiosity are two rover-style robots currently on Mars being used to advance science. Other robots include drones you see flying around that can be used to take videos or explore areas.

Some robots may run on your phone, like Siri on iPhones, for example. Siri does not have the mechanical aspects of a skeleton and muscles, but has a brain, and is still a robot or an intelligence.

PROS:
-Frequent Updates - Their team is growing! from 2 to 3 and now to almost a dozen. I see updates almost every week, with new balances, occasionally new units, and features.
-Community Contribution - The devs asked if people could help translate Legion TD 2 and as soon as they did, several language packs were created by help from the community.
-2v2 or 4v4 - To climb ladder, the games are 2v2; however, you can play 4v4 by creating a custom game and joining it.
-Variety in Builds - After gaining a few levels (which happens pretty quick), there is a mastermind legion.  It allows you to create a custom pool of units from the 5 legions, but you only have 10(?) that are available to choose from the 27 (currently).  It keeps the game entertaining and fun.

CONS:
-Learning Curve - There is still a learning curve, but they now included a crash course on how to play the game.  Definitely helpful to go through as it shows the ebb and flow of how the game works.
-Small User Count - Its not @ 100k yet, but its steadily growing slowly but surely.
-Peak Times at odd hours - Since I'm on a work hiatus, I noticed the 
-$20?? - As of now, I don't think the game is worth $20, but it has been occassionally on sale.

Legion TD is a Tower defense map which originaly was 4v4, Each round was split in two phases Preparing and Defending
in the preparing phase you buy more fighters (defensive units) to protect you from the upcoming wave,  or buy attackers to make i more dificult for the enemy to attack. And then in your defending phase all your bought fighter will then fight against the attack

Pro's:

- Active development, developers are actually involved within their own community
- Relatively short queue times (Sometimes 10 seconds, max a minute in ranked for me)
- Great ""modern"" remake of the Warcraft3 Custom Map
- Some extra strategic involvement due to the armor/damage type system
- A lot of friendly players in the community willing to help you improve

Con's:

- 2v2 instead of 4v4 to keep the queue times short
- Few players that cant handle the competitive atmosphere and can flame from time to time (But we got a report button for that)
- Tutorial is a bit buggy (Recently implemented, and as they're a small team this still needs some work)

I played the original release of Legion on WC3. I was involved in the original forum. I was in a clan that split it's time between LTD and Battleships. Through the years, I'd walk away from battle.net and go play other things, but then I'd get a craving for custom games and go back. I've seen many many iterations of Legion through the years. 

In it's current form, we've got a clean ui, nicer graphics, and no need to deal with the different bot hosts and all the garbage that comes along with bots and their specific rules. There's an official forum, three game modes (four if you count practice against bots), integrated player profiles, and a few other bells and whistles that none of us had in the original version. 

Fine. Great. I've put quite a few hours into it, and am one of the highest leveled people in the game at the moment. Unfortunately, there's some other issues going on with this standalone version. I'll leave it to you to review and decide what kind of tower defense gamer you are... 

1 - Lag issues.
Update: 6/19/18 - The lag issues have been resolved for the most part.

2 - Tutorials. There is an overall lack of communication for new players that have zero experience with WC3 / Legion. When you pick up this game, you'll be required to play against bots for a bit, and the mastermind (we'll get to that later) mode will be locked to you. Sadly, you do not get a primer on why armor and attack types are important. There is documentation on the forum about all the units and their attack and armor types, but you need to find it. You need to have a basic understanding of the old system. Blah blah blah. They've implemented a spell system that grants you one major bonus after level ten. There isn't much documentation on that, and you'll have to visit the forums for what little is there. 

This lack of in-game tutorials has resulted in a lot of players just parroting things that they saw someone win with once and spamming units senselessly. They don't understand why going aggressive against certain units on wave X is bad because they've seen wins on X wave many times, and they're just going to keep parroting. As it is a team game, your rating will suffer from many matchups with someone just parroting what they saw someone else do... 

3 - Legion types (builders). You get in game and see three builders that should be pretty familiar if you've played earlier versions. There's also a fourth called mastermind. This should also be familiar if you've played versions that scramble the units from other builders. You get several units offered from the other three builders. You keep six and start playing. 

Fine. Good. However, this is the preferred builder by the elite. The developers have taken note that the elite prefer this builder and have been tailoring all of their tweaks to units based on numbers they're crunching from mastermind games. Surprise! This has made the other three regular builders virtually unplayable. In fact, the game gives you bonuses for choosing the mastermind builder, but nothing for choosing a regular builder. So if you do have a soft spot for say... elemental... expect future tweaks to your units to be a reflection of what mastermind players have been doing to one or two of your units. See where this is going? Good. Let's move on.

4 - The MOBA Mentality. This is a team TD. It should be a pretty casual experience to waste some hours on after a long day. Something that anybody of any age should be able to pick up, and eventually master after education (I covered that already) and experience. Unfortunately, I'm regularly reduced to a raging crazylady cussing out kids before, during, and after games. Here's why... 

One of the devs did some work for a very well known MOBA that I will not bother to mention. It shows in the rating system itself. It shows in how the devs are tweaking matchmaking, units, etc. It shows in the community. It shows in members of the community making smurfs. (Yes. Smurfs. For a TD. Let that sink in.) It shows in the rampant racism, sexism, and general bad mouthing in chat. It shows when there's so many streamers for a TD. (Most of them appear to be Alex P. Keaton cosplays with a German accent.) I can go on and on, about the MOBA mentality here, but you should get the idea by now.

Summary: It's ok now. It might soothe a hankering for a team TD for awhile. It could be great eventually. It needs to diversify it's builders and stop the MOBA mindset to reach a broader audience.",1521706574,1529448886,True,51,3,0.733043849468231201,2,True,False,True

Personaly; the community is a recommendation on his own!

Game: currently Legion TD2 is in a 2v2 competitive playstyle wich makes it possible to play/farm/have fun with ur friend(s) in a 2v2 setup, you fight ur way to waves of enemy's and decide when to send ur creatures to ur opponents - with the main objective to kill their king in order to win the game.

Graphix: the ambiance is lovely, it's not a graphix based game but the details in the environment are amazing and a cherry on top of this (delicious) pie.

Balance: balancing the game (faction/unit strengts) is a important part of the game and the creators doing a great job on that, there is no worrie in playing a unbalanced game, becasue of the weekly updates/hotfixes i assure you this is on point.

Why to play: if you like strategic/towerdefense/30mins/great community/reagular updates/competitive playstyle/no game is the same - games, this is the game you need!
i've been playing this game over 350 hours and expect to put in way more!
playing solo or 2v2 (upcomming 4v4) with friends makes this a nice to have in ur steam library.

There are a few op minions and some are just underpowered and you should never take them. 
Waves vary A LOT in difficulty. Lower waves dealing more damage to the King/Nexus than higher waves etc. 
In some cases you just have to build the same minion over and over again to win because they are so op when you mass build them. 
In most of the games you won't understand why you lose or win. You might have better income, better built value, less leaked etc and still you will lose because you have the weaker minions e.g.. 
Sadly there are no content patches at all.

I played almost all custom maps in Warcraft III. I played Legion TD. I can't say it's my favorite TD map, but i had some enjoyable hours.

I bought this game in the day of release... And i couldn't played for more than week. There were huge server troubles and queues with 2000 people. That's very bad. I could play the game at the 10-14th day of the release. I played for 5 hours and deleted it. 

I reinstalled the game today, hoping the game got better, but... it's not.

So, basically, you play the game 4 times. Then play until you win 1 time and... There is no more fun. Does it cost 20$? Nope.

Legion TD 2 is standalone game which was inspired by WC3 map. This custom map was created the same developers. So I hoped, they just make it better and more fun. But, the custom map and the game has a lot of differences.

The game starts with 2 teams. Each team has 2-4 players. Each player defends his road. He must summon towers. Then new wave start, towers become units and fight with enemies. If all your units dies, enemy units go to the king and attack him If the king dies - the game is over. Seems simple. 

It plays simple too. The game doesn't require a lot of actions from the player. Just place 1-2 tower between waves and watch how your units fight. The game is extremely repetitive. Each game you have the same map and stand against same enemy waves. The only difference is your race. Each race has an unique set of towers. But, Legion TD has only 4 builders, then original map had more than 10 builders.. tt

Pros
- I think it's a first game in my review list where I can't find pros

Cons
- There are less content than in original map. Only 4 builders, 20 enemy waves
- Devs cut important gameplay things. Like upgrades of hero parameters
- Only 2v2 map. There were 4v4 but devs changed it duo low online problems.
- Battles are completely unclear. You just can't understand is it good or bad. You just watch the battle of lifebars
- Design of new races is bad. In WC3 there were undead, elfs, demons and etc. There is a bee with boxing gloves stand with Makaka tree.. It's not funny
- Huge server problems. I waited for 3 minutes before I could get to the lobby. I started the match 3 times and I was kicked from it, because someone lost connection
- Strange updates. Devs are changing numbers every update instead of adding new content

this game reminds me the old WC3 days.. used to play those legion TD with friends or online 
and now here the new version of it.. not much change if u have played old Legion TD on WC3, veteran player will be able to adapt fast enough..

the game itself now only available for 2v2 not 4v4.. the AI is quite dependable if ur teammates leaves. so it wont be problem..

the problem is game modes.. in WC3 days, i used to only play -prophet mode to make the gameflexible... so everyone got a chance to be lucky enough or shitty enough to get towers.. i think thats the lack if u want play ranked pls set the game mode to All pick or Mastermind (prophet) mode only.. thats good for player tbh..

the community itself is good yet the global chat sometimes got stupid people on it..
tryin play on ranked.. got teabagged all the times.. lul... 

the game shows hope to develop.. the developer is active and is a listener.. hopefully old WC3 player that played Legion TD come here and play make the game good again..

gameplay 8/10
graphic 7/10 
community 8/10

  So I would pay 2/5 the price: about 4 dollars, not 10, 15, and certainly not 20 dollars.

If you liked Legion TD1, this is not for you.  The UI is garbage(super small and laggy) and the game has microtransactions.  I did not even know how to send creep waves until I watched a stream.  They have an option scale the UI, but it scales EVERYTHING on the UI, not just the things that need to be blown up.  The text and small little buff/type icons that you would have to roll over to see what they are miniscule and 9pt translucent font.  Utterly confusing, even for a longtime Legion TD player. 

 The 20 dollar asking price is steep for the value and replayability.  Game has 200 concurrent players on it's major popular day on being on the front page of steam as of right now.  It is dead.  150% population drop since release.  

The game is shady as well, with a very steep asking price, and having ""sales"" that slash the price once in a while.  This game is literally the price of the Full Skyrim Special Edition(20 dollars) or Dying light EE(23 dollars).  Is it worth more than those games?  The optomization is poor and not as much effort went into this game than into games other games of the same asking price.

I will be asking for a refund.

Talking about the value is of the game is something people should do more often.  We are here for the game, not to feel sorry for small developing teams.

Ofc this problem might don't hit you, if you search alone. But I'm telling you something:
Me and my friends bought this ONLY because we could play this together as a team with 4! But no, now it's 2 vs. 2.

The two games are the same in the basic kit, but in the execution very different. That means nothing bad but nothing good. The first games were a bit strange, as I know the Warcraft 3 map, but it was not bad and interesting to try and experiment with many builds, especially as there is a mastermind race that allows you to select random units from all races. You spend a good time perfecting your build in certain situations and what kind of creeps you can send in order to overpower the opposing lane. Tactical approach and team play are a must.
The problem is rather that your team members are not listening or leave...in a 4v4, which makes it difficult to win or unnecessarily lengthen the game.

I've spent almost 100 hours in the game and can only say in a nutshell that the game is far from perfect, but the excuse is simply ALPHA-PHASE.

Whoever has patience with the development of the game will know how much content we will expect when looking at the Warcraft 3 versions.

They havent even started working on new classes, instead they focus on balancing the game with 4 races in game, which is pretty much just balancing damage, attack speed or health of waves or of buildings, every time they just lower or buff units.
Instead of working on new classes immediatly, because this game gets dull after you play it for 20+ hours. 
I mean what do balance patches give us players if everytime they just overbuffed things, which enables strats which everyone uses and then they nerf it again.
This game is dead if they cant bring any fresh air into it, wasted my 20$ for nothing.
Dont buy it if you want varied gameplay!!!

@Akitos
The game was released on the 20th November with 4 races. It is march now and they finally ""started"" to work on a new race. I know they try to get the game compability to the highest degree and bug fixes are important so the game is playable, but thats not an excuse to not work on any other features is it.
You say:  ""Furthermore it's not true that they haven't started working on new Legions, they simply did not have their designer yet (she started last week)."" Thats exactly what I mean when I said they haven't started working on new Legions, they just started now in MARCH. They couldve started working on new Legions themselves or do you think the other 4 races just came to life without any designer, even with shit design it would be more fun with more Legions? It costs 20€ thats so much money for such a slow developing game, (Look at other Alpha games with constant new features and bug fixes at the SAME time) I dont see any progress in the shop or in the system overall, but bug fixes yeah. It doesnt make sense to me when you know that Legion TD has a massive community from Warcraft and they took the fun out of it, with their lazy design and non existing progress. 
If you have fun with it fine, play with 4 Legions thats your time.

Since there is not really any mechanical skill required for any action, this game might appeal especially to players who like competitive pvp games without the stress of reaction or APM-based mechanics. 

What keeps this game fresh is instead the variety of different possible builds (which will only increase with future updates) and the ever changing team mates and enemies that get overwhelmed at different times, giving you different amounts of gold you have to work with every game.

So while you can follow certain builds that you can find online, as you could copy decks from pro players in card games, to get the most out of your opportunities every single game, you have to change and adjust your build every single game, granting even long-term fun.

It might not be the best game out there, but the only competitive stand-alone tower defense game that goes this deep into strategy, unit combos and teamplay that I know of.

I must say it took a couple of hours for me to get into this game. Its similar to the wc3 mod but it has a new feeling about it. Most of the negative reviews here state the fact that its only 4 races. To me thats something positive that the devs do not focus on pushing out races just because to have more of them. The game could easily be unbalanced and fast thanks to this. Instead they focus on balancing the races they have, which in my opinion is prio one. But dont get me wrong, 4 classes to choose from is not enough, but I gladly wait.

But i do agree to the fact that the game might be overpriced, but I gladly give my money to these two(!) devs who earlier gave me alot of fun in the wc3 mod - for free. I bought this game on the 25% off sale and i believe that this is a more reasonable price for the game.

Oters say that the community is crap, i have not noticed anything more wrong with this than any other game. This is a game community problem as a whole, and to get rid of it is hard. But a way to report obnoxious players is a must have. As i say about any game, games are more fun played with friends than solo, this statement goes well with this game aswell.
Something i really want, is a way to vote for draw if one player leaves. Some communities in the wc3 mods has this options. If 5 ppl vote for draw no one gets elo. Or atleast make so that the team who looses a player early do not loose elo.

So far this game has come a long way, and i think its a shame that the community demand more and more instead of appreciate that we now have a stand-alone game of this loveable wc3 mod.",1519257056,1519257056,True,3,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,True

Yeah you can have fun with it for at least 20+ hours if you play mastermind, if you play any other class then you will only have fun till you learn what build for that class is the best to win. I wish they would add the arena fights from the mega version of it or do something else fun like maybe doing a mode where you and the other team build mercs as the wave against the other team and have the waves grow as you build more and more mercs the bolster the ranks of your own wave that you created against the other team. They could even do it where you and the other team build the waves aganist the other team using the mercs, but instead were left with 4 classes 5 if you want to include mastermind but it really doesn't count. Also patches that sometimes help or hurt the game and then later done again is what we as players are left with when it comes to Legion TD, Now its not to say I don't like this game but as of right now this game is not worth it and it's hard for me to say but it's not with the very little content that it has. I also have to add that yes it is in early access but it was released in Nov 20 2017 and it is now Feb 16 2018 and the new class isn't coming out for another month and mind you that is 1 class not 2 or 3 but 1 class now ask yourself if 5 classes is enough for you 6 if you yet again include mastermind.

All the magic that LTD Mega, Hellhalt TD and the original LTD had? Its not here at all. What the creators did was take a good game and make a terrible sequel to it trying to get nostalgic fanboys to buy the game.

Don't. If I had any other game to compare this sequel to, its not even Legion TD. Its a worse version of Squadron TD from Starcraft 2 except that Starcraft 2, a game made in 2010 has better graphics and gameplay. 

Pros: Just one - Its almost exactly the same as LTD. If you make the graphics worse, simplify the gameplay by 1000x and implement a shitty ""meta"". What in the fuck. Units are specifically designed to be worse or better than others. E.G protons, which are the supposed starter unit you should build as elemental but are so pathetically weak that even bots don't build them. 

Cons: Stupid fucking meta, terrible graphics, simplified gameplay,  connected lanes instead of parallel ones, boring and slow gameplay, the fact that you get like 10 exp from each game and need 200 to level up, having to figure out literally everything by yourself, not being able to control the fucking king, which is controlled by AI and just does fuck all. Uses abilities too early, doesn't use abilities, attacks targets with full hp instead of killing the low hp targets first. What the fuck? GARBAGE MOTHERFUCKING AI THAT DOESN'T FOCUS TARGETS AND JUST SPREADS IT SO ALL THE ENEMIES ARE LEFT WITH 10 HP BUT STILL ALIVE HOLY SHIT!! Ridiculous scaling where enemies are easily beaten one round and the next round mauls your entire defense while only losing one of their number.. Bosses being literally impossible to beat unless you get lucky as fuck, enemies stacking on top of each other so they just hide underneath a tank while they attack you and you can't touch them because of the hitbox...

There's a ridiculous amount of stupid issues and problems. Please don't fucking buy this.

I just started playing this game, and had yet about 10 games and had a lot of fun with it. Also it seems to be very balanced, what I like, as it gives a competitive character, without beeing pay2win. 

A graphics update would be appreciated, but not necessary at this point.

Usually I'm not a friend of early access, but in this case I'd like to support the developers. Hopefully they will invest the earned money in expanding the game and establishing the brand.

I totally recommend it for everyone, how liked the Legion TD mods, or other competitive games like LoL. It is worth a try and brings a lot of fun.

Its funny and the Chance to get a Card makes me starting Game after Game.

Just one Tip : If u are new in this Game  - dont even think of touching Mastermind - try each Legion in Custom Games and  figure out whats your Favorite. Then go Normal Games and play YOUR Legion till you Master them or get bored.

Get it on sale for 5$/5€ max.

After 100+ hours of testing, here is my review:
Toxic community, like LoL or CoD. The global chat is full off hate, racism etc. and there are no moderators/scripts to stop them. It´s an early access title for 20€, but at this state, the game is insanely overpriced. There are 4 different playable races in Legion TD 2, which is kinda underwhelming if you compare the game to the famous Starcraft and Warcraft funmaps. The game has many balance issues and bugs, especially unit behaviour and pathing issues. Legion TD 2´s Matchmaking is a bloody mess, which endores you to play in a 2-4 stack party in game where the ""tactical"" possibilities are: when to save, when to send, when to value, what to send and cross or else you will have a bad time. It´s kinda funny, that the developers think this game would be competitive material when top players spam their builts (exept Mastermind) every game with very little variation and team up with ""low elo smurf"" players to match weaker teams. Another problem of the game is the wave + mercenaries pathing issue. When you send the same mercenaries 5 times on the same wave against the exact same building order, you will have 5 diffrent outcomes, which kills every ""competitive"" possibility.

Legion TD 2 is a copy of the WC and SC funmaps in now standalone game. It´s insanely overpriced even for this 2-man studio. Get it on sale or leave it unless you´re a big TD fan.",1514497203,1514497203,False,98,7,0.687679588794708252,7,True,False,True

I played the original custom Warcraft 3 mod which this Legion is based on and really enjoyed that. I was pretty hyped about this game for months, finally bought it few days ago. This standalone version looks very promising, considering it is still just Early Access Alpha. Graphics are fine, though I hope the map will be more detailed and changed over time. Gameplay is smooth, you don't need high-end computer to run this on Ultra details. I am running it on a GTX 950 and i5-4460 with 16 gigs of RAM on Ultra with stable 60fps.

There are currently 4 legions you can play for + one called Mastermind which randomly combines units from each of those legions. Devs are currently working on 5th legion, I hope there will be more legions to choose from in time.

But I have to say that I am a little bit disappointed in the whole elo distribution and frustration that comes from constant losing. Out of about 20 games I played, I won only 2 games. You might tell yourself - wow, you must suck balls dude. No. I am not a pro player in this, but the frustrating part is - it is a 4v4 game and even if you work really hard, have no wave leaks and do a good job, if your teammates fuck it up, you still lose. And honestly, I get as unlucky as I possibly can, because most of the time I just lose. It can get very frustrating. I just hope there will be added some 1v1 / 2v2 mode to make it more fair. Because honestly, when you solo queue 4v4, you either get premade against you or team that doesnt even properly communicate or sucks balls. 

Looks like there will be a shop added soon and various rewards for currency you have in game (Essence), so I am pretty much looking forward to that.

With everything that I have mentioned above, I still do recommend buying this game if you are a fan of Tower Defense games, or played the original WC3 Legion TD. Even if you have no experience in TD games, I still recommend it. This game can be both frustrating & addicting at same time. I'm looking forward for what this game yet has to offer and I hope the losing streaks end very soon. I'd give it 8,5/10.",1513952051,1513952051,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Reason: the game does not have separated queues for solo players and premade groups.

As obviously a premade group of 4 with teamspeak/discord is superior to a group of 4 randoms, there is a point in the game where you are forced to either join a group and find people to play with or get constantly buttf*cked by groups while desperately trying to communicate with the randoms in your team.

I get that seperate queues mean longer waiting times due to overall low player count. But that's ok. I'd rather wait 5-10 minutes for a fair game than wait 1 minute and get in a team that I can't communicate with (language barrier) while the other team is ra.ping us.

Yes! It's been a while, but they've released Legion TD 2 as EA Game.
What to say? 
It's Early Access, of course it's not done with developing yet, and the game is very basic.
But, it's already, as it ever was, very addictive and fun.

They already implemented yet:
- Play vs. Players (rated play)
- Play vs. AI
- Custom Games
- Account leveling (XP)
- Trophies and Cards, Avatars etc.
- Rankings, leaderboard

And their Roadmap is still ongoing:
to see here (always up-to-date)
https://legiontd2.com/community/threads/major-features-priority-list.11126/

Developers ALWAYS reachable within their Discord.
Fast Support in any Case

In my guess, this game will become very very very popular especially to the eSport Scene in the near future.

So if you already considered buying this, do it. You'll have a lot of fun.

I know how to play legion TD2 cause i played a long time ago on SC2 so you can remove the ""learning the game"" out of my experience with legion TD2

You'll play one game and discover the towers, the minions. After 10 games you'll understand which tower is more OP than the other, same for minion. Then you'll learn to send exactly when it's best.

After you've learned all that, well that's it, the games are all gonna be very similar. But the time you get to that level, if you're a total new to this game, ~15 hours will have passed.

The good:
+ Lots of tactical depth.
+ Has a practice mode where you play vs bots.
+ Also custom game lobbies for practice.
+ Lots of beginner guides on the forums.
+ Very active developers, around 1 new Update every other day at the moment.
+ Very competetive game with leaderboards.
+ Lots of active players, more than 10,000 individual players every day.
+ 4 Races with individual strengths and weaknesses to choose from, plus 1 random race.

The bad:
- Interface not very intuitive, many windows only available through chat commands.
- Games are somewhat RNG reliant, hope this will get fixed at some point by making pathing and unit focusing more consistent.
- If a player disconnects a bot takes over, this is fine for now but I hope they'll implement a more elegant solution in the future (for example if someone disconnects before wave 2 the game will be cancelled).
- Very hard for new players, even though you get all those practice opportunities a tutorial of some sorts would be appreciated.
- Matchmaking is ok for now but could use some improvements. Even though I'm somewhat high elo I constantly get matched with 1200 elo players who have no idea what they're doing. Though this will probably fix itself once even more players start playing the game.
- Features like the cosmetic shop not implemented yet, only 4 races as of right now, buit the base game is definitely there and ready to be expanded on.

Conclusion:
Over all the game is 100% strategy, knowledge and prediction what the enemy will do, it doesn't require a good internet connection nor your constant attention which makes it the perfect game for me and my 2mbits connection to play while also watching some youtube/twitch on the side.

This game was fun for a second... Then I started playing casual games and found out people would duo and build back behind their lane supporting 2 lanes at a time. One would farm crystal, and the other would farm defense. This is fine unless you're a solo player, then you're screwed because you're defending against a 600 crystal push by yourself past wave 10... I have no problem helping to defend the base after you've cleared your own lane, but this isn't fun when you're going 1v2. Even if I got into a game with a rando that was a proactive player, that wanted to work together to do the same thing. You will still lose against a duo group because they both build and push to eachothers strengths that has to be esablished before hand. Waves are too quick to strat on the spot who's doing what when a duo can come in with an established build order and job. Remove the cross and this will be a good TD...

Skip the wall of text for TL;DR it's just a little backstory as to why I love this game so much.

I have always had a soft spot for tower defense games. Growing up I would play a multitude of TD style flash games and enjoy them greatly for a short time. Later in my gaming career I would play TD mods in vanilla Starcraft 2 like Desert strike or redstone TD. Those got a lot more play from me than the flash games but I'm sure I didn't break 30 hours in either of them and I quickly entered my cringey MOBA phase after that. After I burned out on League of Legumes and built a computer that could run DOTA 2 I dove into that. Sadly Valve took ages to implement the ever important arcade, after all the game started out as a simple Warcraft 3 mod. Well not that simple. Anyway after some Epic Boss Fight and Overthrow I saw Wagamama playing Legion TD on stream and from that point on I was enthralled. I trudged through 5 minute queues just to roll dice on if all 8 people would stay and play favorite tower defense game of all time. Even with just 3 builders I throughly enjoyed Legion TD for probably about 50 hours. It was something that was on and off and it was really difficult to find others to play with. I also favorited it more when my latency was awful. Sadly I didn't see the Kickstarter campaign until it had completed successfully so all I could do was add the steam title to my wishlist and bide my time. Darkness crept into my world and the one TD to rule them all became forgotten. Until I see the Early Access game get a release date. The only reason this game is rated average is all the negative reviews people left in the first 2 days when the game was unplayable. I was able to play 1 game during that time and it got my so excited for when the servers were stable.

TL;DR The best Tower Defense game I have ever played. Cannot be mastered by just learning a rigid build or figuring out the meta. The meta is ever changing and the gameplay is dynamic because of the competitive atmosphere. AutoAttack Games put their heart and soul into this game and it really shows. If you would like a Tower Defense game that does not get old then this is the game for you. Well worth the $20 pricetag and I'm so happy to support the developers.",1511937969,1511937969,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Ui is unintuitive. I understand everything better on a 13 year old game (namely wc3) 

No tutorial, no vs ai working, no custom game. Only normals (which are actually ranked) where you get shit on by other player for being new.

which brings me to toxic community already (an impressive feat achieved quickly)

22$ price tag for a barely functionnal game.

All info is clustered into a tiny corner of your screen and you are supposed to know all that stuff.

Incredibly snowbally (if you fuck up just one bit in a game, it's over)

you can't ever come back

Very not newbie friendly.

SO much fucking information about every tower and you have so little time to even place them. You literally have to know everything by heart to even have fun (would be fun to learn in not ranked only you know)

- Cool Races to start with (Element, Mech, Forsaken, Grove)

- Offline Mode (vs. Bots / Custom for Lans ... eSports etc.)
- Next time a stress test (Like 3-4 Open for all Free Weekends)

First the good news. It really catches the feeling of the old Warcraft 3 funmap quiet well and is fun to play.

Bad news, as already said it's currently a alpha version, which still has a long way to go. Especially the network code and the server-capacity is currently not good enough to support a large amount of player's at the same time.

Furthermore don't expect a 1:1 copy of the wc3 funmap. Some things here and there are quiet different. For example damage and amour types have different names (because of copyright reason), or Zeus now does impact damage (siege dmg) and not pierce.

Server issues seem mostly resolved during normal US times. Botgames and Custom games are not yet on, but I haven't had issues with lag, long queues, or crashing.

This is my first time with this kind of TD (so I can't compare to WC3/SC2/DOTA2), and I have to say, I'm in love. 

For those like me who are new to the genre, here's an overview:

Legion TD2 is a ""competitive tower defense"" game. 2 teams of 4 fight against identical waves, defending their team's King from creeps. The game is split into two phases, night and day. During the night, you place, upgrade, and sell towers, and hire mercenaries. During the day, your towers wake up to defend various waves of creeps (sent by the game) and mercenaries (sent by your opponents). 

Currently there are 4 races (or legions), and one legion using random units from each other legion. It appears the devs are planning on adding more races, cosmetics, and mod support. However, the dev team is only 2 people, so I would expect mostly bugfixes and balancing to come before new features.

Currently, I would be catious about recommending the game.  It's fun, but $20 is pretty steep for what is currently a glorified mod. Keep your eye on it. Any sale above 25% off should be an insta-buy, and maybe in half a year, once more features are added, it'll be a must have. Or, if you've played counltess hours of WC3 Legion TD (as it seems many have), you shoudl grab it to support the devs.

edit: Being a new player, I was very skeptical of jumping straight into multiplayer, bu the community is really helpful. Even though most players are from Germany, many speak good enough english to help if you have any questions.  Streamers, as few as they are, are also very helpful, and were invaluable for helping me learn the game.  This is probably the most friendly and helpful community I've ever seen. Unfortunately, it's the only real way to learn the game, as there is no tutorial, and very few good videos that cover anything beyond the basics.

edit2: Ratings have been enabled, as have achievements, etc. Still only PVP, no custom games or v bots. In addition, there is no unranked PVP. I still recommend this game, been having a great time.",1511349155,1511776556,True,2,0,0.468598127365112305,0,True,False,True

This game is all about perfecting your build, only to see that a few extra sends can topple it once again and you will have to rethink your strategy. What is set in stone can be crushed by better strategy and planning.
This leads to outcome of the game being decided by the teams capability and decision making.

For instance there was a game we lost on round 6 with all lanes not leaking before, just because the enemy decided to hold back on sends and add all of it on 6, resulting in a complete spillage, the yet weak king could not hold. Of course, this was a do or die scenario, as the enemy was really weak on income thus far, and would not have been able to hold anything afterwards.

You will have to wait in queue a bit for now, as of course they still have to build up their Server pool to be able to take a few thousand players, but im confident that they will manage in the long run.

Unfortunately Legion TD 2 had a rocky launch, but it feels better today (11/26/2017) and the disconnects are few and far between and the lag is almost non-existent. 

Now, I firmly believe the developers explanation for the rocky launch and I do believe they'll fix it.This is a great surprise and a game I had no idea existed -- but now it's looking like my next ""main game"".

The game is in alpha, so of course it needs a lot of work. New legions and hopefully new modes would be welcome.
The current legions seem nicely balanced on launch, each has it's fighter ability synergies. I hope the 2 devs hire some staff to push out new content faster tho.

Some complain about the ""slow gameplay"". But remember, these guys developed the original Legion TD War, not the mega and hell variaties. I think it's very nice that they sticked to the original idea. I never liked the ""Angel Arena"" feel to other types of Legion TDs.

And also worth mentioning.. I love the art style, feels like torchlight in a good way. But some aspects of it are too childish, especially when the audience is mostly oldschool war3 players who are mostly adults by now.

This is a team based (4v4) competitive Tower Defence game in which you build towers against waves increasing difficult mobs. The twist of Legion TD is that at the end of the game you send your towers (they are actually living creatures not a stone tower in the literal sense) against the enemy team's towers in a showdown. And hence the difficulty lies in you have plan not only for the waves of mobs, but towards the enemy team as well. 

At higher levels of gameplay I can definately forsee build orders like Starcraft 2. There can also be pocket strategies in which one particular player does not build towers but focus on generating income through mining. So therefore I believe this game is complex enough to develop a competitive scene. 
 
(I admit I have only seen these advanced strategies in Legion TD 1/Warcraft 3, but the selling point of Legion TD 2 is its authenticity to LTD1/War3.)

The good: 

1) Plays exactly like Legion TD custom map on Warcraft III /Starcraft II. If you liked that you will like this. No controversial/unpopular mechanics changes so far. 

2) No Lootboxes (for now). Very rare these days.  

The bad:

1) I cannot imagine what their server infrastructure is like.  This game on launch has experienced server capacity issues on the levels of Diablo 3 and Simcity 2013. No one can ever login because they are stuck at the log in screen and if you do miraculously login, you can't play a game because your username is NULL as you cannot connect to the server that holds your username as well.  

I bought this on launch 20 November 2017 and found myself having connection issues. That's fine. I waited a few days and came back 23 November and it is still experiencing connections issues.

This is raising serious issues for the game's longevity. This sort of multiplayer only game need a large player base to sustain matchmaking of various skill levels, and I would hazard a guess a significant portion of the population has already refunded the game due to the game LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE. 

At this rate I wonder what is your server infrastucture is like. Is it a Pentium 4 3.0 Ghz powered by a hamster wheel?",1511515880,1511523213,False,6,0,0.481931775808334351,0,True,False,True

Please do not be dissuaded by the negative reviews (none of which this game or its dev team deserves). Every negative review here (and I've read most of them) is written by someone who is impatient and does not understand game development at all - let alone what early access means. Early access is a way to greatly include the community in the development process and help the (2 man) development team to iterate on an already solid game *before it is fully released*. It also is a time for them to work out infrastructure issues - which we are currently experiencing. If you can't be patient with an early access game that is being actively developed then you should not purchase it and leave nasty, uneducated reviews. If that is you, just be patient and wait until the game is fully released to review it.

I am personally impressed that this game is made by a 2 man team and I'm not surprised they're having infrastructure problems. At the time I'm writing this it can take up to 5 minutes just to get into the lobby server. This is frustrating enough on it's own but to make things worse you reenter the lobby queue every time you finish a game. From my understanding this is only a temporary solution while they prop up more servers to handle the load which was 20x more than they anticipated at launch (so cut them some slack). I do appreciate their responsiveness to the community and, although this is a headache, I will gladly be patient while they work out the kinks. They've done a great job recreating and improving on the original WC3 mod and I am in no way dissapointed. I'd like to see improved lobby/menu UI which feels a little amatuer at the moment but that, again, is totally understandable as a 2 man team. I think this game has the potential to be a huge success and I'm happy to help support them. Can I donate more money to help?",1511469499,1511469581,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

BUT let me warn you:
The game is still in EARLY ACCESS, that means:
The server are still not able to endure the sheer amount of players who try to login. Depending on the time of the day you have login times ranging from some seconds up to umpteen minutes. And that's just the login time for the lobby server. Right after that you can find a game pretty easily, IF you want to play alone, that is. If you want to try to play with one or more friends together, it gets even trickier. You don't always have a friendlist and can't invite your mates. Suddenly you are in a party with some random people, and when they start their queue you will be queued too!
Then, when you finished your game, you're right back in the login queue to get back to the lobby server, even to see your statistics. If you're unlucky you are unable to queue again (especially when trying with multiple people).

BUT when you get all that to work and bring the time or enough other stuff to do whilst in queue times, then this game is pure bliss. Especially for a mathematic driven person like me. You don't really need much skill or fast mouse movements to master this game, all you need is a really good game knowledge, the ability to use that knowledge, to adapt to your enemies and maybe some decent team mates (it's hard to win when one of your teammates goes afk wave 1). Even tho the players will be replaced by bots when leaving the game entirely. And they still have the ability to reconnect into the game later on.

Come to think they will add even more legions and king control perhapt this game will only get better so I definitely recommend it to anyone! It is also easiert to learn than other strategic games like League/Dota/Starcraft etc. and there are no mechanics/fast hand movement needed so older people who are smart about games can play it as well (personally going to show this game to my dad maybe he will like it! :) )

I really do love LegionTD, we still play this game on LAN Parties. You guys know why we love it? I mean, beside that it's fun to play? We can play it offline. No online connection needed, but a LAN network. 

So why don't you guys go back to the roots? Build in a offline mode. This way the launch wouldn't have failed this hard. We could start the game and play matches, with friends at home or with AI.

Well, because the devs expected only 400 to maybe 600 people to play the game in the first few days. The amount of unique logins have reached 25k+ until now, only 49 hours after release. 25000. They prepared effectively for 500.

But since the game was released, they were trying their best to fix the servers, so that evens it out and I am not going to let that affect my early point of view of the game.

To the game itself:

Even though it might seem like a Tower Defense game where you have that one most effective strategy and certain most effective units (which would be expected, since the generated ""waves"" attacking your ""towers"" each wave are the same), this is not at all the case. Each game differs a little bit, due to the enemies being able to send mercenaries on your lane to attack your towers alongside the preset wave. And these little differences affect your game in a way that is crucial and changes your every game you play.

Graphics:
Simple. Nothing special, animations feel a bit off and ""clumsy"" at times. Especially when it comes to high attack speeds, the animations of certain units do not work very well. But overall, it can be looked at and doesn't cause your eyes to get cancer. 6/10.

Interface:
Simple, intuitive and it seems like thought was put into it. You can basically ping everything you see and make all important announcements to your team by pinging. Nothing I could think of to improve the UI, except for the design. The functionality is definetly on point, which is the most important aspect of the UI for a game like this. 9.5/10.

Gameplay:
Oh, Boy.
As mentioned in the short opening section, it is more unique than you might expect of your average tower defense game and fits perfectly for competetive play. You can do complex tactics, but also very simple ones that are effective for beginners. The towers and attacking monsters feature different attack and defense types and also different abilities. This game, like many other competetive games, have a steep learning curve and here, intelligent and strategic thinking is the key to success, not reaction time or quick thinking (although you need to be quick in order to not miss waves, so you cant just take all the time in the world to think of the best available tactic). You also need to observe the way the enemy builds his lane, so you can attack adjusted to his units. Due to the lack of action which one might lead to playing even more, 9/10.

Overall impression would land on a solid 8/10. Might get better with time and server fixes.

But now at the 3rd day they got the servers working (at the moment there are really short login queues, I waited like 10 seconds)

I'm really enjoying the game, it's really similar to the old LTD mods in SC and WC, but still they changed some things and i really like it. 
If you ask yourself why should I buy this if I can just play the mods:
Like I said they changed a lot of stuff, there will be a lot a new stuff coming and there is a different interface. Also you support the devs that worked for years for nothing at all to provide you with the great mods.

At the moment we're in early acces so there aren't too many races and there is no prophet/mastermind only mode where you get random units so every game is exciting and you can't just use the same builds again and again, but I'm sure it will be coming since it's also there in the mods i refered too.

Of course, I spent thousands of hours playing these and the many other WC3 custom games, but this was truly a gem in the TD options. I wanted to buy it now because I fully support these developers in their efforts, and would love to see the game further developed to a point where they're proud to send it out as a full release.

In regards to their comment about possibly going free-to-play if players wanted it, I am perfectly fine with paying $20 for the game, but it would be disheartening if additional groups were added as DLC's. I would love to see any new content added as something that is free, or at the very least least freely obtainable with the option to purchase it if you just can't wait that long to earn it to try it. It seems like a popular thing with games now; shovel out loads paid DLC's for small additions to the game. But this is a horrible practice that has a massively negative view by players. I hope this doesn't become one of those.

I'm currently downloading the game as I'm writing this review, but I'm not expecting to be able to play and have a good experience on the day it launches. In my experience, many games have a rough launch date, but more often than not, it smooths out in a few days. It's great to see how many people are interested in playing, and I can't wait to get in and start playing too. I personally am going to save myself from a potential headache and wait a few days to better appreciate the game when it's more stable.

In order to post my review, I had to launch the game for at least 5 minutes. I was able to select my username and go to the lobby without any issue, but as expected, I was unable to connect to a game unfortunately. I was able to search for a game, was placed in a lobby with other players, found a server, and was connecting to the server. The game appeared to have started, but it never let me connect. Eventually it said I was disconnected, and then tried to reconnect again when it said I abandoned a game in progress. It disconnected me again, and the game closed. Based on the lobby, I was grouped with 3 Chinese players, and we were against 4 German players... so... there are probably 3 Chinese kids mad about my inability to connect to the game right now. As expected, there are server connection issues, but hopefully these will smooth out as time goes by.
