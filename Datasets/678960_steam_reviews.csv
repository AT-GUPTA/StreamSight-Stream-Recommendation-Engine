Plenty of touching stories. I really enjoyed first playthrough, where did everything possible for two good endings. It took under 50 hours. Maybe a bit more for 400 medals.

Overall game is positive, not like Dark Souls or Elden Ring. By the way, ghosts companions and that tricky jumping part of stage for bad ending in ER, I think, was inspired by CV.
Of course, companions in CV much better, than dummies in ER. And so is coop, completely free from cancer invasions. Though, I wish here some kind of arena too for PvP.

While stages are straight forward at first glance, you will noticed, that they are a bit complicated and it requires some time and effort to investigate everything.

I think, Cathedral is a great example of genius level design) I know, many ppl hate it, though))

Also there is similar stage later, but if you apply ""switch"" road rule, it will be breeze.

Many good looking female bosses, 3 female companions + nice customization. While I helped other ppl or sent signals for fun, I enjoyed players customs.

It took me 84 hours to clear it for 100%, but I still will play it in coop mode.

What I don't like in game:
- autoaim is terrible. It is crystal clear, when you use great type of swords. ER much better with auto aim. At the same time if you pick manual, very often you still have some weird tracking, that become obvious, when few enemies are trying to attack you. It is like you aim in one direction, but than invisible force move your weapon somewhere else.

- netcode for long distance in coop is terrible too. It is impossible sometimes to dodge in time. But mostly I saw this, when played in the morning, when only players from distant regions are available.

I wish here was base customization, so you can decorate your fortress a bit)

Kind of like going to a bar and finding someone attractive just to see how bad the choice was. 
As a matter of fact, the boss which made me write this negative review is Blade Bearer and the Cannoneer.
I strongly respect that Bandai Namco wanted to get some of that Fromsoftware spicy spicy boss recipe, but they failed harder than Plankton stealing recipe from Mr Crabs. This awful duo which was supposed to be another refresh of Orstein and Smough turned out to be worse than throne watchers from DS 2. 
Moreover, as a follow up to my nagging before that, the ""imperfections"" I mentioned is the whole combat system. As a casual parry enjoyer I thought that parries would be more polished and they would mean anything. Though, parrying basically does nothing. Nice, I see how you wanted to subvert expectations. Nonetheless, if you remember DS1, beware blocking is back. Yep, they did it again. What does it offer you? Well, we designed some bosses in a very specific way because you will not be able to roll enough times, parrying does nothing... so yeah. Just block, hehehe.
Side note: attacks are not well telegraphed, enemy hitboxes are the size of yo-mamma (massive).  
The most infuriating bosses I have seen in a while are compiled into a nothing sandwich which is Code Vein. Do I regret buying / playing it? Nah. It makes me appreciate mid games more. 
On top of that, upgrading weapons feels like nothing is moving forward. By the time you get to aforementioned duo, you have +10 weapon and you need to be rocket scientist to perform this battle even with a companion. Forget about co-op, game is dead. 
I will try to finish this one and come back after getting closer to platinum.

Edit 5 hrs more in this hot mess

1. Finished the game, just because RNG allowed me to do so
2. Thought I would do some side stuff like Depths 
3. I step into wrong neighborhood. 
4. Turned out Bandai Namco just thought Blade Bearer and the Cannoneer were such a banger combo that they would use them again, but in smaller arena 
5. There is also a twist, now the one which is killed first transfers their special powers to their companion. Nice shameless bottom line copy of DS1. 
6. Forgot to mention one whole area looks like Anor Londo, but without any soul or charater. Copy paste land. 
7. I thought I would push myself to get platinum just for the sake of it.

At first glance, it has the appearance of a soulslike but none of the substance. There is no mystery or intrigue. Levels are boring, dull, a chore to navigate and use the same few textures repeatedly. Despite the severe lack of environmental storytelling, cutscenes go on forever. During these obnoxiously melodramatic and long cutscenes with no self-awareness, either nothing is happening or characters explaining the things that are happening right in front of them. Until this game, I have never wanted to stop playing something because of its story. You can unlock new classes and skills by repairing the memories of the NPCs who all have amnesia and sit through more of the awful plot, but new skills and classes are mostly useless anyway. The game also severely lacks enemy variety and original soundtracks.

Combat feels quite impactful and has the right amount of ""sluggishness"" to it. Equipment-options are exceedingly limited (3 Slots - 2 for Weapons and 1 for your Blood Veil), but there is a wide variety of weapons that do set themselves apart from one another. Particularly some boss weapons with elemental effects feel very unique.

While weapon movesets are VERY basic, the option to combine gifts and passives from various classes (that also differ wildly) ensures that you have a lot of different playstyles at your disposal and you can create a class that wreaks havoc however you see fit. Be it a Greatsword-wielding berserker, an elemental caster or a ranged ichor cannon.

The lore is fairly interesting and the world-building is well done. In terms of the overall story - it is serviceable but definitely nothing to write home about.

If you've played some Dark Souls or Nioh, the standard difficulty is probably not going to be very challenging for you. The addition of a constant companion that can not only draw aggro, but also revive you, paired with the generous i-frames  and mostly heavily telegraphed moves makes it very easy to plough through most bosses.

Regardless of this, Code Vein stands as an above average souls-like and is definitely worth your time.",1707677738,1707684545,True,8,1,0.610689997673034668,0,True,False,False

the atmosphere and overall level design is really cool, despite being somewhat confusing at times. the story is great, and even better is the way it's delivered; the whole memory collecting thing is awesome. i usually hate ""protagonists without voice lines"" (not to be confused with purposefully silent protagonists), but code vein weirdly nails it somehow, probably because the voice acting of the other characters hard carries the cut scenes. the character creation is fantastic, and that's saying something for a bandai game, which also helps keep the interactions interesting.

gameplay-wise it's... complicated. the blood code mechanic is very unique and creative. the problem is that it's supposed to be a soulslike game. why is that a problem exactly? because it's too easy. i hate having to type that out but it's true. the difficulty really hinders the use of the many unique and fun mechanics it presents. the combat really doesn't do a good job at stimulating the player to explore different builds or even learn the core mechanics at all, which for me is a big problem personally. to me the most fun part of soulslike games is being challenged and forced to learn, something that unfortunately doesn't quite happen in code vein. to give it some credit, it's not like the bosses don't have fun mechanics and learning curves, but somehow nothing seems to really deal much damage or pose a significant threat.

in conclusion, it's a good game. you'll have fun playing it, and you'll definitely be engaged in the story. but don't expect the typical soulslike experience as i think most will have a strangely easy time playing, specially for more experienced players.",1675754187,1707456451,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Therefore, I think the problem is my computer and not the game. I moved my original complaint to the bottom of this review. 

Although I am not really a fan of Soulslike games, Code Vein was good if I'm being objective about it. The character customization was fun. I was pleasantly surprised to find the story interesting. The writing was not bad, even though it was basically about post-apocalyptic vampire anime waifus and husbandos. There was at least one creative twist, and the characters had believable relationships. The music was good, and so was the voice acting in Japanese. I thought the UI looked minimalist and stylish. Rebinding keys for keyboard and mouse was easy. However, it was annoying that the game chose ""E"" as a default unchangeable key for interacting with doors/NPCs and even your Haze (souls) if you died and dropped them.

Gameplay was alright. The weapon movesets were limited, but a variety of weapons, ""classes"", and skills gave way to various playstyles. You aren't locked into one class, so you can open your loadout and change it in the middle of the instance. This encouraged us to try new skills that helped counter certain enemies. The only confusing things were the explanations that lived outside of the game. (But I play Monster Hunter, so...) Every once in awhile, I had to look up what stats do, how the letter grade scaling system worked, the difference between two weapons of the same class, enemy weaknesses, etc. 

I enjoyed the pace of combat. It seemed faster than Dark Souls, but slower than a hack and slash. For me, Normal difficulty was easy to medium with a couple of hard fights. With my friend and the partner NPC, we didn't die too often, but there were a couple of fights in which we died repeatedly. There was also one boss that forced us to go online and check its weakness. The partner seemed to do a lot of damage and helped with diverting an enemy's attention. Some of the maps were so big that I might have gotten annoyed if I wasn't playing with a friend. But then again, I had to do every map twice due to the way co-op only gave the helper more Haze.

***
ORIGINAL COMPLAINT: 

I don't really like Soulslike games, but the irony is that I would have recommended this one if I hadn't just experienced inexplicable screen tearing after playing for 75 hours. I spent the last 3 hours of playtime relearning how to play (I sorta dropped this title 2-3 years ago), changing my builds, troubleshooting graphical issues, and finally beating the end boss. I had been playing with a friend prior. I forget why we stopped right before the final boss, but I didn't like how co-op wouldn't complete the mission for both players. Such is a soulslike, I suppose. 

I had v sync turned off (it never worked for me) and the frame rate capped at the correct rate. Toggling the cap higher didn't do anything, nor did lowering the graphics quality. Nothing was out of the ordinary in my Nvidia control panel. Next, I updated my video card driver, reset graphics to my recommended system settings, and restarted my PC -- which also didn't help. Scratching my head, I tried increasing the frame rate cap above my monitor's actual refresh rate one more time. This somehow made screen tearing less severe, but I still saw it from time to time, even in the second to last final cutscene where something important was happening. If this happened to me in my first 2 hours of the game, then I definitely would have returned it.

Maybe there was an update that went wrong? I noticed a game client version listed on the title screen. During today's session, my game also froze when I had alt tabbed for just a second. I had to kill the app in Task Manager to close it. I also ran into another bug that was already documented in another Steam thread: I couldn't exit the ""Receive Items"" window when trading with NPCs at home base. That was fixed by giving them my stuff and walking away every time before trying to take the item I wanted from them.

NEW THOUGHTS: 
I already uninstalled the game, so I have no desire to redownload it and test other settings. But I probably should have fiddled around with v sync again.",1706868259,1706999576,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

It is true that the game makes little bones about its influence while adding an anime coat of paint to the proceedings. But what differentiates it from other soulslikes such as ""The Surge"", ""Hellpoint"" and even ""Jedi Fallen Order"" is that ""Code Vein"" is developed by Bandai Namco - the very publishers of ""Dark Souls"", as well as the incoming ""Elden Ring"". In this context, I like to think ""Code Vein"" is less like a clone and more like evidence of FromSoftware's influence on Bandai Namco. It's a game that shows what the company assimilated from its time with Hidetaka Miyazaki.

However, the game tries to be more accessible on several fronts, and I have seen people calling it ""easy Dark Souls"". The game has its share of differences from the real thing, so I would like to address them here.

For starters, the world design of ""Code Vein"" is a bit different from that of ""Dark Souls"". While ""DS"" had these interconnected levels with several paths to each other, the levels of ""CV"" are more isolated, with usually one path leading in, and one path leading out. And when it seems that you have hit a dead end, it means you have to backtrack to another level, in which a path has just become accessible.

On top of that, you now have a mini-map that marks with a dotted track where you have been, and it will be incredibly useful for you not to walk in circles. At first, when you arrive in a new area, the map will be blank - the track you leave behind will be your only mean of navigation. But in the tradition of Ubisoft games, you reveal more of the map by activating mistles in the levels - the game's equivalent of the bonfires in ""DS"". The map also pinpoints quest-giving NPCs in the environment: they usually require you to retrieve an object or to kill a monster, and those will be marked on your map as well. Puritans will be horrified by that, but I deeply appreciated the game making things easier for side missions.

Most of the levels are actually fairly short, but they still have that traditional FromSoftware design of having multiple tracks, shortcuts and locked doors. It also pays off to always look down edges: sometimes there's a path underneath them leading to new areas.

The levels are reasonably uncomplicated to solve and navigate... except the hateful Cathedral, which is a massive, unpleasant maze that will drive you mad. I remember when I saw Iron Pineapple's video on YouTube of him playing the game, and the Cathedral was incredibly frustrating for him. When I finally got to the place, all I thought was ""oh hell no"". At first I tried to solve the place by my own, but when I found myself stuck, I swallowed my pride and looked out for a walkthrough - and you should too. I bet the developers were really proud of designing a level so big and complex, but it's just not fun. Even with the mini-map, since the place has a lot of verticality, and the mini-map is not dimensional like that. Later on, there will also be the Crypt Spire, but at very least it's not that big and complicated.

Then there's the home base, which is not directly connected with the rest of the world. This is a place for you to buy stuff, talk to your fellow companions, upgrade your gear, fight previous bosses, and even to know where to go next: there's a mural with your current objective, so you're never really lost in that world.

Still on the subject of the world, the Depths are these separate levels that are not directly connected to the main world, and can only be accessed at first through a character at your home base, and later by teleportation. These levels seem to be optional, but they do offer rewards, like perhaps better weaponry and more boosts. Unfortunately, they're all designed the same: you have to fetch keys to open a door and fight a boss that you already faced before.

You can have a companion in your adventures. This makes bosses and surprise hordes more bearable. Once again, puritans will scoff at this, but I was very appreciative of it - besides, you can go alone in your quest if you desire so. Different companions have different styles, and they can revive you when you're down by giving you some of their own HP. This makes them more vulnerable, but it gives you a fighting chance - it actually reminded me of the second life mechanic from ""Sekiro"". Companions are very reliable, but they're also very talky: they always have something to say at whichever circumstance.

Companions actually carry a lot of valuable objects, and the way to get them is a bit more complicated than in a Bethesda game. You have to score points with them, and the way for that is to give them special gift items that can be traded for what they're caring. Unfortunately, however, I found out there's a glitch in the game that would lock me in the trading screen after I got something. This made me sceptical about trading stuff, so you're better off saving the game first by doing a quick visit to the local mistle.

There are plenty of weapons and veils (the game's version of armours) to be found. They can be upgraded, and if you have the right items you can give your weapons extra powers, such as lighting damage or poisonous effects. Another way the game tries to differentiate itself from ""DS"" is to have what it calls a ""blood code"". Different codes can give your character different stats and abilities, and they can be changed at anytime.

One thing I really didn't like is that your character is barely visible through most of the game. I took my time in creating my anime character and her clothes, only to discover that when you're outside your home base and into the world at large you always have a mask over your face - and the veil covering your clothes. What were they thinking? It may serve the propose of lore, but its aesthetically unsound and not intuitive.

And now that I mentioned lore, I think the biggest difference between ""Code Vein"" to the works by FromSoftware is the way it presents its story. Miyazaki has always been economic and minimalist about the way his games tell their stories: there are barely cutscenes in his works, and they only pop out at very important moments. Meanwhile, in ""Code Vein"", it's like you can't go 40 minutes before you trigger a cutscene. And they're long, with talkative characters exposing the story for us. There will also be these obnoxious moments when you restore vestiges of memories from other characters, as you walk slowly through these dream lands, watch static petrified models, and listen to dialogue in the background. That just sucks.

As for the rest, it's pretty much ""Dark Souls"". You have your usual lock-on combat, rolling mechanics, boosts for your weapons and yourself, bonfire-like mistles for resting, levelling up and teleportation, backstabs, and a pause menu that doesn't actually pause the game even when you're playing offline by yourself. The game also adopts the posture mechanics of ""Sekiro"" as well. It is ""Dark Souls"" simplified for an audience who may have always been interested in the mechanics of the series, but may have been turned off by its difficulty - specially in what concerns traversing the levels.",1632124997,1706756443,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Has it's own charm on souls-like game, but not so great, 

- Pros
- has an AI partner, this partner has a great stat that can tank enemy attack and easily can make as a bait in combat
- blood code, makes building character easier to understand, pretty much like a preset stat for classes
- ability to learn, ability can be inherited to another blood code which can be used
- anime
- good VA
- pretty good character customization

- Cons
- it has a clunky attack animation which kinda makes bad spacing when doing melee attacks
- slow death animation, makes you frustrate to repeat the battle
- anime

Cons first:
-Combat is jank, un-intuitive, jank, clunky, and jank.
-Maps look decent. if formulaic, but have Far too much empty space, wasting a player's time in traversal.
-Music is largely bland and easily forgettable.

Pros:
-Story content is genuinely interesting and engaging, with surprising twists and hard-hitting moments.
-Characters are largely compelling, and emotional aspects are handled amazingly. Seeing the hardest character in the game on the edge of tears purely by the quivering of his eyes is excellent attention to detail. Some character arcs fall flat, but those are the minority.

Pros:
- The absolute best character creation I've ever seen in my entire life
- Story and themes are super intriguing but I didn't make it far enough to actually rate it properly
- The Blood Code system is amazing and I would LOVE to see more of that in other games. Having the option to pretty much change your class at any point in the game to encourage versatility and build exploration is such a cool mechanic.

Cons:
- Janky as hell. A 2019 game shouldn't be this clunky. Inconsistent backstab, lots of inputs not registering properly resulting in various frustrating situations, inconsistent dodges, etc
- A LOT of enemy attacks have ZERO wind up which makes it virtually impossible to react to some attacks
- Mob density = artificial difficulty and this game has loads of it. Enemies, group composition and bosses don't feel thought of at all. It just feels like they crammed the same enemies everywhere as much as they possibly could and call it a day.
- Controller mapping. As of 2019 there are TONS of soulslike with virtually all the same controls but they somehow decided to just attribute random actions to random numbers with some controller buttons not being remmapable properly so you can't get the usual ""Light attacks on R1 and heavies on R2"" for some reason",1705947037,1705954185,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Hra se odehrává ve světě, který byl zasažen apokalyptickou katastrofou, která proměnila většinu populace v upíry. Hráč převezme roli Revenanta, který trpí ztrátou paměti a musí bojovat proti hordám nepřátel, aby odhalil svou minulost.

Hra se vyznačuje kvalitním a detailním výtvarným stylem. Svět CODE VEIN je temný a ponurý, s rozmanitými lokacemi a nepřáteli, což přispívá k atmosféře hry. Grafické provedení je obzvláště pečlivé a oko lahodící. Postavy jsou také dobře navržené, s výraznými tvářemi a oblečením.

Ve hře je důležitým aspektem bojový systém. Hráč může vytvořit vlastní postavu, vybavit ji různými zbraněmi a schopnostmi a poté se pustit do boje proti nepřátelům. Hra nabízí různé styly boje, včetně rychlých útoků a silných úderů, a také různé strategie, které můžete využít při boji s různými druhy nepřátel.

Dalším zajímavým prvkem hry je možnost vzít si s sebou společníka, který vám může pomáhat při boji. Tito společníci mají své unikátní schopnosti a dovednosti, a také příběhové vývoje, které můžete odemknout prostřednictvím interakcí s nimi.

Co se týče příběhu, CODE VEIN nabízí zajímavý a zapojený příběh, který se postupně odhaluje během hry. Příběh je plný intrik a tajemství, a také obsahuje několik dojemných a emotivních momentů.

Jedním z nedostatků hry je příležitostná frustrace v důsledku obtížných soubojů. Některé bossové souboje mohou být velmi těžké a vyžadují trpělivost a opakování. To může být pro některé hráče frustrující a může odradit některé hráče.

Celkově vzato, CODE VEIN je velmi kvalitní akční RPG s atraktivním vizuálním stylem, zajímavým bojovým systémem a poutavým příběhem. Hra je určitě doporučovaná pro fanoušky žánru a pro ty, kteří hledají výzvu ve formě obtížných soubojů.",1705826685,1705826685,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Graphics: if you like anime graphics then you will likely love the aesthetics. Some of the best visuals I've ever seen for an anime-styled game. Animations are also very smooth and well done. Enemy visual designs are pretty awesome - similarly for bosses. Also, I love the dark fantasy quasi-vampire vibes from the story/setting/environment.

Sound: stellar. Voice acting for all conversations and some notably famous voice actors have been recruited as well. Also, while the companion is following you they will occasionally say something - sometimes what they say is just idle chat but sometimes they things of interest like making you aware of certain interactive objects. Ambience, music, and enemy sounds are good too. They really put a lot of effort into the sound department.

Gameplay: has all the things you love about Souls-like games like parry, block, dodge, light, heavy but in addition also has the concept of ichor to use to cast skills and regaining ichor through various means like drain attacks, back attacks, parry, dodge, block, launch attacks (only when in focused state during combat), and normal attacks as well, so the game encourages skill usage a lot more than most Souls-like games. There are a crazy number of different builds to make because you can equip 4 passives and 8 active skills and you have to find blood codes to unlock them and you have to ""master"" them if you want to transfer them to a different equipped blood code. There are 3 equip slots: blood code, blood veil (armor), and weapon. You can also enhance your build with one of multiple different companions or choose to tackle the game solo. Backtracking, finding shortcuts, hidden items, finding hidden paths, these are all done well - the map designs are pretty good in my opinion. I also like that the game is not mission-based, but comprised of different maps that you can revisit that retain the shortcuts you've unlocked.

Replay value: high - there are many different builds, there are other gameplay modes/instances that you can combat through outside the story, there's also NG+, etc. that you can replay at either enhanced difficulty or normal difficulty. That is in addition to the fact that the game is very long on its own for just beating the story (about 30 hours).

Difficulty (unpopular opinion): I actually enjoy this game more than the FromSoftware Dark Souls/Elden Ring titles. I feel like the game allows for more variety of playstyles, whether you like dodging, blocking, parry (although I believe you don't benefit from parrying bosses), ranged, melee, glass cannon, tanky playstyles, and, in my opinion, the bosses and enemies are more ""fair"" (i.e., they don't just blast the arena with large AOE's constantly in every fight and there seems to be less one-shot type damages).",1705801558,1705804238,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-Primarily, the graphics. It's pretty, it's gorey, it's the perfect edgy anime vibe.
-The soundtrack is fun to listen to, and you can play piano!
-The story, while confusing, is pretty fun, and different from anything else I've played. 
-Character customization is out of this world! Seriously spent half my time just playing around with customization. 
-The combat is fun, and does require an element of skill rather than button mashing.

What I Don't:
-The multiplayer is horrible. Random match-ups are extremely rare, but playing with your friends is hardly fun at all due to poor handling of cut-scenes/constantly kicking out anyone that isn't the host. I wouldn't normally mind this, but I'm terrible at some of these bosses so I'm now completely stuck since I can't get any support, and can't bother continuing to die on my own.
-While there is a decent story reason for this, I strongly dislike games that require multiple playthroughs to get all the achievements, despite minimal differences in said playthroughs (i.e. having to play every class, despite not every class being suited for every play style).
-Combat can be kind of janky/unpredictable at times, dodging/parrying aren't always reliable.


Overall, I had a really fun time with this game. I am genuinely glad I played it. That being said without a major overhaul of the multiplayer system at a minimum, I wouldn't bother recommending this to anyone. Which means a lot, as I usually play most of my games solo, even with decent multiplayer options. I just feel this game fell short in a lot of important areas, and no amount of brilliance elsewhere could make up for it's glaring issues. It's a pretty niche type of game too, which makes the issues even more obvious.

""Code Vein"", the action RPG developed and published by Bandai Namco, emerges from the shadows as a magnificent symphony of gothic artistry, thrilling combat, and a deep, emotionally charged narrative. Drawing inspiration from the Souls series while infusing it with its own unique flavor, Code Vein stands proudly as a captivating and unforgettable experience.

From the very first frame, ""Code Vein"" enchants players with its breathtaking visual design. The post-apocalyptic world is gorgeously detailed, a mix of desolate landscapes and grand architecture overtaken by nature's reclamation. The character and enemy designs are an exquisite blend of elegance and darkness, reflecting the game's central theme of vampiric beauty amidst ruin. Each locale is distinct, offering a diverse range of environments that seamlessly weave into the narrative, making exploration a genuinely enthralling journey.

The character creation system is a highlight, allowing players to sculpt their revenant avatars with astonishing precision. From facial features to body types, every element can be tailored to one's liking, resulting in a truly unique protagonist. Further personalization comes from Blood Codes, which function as distinct character classes, granting players access to varied abilities and play-styles. This depth of customization fosters a strong connection between the player and their avatar, enhancing the immersive experience.

Combat in ""Code Vein"" is a mesmerizing ballet of precision and strategy. Drawing inspiration from the Souls-borne formula, battles are intense and demand a careful balance between offense and defense. The introduction of Blood Veils and Blood Codes adds an innovative layer to the combat, allowing players to drain enemies' blood to enhance their abilities, reflecting the vampire lore beautifully. Weapons feel impactful, and mastering the various skills and combos is deeply rewarding. Moreover, the AI companion system, which grants a partner to assist in battles, adds a layer of camaraderie and tactical depth.

At the core of ""Code Vein"" lies a narrative that surprises and resonates. The story is not just about survival; it delves into themes of sacrifice, redemption, and the nature of humanity. The game's NPCs are memorable, each with their own tragic tales that weave into the overarching plot. With a world shrouded in mystery, unraveling its secrets is a driving force that keeps players engaged throughout their journey.

The musical score of ""Code Vein"" complements the visual grandeur impeccably. From hauntingly melodic tunes to pulse-pounding battle themes, the music serves as a vital emotional anchor, heightening the impact of every moment. Voice acting is well-crafted, breathing life into characters and adding emotional weight to their interactions.

While ""Code Vein"" stands tall as an exceptional RPG, there are minor areas that could benefit from refinement. Occasional frame rate drops and texture pop-ins momentarily disrupt the immersive experience, though they are infrequent and do not significantly detract from the overall enjoyment.

Ultimately, ""Code Vein"" is a masterpiece that successfully carves its niche in the action RPG genre. It captivates with its gothic beauty, combat finesse, and deeply moving narrative. Fans of challenging games with rich lore will find themselves entranced by the world of Vein and its cast of characters. Bandai Namco has crafted a symphony of darkness and blood that will resonate with players long after the final credits roll. In a sea of games, ""Code Vein"" shines as a unique gem, a testament to the power of creativity and storytelling in the medium. It stands as a reminder that even in the midst of darkness, beauty and resilience can emerge, and that the bonds formed through struggle can be the most enduring of all.",1693176015,1705352431,True,4,0,0.511378824710845947,0,True,False,False

The reason being it will not be patched or updated in all likelihood. With the low res textures, lack of HDR support, and its general age makes me ask if it deserves $60 given there are newer games out there (with higher budgets) for less. Now keep in mind Code Vein is one of the best souls-likes RN. People often forget how many there are, especially bad ones; but so long as you can come to terms with the fact that you will die because sometimes your build is just bad for what you are doing. I think you will enjoy the game 

The good: Gameplay, Build varieties, Music, Artstyle, Background lore* Character creater (anyone you want but anime).
The bad: Story, Level design (especialy the cathedral even if I found it fun), Character development, Character design*, Pacing.

The basic gameplay loop isn't too hard to grasp if you've played a souls-like before, since it's mostly the same with a few modifications and additions to spice things up. Heavy attack, Light attack, dodge, special attack, and stamina management are similar to most other souls likes, though you may need to remap your buttons if you like the souls control scheme. You have a limited pool of MP to use your skills and buffs and can increase it via backstabs, parries, and drain attacks. As well as a focus meter that fills up as you dodge block and parry (it may do something but I never incorperated it in my builds so IDK). You also have the option to play with a Partner AI that can revive you, take agro, and deals some damage, but it always depends on what you do.

Your level gives you a set amount of stat points that are distributed via a ""fixed"" modifier from your class. These modifiers determine what skills/weapons/veils you can use but you can add any skill to any class as long as the letter is high enough. Veils enable you to do drain attacks and greatly affect your stats and mp gain (ichor). You start off as a blank slate with a handful of skills and classes to start the game, which will be expanded/modified as you play the game and collect more vestiges. This system allows you to have a massive variety of builds without even requiring you to level up. My only problem was the game didn't include any information about how these things worked in the tutorial instead requiring you to learn by trial and error, or just using your eyes.

The music is good for what it's worth it isn't distracting, and does get somewhat exciting when it winds up. It manages to sit in the background as you wander the artistically diverse maps and deal with their ""wonderful"" gimmicks (sand and water). There are only a handful of songs for each activity, so you end up hearing them very often and depending on the ending you're going for the memory song may or may not get stuck in your head.

The maps are beautiful/interesting with each following its own theme and most of the early game maps are all connected to the city center as a hub. The devs knew what their artstyle was able to do, how the thorns were everywhere and moved the preexisting architecture, created deep crevices in the earth then called the depths (endgame stuff). With the entire region being a near unlivable wasteland with massive glowing vines strangling the the remains of the city. How the crypts look like they're made of bone or wrought earth, impossible stuctures of ice, the burning remains of some shipyard, underground prisions deep within what was once a carpark. The style is consistent, and is really amazing in 4k only being held back by the low resolution textures.

However can't look past the one elephant in the room for this artstyle, this game has a lot of ""sexually"" charged character designs. I don't mean like how claymore handles it. Most of the men are himbos designed to pander to a few different popular ""Hot guy"" styles. Most of the women are some form of ""dere"". All of which are to apeal to the general cliches of ""sexy anime women"". this extends to the designs of enemies, bosses, NPCs, and the tools for when you create your character. It never gets to full nudity, and the game is indeed rated M for blood partial nudity, and violence however some people have been caught off guard by it. One dude had a 63 comment thread about this SMH. Vampires are sexual monsters to manipulate humans and always have been. They are literally representations of evil and are a type of immoral demon. IDK how people get pressed about stuff like this.

The story and world of this game is inherently absurd and can explain in part both the lore and character design. Simply put you are a special vampire in a world of insane mutated vampires that opress normal vampires and humans on a quest to save everyone from bloodthirst. So you head out to find these bloodbeads that come from some of the queen's leftover power to see if you can use the power you alone hold to awaken the bloodspring source..

The big issue is the fact that they tried to do too much beyond the original premise, and all the mystique of this ruined world get thrown out. You stop feeling like you're uncovering the secrets of the world way too early into the game; it leaves the other themes and fun facts feeling as though they might as well be loading screen exposition. Themes That could greatly benefit the worldbuilding and improve the story: Themes of loss one's self identity. The idea of starting over in a ruined world with an ever dwinding supply. Questioning the morality behind project queen, since they turned a young woman into a mine of material abusing her immortality. Was it right that so many vampires were created from the non-consenting dead, and should humanity as a whole be held responsible.

Instead of exploring the concepts the game introduces it tries to rush character development throgh some extremely awkward cutscenes, yes the one's where you exist. Honestly I was desensitized by the time ""The Real Bad Guy""TM made his appearance.

I know I sounded like a real negative nancy when I described the problems with the game but they really didn't bother me too much while I was playing. The story isn't as bad when you focus on the vestiges. There's NG+, and plenty of dungeons for endgame or midgame or whatever. The DLC dungeons are fun and add to the experience if you bother to buy them but they aren't unbalanced. Most importantly have fun with whatever you choose to play, God bless!",1705043376,1705043376,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Well, I typed up a short essay to review the game but it didn't save so now I'm just pissed and going to give a super short review.

It's a good game, the story is good but cheesy at times combat is fun with lots of built diversity.
The areas are all visually good-looking but are very linear and enemy variety isn't great.
Difficulty  can vary based on playing with a companion or alone, the balance is based on having a companion so playing solo is only recommended for hard core players. Over all its a good game even if the DLC shafted it, in terms of potentially getting more notary.",1614904307,1705033621,True,1,0,0.501867949962615967,0,True,False,False

The first element would be the character customisation, with quite an in depth character creator, it is easy to create any of your favourite anime characters and play the game as them. My only complaint would be that there is not a convenient way to import and export your character presets to share with others and play as other presets easily. The only way for you to create characters others have made is to meticulously copy the same settings when attempting to remake the same character. 

The second element is the character customisation of the builds. As the player progresses through the game, you unlock classes which have their own unique stat spreads and passive and active gifts (the games term for spells). The gifts are initially restricted to the specific class to use, but you can ""master"" the gifts through killing enemies and this unlocks the class restriction on the spells, allowing you to use the mastered gifts on all other classes (outside of a few powerful gifts which are locked to a class no matter what). While some weapons, gifts and armour have a stat restriction, since the stat spreads are tied to the classes, you can just freely swap classes on the fly for no cost meet the stat requirements.  You basically have access to all the builds and can freely switch from one build to another once you have unlocked the required classes and the relevant gifts you want to use. The weapon system is simple as the weapons can be enhanced to +10 with in-game materials, I found that the game gave you enough of the enhancement materials so it would not be a problem if you wanted to try a bunch of weapons. Additionally, in the later areas, when finding new armours and weapons, they come upgraded to the expected baseline(+3,+6 or +9) of your current weapon/armour set so you don't need to enhance them from +1 to +10. 

The last element that is quite important to this genre that the game does deliver on is thankfully the bosses. While the graphics of the game is a bit lacking for the overall experience, the gameplay of the bosses is quite superb for the most part. Outside of a couple outliers, the bosses are all quite fair and challenging as a solo experience. While most of the bosses movesets and attacks start out basic, usually they have a soft phase change halfway through the fight. The base moveset is built upon with small and simple additions that add to a fair but still challenging boss encounter. There are a couple of moves that lack a react-able tell for some bosses, but this is rare enough that was not a source of frustration when learning bosses. Unlike the general enemies, the bosses had minimal reuse outside of one remixed fight. I do know that the depths area just reuse these bosses, but that area seems more like a bonus option side area for you to grind in. When coupled with the build variety and freedom to switch to any build on the fly, learning a boss has never had more options available especially when a boss is giving your specific build a hard time. 

Unfortunately, outside of these 3 factors, everything else in the game is either painfully average or subpar compared to the Fromsoft games. However, as flawed and subpar as this game is, overall, I still had an enjoyable time as the game was what I expected for the most part for a game that seems like Dark souls with an anime aesthetic. Would recommend this game on a heavy sale for anyone who enjoys Souls-likes, the anime aesthetic and the excellent boss gameplay of the genre.",1705016851,1705017176,True,18,0,0.722061634063720703,0,True,False,False

Lies of P has much better parrying, feels really pointless here . . .
The flow of combat is pretty great, all bosses have a small pause between moves that in case you have not been damaged you can either punish, rebuff or heal. Similar with most mobs, but in case you are surrounded, run, because they will stun lock you.
Story is the usual shit for anime. Everyone has tragic back story, everyone is traumatized but in the end has hopeful outlook on future or dies.
I hate tragedies, but this is so cringe I really don't care.

While it has similarities to DS with its checkpoint system, lost currency on death, combat, and overall feel of gameplay, it completely fails at actually doing Dark Souls in its own way and at understanding what makes Dark Souls good.  [spoiler] Buccaneer and cannoneer[/spoiler] are an example of this, the fight is basically Ornstein and Smough with guns and even the fight progression is similar to O&S, but it feels closer to RNG than an actual skill based fight.  Most of the bosses in the game feel unfair, even with the AI companion, as they obliterate your HP by pulling out awkward and frustrating moves in an instant that feel terrible to fight against.  Simply put, the bosses are hard, but in a crappy way, not a skill check.

The gameplay outside of the bosses is also pretty frustrating, the enemies either all die far too easily, or are obnoxious to fight against (looking at you [spoiler] Boreal Brutes [/spoiler]).  That wouldn't be as bad if it wasn't just 4 different enemies copy pasted throughout the entire game with maybe one area exclusive enemy per region.  

Speaking of regions, the level design in this game is atrocious.  I have never played a game before where I got angry at seeing new areas until this game.  Everything looks the same, all of the environments are mostly empty of interesting visuals, it's either buildings and rubble, buildings and spikes, buildings and sand, building and water, or buildings and snow caves.  It's generic and once you see one part of a region, you've seen the whole region. 
 
The map design is pretty poor as well, it seems that you've got options in where to go, and which routes to skip if you wish, but then it turns out that you need to explore both routes anyways looking for a ladder, a key, or a door switch because what you need to progress one route, is at the end of another.  It would be better, if you didn't have to backtrack every ten steps for one thing or another, there's too many little roadblocks for the progression to feel fluid.  One area ([spoiler] cathedral of sacred blood [/spoiler])took several hours just to get through because it: had dozens of locked doors, was designed like a maze, had too many dead ends and hidden (but mandatory) routes.  

And on the note of routes, the game was not very clear where to go after each major boss since you would have to go to different already completed areas for the now open pathway (that may have just been me not paying enough attention though.)

The story itself was ok, a bit cliche and predictable, with the typical Anime style and story elements.  It actually told the player the story upfront, so it's a bit easier to follow.

Overall it was not worth my time nor money

Dodge type is based on weight which means you have slow, normal and quick blink(fast). iframes are fine for 1v1 add multiple projectile or multiple enemies and dodge feels awful.

Parry exist but you have to parry before the enemy has attacked but not to soon and not to late. By this i mean it feels off you dont click it when it feels right.

Backstabs is the most consistent mechanic but i dont know when it works and when it wont... get behind enemy click normal attack if you dont get backstab quickly dodge and try again.

Stagger mechanic
This is propaply the biggest reason for the game feeling clunky. So every enemy(not bosses) has a meter that build up from attacks. So you hit something with a big hammer and the enemy wont care until the meter has been completed. Once the meter is full that dosent mean the enemy is powerless, it will stagger for a few moments and then attack again.

Skills and status effects
I would split up skills into 4 categories

-big damage, I Would say this is the most useful to deal with high health enemies
-status effects, not very useful but is usually cheap and low effort
-crowd control/stagger build up, used to knock down trash or build up the stagger on higher health enemies
-buffs, more damage,more defense etc

So most effective method is the backstab on everything that isnt a boss. Does the most damage and is the easiest to pull off.

Level design was fine except one area that the game itself called a maze but it was mostly just infuriating.

Story was fine, nothing to be wow´d

Most of the weapons, armours, blood codes(classes), and consumable items are almost completely pointless after you pick your starting style (small fast wep VS big slow wep) as you get all your power from upgrading your weapon and you do more damage in a less risky way by just using mele all the time. Anytime i tried using a special attack it did about the same damage and often put me right in the path of an incoming attack so i stopped using them.

Gameplay was ok, most of the trash mobs were trivial to kill, it only when they started throwing a huge number of them at a time that it can get tricky which didn't happen very often.

The boss fights were tough enough.

Story was boring so i skipped all the dialog, and there was quite a lot of it too if you go through all the vestige unlock 'cutscenes'.

Things that is great:
Story-telling 
Difficulty (newbie-friendly)
Character-making (Really high freedom)
Combination of weapons ,blood veils and blood codes 

Can be improved:
DLC (No story, only new boss and overpowered blood type)
Battle (especially using heavy weapons, maybe it's my skill issue)
Map designing ([spoiler] Cathedral[/spoiler] )

Overall, i had a great experience. It feels really good to control your own character.

solo-play all achievements + 100-hours gameplay + 7th walkthrough
Conclusion: DLC blood codes are crucial, skills like ""Radiant Barrel""/""Lightning Charge""/""Steadfast Strike"" can significantly improve gaming experience.

Another big plus point is the large character creator, where you have a large amount of options for your avatar available.

Code Vein is exactly that, with many of the same parallels - makes sense, as it is developed by BANDAI NAMCO. Traverse areas as a revenant, collect haze to level up or unlock blood code abilities (classes, essentially) and fight difficult bosses. It has a really cool and expansive character creator with a wealth of options, and the game itself has some interesting ideas, but falls a bit flat overall.

So, if you ever played a Souls game before, Code Vein is exactly that, with a few mix-ups thanks to the abilities and blood codes. The game is mostly fun, looks appealing and has a good soundtrack, but it does have a few flaws, namely in terms of balancing and pacing. The story is also a bit confusing and doesn't want to hit right, but most of the voice-acting is well done.

Most of the game is actually rather easy comparatively, but there are a few bosses that will make you tear your hair out as they present huge difficulty spikes. Some are complete pushovers and others, especially later on, can kill you easily in two hits, without giving you any time to react. I played around a bit, but it does not seem like stacking resistances matters all too much; at most, you may be able to tank another hit, but that is about it. It makes some bosses feel super cheap, whereas others are challenging, and some are very easy. That balancing weirdness is also kind of there in the main game, with some areas having very unfair ambushes and strange enemy patterns. Whatever, it's a Souls game.

What also bothered me is the pacing of the game in terms of acquiring abilities and codes. There are a TON of blood codes for no discernable reason. You can ""inherit"" most abilities by using them for a while, which means you can then transfer them to other blood codes. Technically that means you can create your own class, with every code also having different attribute levels which determine how well you can handle equipment and armor. It is kind of cool and allows for some experimentation, but some blood codes are clearly much better than others, some are very strong and others feel super weak. There are at least 3 dozen, if not more, and there is quite some overlap. 

That diversity does not extend to the weapons, though, as there are only few weapon types. You will quickly find your favourite weapon that meshes with the code you are using, upgrade it to the max throughout the game and that is that.  You constantly gain new blood codes, but chances are that you won't change away from what works for you, and many of them have abilities locked behind finding ""vestiges"", so it may even take some time for them to become really useful, so may as well stick to what works. For that reason, finding new codes just often seemed somewhat pointless to me. I only switched my code once about halfway through the game.

Then again, it is fun to experiment and find your playstyle, though with so many codes but so few weapon types, it actually feels surprisingly limiting at times. Inheriting the abilities is also a good idea, but can take some time depending on ability, during which you may be switching to a code that is much weaker or not suited to what you are used to, and you will essentially have to ""grind"" for a bit. Technically this is all optional, but you really don't want to limit yourself to just one code with it's own abilities as you can have up to 8 active and 4 passive abilities.

Anyway, I feel like Code Vein has a lot of cool ideas, but in the end it's ""just"" Anime Souls with bouncing robertsons (almost every woman has a ridiculous chest size), a wealth of options that end up surprisingly limited, a flat story with meh characters and a generally fun, but partly unbalanced gameplay loop through mostly drab areas - though a few of the areas I actually really liked in terms of creativity and looks. I will still upvote it because it ""works"" and most of my playtime has been somewhat fun, but I also feel like there was a lot of unfulfilled potential in the game and its mechanics.

The only good thing about this game is the character customization and you can't change my opinion on that. 
Our biggest issue was the multiplayer, you can only invite one person to an area where you haven't defeated the boss. When the revenant is helping you, you can't use Mistles to heal or save, when they die they are forced back to their world and they have to rejoin the host manually which forces them through two loading screens. After every boss your partner is forced back to their world without being able to see the cutscene and lastly you can't join your friends from your base you have to load somewhere else first.

If you were planning to get this game so you can play with your friend I don't recommend it.

Level design wise it's just bland and sometimes irritating. Up to the Cathedral it was serviceable but having to fall off to reach new areas becomes old pretty quick, after that the City on fire was a chore especially in multiplayer where you can use mistles and you're forced to take damage just to progress with the fire floors and lastly the sand area where for some reason the sand drains ichor and slows which just makes the game feel sluggish. The mistle placement on the sand map was also horrible, only unlocking the mistle at the boss arena after you defeat it which makes it obsolete.

Enemies are in my mind split into a few stereotypes, all of them bad.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Anime vampires sounds like a fun premise, and I can't deny that it has that little something that keeps you playing, but returning to Code Vein a couple years later I can't stop myself from thinking that every aspect of this game is painfully mediocre.

...Except for the character creator. I liked that.

[h1]Story and gameplay[/h1]

Oh, it's very anime. Code Vein is fairly cutscene heavy and features a lot of characters that will have their time under the spotlight in one way or anohter. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3114405380
The game starts us out as your traditional amnesiac protagonist. You don't know who you are, you really pretty much wake up with no knowledge of the world around you, and it's up to you to unravel what is going on and what the hell you have forgotten, while trying to unscrew the very screwed up world of Code Vein.

Other than being story-heavy, it's your usual souls-like fair - you have your home base with merchants and NPCs, you progress through levels, exploring for materials and upgrades and whatever other collectables on the way, you kill enemies that try to kill you while you do that, and each level finishes off with a boss fight (and a few cutscenes, of course). 

The levels, overall, are pretty boring samey-looking corridors with enemies (and lots of bottomless pits for you to be thrown or roll in), and I wouldn't really say that level design is where the game shines. One level in particular that would give Code Vein players PTSD upon hearing the word ""Cathedral"".

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3114395877
The enemy variety is pretty low, and you will absolutely meet reskins of enemies you saw in the beginning of the game in late game areas. Combat and boss fights can be quite fun due to the big anime weapons and the cool blood magic abilites, but all the aforementioned factors turn the game towards boring tedium most of the time... So the story cutscenes at least give you a nice feeling of ""Woohoo, I progressed!"" every time you beat a boss and finish a level. Until you stop finding a reason to keep logging in, that is.

Overall, this game has a tendency of not respecting the player's time in tiny little things that just keep adding up. For example:

One of the main story elements is the fact that our main character has ""Void-blood"" - meaning we don't have our own blood code (class) that we're bound to, but can absorb blood codes from others. You do this by collecting vestiges to unlock new abilities... and unlocking new gifts is one of the more tedious parts of the game. 

To unlock the power of a vestige, you need to ""watch"" a memory - a tiny flashback into that character's story. You get ported into a mindscape with decorations and you are locked into slow walking between flashback landmarks. Think Fallout 4 Kellogg's memories, but slower. And with dramatic music. 

The sad thing about this is that you can't speed anything up. You can only skip the memory outright, which, for one, is not very obvious (it's a gameplay section, after all), and of course is not ideal. If you want to actually see the story (which is pretty much the only reason to see this game through), you will have to slog though the painfully slow, scripted walking.

So, now I get to best part - each vestige consists of like 4 or 5 parts. So that's how many times you need to do it for 1 blood code. And there are many blood codes to gain through these vestige shards. You can see how it adds up. Especially if you have a backlog of them.

This vestige + memory mechanic of some characters is also very important for the main story itself and will affect your ending, so you can't just forego it entirely if you want the good end.

[h1]Controls (and a bit on the tutorial)[/h1]

I harbor a thorough dislike for games that like to waste your time with remapping controls because the default ones aren't playable in the slightest. 

And yes, the default PC controls are horrible. Yes-yes, the game was made with controller in mind first (and plays great on the controller - no complaints here), but it doesn't excuse the absolutely baffling [b]` + F(1234etc)[/b] control scheme for gifts that is there by default. How is that even supposed to work? What kind of hands do you think we PC players have?! You can do better. ""It's meant for the controller"" should stop being an excuse.

What's even more annoying is that the game BEGINS with a ""blank space + dummy while a voice explains to you how game work"" kind of tutorial (it's literally the first thing that happens after character creation), and now you need to figure out how to remap controls ON TOP of, frankly, all of gameplay mechanics being dumped on you right off the gate instead of fed to you organically through gameplay. 

This sort of tutorials is another pet peeve of mine. One would think they should be a thing of the past since they are just not that helpful. For me, personally, such an approach results in fragmented knowledge. I basically just end up not using the mechanics I did not understand. What that means is when I played Code Vein for the first time, I ended up heavy rolling around with a Zweihander and my boi Yakumo, because thankfully if you have brute force and determination, you don't need any skill.

[h1]Companions[/h1]

In Code Vein, you pretty much always play with an NPC companion. Of course, you can play solo if you want a challenge, but it is quite obvious from the beginning that the game doesn't want you to be alone and is designed with a companion/co-op in mind. You will start off your playthrough with a companion by your side, and as soon as you lose one, you will find another one soon after. 

I spent my whole time playing this game with Yakumo, because him's hot with a big ash sword. And he... can dish it out, oh boy. It sometimes feels like he's carrying all the damage. I haven't tried it, but I wouldn't be surprised that if you played a support character, he could solo the game for you. Some would probably say the game isn't even hard because of this.

On a side note though, when I returned to the game and realised that you can have ""quick"" movement speed, instead of heavy rolling with a big bonk weapon I decided to dash around with a bayonet. Did you know that if you are shooting at a target, Yakumo will stand between you and that target and block, protecting you from incoming attacks? I didn't, and I found it beyond cute. He's such a sweetheart.

[h1]So do we buy it to play around in the character creator, or?[/h1]

Yes. Yes, we do. We buy it on sale. (Like now! 10 euros is a great price for it.) This way you can really close your eyes on the flaws of the game that happens after the character creation screen. 

Yes, it's a big game with some interesting systems that can scratch your souls itch, but the reason it's big is mainly because it's padded out with uninspired levels.

The amount of customization, abilities and all that stuff, makes it hard to get back into it after a few days break. You need to re-learn which npcs sell what, and you aren't slowly introduced to them through quest lines, like you do in games like dark souls 3 or elden ring. The NPCs are... just there, at the start in the main hub. Like the lifeless store fronts that they truly are. With no real rule as to which one of them sells what. A reputation system that's a poor mimic of the one in stardew valley, where you can improve your standing with a particular npc by gifting them things they like, for no real reward, or plot reasons, just so they say that you're a good boi OwO <- see how stupid this shit is, I might shamelessly say that cringe shit as a weeb and a femboy, but a game doing this to me... go fvck yourself, you stupid ass ubisoft feathers

The memory fragment thingies are tedious as hell, just skip them, it's an awful way of story telling anyways, fking retrospectives from characters lives in the form of a walk through a museum, total and utter waste of time, seems like the devs were to some museums a few times, but completely missed the mark when it comes to the idea of what's exciting about that experience. Environmental story telling is poorly executed, like a cheap mimic of fromsoft, it's truly pathetic. Voice actors did a great job tho, it's just that the game designers who worked on this are complete idiots.

The controller layout they chose for the game is so different from dark souls and elden ring, you get reminded that some games do make inputs different just to be different.
Is it better? No. 
Is it worse? Maybe, cuz I didn't like it.
Is different so switching from a good game like elden ring, sekiro, dark souls3 is a chore? Yes.

Tbh. I don't feel like ever trying to get back into it again.
The first few hours are fun, because you're still learning the combat, 
but it gets tedious real fast. 

The combat focuses on spamming the abilities, rather than actual skill, reactions, quick thinking etc. don't worry, skill isn't rewarded in this game, because before you even get the chance to gitgud you will probably quit out of boredom.
It gets unrewarding the more you play, kinda like exploring the environment, which feels like it could have been copy pasted and been more fun to run around, indie games can procedurally generate better maps than what this game offers, and someone had to design this.

It leans heavily into it's anime themes, which might be a good thing for some, but despite me absolutely loving asian culture and anime, it felt out of place.
Like, we're in a post apocalyptic world full of vampires and stuff, and there is just a random hot sprint in the main base. Like, what the fvck? If it was a location somewhere in the game that you find while exploring, it would be so much more rewarding, fun, intriguing etc. put some new npc in there, make it so they have some quest line about purifying the waters, make them open a path to the main base, for seamless travel like in sekiro. see? Was it that hard? No, it wasn't. If you're based on anime, use the anime themes properly to enhance the game, not just throw them in there for the sake of them being in the game. Come on.
The story, themes, story telling, it all feels disjointed. It's chaotic, but not in the good way, in the tedious boring way, the plot twists are poorly executed and you probably won't even notice that a plot twist happened, cuz you couldn't be bothered to pay attention.

If you're too broke to play a proper souls game and you're considering this trash, just play genshin. That chinese anime game that makes money from peoples gambling addictions is in every possible way a better experience, it's still trash, but at least there is no cost of entry, and if you aren't a moron it's completely free.

I'm not super big into Souls games, just didn't catch onto the hype of them at the time.. and Elden Ring looked interesting-ish.. but again, burned out on open-world lazy-writing games. SOOO I saw this on a discount and just went with it.. I haven't really gotten into anime games in a loooong time. Last good one was Vindictus, but I despise p2w and I only really liked the combat... so here's to me hoping this game could give me that combat!

This has all the usual tropes.. young girl + big boobs + skimpy clothing to start you off. *SHRUGS* BUT, the game was actually alright. I wanted to scratch the itch of a fast-pace fighting. It actually does that a bit, yeah. Bosses are friggin' brutal in this game and damn satisfying to finally take down on my totally-first-try *coughs usually 6+ tries...*. I could make a cute vampire guy to slay all the things with and totally just stare at all the men to spite the game and its insistence of boobas in my face. 

Decent anime-character creator, though very limited in outfits. Made me a bit sad. The character creator felt one of the most hyped things about the game and it was just fine? Like it wasn't the most amazing thing ever they made it out to be. 

Music/Sound was pretty good, well cept all the opera vocal stuff.. get really tired of anime and their light-hearted music with sadlyrics being classified as 'dark and moody'. Japan really needs to understand 'dark and moody' more. The environments were pretty nice, simple corridor action but I liked it. The sounds were nice and crunchy, especially the finisher moves. Those were a lot of fun visually too! Pulling them off on the other hand will take a lot.. A LOT of practice.. and even then you'll still fail too much. Parry system was just, it was harsh.. doable, but definitely hard. And if you pull it off at the right time on some bosses? Holy hell that was satisfying indeed! ...most of the time you'll probably just get smacked.. but its worth it when it works! 

Overall, I think this guilty-pleasure game is pretty good for the combat alone and if you like to make cute anime boys.. okay and girls too, we know we know.. you guys aren't exactly NOT pandered to. :P Still, it gave me options and I enjoyed that for what it was worth. I admittedly didn't beat the game yet, I got to the last zone and honestly.. I got burnt out after attempting the opera-singer boss lady. She was TOUGH as hell. Guess I shouldn't of insulted the opera lyrics so much.. lol. Still, then I got distracted. I'm sure I'll come back around to this game though to finish it proper like. I did have a lot of fun.

In the end, grab it on a discount and enjoy some pretty anime characters turned evil and biting everything with strange armor-blood powers.. or something. ITS FUN! Crunchy fast-paced combat is fun!",1702349350,1702349350,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

On one hand, the character customization is top notch, the graphical style is relatively unique, and the game controls well. On the other, it's story is uninteresting, it's design is bogged down by numerous questionable design choices, and it contains a difficulty ""curve"" that equates to climbing up a cliff then jumping back off of it.

Most of the enemies and bosses are jokes. 90% of the time, you'll see any enemy that looks intimidating just to think ""Wow, that was it?"" to yourself by the end, which will generally take about 3 seconds. The other 10% of the time, you'll be faced with mundane nuisances that serve more as a test of patience than skill. The former unfortunately made up the bulk of the game, boring me in the process. The latter generally involves the game throwing a wave of enemies at you with no consideration as to how these enemies actually function together. Dark Souls often feels hard but fair during a first play-through, while Code Vein can often feel cheap with it's approach in contrast.

The bosses were one of the most disappointing aspects. Most of them were piss easy; I died to each of them once or twice at most. Several times, I achieved easy wins by simply having the boss target me while my partner dealt all the damage. Speaking of partners, the game was clearly designed with them in mind. This is a problem for three reasons. #1: Some partners are clearly better than others. #2: Your reliance upon them means that their inconsistent AI can sometimes screw you over. #3: Boss difficulty is balanced by having your partners draw some of their ire. They either produce AOE attacks that you can't reliably get through, or have attacks with both minimal wind-up and cooldown. It is certainly not impossible to do a solo run, but you have your work cut out for you. Not in a ""difficult but reasonable"" sort of way, either. It's more of a ""I'm going to sit here for the next 10 minutes, slowly chipping away at this damage sponge"" sort of situation. On the other end, most of these bosses are easily cheesed merely by having one of the better partners with you.

Stat customization is EXTREMELY shallow. What little can be influenced is mostly influenced by your weapon and armor alone. Leveling up increases the same stats every time, and by a paltry amount per level. Blood Codes fill this hole in the customization in theory, but none of them ever really felt distinct from one another in practice. The most they ever offer you is unique active and passive abilities, which also never really felt like they did much outside of the occasional damage-dealing projectile.

English VA's were horrible and off-putting. As is usual with Japanese produced games, they don't capture the emotions that the context of the story should give. I switched to Japanese VA's with English subs about twenty minutes into the game, because I just couldn't take it anymore. I don't actually understand Japanese aside from the occasional Arigato, so I can't criticize or praise the Japanese VA's. I did, ultimately, find them much more sufferable.

Also, fuck the City of Falling Flames. Mandatory damage, fire walls with bloated hitboxes, crowds of fast enemies huddled together, and your partner AI refusing to provide needed revivals because of said fast enemies keeping them too busy to do so. Everything wrong about the game merged into one area.

Gameplay: 4/10, for reasons listed above.
Controls: 9/10. I saw other negative reviews mention them, but I personally had few problems.
Graphics: 9/10. Art-style is great, and I really dig the early 2000's style edge. Really nice vibe.
Music: 7/10. It's just okay. Don't really remember much of it.
Stability: 2/10. I experienced one crash a significant distance away from a Mistle. Elevators wouldn't function properly and take me to my destination without temporarily lowering the max FPS to 60. It once gave me a blue screen near the beginning of my play-through, forcing me to repair Windows with a USB and reinstall Discord, because it was broken and wouldn't launch. There is no excuse for these issues, especially so many years after this game's initial release.

Overall, I'd give it a 4/10. It's closer to DS2 in quality than 1 or 3. The best part is the character creator at the beginning. The actual game part of this game, though, is incredibly mediocre. If you're so desperate for a new Souls-like that you'll even play a paltry one, get this on sale. A good sale. I'd say it's worth 10 bucks at most, and that's WITH the DLC. Don't pay more than three bucks for that garbage.

If you look at the most popular reviews on the store page, it's full of people giving it undue praise, or the usual unhelpful ones screaming about anime titty and how much they like it. Don't get it twisted, I like titty as much as the next guy, and there's no crime against enjoying flawed games for whatever personal reasons you may have. I genuinely don't understand how Code Vein ever receives it's praise, though, and it's concerning to see so many people ignoring it's faults outright. Steam reviewers just have lower standards, I guess.

It is a shame. That character creator is REALLY good.

Edited in on January 12th, 2023:
Hey, this review is gaining traction and there is one more thing I've found out about. It may be important for people to know, since a lot of eyes seem to be catching this.

It turns out, this game has Denuvo. This is not clarified on the Code Vein store page: You can only find out about it by reading the Terms of Service. You know, that thing you never read because it's long and filled with legal mumbo-jumbo that you probably don't understand.

So yeah, add it to the long list of reasons not to buy this game. It sucks, I was too easy on it.",1672469141,1702104849,False,67,5,0.662209749221801758,11,True,False,False

Today i will write a review about the game CODE VEIN. This is a game that involves revenants that are similiar to vampires. Many people compare this game to dark souls, as many aspects of the game has same mechanics as the dark souls games. The character you create has a great selection of customization options, even better when you buy the dlc stuff. They also added new customization options since the game came out, such as holiday items and new emotes to use in the game. Many of the graphic style is similiar to anime looking characters. If you do not like anime looking characters, you may wish to avoid this game. Also, if you want a easier game than dark souls, that is similiar in style to the dark souls games with anime, then this game is your choice to try. Anyways, here are my pro and con points:

- A JRPG with similiar mechanics to the dark souls games.
- The difficulty level gets pretty hard very fast, but can be done if careful.
- Great music and nice graphics.
- Very good customization system for making your own character how you want it.
- The ability to mix skills in blood codes to make a build how you want, with many different skills, it is almost infinite how many build you can make depending on the skills you fully learn.
- Variety of different weapons and ability to upgrade them and even add different status effects to them so enemy can be effected by them.
- New game plus modes add more difficult enemies which is similiar when you beat the dark souls story. Each consecutive beaten game increases the difficulty of the game enemies and bosses.
- Works on windows 11 OS.
- Works with controllers. I am using a NEO switch controller.



CONS:

- Sometimes finding a co-op partner to play certain boss areas is very hard. It is recommended to ask on the steam forums to see if anyone can help you, or ask a friend to help you in the game if you can.
- The game sometimes crashes and the internet and servers sometimes crash causing you to lose online play with other people.
- Online play allows you to not fully co-op the game, but only certain parts with a co-op partner. This means you need to reinvite them back everytime you go to new area or want to fight a different boss together.
- Some armor can clip for certain styles of mixing  armors. This means sometimes the armor will clip thru and even go thru the blood mask (veil) and look sloppy. There are settings you can change to prevent this by turning off certain armor pieces in game in settings.


Recommended for a game that is likened to the dark souls game forumula with very good character creator selection and ability to make many different builds using many of the skills you can learn throught the game. Avoid if you do not like anime style jrpg graphics.",1701811746,1701993488,True,66,2,0.797369837760925293,2,True,False,False

Hard souls-like game combined with anime like style is perfect for any anime lovers and gamers searching for challange. Beautifull wiews, emotional storyteling and good game mechanics. Just completed it fully and im gonna say, the story will make you cry.
[h2]Story[/h2]
Post apocaliptic world facing with lost onslaught, revenants trying to survive in brutal world, and you trying to beat this one annoying boss. the game's lore have a lot of story to offer and is mostly focused on revealing the truth about the vein. The choices you make have a meaning, and the actually
define ending you will get, out of 3 possible, your [b]actions[/b] will make a difference.
[h2]Music[/h2]
The music in this game is the most marvelous thing you will hear, from the choir welcoming you to the game, to the [b]best ending songs in game industry![/b] The game developers realy did their best making music that gives you thrilling feeling while fighting lost or gets very emotional while experiencing a  revenant's memory.
[h2]Game[/h2]
The game itself may prove to be hard, like... very hard. You need to be cautious even while fighting normal enemies on the map. There may be times where you [b]WILL[/b] rage quit, but trust, everyone was at this point. Forcing you to learn the pattern of the attacks if you really want to defeat enemies you approach, while still trying not to die from sisyphus-like healing. You have wariety of weapons to choose and fair amound of blood codes that are basically classes that you can freely change. So, read the pattern, die, improve your strategy with different class, repeat until it dies.
[h2]Characters[/h2]
Characters in vein world have their own little charm, a responsible leader trying his best, kind defender making sure you are safe, or your own character that you spent multiple hours customizating. Code vein offers rather big amound of customization for your character so creating character you desire is indeed a posibility here. Characters emotions together with their ambiotions and determination to resolve their past selfs creates a feeling where all of them are needed for game's lore.

like feminine enemies being like 90% of the enemies in the game while also being very forgiving unlike dark souls where you can mess up and not get punished as much as dark souls would in that situation

great game however very easy  compared to dark souls  due to the companion mechanic however you could mod it to make it more difficult or just not use the companion to make the bosses and small enemies in the areas harder the game also  can be replayed for different endings  however i do dislike how the areas are difficult to get around almost every area in the game is like a maze of its own with some areas being reused to progress through the game  its not one route which could be confusing if you have played dark souls where you can kind of tell where to go from each boss

Somewhat great story locked behind ""Mouse in a maze"" generic type pipe-layout dungeon crawling that sometimes tried to be smart though overly stretched in some parts and easily to miss important passages, enemy combat is ... Well, lots of creatures lack ""personality/character"", faint animations and lack of weight of their attacks, heavy reliance on fast-combos and /or area-of-effect attacks, coupled with the fact they don't damage nor get interrupted by their team-mates in group fights, leaves for ""luring out"" or ""speed-run-through"".
Having completed the game I can see why so many haven't finished (so far 13%), since it is more of a chore then an adventure, though the ending and the story as a whole was worth it to some extent.

The story is rather straight forward, and while I do love the more item description lore methods some games use to tell theirs, this was just way better storytelling. And there is some excellent stuff there. It's also excellent game play wise, with actually fun regular areas and a boss roster that had a meager 2 bosses I dislike. The other 15 are at worst passable, and at times (mainly the endgame) absolutely fantastic. Plus there's a ton of build variety, so it also feels replayable as hell. As bonuses, the game looks pretty good and the music is solid, though admittedly a bit on the weaker end of the genre. My main complaint, and the games main flaw, is that it was surprisingly buggy. Keep the game locked to 60 fps max, otherwise elevators won't work and a certain boss can just straight up become invisible. 
Also don't waste money on the DLCs or deluxe edition, they are absolutely awful and the rest of what deluxe edition offers just isn't worth it.

Code Vein is an underwhelming Dark Souls copy that only got as big as it did because its an anime game. I am struggling to find good points about this game.

Voice acting is terrible, I couldn't stand sitting through cutscenes and skipped them

I have seen better animation quality in homemade Team Fortress 2 videos on youtube

The plot is so boring, confusing, and dry. Code Vein tries to do ""throw them into adventure with no knowledge of anything "" card but fails horribly.

CHARACTER MODEL DESIGN was beyond overhyped. UI confusing and cluttered, and actual design options for character mediocre. Doesn't matter what your character looked like, because their entire face would be covered by a crappy gas mask  And oh my god the mesh model clipping.

As a big anime fan I think the story was very well thought out and compelling where it needed to be .  It's combat system takes some getting used to and can be slightly frustrating at times but it's not so bad that the game is unplayable. Furthermore whilst I feel some of the bosses could definitely do with some fine tuning as it feels they just cycle through there different attacks in sequence, most of them still proved very challenging and were compelling in their respective roles. Each character has awesome development and are a joy to interact with. Lets not forget where this game shines particularly well, Character creation! I don't think I've ever seen so many different options available. The only place I'd say it may have been lacking a bit was with the clothing selections, and even then you have the option to decide which particular parts of each different clothing selection you want to be visible on your character! Another thing, Co-op, when it is available considering the current lack of players, is in my opinion better than in ANY Souls/Borne. They have the password system and everything and when in use makes your summons INSTANT, and  I mean INSTANT. Unfortunately with the lack of players finding help via summons w/o pass-code can take a minute but it's not impossible. All and all I really only have positive things to say about this delightfully under rated souls-like!I really think it gets a bad rep for no rational reason! I hope more people will give it a shot!

The game will appear easy at first but then at the midway point will slap you to the ceiling in difficulty that it’ll be a different game. 

[h2] Gameplay [/h2]
It’s a Souls game through and through but it has its own unique mechanics. For one, you only have one piece of armor to deal with and it effects how powerful your backstab is. Second, you have sword skills that use your “bullet” energy and other skills that can be unlocked based on your character’s class. Your character class affects virtually every stat and what abilities you can unlock, and it can be changed on the fly so it gives you a lot of breathing room to try different builds without having to rely on bonfires. Now the most important difference is that there’s always a NPC companion helping you traverse. You could dismiss them but the game is balanced with their help in mind. The bosses are fairly easy as they’ll target whoever is closer to them but once they get half health they start random switching. The companions are fairly competent but if they get occupied by anything they will refuse to help you. The only boss that you’ll find wanting to tear your hair out is one that’s a tag team. That one is a win based in pure luck, doesn’t matter how leveled you are you will die multiple times. It’s the same interconnected world and the same bonfire mechanics so you’ll feel at home if you love FromSofts games. Be warned tho, the game’s invasions are badly balanced. They will 

Not much I can say about story without spoiling it but their are whole sections where you’re going into the memories of important characters and it’s a nice atmosphere. If you’re in the market for a soulslike that’s pretty solid and puts an anime story in the forefront then I’d definitely recommend this. At the end of the day it’s basically faster Dark Souls with anime characters, great combination.",1700447873,1700447873,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Visually this game was really gorgeous. The art team did an excellent job with the set pieces, and the lighting and textures were solid. 

Technically this game was quite smooth, however when you were entering new ""zones"" the game would take a severe frame dip for a few seconds for I guess things to load in as you are moving.

I was playing locked at 165 fps, and google search let me know that you need to set your game to 60 fps for the elevators to work, and then switch back.

(a) You want a Souls-like-game, because you have run out of Souls/Elden-food. Read on.
(b) You want a story, intriguing lore and good world design. Probably look somewhere else.
(c) You are attracted by the ... outward appeal of some game elements. Watch an anime or play an (in-)decent visual novel.

When I had played the tutorial (twice ...) and unto entering the home base, I didn't understand what I was doing and even less why. I would have recommended the game nevertheless on a somewhat neutral stance, if it weren't for Denuvo. It makes the game micro-stutter until you remedy this with a modded configuration file (check the Nexus). There seems to be a decent game buried in here.

The Good
- graphics and world design are beautiful, great really
- Souls-like game mechanics, if you are into that
- good modding scene to remedy the Souls-like mechanics, if you're not too much into that
- customization is awesome

The Bad (design)
- It's a 'developer 101' of how *not* to design (and port) a game.
- PC control scheme out of hell, and some key prompts shown on-screen are wrong.
- Yet again, devs try to emulate controller mechanics on a PC keyboard/mouse lay-out - I mean, there are 10 number keys (and the numbers from 0-9 should not be that hard to understand from a designer's point of view). Just put everything in there and give us a decent lay-out or a wheel and that's it. It has been done countless times.
- The mini-map is too small, and the 'switch display function' is a bad joke.
- No pause function. If nature calls or the pizzaman rings, well, they just have to wait until you reach the next mistle ...
- Realistic, yet ineffective audio design - you have to turn around and face your party members if you want to understand what they are saying.

The Bad (narrative set-up)
- chaotic prologue and reception-protected backgrounds during the first two hours of the game
- incomprehensible objectives
- the developers went to great lengths so that you can neither understand the lore, the characters nor that feeble ruin they call a story (the Queen?, Silva?, the red mist? - what the heck is going on)
- confusing, pseudo-maze like level design that wants to hide linearity
- (this may be subjective) I didn't understand the game mechanics (skills, fighting), even after I watched a walkthrough
- there is A LOT talk about 'blood' for sure

*Update* after beating the game - which I did just to be fair: This game features some really bad game design aspects for a triple-A game. It has atrocious level design, lots of annoying backtracking, a 2D-map for 3D levels with overlaying floors, an unengaging and rather incomprehensible story, tripe dialogue, annoying party member banter, uninspired fetch item/kill enemies side 'quests', obscure leveling mechanics as well as sometimes unresponsive controls. There are also two really enraging bugs that have never been fixed: (1) enemies randomly turn invincible when they are forced out of their animations; (2) after acquiring chromes you cannot leave the menu and have to Alt+F4 out of the game. 'Code Vein' has it all. My vote is a 5/10 - sub-par (4/10), it gets the extra point for its gorgeous world building and (physical) character design.",1698756018,1699835535,False,0,1,0.47413790225982666,0,True,False,False

I tried using every skill and potion I had to stop their fire and ice attacks but to no avail, on my 20th try I decided to give it up and go play something else. I guess I won't be buying the DLC since I won't be finishing the game. And something else I might add is that only 16% of players were able or willing to finish Code Vein, I think that says a lot.

rpg like, adding points to your character sheet. (strength, fortitude, etc) in code vein levelling up levels them linearly.
mechanics are quite interesting? instead of weapons giving you special moves, they're on the blood codes.
your play style is dictated by the 'blood code' you choose. i would even say that the whole game goes around the blood code.
its simplifications helped me ease into more serious ones.

still too complicated? if you like meta and death of boredom, add fortification to zweihander, which negates all damage on block.

character editor is one of the best things in this game. not half baked. other than the standard uniforms you can only wear, vast customization in terms of hair, eyes, accessories. it being anime, the only thing that is missing are different body shapes. AFAIK only youthfulness, build (barely), height. you can only be a fashionable highschooler. rough manly men out of the question.

dlc? don't get. you wan't more reasons? uh don't get???

if you like anime girls and too scared to play 'souls-like' games because of difficulty, i recommend.

Neutral

Cons
- Map Design (Cathedral...) and Mini-map Information

The gameplay difficulty...can vary. if you play with a npc companion and/or friend, the game is a breeze. 
if you play absolutely alone, it gets rough. I'd say that's a good compromise.

Anime Dark Souls. Okay not really, this games level design and enemy variety are miles behind Dark Souls, levels are boring to look at and there has been like 5 different enemies so far and the enemies barely telegraph their attacks and bosses are mostly forgettable so far. Not a great start is it?  But i'll stop talking about the bad things, now i will talk about the things i like about Code Vein. 
The combat, the combat is not perfect, however i still like it. Weapons have a nice amount of variety to them and most weapons feel pretty good to swing around, i found myself testing out every weapon i can get my hands on. One of my biggest gripes with this game is the atrocious healing item, it barely heals you and you need to use like 3 or 4 to heal back to full health so making mistakes is annoying and VERY punishing (annoying because of how enemies barely telegraph attacks and how they hit very inconsistently) Uhh what do i talk about next... I know!

The companions: Some of the story important characters help you in battle and in exploration. I do not like them. First of all, they are annoying, they steal kills from me and they make the game easy, they're also a bit annoying to listen to since they like to repeat the same lines over and over again

This is all i will say so far, i said that i will make a proper review when i've beat the game but i'm not sure if i actually want to make a proper review, i'm not into reviewing games. Overall i'd give this game a 7/10, if i could, i would give this game a neutral rating but im starting to want to make this into a negative review.

This game has one of the most amazing character creators of any game I have ever played. Unfortunately, there is not much else that is remarkable about this game. Aside from the obvious gimmick of being anime dark souls. I think it fails to understand what is actually fun about dark souls games. The level design is generally sub par, the movements are quite stiff aside from the roll, and the animations are jank. The story itself is about as generic anime as it gets. I think that if you are looking for anime dark souls and you are in it mostly for shits and giggles you may enjoy the game. Unless you get this on sale, its not really worth it. Titties are pretty cool tho.

The flaws outweigh the pros and the flaws seem determined to kill any kind of fun you're having with the game. Its main flaws are its *awful* level design (every level is either pain and suffering or just extremely uninspired) occasionally jank combat, and the fact that this game has a lot of abilities (""gifts"") you can acquire, but the vast majority of them are pretty much useless. On the plus side, you can make your own anime OC, but if you want to do that, download the demo before you buy. If you like what you see, I'd say get it on sale (and ignore the deluxe edition and DLC). If you're a hardcore soulslike fan, nothing about this game will impress you. 

Like every review will tell you, this game is ""anime dark souls."" Sounds like a dream if you're a fan of both, but in reality, the only real thing it has going for it is that you can create your own anime protagonist; you'll have a lot of fun with character creation. And yet, despite what I just said, I'd still say I ""like"" the game, but I think it's a shame that more effort wasn't put into it, and its flaws come close to turning my ""liking"" this game into resenting its existence. 

I'll start with the level design, which is by far this game's biggest flaw. This game's levels were made by someone who takes joy in the suffering of others - either you'll find yourself trudging through a really boring environment or you'll find yourself scrambling through a really painful one that will make you wish you were in one of Miyazaki's swamps (and before you ask, yes, there's a swamp level). The levels themselves look uninspired as well - there's a fire level, a sand level, etc, and that's where the descriptions of those levels end; they are thoroughly unremarkable. So some levels are boring, but what makes others downright painful? 

You may have heard of a certain ""Cathedral of Sacred Blood"" reading the other reviews, and how much people hate it. Don't worry, you will too if you buy this game. As a cruel joke, this environment is the best looking in the game (imo at least) - it's this massive, beautiful cathedral that when you first see, you just take a moment to pause in awe. Unfortunately, this level represents everything wrong with this game's level design philosophy (or lack thereof). It's tough to describe it unless you play it yourself, but I'll try. In essence, this place is a giant maze where *everything* looks the same. But hey, you have a map, that'll surely help you right? lolno. Your map is useless in this game, mostly because you'll be navigating blindly until you discover certain (and sometimes *hidden*) points in the level, which are the only way to actually fill in your map. The most your map does is give you an idea of where you were 5 seconds ago in any given level, and it does even that poorly. 

Anyway, what really highlights how useless the map is is this cathedral alone - the cathedral itself has a few ""floors"" for lack of a better term, and your map is unable to tell you what floor you're on, which floor you haven't been to in your character's exact location, or even which floor is which between higher and lower floors. To be blunt, this level is a clusterfuck, and if you already don't like the prospect of a giant maze, you'll be happy to know that this place also has really dangerous generic enemies, ""shortcuts"" you can open that are completely useless due to usually being right next to a fast travel point anyway, pseudo-platforming despite this game's lack of a jump button where you must fall onto surfaces that are below you in order to progress, and deceptive paths that have holes you can easily fall to your death through if you're running. 

This level is a monument to this game's level design, and obviously I don't mean that in a good way. Most of the other levels are mazes too (albeit slightly less painful) and have nothing interesting about them. Yeah, this game's levels are garbage, and that's me being generous. They are so terrible that they either will, or come close to, destroying any enjoyment you have been having with this game, and that feels like an achievement itself because I can think of no other game, soulslike or otherwise, where *every* level was bad.

Now let me tell you about this game's systems. Basically, leveling up gives you a static increase to your stats - your actual ""class"" is determined by your blood code and blood veil (armor), both of which make up your actual stats. This means you can be anything you want at any time which is pretty neat - there's no need to respec and you're only limited by what blood codes you have at the moment. What isn't neat is this game's gifts - these are abilities you can learn, either through using a blood code enough and having the gifts equipped for a time, or spending a special currency to unlock them instantly. The former is painful, so you'll likely be using the latter, which means you'll have to sometimes grind for that special currency which drops randomly from enemies, or can be found in one time only set locations. 

Sadly, the majority of abilities you can learn are downright useless no matter what build you are, and others still are highly situational at best. Most of the time they can have their effects replicated through an item, and items themselves are really common. It feels like this game really just wanted to be able to say it had a lot of abilities to choose from. You think you can choose from several gifts, but really there's only a few to choose from because the rest are useless and not worth the currency to learn.

As far the game's combat goes, it's serviceable. However, attacks don't always feel good, mostly because they don't really have weight behind them which just feels weird. Parrying...exists. Poise isn't a stat, as is soulslike tradition. Bosses are typically pretty easy (mostly because of the partner mechanic), but a couple are somewhat difficult and/or cool. That said, in all my playtime of this game, I never really noticed any ""patterns"" they may have had and I kinda just swung my sword at them until they died. 

Speaking of bosses though, nearly every boss has the same boss theme in this game, and aside from everything else I've said, this is one of those small details that makes me think not a whole lot of effort went into this game. In the game's second act, you'll encounter bosses that have a phase 2, and as they're going into phase 2, the ""phase 2"" theme will play. For literally every boss. This makes bosses feel...not special. Only a few towards the end of the game get a special theme. The soundtrack for this game isn't terrible, but it definitely needed more tracks. 

As for the story: It's decent, but it takes its time getting to the point. The characters are likable enough too, so those things are alright I guess.

All that said, Code Vein sounded like my dream game (I love anime and souls combat), but in many ways turned out to be a nightmare, and such could be the case for you too. To say I have mixed feelings about this game is an understatement - I like the idea of it, but loathe the execution. 

If you just want to mess with the character creator, you can download the demo and that's the main selling point of the game right there. Otherwise, either pass or buy the base game on sale, as the deluxe edition DLC does nothing but add superbosses, a couple of extra blood codes you get from said bosses, and some armor with no extra story or anything else particularly relevant.",1698591568,1698594584,False,1,2,0.49275362491607666,0,True,False,False

First, let's talk about the visuals. Code Vein has an anime charm, and the character designs are gorgeous. The post-apocalyptic world is bleak, but it's a beautifully bleak world, if I may say so. It doesn't strike you as realistic, but it sets you up for a bloody adventure.

The gameplay - well, it's what you'd expect from a game of this genre. It's challenging, and you'll be dying a lot. finding the right bloody code and weapons can be a real trial. But when you finally defeat a boss, you'll feel a sense of satisfaction.

The plot is intriguing, but it won't win a Pulitzer Prize. The main thing is to unravel the mysteries of this vampiric post-apocalyptic world, and it will hook you so much that it won't let you tear yourself away. And this is better than just mindless hack and slash.

Now let's talk about the characters. Your companions on this journey, while lacking the depth of some other RPGs, are interesting enough that you'll grow to love them as you fight side by side. In addition, their abilities can bail you out in difficult battles.

There is some grind involved in the battles, which involves going back to areas to level up and get materials. This may not be the approach for everyone.

Ultimately, Code Vein isn't a game-changer, but it's a fun and steady game that puts a unique spin on the genre. It's a blast! It's akin to a good B-movie that you adore in secret. If you're into the whole souls-like encounter and don't object to a touch of vampire mythology, try it out.",1697661862,1698457772,True,5,0,0.583333313465118408,0,True,False,False

Joking aside, from what I have heard through the grapevine Code Vein cannot be Dark Souls, due to Dark Souls being harder.  I kid… mostly, as someone who has never played a Souls Like game before I enjoyed my time with the game, its characters and story.

Does that mean that Code Vein is simply a rung in the ladder to reach Dark Souls difficult?  At a service level yes, one can view Code Vein that way.  I would say, however that Code Vein does put a lot more emphasis on story and characters than what Dark Souls appears to.  While the bosses in Dark Souls do indeed have lore and interest in them the same consideration cannot necessarily be said about the NPC’s or even the player character.

“That is not the point of a Souls like game.”

The above might be mentioned with regards to criticism of me specifically saying the player characters importance.  While a silent, faceless protagonist can work as a simple mechanism to experience the world, having a semi-interesting character and still having a deep world also still works.

If you are looking for a game to tied yourself over between souls like games then Code Vein will indeed work, but even if you are not a souls like fan Code Vein does indeed work and is enjoyable without its obvious comparison.

The combat has interesting ideas and fun segments, the map design is maze-like and not to my taste but it isn't awful either. The companion system is kinda fun and the blood code system gets pretty interesting by the end of the game with all the options you have. 

That being said, it is also unique in the fact that this game has a heavier emphasis on story. The story itself is fine, but the pacing is awful. You will be forced to walk through very slow story sections in order to understand the story. You can skip it, but then you won't know why anything is happening. The story isn't complex enough to warrant such a hamfisted way of telling the story. You really could have borrowed more from Dark Souls in this aspect. Still, the game is fine as is and worth checking out if you like these styles of games.

The waifu factor and the fact that the character creator lets you make a pretty good OC should be enough to give Dark Souls fans who like anime a reason to try the game.",1697913726,1697913726,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Very mediocre soulslike filled to the brim with edgy storytelling, melodramatic monologues and weapons double as big as the character. 
Or to sum it up in a question: ""What if Dark Souls was anime, but we add vampires and this fanfic of my moody 15y/o brother who has his ""xXDarkShadowkillerXx""-phase?""

Either you enjoy this game by taking it 100% seriously and sink into the storytelling or you laugh your ass off by how overly dramatic yet senseless everything is. I did it the second way.

The gameplay is sadly very underwhelming, it's very similar to Dark Souls with dodge rolls, blocks, parrys and abilities, but it barely matters because enemy attacks are often too simple and npc movement is pretty hard to read/predict

pros:
+ edgy as hell, just watch the intro and you know what you're in for. Can be super entertaining
+ beautiful models and environments, also really nicely designed clothes and characters
+ beautiful theatrical music
+ VERY huge character creator (but for some odd reason there's no beards at all. I mean come on, even with a mask you can have some kind of beard)
+ fighting with a sword that is almost double the size of your character is fun

- despite the seemingly big variation of skills and classes, gameplay is quite dull and easy
- levels are just tubes, very boring sadly
- 70% of the game's music is one song that is played over and over and over again. Had to deactivate ""music"" in the settings after a couple of hours because that ""opera voice""-song just kept popping up
- edgy as hell, everybody has a dramatic, dark past, everybody is sad, everybody wears variations of black
- monster designs are extremely dull, your typical spiky anime demons with typical anime demon voices
- there is SO much empty talking with anime trope topics like ""what are we living for?"" or ""I can't forget the past!""
- whenever you recover a memory you have to play a little walking simulator where a small story is told, feels more like little fanfics of ppl being all ""uh, my sad past :("". And guess what, every single one of them has the mentioned ""opera voice""-song. And there's probably around 40 of those sequences in the game, sooo I hope you like walking sequences! Sadly you need to play those because you receive a skill afterwards. Felt a bit like a mobile game where you have to endure a commercial to get a benefit lateron
- mediocre animations, but that's sadly kind of a standard with games from japan
- tries a bit too hard to be dark souls (ambushes, shortcuts, elemental upgrades increase elemental dmg but decrease the core dmg of the weapon, bonfires, etc etc)


It wasn't really fun, you know, okay-ish, mildly entertaining. If you dig anime styled visuals and soulslikes then you might have a try, but please don't expect much of it, it's more of that kind of game you play when you don't really have anything better to do

5/10, mildly entertaining vampire dark souls 15y/o fanfic

I was between 2 options but in the end decided go with negative because some core mechanics are really unreliable which I can not ignore. Yet, buying during a sale wouldn't be a bad option

Pros:
- Flexibility on character design. Player is able to change the character whenever he/she wants
- Dynamically changing blood codes and not limiting player to a class. I really liked this mechanic. You can discover all blood codes and weapons, pick the one that suits you
- Multiple ways to drain. i.e combo drain attacks. This actually lets user to be active and drain during midcombat. So user does not need to wait for an opportunity

Cons:
- I did not like level design. It doesn't feel like neither linear nor open. It is more like a maze. To me, dumping a ton of enemies in a maze between 2 resting points is not a good design. Especially that ... cathedral. Just so annoying. I wanted to quit at that level
- Backstab mechanic is unreliable. It feels like a random event. I am able to backstab randomly, without even trying, in the middle of the combat. When I try to backstab on purpose it fails. Character does a random attack
- Parry is unreliable. This to me maybe the most important mechanic of the game and I still do not know what the parry timing is. Parrying shouldn't be that hard. I tried in training zone to parry and it was successful. I know all monsters have different timings but they still should be predictable or stable.
- Enemies become too repetetive after some point

In [b]Code Vein[/b], you rise as a vampire and embark on a journey to remember your own past and uncover the mystery of the Red Mist. This hack and slash game combines the fast-paced gameplay of [b]God Eater[/b] with the challenging difficulty and mechanics of the [b]Dark Souls[/b] series, resulting in a unique and enjoyable gaming experience that's both fun and challenging. In this game, you play as a vampire, or Revenant, who has lost their memories. Guided by a mysterious girl in white, you join a group of Revenants to unravel the origins of the Great Collapse.

The gameplay in [b]Code Vein[/b] focuses on hack and slash combat, allowing you to confront enemies head-on and even perform backstab attacks at times. In an attempt to mirror the mechanics of the [b]Dark Souls[/b] or [b]Soulsborne[/b] series, the game introduces a forgiving feature for players new to these types of games: companions. Companions are there to assist you on your journey, particularly in battles, as they can attack and draw enemy aggro, making the game more accessible than many entries in the [b]Soulsborne[/b] series. Most companions can also revive you (and vice versa), but this comes with a cooldown period. While this feature is invaluable, the revival animation takes some time, highlighting the importance of timing.

The presence of companions can be disabled, creating a more challenging solo experience for those seeking greater difficulty. Each companion possesses unique abilities and fighting styles. Some are frontline fighters who draw enemy attention but deal lower damage, while others attack from a distance with guns and gifts (magic), keeping you safe but needing your defense. There are also well-rounded fighters. You can also engage in cooperative play by inviting other players to join your journey, essentially making them your companions. While I personally haven't used this feature, it's worth exploring for those who enjoy cooperative play.

[b]Code Vein[/b] offers a wide range of weaponry, diverse gifts (magic), Blood Codes, and Blood Veils, allowing for nearly limitless customization of your playstyle. Blood Codes primarily determine your stats, which you can focus on when building your unique style. They also unlock gifts associated with that Blood Code, eventually making these gifts accessible to all Blood Codes. Although unlocking all gifts can be somewhat grindy, you can concentrate on unlocking those that align with your desired playstyle. Whether you wish to build a magician vampire capable of ranged attacks, a sword-wielding character dealing heavy close-range damage, or a tank who relies on your companion for damage, the possibilities are extensive.

The game's difficulty and boss battles are manageable for newcomers while providing a satisfying challenge for [b]Soulsborne[/b] veterans. The maps in the game, although at times appearing vast, sometimes feel like reskins of each other. For instance, the Cathedral of the Sacred Blood, while visually striking with its white color scheme, bears a resemblance to Crypt Spire. It's a minor issue, but one that can be bothersome. Fortunately, the game offers plenty to explore. You can discover secret maps and fragments that unlock memories and gifts, making map exploration highly rewarding. The map design also allows for unlocking hidden or blocked paths, reducing the inconvenience of backtracking.

One notable feature worth mentioning is how the story is presented. Throughout the game, you'll come across memory fragments that serve two purposes. Firstly, they allow you to unlock and upgrade Blood Codes for your use. Secondly, they help you recall and experience the past of related characters. The story is portrayed as frozen moments while the accompanying voiceovers narrate the events. Some may find this storytelling approach somewhat boring, but others, including myself, appreciate the uniqueness it brings to the game.

In conclusion, [b]Code Vein[/b] is not without its flaws, but it offers solid and enjoyable gameplay. Some enemies can be challenging, often ganging up on you, but the presence of companions can provide significant assistance. While the base game is highly enjoyable, the DLC content may not be as worthwhile, as it primarily consists of boss reskins with inflated stats.

despite the game trying to emulate soulsborne, it fell short because this game got many flaw and way too forgiving made it too easy compare to soulsborne(fyi i play with no companion). enemy AI and Design is boring. world setting is bland. characters is one dimensional. story  is so cringy even worse than any average anime. combat somewhat similar to soulsborne but bad enemy design and ai ruin it, backstab all the way! bosses is collection of every existent icon character combined (werewolf, miku, catwoman, sphinx). lack of originalty. environment is dull connected with unrealistic tunnels.

anime-ish graphic looks great and character creation is very detail which is amazing. but that's the only redeem point.
the game lack of originality except it's chuuni-style memory traversing storytelling  which i really don't like but still it's a plus for me. anything fresh and new is appreciated.

i guess you can say this game is anime soulsborne(with lazy design and lack atmospheric feeling soulsborne have). if you don't care about anime style then nioh is better.

edit : finally complete this game with true ending after many times hiatus. my point still stands. the story is the worst part of this game. the devs made the setting grim but the scenario is way too childish with fairy tale like cast which everyone have no selfish desire eagerly sacrifice themselves for strangers. every bit of this game scenario is a kid made up fantasy. i won't be surprised if the story written by a teenager

Movement being far too slidy is very bizarre when you're already used to the more snappy movements of the Souls games, no stat allocation (with stats mostly being locked based on classes instead), a very limited weapon types (5 types being one handed sword, Greatswords, Bayonets, Halberds/Lances and Greathammers).

and its DLCs are just very lackluster especially when all 3 combined are more expensive than the base game itself.

the quick access to skills and magics are pretty great though, wish that would be present more often in the genre, but Ichor balancing is pretty bad for certain classes. they should've put passive ichor regen for the heavily ranged classes instead.

Multiplayer seems to be locked to Co-op with no PVP whatsoever, (at least from what i've experienced)

and the game being balanced for players to always have the AI companion is pretty annoying.

all those criticisms and you're probably wondering why i'm still recommending this game

while the game is mired with questionable design choices, for the most part it is still a pretty solid game overall. which puts it above Dark Souls 2 Scholar of the First Sin by default. speaking of which, this game is smart enough to limit their version of Lifegems to just 5 you can carry at any time.

Gameplay: hardly even mediocre

Great graphics, much emphasis on solving mazes.

The combat mechanics, however are terrible. Makes it impossible to play. Mobs always attack the protagonist. they always ignore the accompanying npc. Always. The protag is effectively the pet of the accompanying npc. He has lousy defense, lousy attack power. Very limited ways to upgrade any stats.

Leveling up merely increases stamina and HP, not offensive or defensive prowess.

In boss fights, the camera follows the protag far too close by, depriving the player from an overview of the arena, not adjustable. No maps in combats, a targeting system that takes too much time to operate in combat, characters not responding swiftly enough to directional operations  during combat.

Gifts (aka skills) are unusable in fights because of this. We don't know when the boss is where, and he jumps at us out of nowhere before cast times are over.

The NPC partners are useless, they apply a bad strategy in combat. In boss fights, the one attacked by the boss should defend, while the other deals dps, As soon as the boss turns to the other, the players switch roles. Instead of separating from us when a boss fight starts, the partner follows us, pulling the boss right at us, leaving the both of us to be sitting ducks.

They pull way too little aggro, forcing me to tank while the npc fights the boss.

Having to fight our way through a maze dozens of times to arrive at a boss that 2-hits us because we cannot turn around to block, and when we beat him. the spawn point behind him didn't save.

And then there are the FPS drops and freezes during boss fights.

The game sure has potential, but it was obviously not designed by people who play these kind of games. Too much emphasis on the cuteness-factor.

Pity, for the game surely has potential. Hopefully some dev will get to read this (sending emails to the company is impossible), and use it to improve upcoming versions.",1625474750,1696353557,False,1,0,0.451430141925811768,0,True,False,False

Only after completing them all, will you understand all of the character's backstories, and how they fit together. The bosses are mostly all well balanced around your first playthrough, forcing you to get good, or grind out some additional levels. You never find yourself completely unable to progress, as there is a weapon and ""veil"" upgrade system, or alternate ""Blood Codes"" to try.
The co-op system was enjoyable, but could use some tweaking, as it syncs a higher level player lower even than the person they are coming to aid, and even had times when it would fail while attempting to connect to a friend, which would only be fixed by toggling the online mode off and on again from the main menu.
Of the 3 (4) endings available, playing to earn them adds enough variation to character interaction to keep cutscenes interesting, the ""bad"" end being vastly different. Overall, it was definitely worth the sale price.

As a Completionist - Be prepared to grind for haze and medals at different times to unlock everything. The co-op medals in particular, requiring an afternoon or 3 of mindlessly killing the same monster, as without having a dedicated partner, this is the only way to reach the end. I also strongly recommend looking up the criteria for each ending after finishing your first playthrough, as missing one thing in particular means an entire additional playthrough with very similar cutscenes until the final 10 minutes of the story.",1695353631,1695353631,True,16,0,0.670193135738372803,0,True,False,False

I've invested quite some time in it and ultimately, I can say that this game.....isn't really fun which it could have been since the game had potential. 

Firstly, it's an anime game so, trying to make an anime game a souls like isn't too bad of an idea. In fact, it can be wonderful but in Code Vein, the execution is just poor. The most addictive part of a Souls Like is combat. Try playing games like Nioh and Sekiro and you'll realize that even after dying to a boss for the 100th time, you still love the combat. 

But in Code Vein, the combat is the biggest flaw by a long shot. Anime characters are known to be extremely flexible and fluid in terms of combat, even the in-game fighting cutscenes have more depth and fluid movement to the combat style. But the in-game combat we play with.....is so rigid and stiff. 

You have extremely slow movement and extremely slow attacks and these two traits just qualified the game to be a Souls Like. Remove these two and this game just becomes a normal JRPG. It's not as if the enemies or the bosses have complex fighting styles and phases, all of them just literally have the same pattern of attack. The only thing that makes you fall for these attacks is because of the slow and stiff movement. There's literally no other reason other than this. You don't have bosses that can one-shot you or anything like that, in fact, the game is pretty easy. 

Secondly, repetition. The game's style of level designs just doesn't change at all. All you get are new and stylish environments but that's it. The Bosses only have appearance variety. 

Thirdly, the story. The story is pretty decent but it has a poor execution since there are a lot of moments in the game where it feels as if the game is forcing you to face some kind of emotional impact, rather than proper build-ups. 

And that's pretty much all

The game has its pros: Like the character design, the Blood Codes and the Buffs you get with it but a lot of it is simply overshadowed over the main priorities of a Souls Like Game.",1695021554,1695021554,False,1,0,0.47837415337562561,0,True,False,False

[b]the good:[/b]

the game replaces traditional soulslike stats leveling with a ""blood code"" system. throughout the game you unlock different ""blood codes"", which you can equip on the fly. you always have one blood code equipped, which determines your stats. this makes it possible to completely change course with your build as you progress through the game and discover more mechanics, equipment, etc. and you don't have that classic soulslike fear of ""am i leveling the right stats""

the story of the game, while very stereotypically anime, is overall genuinely intriguing and certain characters and scenes managed to have a genuine emotional impact on me. unlike the souls games, basically all plot is told to the player directly, but that can be a good thing depending on what type of storytelling you enjoy.

the combat feels great. it takes a while to get used to (though, to be fair, this might be more noticeable for me personally because i'm a weirdo who plays soulslikes on a keyboard) but once you do, both normal attacks as well as special abilities feel powerful and just good and fun to use

while i've played a few anime games before, i never really considered myself a big fan of the style. however, this game still had a lot of really beautiful scenery that strongly reminds me of the landscapes you'd see in a dark souls game. and a lot of times it does the ""if you can see it, you can go to it"" thing really well too.

[b]the bad:[/b]

platforming is abysmal. this is almost irrelevant, as theres barely any sections of the game that require it, but the parts that do have it are a pain. there is no horizontal velocity in the air, so as soon as you drop off a ledge, no matter how much momentum you have, you always drop straight down.

throughout most of the game the level design is great. however, there are individual sections that are just a pain to deal with. the minimap tracking your footsteps and showing you where youve already been helps out a lot, but certain areas hide away the spots where you can activate that minimap in the first place, contributing to their maze-like feel. in two areas in particular (the cathedral and the last area of the game) i wasted so much time just running around aimlessly because i got lost due to tons of path junctions and everything looking the same.

certain enemies are just not fun to beat. while there are some enemies who are simply challenging, which i can appreciate, some are flat out annoying. two examples that immediately come to mind are an enemy who can simply randomly decide to permanently reduce any incoming damage significantly, making it a slog to defeat even with strong weapons. the other example is a bossfight towards the end of the game, which seems like it's mainly up to RNG whether you win or not, due to one of the boss enemies having unrestricted access to AOE attacks no matter where you are in the arena. HOWEVER, note that these types of enemies are most certainly the exception, not the rule.

on a few occasions i've had somewhat major bugs occur. a random crash resetting some of my progress, an unresponsive menu forcing me to exit the game without saving, an item related to a side quest not spawning - nothing super terrible, but annoying to deal with.

[b]in short:[/b]

if you like anime games in terms of style - visually, audio-wise, story-wise - and you have enough experience with soulslike games to know you wont quit when a boss takes up to a few dozen tries: get the game, you'll enjoy it.",1694305972,1694335822,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you do get the game on sale, get the deluxe edition if its also on sale. It comes with some extra cosmetics, an extra blood code (see details below on what a blood code is), an extra partner, and all the DLC.

TL;DR: I give this game a 9-9.5 / 10. Great game.

This is one of my favorite games. I've played through it a total of 15 times so far, some of which were challenge runs like a level 1 run, a non-upgraded rusty pipe run, and a few no partner runs with different themed builds. I'll go over a some of different aspects of the game and describe what I liked/disliked.

Character creation:
Character creation is surprisingly really good. Starting out, it just seems like theres a bunch of presets for everything, but once you get into it, you can make some really cool characters. I've made Hatsune Miku, Ai Hoshino (from Oshi No Ko), Harley Quinn, Amy Rose, and some other characters.

Pros:
- Color choices are good
- Presets look alright
- Accessories are super fun to play around with to get something that looks perfect

Cons:
- Outfit choices are lacking


Story:
I don't have a whole lot to say about the story since I don't want to spoil it. Its a good story. Some parts had me teary-eyed. The characters are all really fun and have their own stories you can choose to look through when collecting certain items.

Pros:
- Good story
- Fun and likable characters with their own stories
- Theres some good character development throughout the story

Cons:
- Some predictable anime tropes
- You have to find the items related to characters' back stories, which means you can miss some stuff.


Gameplay:
The gameplay is very smooth in my opinion. Movement is smooth with the right builds, like dark souls but faster and more fluid. All the weapons are fun to play with and are all viable options. Every weapon is at least a decent choice. Gifts (spells) are plentiful and feel great to use in combat, especially since you have 8 slots for them.

Pros:
- Movement is great
- Lots of fun spells
- Weapons are great

Cons:
- The controls can take a bit to get used to coming from most other souls-like games


Character building:
The character building is great. You are able to change your build at any point in the game provided you have the correct weapons, blood veils, gifts, and blood codes. The blood codes act as a form of class with its own stat scaling, weight limits, and gifts. You can even unlock the gifts from a blood code to use with other blood codes, which can make for some really fun combinations.

Pros:
- Can change build at any time
- With the right combinations, you can use any gift with any blood code

Cons:
- Stat scaling is somewhat confusing. Gear scaling uses letters and gift scaling uses numbers
- Some buff gifts don't really tell the whole story when it comes to what the exact buffs are


Level design:
The levels are alright. For the most part, the areas are quite linear with how you navigate them. You only backtrack a few times in the game. In terms of the setting of the levels, they lack variety. For the most part you're either in a city or a cave, with some variations and exceptions. One of those exceptions (without spoiling it too much) will make you rage.

Pros:
- Can be easy to navigate for the most part.
- Linear

Cons:
- Lack of variety in setting
- Transitions between levels are obvious
- Enemy placement seems to be designed around having an NPC partner/co-op helper, making solo runs more difficult


Bosses:
Whats a good souls-like without good bosses? The bosses in this game definitely deliver. I had fun with every boss, even if I was upset at times (but who doesn't get upset at times with a souls-like?).

Pros:
- Range in difficulty
- The harder bosses feel great to defeat

Cons:
- The difficulty range isn't linear with the game's progression. Some bosses near the beginning of the game are harder than some bosses later
- Like the enemy placement, bosses seems to be designed around having an NPC partner/co-op helper, making solo runs more difficult

Compared to those games, combat is easy and is designed around the use of a AI companion. For veterans of this kind of game, I do not recommend rolling solo as the game because the game becomes way too difficult since the enemies are aggressive and are designed around sharing agro.

Combat is fun and fast. The stats and equipment in the game are daunting at first, but after looking some stuff up you can eventually end up getting into it and making a build that fits your play style. 

The game also features one of the best character creators I have ever seen in a video game, evening rivalling Black Desert's character creator.

One thing that maybe a knock for some people is that it does lean heavily to the anime tropes with its characters, dialogue, exposition, and, of course, sexy looking characters with jiggle physics.

But if that last point doesn't phase you (or intrigues you) and you want your first foray into the Soulsborne genre, then I recommend this game. Veterans of the genre wont find much challenge in this game, but I still recommend if you want a more laid back Soulsborne game to play.",1694203326,1694203326,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

From the moment I delved into this game, it bore a striking resemblance to Devil May Cry, at least in terms of its premise. My initial motivation for acquiring it was the hope of capturing some of the essence of the Souls series, albeit in a more accessible form. While it doesn't serve as a mere clone, it incorporates fundamental elements reminiscent of the Souls games. Within its world, you'll discover a sanctuary filled with rooms, enigmatic characters seeking refuge, and the gradual unveiling of companions along your journey. Although the cutscenes may not align with my personal preferences, they remain an integral part of the experience.

**Key Points:**

**1. Souls-Like Essence with a Unique Flavor:** This game echoes the essence of the Souls series while infusing its own distinctive character. It offers a familiar sense of exploration, sheltering characters, and the discovery of companions, akin to the Souls games. However, it stands as a unique entity rather than a mere replication.

**2. Cooperative Gameplay Dynamics:** The inclusion of an AI companion adds an intriguing dimension to gameplay. This companion proves invaluable when facing hordes of foes and hastening mission completion.

**3. Genshin Impact Influence with Drawbacks:** Character-wise, the game draws parallels with Genshin Impact. Unfortunately, it occasionally accentuates exaggerated female body proportions, which may prove off-putting for some players.

**4. Value for Money:** Acquired during a sale, this game doesn't feel like a financial misstep. Most levels or chapters feature narrow, maze-like pathways where death lurks at every turn. Persistence is key, as you'll find yourself retracing your steps repeatedly to clear zones and bypass obstructions.

**Conclusion:**

In conclusion, this game intertwines familiar Souls-like elements with its own unique identity, offering an engaging and accessible experience. While it may bear a resemblance to Devil May Cry in its premise, it possesses its own distinct charm. The inclusion of an AI companion enhances the cooperative dynamics of gameplay, but the character design, reminiscent of Genshin Impact with exaggerated proportions, may not appeal to everyone. Acquired during a sale, this title offers value for your investment, but be prepared for labyrinthine level design and a requirement for a good sense of direction to navigate successfully.",1649987661,1693681843,True,9,1,0.607663094997406006,0,True,False,False

The 3 DLCs are terribly handled and basically just reused bosses. One boss per DLC. For 9,99€ per. Worst DLCs ive ever seen.
The game itself can be very complicated to understand with all the Codes you can get and use, which are basically the stats of this game which govern what builds and weapons you can use, and the map layout is sometimes extremly confusing.
The tits. I know im mainly alone with this one, but i just dont like oversexualized animes and games. Which almost was a reason for me to not get it... but im glad i did, because luckily thats really just superficial fanservice and not a topic in the game. But yeah, most men would count this as a positive.

Ye thats about it, now for the positives:
First of all, the best thing about this entire game is the soundtrack. Its one of the best OSTs of any game ever, and i say that as someone who loves From Soft OSTs like Bloodborne, which imo is still the best one ever made, but the one of this game actually comes kinda close, which is ridiculous. Rarely ive cried harder to a song then to ""Memory of the Lost"" or ""Requiem"". But most of the songs arent sad, but upbeat, orchestral and epic. And almost every single one is an absolute banger.
Now for the game itself, its all in all just great. The combat isnt Dark Souls level, but closer to it then most souls-likes, its pretty crisp, accurate and fun. Not always ofc, but most times. The weapons are very fun too, there are just enough diffrent ones to have a big enough arsenal to choose from, but not too many to get overwhelmed, and not many same-y ones.
The worldbuilding is fantastic. I would not have expected that from this game. Some locations have obvious references to other games (Anor Londo, if you know you know), but thats fine, theyre not copies or anything. And while some maps can look kinda repetetive after a while, youre probably not long enough in one level to notice too much. Its varied enough to not immidiatley jump out.
And the story... is a bit complicated at first, and you have to search for it, but its actually so darn good... most animes ive seen dont compare. It gets better and better the deeper you dive into it, i can only recommend watching videos about it too to understand more. Not many games made me actually cry, and the OST didnt help either... to make me stop crying that is.

I honestly can say, even if you dont like anime, oversexualized characters, ridiculously big weapons etc., if you like an emotional story, fun combat, great visuals and songs, try it. Especially if you like the God Eater Series, from which this is kind of a spinoff i think? I heard its at least in the same universe.
Right now its -80% off for 9,99€, theres no excuse to not get it right now. But yeah, skip the DLCs. c:",1693575463,1693575721,True,19,2,0.683350861072540283,0,True,False,False

Graphics: 7/10
Very good, quite detailed. Not too heavy-load but not too light, perfect for mid-at-best PCs.

Gameplay: 9/10
The blood code and gifts system can be overwhelming at first, but once you spend enough time reading and playing through you can easily get the hang of it. The weapon designs are really good, each and every weapon is unique, with different types of attacks, and yes, each weapon, even the same type of weapons have different attack types. The weapons, they feel solid. You can really feel the heavy hits you're dealing, as well as the hits you take, and DAMN do they hurt. The blocking and parry mechanic can be forgettable sometimes, as you only really dodge most of the time, but taking your time to learn how to use them in the correct situations can give you the edge you need in an important boss fight.

Character Customization 8/10:
Short answer: Yes. 
Long answer: There's A LOT of customization options, and the possibilities are limitless, from hair, eyes (heck, even the pupils), face shape, to your clothes and its colors, and much more. You can spend an entire day customizing your character and you wouldn't even be halfway done (that is, if you care as much as I do about how your character looks). 
Side note: booba size slider 10/10

Story: 9/10
The story is very good, the world-building is phenomenal, and the areas and their backstories are well-made. What I like the most are each character's stories. The game shows you their memories and backstories when you receive their powers/blood codes, and damn they are well-executed. They tell you the story in a way you just can't skip it, they keep it interesting, and they really make you care for the character, no matter how little they matter to the main story (which is rare, most of them have important roles in the story, which I also really like).

Boss Fights/Fights in general: 1000/10
I can't stress enough how much I've had fun just pushing through bosses and fights no matter how much I die, it doesn't even make me mad. You can't be too straightforward in fights because there are things you need to prepare before going in, like choosing the correct skillset, elements, and status effects to give you an advantage, which I really like. Each time you try to fight the bosses you learn something new about the fight, giving you more information and helps you prepare for your next tries. For Small mob/Mini Boss fights, you can't let yourself get caught lacking, because no matter how weak they look, they still pack a punch. I can't count how many times I almost died underestimating mobs and just button mashing them. You have to think of how you're entering a fight, no matter what. Because once you get overwhelmed by multiple mobs, there is no escape, you run out of stamina, get cornered, and get beaten to death. As I've mentioned before, the most important part of the game is preparation, and it's the part I love the most.

Overall: 9/10

Anyway on with the review...This is a very average game, the least inspiring game that I have played for a very long time. The scenery and graphics in general are below average, combat is dull and repetitive, enemy AI is a joke which comes in handy since so many enemies will just target you while your annoying companion kills them. The companions continually talk complete rubbish, the game is filled with dull cutscenes, some of which directly follow other cutscenes and are then followed bu yet another cutscene, more than I remember in any game I have ever played (thankfully they are skippable), the hitboxes are dodgy (something I have not complained about in any other game), the enemies weapons have more range than their size, my weapons have less range than their size. The game mechanics are ridiculous, but that is okay since you can just spam light attacks. The only thing I like so far is the rolling, it rolls really easily and fast, you can spam roll out of pretty much anything (with the right build). I bought this on sale, otherwise I would have gone for a refund after about 20 minutes of play.

I don't now if there is a anime for this game, but at least for me I feel all the emotions in the game, drama, sadness, happiness, friendships, etc. 

Like in dark souls and elden ring you have to grind, upgrade you armor and weapons, you can chose your play style be unlock blood veils and gifts (actives and passives), you also need to learn the mechanic of the bosses like the enemies and of course you will died often.

I mean, if you like to make anime characters, the character creator alone is worth the asking price. The game itself is rather complicated. It has a number of wonderful ideas. The blood code system needs to be iterated on. There is definitely a phenomenal game that uses this sort of class/stat change on sight mechanic. Giving NPC helpers as difficulty adjusters was also a great idea. The issue is in the execution. For example: healing. Healing in this game comes from one of three sources: regen items, other player's abilities, and self abilities. The abilities either can only heal others directly, or require conditions to work. They tend to also come mid to late game. This means that for a lot of the game, you'll be relying on the regen items. They are slow to use, and do not heal very much. This is a necessity. If they were better, having an npc partner would make the game trivial. However, it makes solo play incredibly frustrating. Getting off a heal is difficult and not very rewarding. Generally, it involves breaking the flow of combat to run away and heal at a distance. So, as long as you are a pro gamer and are doing well, the game's healing system doesn't get in the way of the action. If you get hit it quickly spirals the fight. There are a million little knock on effects like this that plague the game. Ideas that individually make sense, but get very draining very quickly in the actual game. From deceptively wide sweeping attacks to janky backstabs, everything feels uncertain in a way that doesn't gel with this style of game. That said, there are large swathes of the game where these issues die down some, and we can see what Code Vein was attempting. It can get REALLY good at some points. Typically, the knight enemies are interesting and enjoyable. There are whole levels where they shun those awful bug enemies out of the way and just let you have fun for a bit. Honestly, this whole game feels like a rough draft. While I'm only lukewarm on Code Vein itself, I am very intrigued for a sequel. If you like Souls games, I can't promise this one will enamor you, but you'll at least get something out of it.",1693171054,1693171054,True,94,0,0.849204838275909424,0,True,False,False

Lore 8/10

Just a quick explanation of why I give the rating for this game play and lore:

I tried only two weapon style, Castor and Two handed Sword melee. Castor is a fun concept but the fact that many other better spell is lock too far back into the game, another issue I have with Castor is the ichor cost to even maintain this class. All I want is, if I want to play Castor, I want to play it fully without all the extra nuance. The nuance which is the bloody annoying drain attack to increase the threshold, and the best part is even with maxing the full threshold, your early spell may not even be enough to finish off a boss. Bayonet is also a terrible weapon itself, when talking about the topic of ichor. The shots can easily block by end game enemy and not only it doesn't deal a ton of damage, it cost ichor which is a shitty resource to maintain. Unlike in dark souls 3 where you can refill your mana with a REFILLABLE flask. 

But why I still give the gameplay 8/10? That is because I managed to clear the game with only a single Zweihander, any souls game where you can just use one big man weapon and beat everything already deserve a 6/10 as base even if everything else sucks. The extra two point also come from the flexibility in swapping passive skill and active skill which give more fun in the combat, along with the replayability that comes with it as you can choose to play with the same difficulty or enhanced difficulty.

As for the lore, I really like the story of the game, it is very simple to understand and I don't need to head on to YouTube to watch 50 minute worth of lore because I don't bother to read the description. I also like the way they implemented the lore, by rewarding the player with parts which can allow you to unlock better gifts after you finish reading memory. You can also skip all of it if you are replaying the game, so that's another +1 in my dictionary.

Some things go unexplained and you have to do your homework on your own to figure out the story than have it shown in-game. Half way through it gets better, but despite it does the plot is predictable where we are going/headed.

The difficulty - is nowhere near Dark Souls - I know this because Dark souls is my top 3 most played game on Steam. Most of the bosses in this game I beat on the first or 2nd attempt without knowing what to do.
(At the time of this message, Dark souls is my top 3 most played game over hundreds of hours)

------
The gameplay is alright, the weapon animations are a joke however - all the weapons attack/feel the same you can tell this game was heavily on a budget/rushed for some material.

These are the same publishers who have the game Dark souls under them.
(I even know this because I know some of the tools that was used to make this game.)

------

The content for this game is decent, despite the flaws and obvious traits there. You can sink a lot of hours into it due to the grind of the weapons and searching the environments for clues/areas where to go towards next.

------

Multiplayer is dead for this game - I tried searching every area until I beat the entire game and DLC for open search lobbies or making my own several times before progressing. Nonetheless people can co-op with you but it can only be 1 person to aid on your journey.

------

The game overall is okay, I wouldn't say honestly it is better than other JRPGs out there already, but honestly it has a great concept - but that great concept I tried digging in the gameplay or story - was implemented mediocre making the game yearning for more content/DLC or something more to happen at the end result of it.

Give it a good end-game/extra bosses or more flashbacks, and touching up on some untold parts of the story, and I'll call the game good after that - it never will happen but it is only inches away from becoming something unique.",1659304016,1692848569,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

Pros: 
- Amazing Graphics even by today's standards
- Well Optimized PC Port!!! Was able to play in 2K Max Settings and still reach above 90+ fps for my FreeSync to kick in. (YES, I'M A FILTHY AMD USER, GO FUCKIGN BACK TO YOUR NVIDIA SOFTWARE ALWAYS FUCKING UP LMFAO)
- Character Customization. Yo, I don't know what they were cooking in Bandi's studio with that shit. A bunch of options to make your character unique, even though it's mostly presets BUT you can modify them to your liking.
- [b] THE SOUNDTRACK....[/b] IM A FUCKING SUCKER FOR OPERA SINGING AAAAAAAAAAAA
- The concept of the game overall + story (Even though I didn't really care for it, I thought it was still original enough to stand out)
-Co-op being a thing even though I didn't get to try it out! You still have the options of using NPC's as partners if you want, or not! Whatever floats your boat you lil' tryhard.
- KIND OF repetitive combat but it makes up for it with how different it is with the Blood Codes and the Gifts. (Idk, I'm not really much of a SOULS GAME FAN myself (Only Played DS3 and Elden Ring) but it felt good whenever you found out a good build to use)
- Io
- [spoiler] No seriously, I want to smash the ever living fuck out of Io. She is very precious and wholesome. [/spoiler]

Cons:
- The price of the game at the time of writing this. Seriously Bandi? $59.99 retail price in 2023 and the game was released almost 4 years ago at this point? Just get this game whenever it goes on sale in general please. I got the Deluxe Edition for $11.99 this past Summer Sale WITH the DLC included.
- The DLC. Mostly just there if you want to squeeze extra content out of the game beyond base game. Can pretty much be 30 mins to an hour of enjoyment since it really only adds re-skined enemies and 3 bosses. Can make up though with alternative outfits and more blood codes though. Also costs money by the way because why wouldn't some short dlc's cost money right?!
- [spoiler] The fact I lose Io in all 3 endings i want to die WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY [/spoiler]

- [spoiler] Kinda of a personal thing here, WHY THE FUCK DOES EVERYONE HAVE HUGE BONKERS. I WANT SOME VARIETY OF FLAT CHESTS AND SHIT. SURE THERE WAS RIN, BUT THAT'S THE ONLY MF I CAN REMEMBER THAT TOTALLY DIDN'T HAVE THEIR CHEST SIZE MAXED OUT.  I CAN'T WIN WITH FUCKING ANIME DEVS BRO [/spoiler]

Overall, I wouldn't say it's one of my favorite games in the vast library I have but I'd still recommend it if someone liked BIG ANIME BOOBAS + Dark Souls in a sense.

A lot of areas feel like interlacing corridors (with the Cathedral being the best example) that feel so artificial and forced. 

Perhaps the best example of the game design issue comes from one of the later bosses. It's a double-boss, clearly inspired by Orstein and Smough from Dark Souls. But in DS the boss fight is very well designed - it teaches the player to handle ""gankers"" by teaching you the tricks to dealing with two opponents at once, you can use the pillars to block their charges and you can even get a reliable summon for the fight.

Code Vein's version of the fight is worse is every way. The boss's have attacks that hardly telegraph, manipulating the camera to see both at once is almost impossible (meaning the AOEs they sprout underneath you have almost no warning) and the pillars only block your movement and nothing else - they can charge through it and fire their ranged attacks too. 

This kind of issue is rampant in the game - a lot of design choices feel like they're only there because Dark Souls did it, but missing the subtleties that made those elements work in DS. 

When it tries to be it's own thing it seems to do a lot better. Using the vestiges to retell other characters histories was a nice touch, the story has some potential and the character customisation is amazing. It's a shame it's just bogged down by too much garbage outside that.",1692483158,1692483158,False,1,0,0.506398499011993408,0,True,False,False

exploration and everything else was done fairly well.
I did enjoy the story, thought the story was good, finished game with the ""good ending""
cant stress enough how garbage combat feels, so janky, tracking is terrible, and  most the boss battles were designed like dogshit.
I CANNOT EMPHASISE ENOUGH how badly bosses were designed in this game. Especially the last boss, that shit was an actual meme. Id like to go back and replay the game to 100% the achievements however the terrible boss design and overall jank as hell feel to combat I think ill pass, beating the game once was good for me.
I would recommend picking this up on sale, i see they added the DLC's with the base game now which they should've done from the start as the DLC's are a scam, and beyond terrible for PAID DLC CONTENT.
otherwise just get the base game, its pretty good if you can look past how garbage combat feels.

the game do have a lot of flaw as well the map design and DLCs which add almost nothing but dungeon map that you may or may not play also dont add anything to the story what so ever which is the biggest offender and enemy variety is quite lacking but they arent bad , not to mention the music which isnt bad by any mean but they over use to much tho
the combat surprisingly not that bad same with the build and the option to switch it out on the fly which mean you have a lot variety to make your build good and the amount combination you could do is quite neat , i do like the idea of ichor which is your mana bar only fill up if you do combat meaning that you have to engage with the combat if you want to use any skill what so ever so no hiding at the back 
story very straight forward which is good or bad thing is depend on who you ask for me it ok not the best but serviceable if you want deeper lord then you have to do research tho there a lot of stuff being hidden tho
character customization easily the best one i have seen so far from these souls game almost full control of everything like you could move the accessories , hair around to the combination you could do with this is just very good like you could easily make most of the character from other series without any problem if you have the time to spend 
also the cherry on the top mod support
so here a example of the character form other series

It's sort of just an anime Dark Souls. I think the thing I like most about this game is that levelling up is just a flat thing for your character instead of different stats like in Dark Souls, this gives total freedom to experiment with whatever you want, you can be a pure dark caster and then swap to a strength build very quickly, just have to change your blood code and veil (single armour piece) and weapon

There's a fun character customiser, though I wish there were more clothing options, I like making NPCs and using their weapon and blood code

You also have an npc ally for the entire game, and they are actually somewhat competent. You can also choose who to take depending on your playstyle or situation, though Yamuko is the best <3

first of all, its a souls-like but anime. It certainly have some dark soulsy-vibe to it. I have a lot of fun playing it even after beating the game, mainly because of its ""endgame"" system that the game have, more on that later. So, what';s the positive and negative side about this game?

Pros:
1) The fighting felt good. Dodging and attacking is smooth making it easier to survive. The animation of each attack is polished as well, and doesn't feel clunky at all.
2) The map design is pretty good. Although it can get bland especially how some areas looks and feel the same, just a ruined city that you happened to be stuck in, so it can get pretty bland. However, it does have some maps that is different from the rest and i'll give a pass for that.
3) The bosses are great with decent telegraphed attack. They can be challenging at times but it doesn't feel unfair until you fight those same bosses without companion. With companion, its like riding a bike. Without companion, its like riding the same bike while a volcano just erupted and you have to dodge its meteor while going down a ramp with 1000 monsters trying to kill you. it was fun.
4) Endgame. While exploring the game, you may find maps from npc questline or scattered all around the world. This is basically dungeons with mini-boss and the main boss, with the main boss being one of the boss you will encounter in the main story. Since those bosses respawn infinitely after you rests at mistle (bonfire), you can test your skill against these bosses. These dungeons will also conatin items and other useful stuff you can get, as well as providing a good haze farm should you need one.


cons:
1) enemy variety is lacking. You can fight one enemy at the start of the game only to find the exact same enemy with more health in the area just before the final boss. A lot of enemies that appear in previous area will appear in the next one, maybe with different abilities and whatnot (example: cathedral knights can teleport while the knights in government outskirst cant BUT they will buff their weapon then hit like a f-ing tank.
2) Maps design. Once again, some maps are great. Unfortunately, it doesn't translate to other maps making it feel very similar in terms of looks (just look at the 2nd area at the start of the game and 2nd area before the final boss. they look and feel the same)
3) Memory. Memory is the way the game tell you about your companion/NPC past. Although it was a unique way to re-tell the event of the past, it can get extremely repetitive as you keep finding vestiges for different NPCs and Companions. It was unique and fun for the first few but quickly become stagnant as you required to do this for one of the endings.

All in all, it was really good despite all the cons i just mentioned, and i found it enjoyable enough that im willing to replay the game for the other endings, If you're a fan of souls-like and would like o play something that can be challenging but still provide some fun with decent story on top of it, then this one is for you.

So if you like both anime and Souls-like games then check it out, download the demo and give it a go. Definitely worth getting during a sale.

If you hate anime, then you better skip this. The story is a overly melodramatic, the character and enemy designs look like they were made by horny teenagers. If this bothers you then you won't have a good time. On the other hand there's no romance, no sex scenes, so if that is what you're looking for, again probably not your thing.

The game differs from Dark Souls in that you can have a partner for the fights. The partner is competent but won't do everything for you. So you still have to master the various gameplay mechanics, simple buttonmashing won't get you through the entire game. The demo has a section where you must fight alone, this will not happen in the main game. However you can choose to fight alone if the game is too easy with a partner.

You gain XP from killing enemies, this can be used to 
1: level up 
2: buy gear (I almost never did, mostly everything you need is just drops)
3: upgrade gear (necessary)
4: unlock class abilities.
Class abilities have two tier unlock, one to use the skill on that class and one to use it on any class. The second requires defeating enemies while that skill is on your toolbar (you don't even have to use the skill). However if you level up too fast then the game won't let you unlock the skill trough gameplay, you have to use items and XP and the items (various Awake upgrades) are somewhat random drops. So it makes sense to level up slowly, once you unlock a new class, grind out the skills in the Depths (smaller maps unrelated to the main story) and then continue. 

When you die then you lose the XP (items and gear luckily remains). XP can be regained if you do a successful corpse run. You might get unlucky and die again before reaching where you died the first time tho. But this is no reason to rage quit at that point. The XP you get grows exponentially over the course of the game. So it might have taken hours to get 100k XP at the beginning of game but at the end of the game it's like 6 enemies within 1 minute of gameplay. So even losing million XP is not that big of a deal (happened to me a couple of times), you will get tons more.

Overall I liked this game, I hope there will be a sequel.",1691509421,1691509421,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

CODE VEIN is a game that I enjoyed playing a lot. It is a game that combines the elements of dark fantasy, anime, and souls-like genres.

CODE VEIN has an engaging and intriguing story that follows the journey of the player and their companions as they explore the ruins of Vein, fighting against the Lost and searching for their memories. It has multiple endings that depend on the player's choices and actions throughout the game. But, honestly, CODE VEIN also has some cliché and cheesy dialogue, some inconsistent and rushed pacing, and some lackluster and disappointing endings that can diminish the impact of the story.

This game has an exciting and fun combat system that allows the player to use various weapons, skills, and blood veils to fight against different enemies and bosses. The game also has a co-op multiplayer mode that allows the player to team up with an AI partner or a friend online to tackle the challenges together. However, CODE VEIN also has some repetitive and bland level design, some annoying and unfair enemies, and some confusing and vague mechanics that can frustrate the player.

Surprisingly, CODE VEIN has a fantastic and varied soundtrack that enhances the mood and tone of each scene. This game has a deep and customizable character creation that allows the player to create their own Revenant and express their personality and style.

Overall, CODE VEIN is a great game that I would recommend to anyone who likes action RPGs, anime, or vampires. It has a lot of potential and charm.",1613207544,1691381722,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The character customization is really incredible, but clothing and armor feels very limited. There's very few types of both and you can't really mish mash things to create some unique fashion souls

When it comes to character building, for some reason some souls-likes do this thing where strength builds are absolutely busted, there's a specific build that is hardly playable (in this game it's bayonets) and everything else is mid. The game's difficulty (and thus enjoyability) varies way too much depending on what weapon type you want to use

There are some maps that feel like a drag to explore or even just get by. Also, if you want to play the whole game in co-op with someone you'll have to play every map twice, it really is like dark souls huh. I really like the way coop plays but this alone makes it unenjoyable. Also, co-oping with NPCs shares the same problem with the builds, as there are some NPCs that are significantly stronger than others (Yakumo) 

As for the story, I like it. I don't think it's the game's main selling point but it's fine

In the end I think it's a good game to experience if you like dark souls and anime. I don't regret buying and playing it but the fact that it made me think about regretting it or not says something. I would advise against buying it if you want to do a co-op playthrough with someone unless you and your partner can enjoy each other's company without needing to do something together so the game just becomes a background for you. If you two need to feel actually engaged in something together to have fun it'll be fun and games for like 10 hours until you realize that you'll have to play Cathedral of the Sacred Blood twice

tl;dr Mixed feelings. Some builds can feel severely underpowered and there are huge maze-ish maps, but it can surely be fun and cool at moments. Be careful if you're buying it for the coop",1691362276,1691363948,False,3,0,0.518248140811920166,0,True,False,False

Pros:
-Shit ton of customization options, from weapons, classes and abilities, blood veils to suprisingly good character creator,
-Game encourages trying out new classes and changeing gear and playstyles, especially that you can change stuff on the go.
-Really rewarding gameplay, there's high-risk dodgeroll melee backstabs, ranged combat with damaged dealing spells and heavy hitting hammers etc. 
-Coop partner on one hand probably reduces the difficulty but at the same time opens a lot of paths for builds and the game can allow itself to have more complex encounters since (if you didn't let your partner die), you should have somebody there to help you out if you get overwhelmed to save you from getting one shotted or take one enemies aggro,
-Story is fantastic, didn't expect much from a souls-like, but man it was good, the memories you collect create really cool way to tell a story of different characters. 
-the level design is decent,
-Io's boobs,


Cons: 
-Level desing is sometimes confusing, it's not outright bad, the game has a lot of amazing looking places but there's some backtracking and again, confusion on some maps

The story is top-tier, the only one that's managed to make me genuinely sob in years. it's Souls-like combat but better, because there's a mechanic called Ichor, which allows you to use your buffs and big boy moves and spells and all that cool shit. The environments are perfect, ranging from a ruined city, to a giant cathedral, to a sunken city, to a desert. The characters actually feel like people, and the antagonists feel like people with their own motives as well. the bosses are on par (except the butterfly, fuck the butterfly). also, the character creator is THE BEST CHARACTER CREATOR IN ANY GAME EVER MADE EVER AND I WILL BET MONEY ON THAT. also instead of having boring skill specs, you get things called blood codes, blood codes with their own predetermined stats, like one having A+ in strength and less in other areas, stuff like that. each blood code has their own story about the owner of the blood code, and each one has their own unique abilities and skills, which allows for endless build combinations. the armor also different from other souls-likes, because there are 4 categories: Ogre (fast and dexeterity focused typically), hounds which are more for strength orientated and have higher defense, Spine (or something i forgot i don't use it) which aren't all that great, and thorn, which are mainly intelligence and willpower focused. each time of armor has a different parry window, with the fastest being ogre and the slowest being thorn. each time you parry you can do a drain attack, which gives you a ton of ichor and increases your maximum ichor limit until you touch a mistle (bonfire or grace basically)

At first, it was good, and I was having fun until I reached the first boss. Then it became apparent how unpolished this game is, which is why I can't recommend it to anyone.

However, I must admit that most of the time, they felt like nothing more than numbers or appearance customization, lacking depth and substance.

And yeah lastly this kind of soul-like game, but in anime ver, you can either run SOLO or DUO with npc (up to 7 npc with mods ofc), quite a lot of mods check on nexus, overall diff is not that really hard, just need a bit of memorization for dodging boss attack pattern

Considering how old this game is now, it's ridiculous how buggy and unresponsive it is. The framerate and graphical performance is great (like you'd expect from an Unreal engine game), but the input lag is enormous and purely caused by incompetent design.

I'm not a huge fan of the ""50 different classes in 1 character"" concept, but it's to be expected since it's quite common in Asian game design. However, since you can mix abilities from the different classes, as they largely only depend on what weapon you use, the whole class idea goes out the window and just becomes a messy way to unlock new abilities. Many other games do this so much better.

During the combat, the main part of the game, there's a massive lag before it begins to play the animation for whatever you press, and while each animation plays it completely ignores all input. This means you very easily get mauled because you're stuck in an animation with no way to defend yourself, and constantly have to consider how long each animation takes when attacking enemies. This is an archaic combat design that does not belong in a modern game. And it does not help that the camera frequently gets shoved into your characters head, so you lose all peripheral vision and have no idea what's happening while you're stabbed in the back by NPCs that are outside the screen. 

My other major complaint is the awful menu layout and the NPCs that will not shut up. When talking to the vendors you first have to wait for them to complete their pointless spiels before the menu opens, which wastes time, since they never have anything relevant to say. 

I did however give up trying to get something out of this game because it keeps locking up when talking to NPCs, mostly during the ""receive gift"" menu, but I also had it happen during the normal trade menu. And with the non-existent save system it just becomes annoying having to go through the slow animations and pointless conversations repeatedly, just because no one's bothered to bugfix the damn game since it was released on PC 5 years ago",1690121339,1690121339,False,1,0,0.471657723188400269,0,True,False,False

There's definitely difficulty spikes, but never something you can't get around of with a good strategy.

""Souls - Like/Games "" and "" Anime "". It also helped the fact that I heard tons and tons of people praising this game and saying that it was a ""Really good game"".....That was.....until I got to the 3rd boss, that I realized.....that this game was a try-hard.....and SOULESS carbon copy of a masterpiece known as ""Dark Souls"" and it lacked the creative mind to not only tell a snooooooze-fest of a so called ""story"",but also be lazy enough to call this game ""Difficult"" when the game is built around enemy ganks and enemy spam. 

First, lets get into the positives....

1. Customization - The customization of your main character is amazing and addictive. From so many accessories and colors to choose from, you could literally spend your time and your money in a better way by just making your character in the customization menu for HOURS on end than to be playing this Hit or miss game.

2. Builds - The builds on the other hand, offer a breathe of fresh air from the typical soul series where you have to commit to only ONE build. Instead what you have in Code Vein are these things called "" Blood Codes "" which are pretty much presets of actual builds like (Tanks, Int, Magic, Drain, Skills, Dex, Range etc.).

Now back to the Negatives that lowered this games potential and made this game a soon to forget experience and an instant uninstall from my Library.

1. Combat - By far the most crucial trait to have in a "" Souls - Like "" game is the combat. Without good combat, the game is gonna be very lacking and very stale....and it was just that...lacking and stale....While the blood codes did give you diversity in builds, it still didn't matter because the combat was not only clunky, slow, and stupid (Your character hits in the direction it faces + the swipes or overheads are random) , but it also lacked the fluidity and flexibility thanks to the way this game was built. As well as the enemies that didn't make it ANY BETTER. Its as if the devs couldn't decide to either scrap the combat or scrap the enemies, so instead they decided to make an AI system that could solve both problems at once.

2. Difficulty + A.I - Which leads to my next point, the A.I. The A.I is not only OP in the sense that.....idk.... it can dish out insane dmg, tank insane dmg, and also revive you...Multiple times....But is also the MAIN mechanic in which this game is built around. So much so that if you want to even dream of a ""challenge"". Removing the A.I will literally not make the game harder but extremely BRUTAL. Almost as if you are doing demon bell + Kuros charm or doing a no armor hollow run, because Code Vein likes to give you a ""challenge"" through enemy spams, enemy ganks, and mistles (bonfires) that are a mile away from each other....so by the time you are at the other mistle. You have either died a million times and finally made it, or you are a PIXEL of health away from seeing death and starting ALL OVER.

3. Bosses - A hero is as good as the villain right? Well yea, but in code vein the V in Villain stands for absolute VIRGINS. Cause either a.) My A.I destroys the Boss b.) The Bosses projectile spams and runs like a pu**y so much that its easy to tell the patterns it has or c.) both....Regardless the bosses are both forgettable and laughable and arent even a threat until you FINALLY reach near end game. But even so my death counter didn't reach higher than 10 on all bosses....and this is a ""Souls - Like "" in 2019.....

4. Story - At first when I saw Io's stunning ""personality"" and her habit of doing long stares into nothingness while the camera focused on her ""personality"" I thought that this game was gonna be a fun ""self - aware "" anime game or at least a decent anime game like ""MGR"". (IK not anime like but at least self - aware).....spoiler alert...it wasn't. It was your generic "" lets all be friends + we can do it "" type story, with cut-scenes and exposition dumps sh*tted all over the place. Like I kid you not, by the time I was on the 4th out of like 15 levels I was already skipping cut - scenes and major plot lines because it had no tension or no risk....it was a by the numbers story with zero progression. EVEN in character development, if any, the only character(s) that had a development was Jack, Yakumo and Io....everyone else had one bad obstacle and then was never ever seen/relevant ever again.

5. Map Design - People like to applaud and give awards to the artists and the writers for characters and story, but also forget the people that focus on environment and map/level design. This too plays an important role in almost any game. Because if the map and/or environment is memorable or awesome. People will have more of a reason to explore much much longer. Unfortunately for those who want to find good reasons to play Code Vein. The only thing you want to find in every level is just the EXIT, but even then..... good luck in finding that sh*t as well because in almost every map the game penalizes you in some way. Whether it be in the bad case of absolute BOREDOM from seeing, the most bland and dull level design ever, Fighting groups of enemy ganks and spam in every section you go because THATS the ""difficulty"" of Code Vein and/or having your HP/Time/Ichor drained from your character. Because level Design.

6. DLC - Apparently there's DLC for this game, but who cares? When you have to pay 3 installments of 15$ of DLC of re-skins of character skins, bosses, enemies and Blood codes. Especially when you realize all the ""DLC"" is short and locked in an area called the ""Depths"" which is short mode in the game where you can collect gear and spend a bare maximum of an hour. I never played it DLC to be fair but I dont have to when ALL the DLC is getting bad rep everywhere and has mostly negative reviews.

Overall.....people can tell you that Code Vein is a ""good game with friends""....but isnt every game w/ friends? I mean...friends make EVERYTHING fun, and even in the MOST boring and DIRE situations can friends turn something boring and bad into something great and fun. But when you gotta choose a game to spend time on by YOURSELF, Code Vein reaaaaaally isnt it. Even in the ""Souls - Like"" Genre, Code Vein never gives you that DESIRE to explore hidden areas and discover secrets that tell a deeper story...like in Dark Souls. Neeeeeever gives you that THRILL in a fight when fighting multiple enemies like in Nioh. Neeeeeever has that TENSION, that each and every boss has in Sekiro where the stakes and fear were high. Neeeeeever has that HYPE like Bloodbourne has when it comes to finishing the game or Neeeeeever had the AUDIENCE that even encouraged people stick around to play the sequel, like in Fallen Order. In the end, if you somehow want something fun. Buy a better game or wait for this game to be on sale if you want this game down bad. If you want an intro to "" Soul-likes"" you can try out other games that are fun like "" SIfu "", "" Fallen Order "", or even "" Nioh "" tbh. and if you still enjoyed this game......more power to you. But this game wasn't anything special. Aside from the fact that it's a "" Anime Souls - Like "" that tried to be the next "" Dark Souls "". Only to fall flat on its face.....

The story is totally uninteresting, I care for none of these characters or their problems. It doesn't matter at all in the grand scheme of things as the world is normal outside of this ""bubble"". The locations all suck. the finer build mechanics don't make a whole lot of sense as there's basically 2 really good blood veils and the rest are similar stats.

I find the combat totally unenjoyable, which was the one thing that could have made it tolerable, but there's too much I hate about it. Extremely aggressive enemy scaling makes leveling up pointless against any boss. Hitboxes are enormous, you can dodge roll behind an enemy thrusting a spear forwards and still take the damage from it. I don't even have anything to compare it to, this is the worst case of this I've ever seen. Enemies are way too player biased-meaning I can just run around the boss stage while the AI partner eats at least half of their HP bar. In the event you find yourself at low health, the AI aggro becomes impossible to shake. Coolest thing combat had to offer was the blood veil backstab animations.

Character creator is pretty good but there aren't enough outfit options and the ones that are there all suck, get rid of the high heeled boots and shoes, blood veils should either be colorable or able to be hidden and your anime game is also lacking the keystone animal ears and fangs. Boy what is wrong with you? I bet you thought I wouldn't catch on to you being too lazy to do facial animations either. The Tokyo Ghoul mask thing wasn't an accident (they're butt ugly anyways, just like that stupid slav hat Mia wears). I hate the aesthetic this game has but if they were going for an anime Dark Souls it's not that out of place.

But in all seriousness, as my first souls-like, I am deeply enjoying the combat system, the class system, etc--
I still suck at dodging and parrying, but I'm making progress, and it feels satisfactory.

While having plenty of missteps, the game is worth you're time. But, wait for a sale, as full price really starts to exemplify all of the faults.

Code Vein is a title I've had my eyes on for some time now. I'm a fan of the Souls series and seeing the press around this game and the gameplay being shown off, I was rather intrigued. Though, there were plenty of other titles coming out and, having a backlog already to get through, this one slipped through the cracks. In addition, seeing some negative reviews from people I follow made me not-too-eager to check it out. With that said, I purchased it finally on sale have finally played through it.

For one, the story I felt was a mixed bag. I found some elements of the writing to be quite nice. There were several, simple touches that were done which helped to empathize with your party members along the way. You'll also find items which let you see memories of other characters, whether your party members or people who are mentioned in the story, and it shows where they were prior to their current predicament. While I found these to be a mixed bag, sometimes repeating oneself, overall, I think it did the job nicely. However, as I kept playing, I found the story to be losing track of itself a bit and had hoped they would rein in things a bit, but alas.

The visuals were a bit all over. There were moments which I found the place I was to be quite nice visually. The character designs were alright for the most part, but definitely made me think 'this game is what people joke when saying generic anime designs'. With that said, there was plenty of clipping I found in the game. And as for the character models, I found them to look a bit like plastic. It wasn't all the time, but for some moments, it took me out of the scene for a moment.

The music is nice overall. There isn't all too much to say about it in this section. I found the boss music to be enjoyable, but maybe wish it was a bit more varied. But, good throughout my playthrough.

Now gameplay is a bit more complex for me. Code Vein's formula has been seen before in the Souls games and has been tweaked and varied for quite a while now. The core of what is there is solid enough, but I found the additions that they tried to add not to add up in my playthrough. It's hard to ignore, but I found myself not using everything new the game gave me. For example, during your attack, you can follow-up with your arm which can add +1 to your ichor stock. Also, you can charge it up and, if it hits, adds +2 to it. However, at no point did I find this useful in the slightest as it leaves you quite vulnerable. Ichor is important for abilities you gain throughout your journey, but melee attacking builds it back up so it isn't too big a deal to do this unique attack to build more.

While I did say the core was solid enough, there are hiccups. For one, back attacks are terrible finicky. Sometimes the game would read it correctly, sometimes I would be on their side and get it, or in front even. But nearly 50% of the time, I would get a regular attack, which is fine enough, but isn't what I would be going for. The hit reading can be off and make it hard to see what your range is exactly and, at times, taking damage without realizing it. And lastly, maybe one of the biggest issues: level design. While not everything needs to flow well together, doing so really helps connect me to the world, make me smile as I know where I am. Seeing things become more hot as I approach a fire level, or doing something to help bridge areas together. Code Vein, sadly, uses long connecting hallways to connect areas together. And, even with these, the shifts between areas can be stark and take you out of the experience you're playing in.

Despite all of these critiques, I found myself enjoying Code Vein. The mechanics and writing were good enough to keep me engaged all the while. The music was charming as well, and my curiosity about this game helped me through and I found myself enjoying my time quite a bit. But, the elephant-in-the-room for me is the price. At $60, I cannot recommend this game. At that price, all the flaws I've mentioned, and maybe even more which you may have, really are shown off all-the-more.

However, as I did mine, I still do recommend this game. But pick it up on a sale, if you can. I do believe this to be an interesting title and one which held my interest until the end. While flawed, Code Vein is able to still capture you and take you along on your journey together.",1689462450,1689462450,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game offers you a very easy way to change your build. You can even change it on the fly. Fighting a group of enemies as a mage, and the fighting the boss the next minute as a tank? You can do it. And even the skill/spell that you want to use can be mixed unless for some class-specific skill/spell, but there is only one per class, if any.

The story is not that interesting for me, or at least doesnt really have that jrpg magic. Maybe it's because you can only partner up with one teammmate at a time and there isn't warm sidequest/interaction with them. But the setting and genre of the game might not be fit to cater to it. But the setting behind the world is interesting

There is a level that i find people online seem to hate because of its puzzling design. But i find it to be challenging and satisfying to beat the first time around.

Boss fights are great. But because of the system that limit your skill learning capability if you are overleveled without any way to know if you are overleved is kinda annoying. Because of it, i tend to keep my level low and get one-shotted by boss, (judo mizo, damn you). But it's a little nitpick, dont be me, level up some.

The good stuff-
1. Surprisingly decent writing for once, at least it's not AWFUL, plus the vestige memory things are neat.
2. Don't really hate any specific character, which is surprising for anime games like this.
3. The gameplay is alright, but weirdly slow.
4. Blood codes (classes) are sorta cool as a concept, and there's like 50 of them.
5. You're basically anime vampires. Your hideout is even an old church.
6. It's a prequel to [spoiler]God Eater[/spoiler], which is supposed to be a secret, but it's kinda obvious with how the weapons look, how some things are named, how some of the enemies look, plus your Drain attacks.
7. Character customization is pretty nice.

The bad stuff-
1. Equipment is SIMPLE. There's a weapon slot, an alternate weapon slot to switch to, and a jacket, which is basically your ""drain weapon"", not armor. Defensive stats come from both your weapon and your jacket.
2. There's only four passive skill slots, which stinks since there's like 80 to pick from and gives no incentive to unlock more.
3. There's this weird fresnel glow on everything that looks 10x as awful whenever you're somewhere dark.
4. Your chosen class really doesn't change that much.
5. Leveling is almost worthless, some people even suggest avoiding leveling because of how a few mechanics work.
6. Your ""estus flask"" heals a flat, low amount of health, and only upgrades as you find certain items through the game. In my tank character's case, it takes ALL SIX of my uses to heal me to full and you can't chain-""drink"" them.
7. Almost no other sources of healing, minus the ""bonfires"", so high HP in general is a bad idea. There's like 5 ""give your health to your partner"" skills though, which is super odd.
8. Upgrading equipment just raises their offensive stats, which is boring to me. You can ""evolve"" equipment to fudge some numbers out of and into other stats, but that's it.
9. Parrying is finicky, the game doesn't seem to identify what can be parried and what can't be, and since all jacket categories have different parry windows, it's hard to tell when you're supposed to parry. Like, ""turn your jacket sleeves into two wolf things and have both bite forward"" is one of the parries and no, the parry window isn't when they bite, the parry window is somewhere between the bite and the transformation.
10. I haven't gotten far enough for it, but literally everyone complains about a series of maps of never-ending white castles that you have to explore like a giant maze, and I hear it's completely awful.

Still, even acknowledging this is probably not my kind of game, every aspect of this trash heap was fumbled.
the voice acting is horrible, the plot and script are even worse, the environments are ugly and forgettable, there are constant cutscenes, and the combat - that's all you have left if the plot and the visuals are bad, right? - handles like trash. it's also chock full of the worst things from dark souls 1, including stuff that was cut from later games. Watching your character slipping off the map into one of the game's ubiquitous pits during a dash attack and having to backtrack through the entire level all over again because of it is not fun. Watching an enemy fly the wrong way after you successfully dash attacked them and magically end up in that same pit defies logic.
the pc port clearly had no playtesting, because the keybindings are unplayable. You need a hand on the mouse and another on the movement keys (WASD) in order to play, but in order to access items or gifts (which is evidently a huge part of the gameplay) you need to take your hand OFF your mouse and use the arrow keys. Look, you can't do this during a fight. If a game offers keyboard support, I expect the default keybindings to be at least workable.
the 'unique' parts of the game, the stuff that sets it apart from a FromSoft game, are mistakes. the enemies are evidently supposed to be scary, but in practice they're just ugly and goofy looking. It being bandai namco, and seeing the tags, i expected there to be this on some level, but ALL the chicks are wearing super sexy outfits. If it was here or there I'd be like, fine. cool. Nice! but it's literally everywhere, and the outfits are so ugly. And EVERYTHING clips with the character models. the game vaunts its character designer and its photo mode, but the character designer only has a couple things to play with, like the accessories, and while you can move things around the model, you're just going to get clipping. photo mode handles terribly. You get all these pointless poses and filters, but basic things like camera handling and 360 degree motion around the character is missing.
This had high reviews, was on summer sale and was recommended to me. But it looks and controls like playing a ps2 era game with a nude mod. don't get this unless it's literally for free, even if you like the sexy characters. You'll play it for an hour tops.

I am 38.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

According to FromSoftware, wandering around for hours getting your face caved in and having no idea what is going on is fun. 

I would disagree.

The good news is this game seems to do everything FromSoftware can’t:
1.	There is a little tutorial at the beginning of the game, and you can access it at any time if for say you haven’t played the game in a while.
2.	Unlike what happened to me in Dark Souls 3 where I failed to pick up the mana bottle, such stupid things aren’t in this game.
3.	Has a clear path on how to get through the game, although some of maps can be kind of confusing to navigate, I didn’t find it too hard to get around. When I did get stuck, I could eventually get unstuck by looking at the map. There is also a map in your main base that always has the current objective on it, so it is somewhat easy to figure out where you need to be.
4.	Sure, I got my face caved in several times. There are some frustrating parts. However, I was able to always overcome the obstacles. I could beat most of the bosses in just a couple of tries. 
5.	I finished the game while intoxicated so most sober people should be able to finish it no problem.
6.	The story is pretty cool, and there is probably more story in the 1st hour than there is in the first 20 hours of Dark Souls 3.
7.	Big titty anime girls. Enough said. This alone is the singular reason to play the game.

The only real issues I ran into:
1.	I guess if you have a screen refresh rate over 60hz the elevators don’t work properly, or they take many minutes to activate after flipping the switch. The fix is to tab out and back into the game, which is really weird.
2.	Some bosses’ models would disappear after certain moves. I would be able to see their weapons and shields, but the model would be gone.
3.	Some times your AI companion is a mongloid and worse than useless.

All and all it’s a good game. Not the best thing I ever played but I did enjoy it none the less. It has made me want to play more games like this and made me realize that games like this can actually be fun.

Finally, a Souls-ish game I can enjoy looking at as much as I enjoy playing. And enjoy the visuals I did — the environments and especially the characters look great. The problem is that while Code Vein looks nice and nails the anime, it really, really disappoints in the gameplay department. And, simply put, that's why I just can't quire recommend it: The game just wasn't very fun to play.

Combat, the meat of a game like this, just feels... off. Player movement feels stiff, with too little ability to cancel animations and too much time spent locked in place when you do basically anything. And while overall attack speed may not be slow compared to Souls games, (hard to say for sure,) at the very least, it feels like your attack animations are far too often outpaced by the speed of enemy attack animations. Like, it's very possible for enemies to initiate attacks AFTER you start an attack and still hit you before your attack hits them. And of course, enemy attacks are soooo much more likely to cause you to stagger than the other way around, and the time it takes to recover from a stagger is very, very consistently just .1 second longer than the time it takes an enemy's next combo attack to hit you, so enjoy eating entire combos whenever you mess up, because enemies in Code Vein love multi-attack strings. And if you have multiple enemies attacking at once, (with their combo attacks ghosting through each other like they don't exist of course, a problem this game shares with the Souls games,) then enjoy likely getting stunlock combo'd to death. In Dark Souls you could probably panic roll out as long as you have stamina, but thanks to Code Vein's stiff controls, that isn't even an option, stamina management won't save you. On top of all that, enemies consistently have longer (and potentially also wider) range to their attacks than it feels like they should have, so expect to get hit when it seems like you should backed off enough until you learn to compensate with extra distance during the traditional combat dance.

And f all those motion and animation issues weren't enough, the camera system makes combat even worse still by being locked too close and/or being locked to an overly narrow field of view. This limitation in total visibility, combined with a lot of common monsters and most bosses being large if not huge, means that at melee range, you probably can't even clearly see the entire monster you're fighting, and therefor can't read its animations properly to optimally anticipate what it's doing. In a more mindless hack and slash combat experience that wouldn't be as much of a problem, but when the design expects you to survive by avoiding most damage through skillful dodging and blocking rather than facetanking, lack of enemy readability is very not cool.

Beyond combat, there are environments to explore, of course, and this game drops the ball there too. Sure, the environments do looks nice, but the actual layouts are always, always, nothing but repetitive narrow twisting hallways. Narrow twisting caves, narrow twisting crumbling city streets, narrow twisting dried up seabed, the only real question is if the narrow path is defined by walls or death falls. Granted, Souls game were kinda weak in this regard too, but even they had somewhat more interesting layouts and shape variety to their environments. And sometimes Code Vein decides to be extra obnoxious by combining narrow paths that all look the same with twisting, multi-level maze layouts that the completely 2d in-game map is almost no help for. Seriously, how anybody thought the Cathedral was a fun or good addition to the experience makes no sense to me, it's a confusing miserable slog of identical walkways that never gets easier to make sense of even the third time through.

So yeah, as far as actual gameplay goes, Code Vein is a less fun, poorly designed version of Dark Souls where it feels like you fail due to bad design rather than your own mistakes. with bland at best, confusing at worst environmental design. Weapon variety is lacking, since weapons of the same type all have nearly identical move sets. The game has elemental weaknesses and different attack types, but aside from ""ice dude is weak to fire,"" there's no clear logic to what is strong or weak to what. Just pick whatever or check online. And while partners are nice in terms of storytelling and making you feel like the rest of the cast actually exists, highly inconsistent partner AI can both be annoying when they're randomly useless and rob you or a feeling of accomplishment when they suddenly decide to kick some butt. The one thing I think Code Vein does better is its magic system, which allows your magic to recharge through combat rather than being limited to a locked amount of uses that only resets at rest points. Personally, I feel like spells either should have been cheaper or you should have been able to regenerate Code Vein's version of MP faster, but still, just about anything is better than the way Souls games typically dole out magic use. I actually used magic in this game for a change.

Also, and maybe this is a very personally specific problem, the game has something like 90 passive abilities and only lets you use 4 of them at once. Even after factoring in that like, half are pretty lame or way too situational, that is still a horrible ratio of total abilities available to total actually usable at any given time. It really grinds my gears when games let you mix and match abilities like that, but only like 4% of your total options at a time. Unlocking new abilities is way less fun when you're already sitting on a pile of dozens of other already unlocked options you already didn't have room to equip. Mastering new Blood Codes would be so much cooler if they somehow could add additional slots instead of just more ability options to the unused pile.

So yeah, Anime Souls is a great anime experience, I strongly compliment the visual design. The artists definitely did their job and did it well. I just wish the game were even half as enjoyable to play as Io or my custom waifu player character were to look at. (Which reminds me, the character creator is pretty good too.) Otherwise, the gameplay itself is just not enough fun for me to wholeheartedly recommend, despite how much I really and truly do wish more success for games with basically any stylized art direction these days. I am so sick of the generic realism most all modern games with any budget go for otherwise. Why did you have to screw up the gameplay so badly, Bamco? Code Vein had the anime styling and was a real game rather than just a visual novel or something. It could and should have been so much greater.",1688646574,1688646574,False,6,2,0.461773127317428589,0,True,False,False

Otherwise another banger made by Bandai Namco, I really like how me and my bro overcome many dangers and tribulation together though like Elden Ring, he is the better player around.

This game is hard, but fair. Checkpoint isn't a going to be a guess work, but it really make you work for it. Weapon scaling is unbalance as heck, causing certain weapon to be more meta build like the blade polearm that use sweep attack. Making aggressive inchor attack more flashy and utility than just using weak and strong attack, a lot of enemies can teleport, which is pain to deal with, luckily the coop aspect make the journey is pleasant difficult rather than just horrendous.

The in game story is what i really enjoy, it tells a cohesive and intrigue story despite pack with anime action, this is also the very first game where Shift make your choice of gameplay having consequences to the overall plot, lore and ending, which to me really a big shift of how I view Japanese anime games. where you can actually get the bad ending. It felt like you are part of a anime where you are a person in that world with others. The cutscene replay really makes the experience great despite you barely spoke anything in the entire game, you are still relevant in the in game plot. I enjoyed the English dub as they are overall a pleasant experience, I will probably play it again in the original Japanese audio.

Bandai Namco made a really good anime souls like here, i am no big fan of Souls like but the fact Swift made God Eater 1,2 and then greatly expand their anime game design expertise in this, they came a long way. Above that they really made a very good PC Online Coop game where the limitation is just the loading screen and the fact your coop partner cannot re-explore areas after the boss is beaten, otherwise it is another real banger made by Swift under Bandai Namco, I clearly underestimated they are a force to be reckon with in the gaming world.",1688406390,1688580940,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

There is an actual story that takes place and is discussed in game.
There are cutscenes and memories to go through that discuss what actually happens in the story.
The characters are with you in a town and will go alongside you , chat, or you can leave them behind to solo maps/bosses. It is your choice.
The game has good art and sound design.
The character builder is far better than most of the Souls/Bourne games as you can place items on a person and use an editor to specifically place things on your person. You can change them in-game without a fee or some B.S. You get a lot of freedom to make your character.
The Parry system is simple and is based on your armor rather than your weapon, so learning the timings is pretty neat.
There are some difficult bosses and normal bosses that don't make you wanna tear your hair out.
The game allows for coop, which is persistent for the area until you beat the boss. You get plenty of time to run around ""dungeons"" to level grind for souls if you need to and a sauna to replenish some of your souls when you die. 
You get the nice addition of being able to choose from a variety of weapons and can imbue them with status effects. This is pretty good as you can have multiple elements of the same weapon. You can buy the item for imbuing by  speaking to your party members or people in ""base"" and give them gifts. They give you a weapon or some special item which helps you out. You can do a lot with this. 
There are some challenge things in the DLC, which are cool, and reward you in game for completing tasks.  This got a lot of flak as they really were just one level and a bunch of stuff to earn behind a  hard boss. 
You can put on a maximum of 8 active skills to use, which cost your ICHOR. Your MP/ICHOR bar is increased every map by using specific skills, backstabs, counters, or items. Your profile, like hunter, scout, queen, whatever, have different build stats as well as your armors. This will count towards ICHOR capacity, defenses against damage types, movement speed, and your counter type, etc. This is different than Dark Souls, Elden Ring, and NIOH where every piece of equipment matters in that regard and you stat min/max. This game just levels you up and that scales with your armor/profile. That's about it.  Pretty simple and hands off for you so you can just play your game. 
You get to make some choices in the game and do specific things that change the outcome/ending. So, it is a choice. I won't spoil that. 
Each character you take with you can help you out in combat different ways. Buffs, heals when you're dying or k.o.'ed for a revive, etc. It also doesn't feel as empty of a game. Revisit some areas and other people appear. There is a pretty detailed map that are unlocked by mistles and stuff. There is a very ""annor londo"" like place that's nuts. There are ambushes in the game. This is a game where you can take your time and it doesn't have to feel super high octane. The boss fights are , of course, a pace you have to follow and learn the attack patterns of, but that's because they're boss fights. It is expected. 
The graphics in this game are great. 
Sound design is nice and weapons/guns don't sound or feel weak.
This is called Anime Souls on the internet a lot for a reason. It is over the top. Yup. 
The lore building in this game is there and told to you as much as it is environmental, a huge step up from Souls where everyone talks to you like they're going to speak in half-riddles or make little sense purposefully . You're playing an anime. You watch people's memories and last moments, whether they are party members or people in the environment who have fallen (and you get their Blood Code). You can skip them too, which is always good. For people who want their meat, they can have it. For the people who skip, they can skip. Everyone's happy. 
Finally, battle is simple and familiar to people of the genre. Blocking doesn't always fully block all damage. Dodging is big. Perfect Dodging gives you a bar which fills up being in ""focus mode"", which allows you to strike back harder. This game is fully playable mouse+keyboard or controller. I've done both. Lock on is easy to use, as the genre does. Most weapons are viable. There are some end-game builds that are just ""the best"", which is designed to really help you for NG+ and bosses, among my favorites are HADES and QUEEN. So, grab a friend, slash, shoot, and drain the blood of people. Also, there is a world out there, which you see some part of, but.....  :) 

Waiting for Code Vein 2 8/10 Will  Play Again.
Since Wo Long is busted whenever I try to play online, when I get invaded, etc, it really sucks to play online, which is part of the charm.

Art/Character design: Excellent. Love the style.

BGM: Great, immersive, and thrilling.

Story: Excellent. Furthermore, each characters' story line adds weight to their own right, making them equally important as the main protagonist. The way the story is being told has its own merits. Not much of a twist in the story, but it went straight to the point without drags and delays. Though I wished there was more side quests to the side characters (or more interactions with them such as recruiting them as Partners) so we get to know them more.

Combat: Acceptable.

Bloodcode system: Unique, fun, and creative. Really loved the customisation you can do with it.

Dungeon design: Good in overall, but can be better because it is quite linear so there isn't much complexity to it. Though I wished the depths can drop more upgrade materials when we farm the bosses so we can play around with the customisation more (without spending so much time on the farming itself, which can be quite demoralising and repetitive).

Monster Design: Unfortunately, bad, as they are repetitive and just a re-skin of the same model.

Difficulty Design: Not good, because the real difficulty comes from the game pouring you with lots of monsters all at once. Not a great idea to increase the difficulty by using numbers.

Overall: Highly recommended to play this game for its Story, Character design, and Art Style. If these points are what you're looking for, then this would be your cup of tea. Probably not the game for veteran players of Soul series or Elden Ring (as it would be like a cheap version of the two from their perspective). A game worth getting and playing.

The character creation is great and has a lot to offer, but still seems to miss some marks in my opinion. (i.e no breast slider, no height change, clothing options limited and more than half are unappealing to me). The fighting is kind of solid but still feels either too easy with AI cpu's or too hard at points without (but with souls-like games its always diligence being key). Could take more time to get really into it, but I feel that within this 10 hour mark, I may have seen most all of everything.

Having the blood veils (body armor) be covering up a majority of my created costume and accessories was plain dumb; should of have the option to hide. Had to mod out game to be playable. If I had gotten this game on ps4 or something, would have returned on this point, along with the other gripes. Like was the reason I made all my little choices on my character for no reason? like why can't we change the color of our blood veils? As an anime inspired game, and me being a anime enthusiast (love ecchi, harem, action, comedy stuff, kill me), and aesthetics are a huuuuuuuuge part in an anime lovers life, period.
 
Also the combat system of changing classes and abilities feels too simple in a way where every class begins to feel like the other. My character feels like a puppet of classes, rather than a beefed up powerhouse with nice toys.

EDIT:
Trying to play it again and saying eff it and have the cpu/ai tag along, makes game go faster and it might still be fun to imagine this game as a dark souls game but easier that also plays like a anime rpg game with a party.

I still somehow just don't feel heavily drawn to the game. One aspect is that with the anime theme, the world seems hella bland, dark dreary typical dark souls vibe. Hella typical story with everyone being ""already dead"" hoping to somehow be alive or something; like it would have been cool to have a fleshed out vibrant anime world and combat system that feels tough like dark souls. (but alas, I did not make this game, makers choice).

first off if your coming from soulsborne your gonna notice the games combat feels alittle Floaty, it lacks the weight and deliberate impact souls has and sometimes feels like it doesnt control as fluidly.

for those who enjoy deep character building, youll likely have mixed feelings about this, instead of leveling individual attributes like souls does, you will instead swap between a variety of preset stat distributions called Blood codes, having a specific blood code will disctate weight, Strength and dex scaling and the abilities you start out with among other things. however as you get deeper into the game you will be able to mix and match abilities from different blood codes in order to give your build a greater degree of personality. 

the level design can be atrocious, some areas are either increadibly maze like, and everything can look the same at times, often resulting in you getting lost. couple that with unfair enemy placement and you might take issue with exploration.

The game was balanced around the prospect that you will have an NPC companion with you at all times, as a result playing the game solo can feel unnessecarily punishing at times. 

the Game has multiple endings and asa result of a a few above things its easy to lock yourself out of the ending you want if you dont know what your doing.

if you are to look past this however there are upsides. 

this game has a very deep character creator, those creative enough can make no shortage of OCs or anime characters,  and you may spend hours just messing around with what the creator has to offer. 

the game has a simple but well done story that is carried by its cast of memorable characters, and each of said characters have a story in themselves to delve into. 

the OST is amazing, with many memorable tracks that i personally have saved so i may enjoy them whenever i have time. 

graphically this is a beautiful game with a variety of pretty set pieces to look at. 

all in all this journey is one worth taking, and one that can stick with you long after its put down. 8.5/10",1688190373,1688190373,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I replayed this game many many times with quite a few friends I myself pushed into trying this with me. The coop in this game is phenomenal as it let's you play together from start to finish almost flawlessly and even if you don't have friends to play with dw, you still have an Ai partner that's a really good stand-in (sometimes better than your friends ehm...).

The combat itself is not the smoothest in the business, but the story and the characters more than make up for it. The character editor on the other hand is probably one of the best anime character editors I've seen yet. And speaking of graphics, playing this game really feels like being in an anime, with awesome visual effects, character models, environments and music.

The build variety and the amount of playstyles is also one of the strong suites of this game. You wanna be a teleporting guy with a katana? Or a Hulk with a giant greatsword that throws blood slashes? Or wanna keep your distance and cast spells and shoot from a gun? Well you came to the right game, everything is perfectly viable and hella fun to play.

Even if you are not the biggest Souls-like fan I'd still recommend buying this just for the story itself, you won't be disappointed. And if you are a Souls-like tryhard and an Ai companion or a friend sounds too easy, dw you can still turn them off and bash your head against the wall solo.

I know it's not a perfect game by any means, but for me it has everything it needs to have and much much more.",1687883221,1687883221,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you want something to scratch the itches of FromSoft games, go buy Nioh 2 or MonHun instead, much better combat, faster pacing, more depth and actually feels good when you hit something.

As much as I love third person melee combat games, I can not enjoy this game. Small FOV, tight corridor fights (Nioh don't even feel this bad), big weapons obstruct your view, parry feels clunky, stiff animations, I felt no weight when I hit the enemy, all weapons are big and long but their first attack has no forward momentum,  your character doesn't move much when you attack so it feels like you're stuck in one place once you hit the attack button.
I only fought 2 bosses and they felt so boring to fight, only few move sets and all I can do was hit one or two then run, nothing to memorize. The only thing ""souls-like"" about this game is enemies can kill you in few hits, the combat and boss fights does not feel as good as a soul game.

Edit: After 6 months I decided to give this game one last try. After playing more action games this game feel even worse, the animations are so stiff and janky, there's no satisfaction in killing enemies, it's like hitting a piece of tofu, your weapon just go straight through them with little to no impact. I'm not even try to compare this game with other games at this point, I went in with an open mind trying to find more games with good combat but this game is so disappointed coming from Bandai, if this were an indie game then I could forgive the stiffness but no, it's freaking Bandai, they made countless games before this, Lies of P demo felt better than this and it's their first souls-like game.

This game does some things right, but so many wrong that I don't think I can recommend playing this game, unless you are into dress-up games, because the character customization is actually pretty solid in this game. Or maybe if you have played God Eater, since it seems to be connected (I don't know, haven't played that yet). Keep in mind that I have played this game 100% solo and that this review contains a few gameplay spoilers, but no story spoilers whatsoever.

So, I'll start with the positives aspects and end with the negative ones. Here goes:

(+) Alright story. I only finished it, because I was actually interested in how it ends and it has multiple outcomes in the middle and at the end of the story, which I find really neat.

(+) Trying different builds is super easy. Since you don't invest any points into stats when leveling and instead choose your ""blood code"", switching build and playstyle is as easy as pressing a button. And new weapons you find usually are already upgraded, so you can try them right away (why Elden Ring couldn't do the same is mind boggling to me).

(+) The Soundtrack is surprisingly good, I really liked it.

(+) Good character customization options.


(-) The enemy variety is abysmal. From the top of my head I can think of 6 different enemies, which get slightly changed both visually and gameplay wise throughout the game. Enemies being recycled doesn't have to be a bad thing, but not bringing in completely new enemies from time to time makes it so imo.

(-) My most sincere fck you goes out to the level designer, who littered the game full with those ""haha, gotcha!"" moments.
You didn't look where you were going for two seconds? Woops! The ground you were on was actually instable :P
Enjoy walking all the way back x3
Additionally we have enemies surprise attacking you constantly and barely visible spike traps in the walls near the end. And my personal nemesis: the cathedral. You will spend half of your playtime just trying to figure out where the fck you're supposed to go and even if you do, it just drags on while you keep seeing the exact same assets over and over again. I will gladly do a hitless Iron Keep run in DS2 before playing through this area again >:(

(-) Build variety seemed very lame, to me at least, but to be fair I didn't really understand how you make a proper build in this game, so I can't say much to that x)

(-) Except for one boss, which I actually somewhat enjoyed despite him feeling kinda unfair at times, the boss difficulty only ranged from dumb-easy to slightly challenging.

(-) From my experience, enemies and bosses randomly change aggro without any reason, so playing a tank build and having your partner be a ranged support is not really viable. And it's just annoying in general. You think it's safe to heal and boom- boss jumped you :P

(-) Bonus: Did they have to give almost every single female character the largest chest I've ever seen in a video game, I don't want to feel like a loser playing this game xd


So, should you play this game?

Give it a try, if you..
• enjoy anime women with big tiddies (spoken in Niko Bellic's voice)
• played God Eater, maybe?
• really like soulsborne games and just need more to satisfy that itch, even if it has to be with mediocre games

Don't give it a try, if you..
• are an average soulsborne fan and are looking for more, good souls-likes


In the end, that's my opinion and if you think the gameplay looked interesting enough to you, then feel free to try it out :)
There are a good amount of fans of this game, so you might just become one of them :3

While it doesn't reach the same level of excellence as Dark Souls, it stands out in its own way by introducing new ideas. Departing from the traditional stat point allocation system, CODE VEIN introduces blood codes that can be changed at will. Each blood code comes with predetermined stat distributions and offers gifts reminiscent of the miracles and sorcery found in Dark Souls. These gifts are further divided into two types: Passive and Active, which can be mastered and utilized across different blood codes, enhancing the player's versatility.

The gameplay experience in CODE VEIN mirrors the challenging nature of Dark Souls. The captivating soundtrack, coupled with a engaging story and well-crafted characters, creates an immersive environment that will particularly resonate with anime enthusiasts. However, the level design is a mixed bag, with some areas reminiscent of the intricately interconnected paths found in Dark Souls, while others prove to be poorly conceived and cumbersome to explore.

The cooperative play in CODE VEIN is a truly captivating experience, granting you the opportunity to traverse its world alongside a friend. Bearing similarities to the mechanics found in Dark Souls, the cooperative aspect employs a unique twist. Instead of conventional summon signs, players communicate through signals, allowing a friend to search and seamlessly join forces in your journey.

Unfortunately, I had a disappointing experience during my playthrough. I didn't receive the preorder exclusive blood veil, Venous Claw, that was supposed to be available in the deluxe edition. This omission of in-game items feels unfair and takes away from an otherwise great experience.

Despite its shortcomings, CODE VEIN remains an exceptional souls-like experience, highly recommended for fans of the genre. Its unique blend of anime aesthetics, compelling gameplay mechanics, and engaging narrative make it a worthwhile venture. I highly recommend CODE VEIN if you're looking for a solo or cooperative souls-like game.

[h1] Combat [/h1]
While the combat is more less the same, the enemies feel different. Most of the level enemies feel like they ended up in the wrong game. What I mean is they are too slow for this game. You can just run up to them, walk around them and backstab them without them doing anything. Boss fights are in theory the same as in DS just dodge until you have an opportunity to attack. I do not think the combat is bad tho, it is just less challenging (at least at the beggining), which makes the game easier to pick up for new players. Although most likely due to the speed of the enemies their damage can be pretty high.

Some enemies have really wierd backstab hitboxes or hitboxes overal (except for the DLC this only happened with purple hollow enemies). Some enemies get backstabbed when you attack from behind their right soulder and some enemies like Boreal Brutes have incredibly small backstab window.

In this game you can be accompanied by an NPC character of your choice (some can enter combat / are found later in the story). You can choose to progress solo but it makes the game way harder especially during some gank fights like invasions or even Ornstein and Smough enhanced. Or you can alternatively play in coop which I did not get the chance to test since I was unable to find coop game when I tried (I was mainly playing the game during late night).

I love blood code system in this game. You do not invest points from level ups in this game. Instead you only gain HP and stamina and stats are redistributed according to your blood code. You can switch blood codes anytime you like (your HP and “mana“ stays the same if the new value is higher or is dropped down to the new cap) making the gampelay more interesting. If you play with a blood code you can always equip Gifts in that codes tree and other Gifts that you have stats to use. Gifts are mastered by you having them in hotbar while beating enemies (later blood codes need higher amount of haze (souls) collected). There are basically 5 types of Gifts: passive, magic, defensive, supportive and physical. You can have up to 4 passive Gifts and they do not have stat requirements so you can basically turn your warrior into mage if you would like. Physical gifts are something like weapon arts although you can use more than one making every weapon good for any type of combat basically.

Mana system in this game is in my opinion very well executed. Your code has predetermined how much maximum “mana“ it has and that is with how much you start from the checkpoint. You can increase this number by either parrying or backstabing enemies and you can refill it by damaging enemies with your weapon (light, heavy and drain attacks only, physical gifts do not count).

[h1] Story [/h1]
This game actually has a story unlike DS. It is post apocalyptic JRPG, so it is what you would expect (or at least I think you would). But the story makes clearing the game meaningful and definitely more enjoyable.

Cutscenes were really nice but pretty long. Before I actually got to move there was like 20 mins of cutscenes to get you into the story. I did not like it at first but I later realized that this game is gonna differ from DS in this aspect [b] a lot [/b].

One thing that made me kind of mad was that the MC said 2 sentences throughout the whole story and that was before the final boss fight. I would not mind if they just used one female and one male voice for the whole dubbing thing. But your character stupidly staring at someone instead of answering their question was awkward.

[h1] Characters and character creation [/h1]
I love character creation in this game. I did not want to make my character look fancy or anything because I bought the game mainly for the gameplay but man... this character creation is awesome. I managed to spend like 20 minutes there.

Each revenant character at your base has some kind of backstory which can be uncovered by collecting Vestiges and giving them to your “guardian“. The problem here is that there is just so many of these that after 3 of them I just started skipping what was in them because they are not well made. Instead of a cutscene or something you are thrown into a black and white world with statues talking, where you are walking super slowly so you accidentally do not run too far (not that you can...). After each related to some character you get the characters thoughts on that memory of theirs which was enough for me and I got the vague idea what was going on.

[h1] Bosses [/h1]

As I said before, Code Vein does not bring as much of challenging contet as Dark Souls. But some of the bosses could very well rival bosses like Nameless King, Ornstein and Smough, Fume Knight in their difficulty even when fighting alongside a partner. I myself have been doing pretty fine until I met Blade Bearer and Cannoneer (aka Ornstein and Smough enhanced). This boss was pretty rough but it was manageable thanks to the companion. But Juzo Mido, the main baddie, who came after that was a bit too much for me. I have spent like 1,5 hour trying to beat him until I somehow luckily managed to beat him. That being said I am probably not gonna try plaing without companion any time soon because I am not prepared to spend 3 hours doing OnS with higher difficulty.

[h1] Depths [/h1]
What is Depths? Depths is a content that is not a part of the story but is a place where you can find some bosses you fought previously, but only if you can beat challenges set by the game.

Overal Depths is a pretty easy contet except for 2 maps. One contains 2 Boreal Brutes [u] as a mini boss [/u], yes as a mini boss. So yeah I spent like 50 minutes on this location while 40 minutes were spent on this mini boss.
The other contains enhanced Cannoneer and Blade Bearer. [spoiler] Enhanced in a way that if one dies the other one buffs themselve [/spoiler].

Then there is Tower of Trials which for some reason does not count towrds achievement goal of exploring the entirety of Depths. Each tower of trials has 6 floors where 1st and 4th are some enemies that you can see ahead of entering the floor, 2nd a 5th are invasions and 3rd and 6th are boss floors. There is no checkpoint anywhere but you get healing a “mana“ reset after defeating the first boss. You can also get some healing stuff from beatin other floors, but it is only 1 per floor if it drops.

[h1] Overal [/h1]
[b] Pros [/b]
+ Blood codes
+ Character creation
+ Nice graphics, be it characters, enemies or locations (with a small exception)
+ Decent story
+ Interesting bossfights
+ Has a map
+ 4 types of ripostes / backstabs according to the veil you have equiped (although riposte and backstab with same veil look the same)
+ You can swap between 2 weapons while only the current one counts towards the weight limit
+ Quick dodge is a dash, not a strage flip like in DS1

[b] Cons [/b]
- I feel like it has lower replayability than DS due to the story focus
- Pretty short, has around 30h of story if you are average player
- The end of the story feels really rushed. There are two bossfights right after each other with final 4 bosses, meaning there are only 3 areas to clear while fighting 5 bosses and one of them should not even be a boss [spoiler] I am not counting The Virgin Born as a single boss since it is just trasnformed Skull King [/spoiler]
- One map is just awful to play, it only has white textures and looks the same everywhere [spoiler] You guessed it, it is Anor Londo reskin aka Cathedral of Sacred Blood [/spoiler]

Overal while I really like the game I feel like 50€ for it, is a bit too much. So I recommend waiting for a sale if you are still interested in purchasing it.

[h1] DLCs [/h1]
Are pretty bad. 1 boss, 2 new blood codes, 4 companion costumes for 2 characters, 3 weapons and veils (reskins with different stats) and some tattoos. Hellifre Knight is a good boss, other 2 suck. Blood codes are decent. Worth 10€ at most.

You can play with friends or with strangers online on co-op and defeat monsters together. It's great, but it's quite confusing. One of the main issues I faced in this game is not really knowing what to do, the guide/tutorial in this game is very short and lacking, and sometimes I had to go back to YouTube to understand what I was even supposed to do in this game. I'm still stuck, which is why I'm unable to progress. And that's why the rating to me, is not as high.

Fantastic art, sceneries, character designs and voice acting. I know a lot of people like making their own character, and its one of the best character customization games on the market, so I do recommend it! The theme of the game is very cool too (something you can see on the trailer).
For an NPC interactive game though, i'd say it feels a little lonely, compared to other games where I'm able to feel the characters personality, this game lacks in that aspect.
You also don't need high specs to run this game, my computer is on the lower end and I still am able to run it on medium to high graphics with no lag and no issues whatsoever.

There's a lot of just, taking soulslike ideas and executing them poorly across the board, with any of its ideas on how to shift the formula around a bit continuously resulting in a worse time on the whole. The worst offender of this is the entire game being designed around having a companion to fight with you, with the encounters being crafted with this in mind. It essentially makes almost every encounter feel like it boils down to just correctly drawing aggro and maybe occasionally dodging as well I guess, since unless you're fighting something really big and bulky, you basically never have to learn anything about it, it's just a dumb punching bag that gets stunlocked to death. 

This reliance on the companion also makes the boss fights fall into a similar category where you only really need to vaguely learn the basics and you'll be good, being able to easily fall back and also deal insane amounts of damage at a time when you both run in simultaneously. It just feels like the game never fully is invested in the idea of you fully learning it, or at least, there are just a lot of mechanics and bits of design that discourage playing it in such a way. The level design in particular was utterly miserable, with the highlights in the first 5 areas or so just coming across as ok at best, while also being put alongside a comically large swamp and the video game equivalent of white room torture that also happens to be in a horrendous labyrinth. The latter feels especially awful to me because of how cheap it looks, everything just being copy pasted white patterned textures as far as the eye can see, not really evoking and sense of atmosphere as much as it evokes the feeling of someone opening up the Unreal Engine for the first time and just messing around.

While I just said that the level design was where this game felt the worst, the writing is near-equally as soul draining. Everything is so verbose, people just endlessly repeating the same boring nonsense and putting you in cutscenes for an agonisingly long time as it's laying out a plot that felt expertly crafted to make anyone hate anime. Nobody shuts up at any point in time either, making it yet another reason why the game being structured around companions sucks, because they never stop talking and incessantly comment on everything, even opening your menu. Horrible experience that felt like purgatory while playing, the game peaked at the character customisation.

Code Vein is a light Souls-like with an anime dressing with all these tropes and stereotypes that I hate.

Visually pleasing, the game fall short with his story not engaging enough to carry me to the end. it's basically plotless, for where I was in the story, you're just the savior that has a power to recover memories of people in a devasted world, that's it, you just wander from levels to levels with no real objectives ( or I missed it ).

Gameplay wise, it's basically a Dark souls copy but it's well made.

My main gripe with the game is the character evolution, I chose to play a Str build as I always do in RPG and not even mid game I was done with it, stuff and stats, all I I was left to do was leveling. I found myself cruising thru the game, no more challenge.

The dev tried to copy map designs from souls game, but instead they made a horrible flat map with minimal vertical design. In most souls like game, when we open a short-cut, we usually got amazed about how the maps are connected together. However, this game ong, its a pain in the ass to find the short-cut that doesn't even do a thing, why would i need a short cut to the spawn point where i can just teleport.
2. Boss design level are horrible, in other souls like game, such as darksouls and sekiro, bosses gradually become harder in most situation. Specially in sekiro, before the big boss, there are mini bosses that have some similar ability for us to practice and get used to the combat. In souls like games its the player who become better, we always improve something when everytime we die to an enemy. However, in code vein, the boss's moves are mostly the same and there are even some re-skin boss with exact same movement, players usually just have to out level them by grinding the area.
3. The goofy a$$ combat is probably witcher 1 level or even worth. Its more like an hack and slash game except when encountering boss fight.

Use partners, use Gifts (skills), and don't rely on backstabs too much. The grind isn't too bad once you find areas that net you a bunch of Haze (Souls). Story is your typical anime trope and characters are linear. 

A nitpicks are 1/3 of the level design is literally lo(ooooo)ng hallways and bridges filled with texture maps. The endgame options are pretty fair (new game+ allows you to fallback on your decision in case it's too hard). 

The biggest negative is the 3 DLCs for the Season Pass. The dungeons seemed rushed and the rewards mediocre. My only positive was the Hellknight fight was fair and fun (for me). Frozen Empress was a joke. Lord of Thunder was only extremely annoying if you try and go for the Trail Rewards (30 hit combo w/o taking damage was hell), otherwise his fight was alright.

It looks actually quite good for an anime adaptation and i'm expecting like Anime style combat or something so why does it feel like i'm playing 1999 Runescape with the slow-ass combat and terrible pacing? It feels as though it's made for a toddler, not someone who wants to play something with a bit more speed behind each swing of their attacks.

First of all, the top-notch voice acting, particularly from the Japanese voice actors and actresses. It truly enhances the immersive my experience and I feel that every character has their own individual. As always.

The story follows a typical anime-style narrative, where someone aims to become a hero with their 'nakama'. As always, some of female characters are on dual mission: fighting monsters and pushing dress code boundaries!  Well, keep it aside from now. There are bits of the storytelling that aren't explained well and might come across as odd (or maybe I miss it), but overall, I still keep invested on the game. While the pace of the story feels just about right, the 'good' ending doesn't quite satiate my thirst for well-rounded conclusion (yes, it has multiple endings). I wonder, though, if it's just me or if others also share this sentiment. Despite this, from a writing perspective, each ending is really well written. The art and animation are a feast for the eyes, precisely what you'd expect from ufotable. The gameplay is somewhat akin to less intense, anime-style Dark Souls; it's manageable as long as you don't blame your finger for any misclick though. Still, this game beats dark soul on the FEELS department. 

Let's talk about the best part. The soundtracks are truly well done, especially ""Memory of the Lost"". This haunting melody that resonates while traversing the memories in the vestige sends shivers down my spine every single time! And the way the game melds each vestige memory with this captivating soundtrack leaves me utterly speechless. A total masterpiece!

However, when it comes to the map levels, it's a bit unbalance from my perspective. Some maps have intuitive layout, but others are overly-excessively complicated. The Cathedral of Sacred Blood map takes the crown for complexity.  I mean, I wonder the developer had discussion about how to torture the players without player realizing about it. :') You can search for it if you want with this keyword 'Cathedral Code Vein meme'.

Overall, I recommend this game to anyone who doesn't mind inviting the onion ninjas over from time to time while slashing monster.",1685200079,1685201532,True,4,0,0.565658867359161377,0,True,False,False

If you read that and think you'll like this, then you will.

I have three main problems with the game, though. First and most importantly, multiplayer is a bit clunky. I don't see why there is a restriction on it - you can only play multiplayer in an area up until the area's main boss is defeated, but I don't see any good reason for this. Second, the game maps are 2D top-down maps, but the areas feature constant changes in elevation and the map does a horrible job of showing that and it can be very confusing. Third and final, every single outfit in this game WILL clip through your character's hair, including the gas masks that are required for 3/4 of the game. Noticeable in gameplay, and REALLY noticeable in cutscenes where the characters are shown up close. It's even obvious on the other characters, whose hair ALWAYS clips through these dang gas masks.

Multiplayer was a hit or miss with the people who you would find to help you, but still good game. 
Visuals were nice except for sometimes some objects (Hair, tails, etc.) would go through other objects. (EX. One character hugged a younger character, but the first characters hair was so long that it went through the younger characters body.)
Gameplay is great and I got super addicted right when I started playing. (Not good during finals week).

It is nowhere near as challenging, however; though there is plenty of depth to be found in the native weapon system.  The anime style is the real draw here; as it confidently and successfully realises a unique style in the genre with some panache.  The game-play is far more linear than a typical souls game, but rather than detract from the format; it deepens its own individual identity while retaining key mechanics of the genre.
The narrative is as high a conceit as one might expect from an anime, but you're likely not coming here for the story.  The game is far more hack and slash than Souls - and less emphasis is placed on precise timing.  Controls are solid in attacks, and while not as satisfyingly visceral as a less cartoonish concept would allow; the control on movement within attack is very satisfying.  I do find the menu navigation is a little sluggish, but merely an observation rather than a complaint.  
Where the game shines for me is the simplistic nature of what it does extremely well - simple maps, rigidly straight forward and rewarding fast encounters.  Clearing an area is a dream for the completionist and obsessive compulsive gamer alike!
Overall, I am a huge fan of Code Vein for its style of gameplay - they also provide a free Demo here on Steam; try it - if you enjoy this experience, the game repeats that formula and scales the threat level for the rest of the game.",1684772120,1684772120,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In terms of story, It was okay i guess. The first boss of the game was kind of confusing. I never knew how the boss became the boss in the first place. The characters are introduced so fast and there are a lot of them.

So I started playing and discovered that the protagonist doesn't talk at all like the other characters (basically a complete mute) during most IF NOT ALL storyline scenes. The most you can expect are gestures and groans.
The movement animation during the gameplay is choppy as well. The combat doesn't feel souls like. It's too easy to be considered soulslike.

Set in a post-apocalyptic future, the game presents a desolate landscape filled with gothic architecture, eerie environments, and a sense of melancholic beauty. The art style and attention to detail create a captivating atmosphere that immerses players in its unique and mysterious setting.

The gameplay in Code Vein focuses on fast-paced and challenging combat. Players assume the role of a Revenant, a vampire-like being with supernatural powers. The combat mechanics are reminiscent of the ""Soulsborne"" games, requiring precision, timing, and tactical decision-making. Players must learn enemy attack patterns, dodge and parry effectively, and manage stamina to survive the intense battles.

Code Vein introduces a ""Blood Code"" system, which allows players to switch between different character classes or ""Gifts."" Each Blood Code grants unique abilities, such as magic spells or enhanced physical attacks, giving players flexibility in tailoring their playstyle. The game also features a companion system, where players can team up with an AI-controlled partner called an ""A.I. Buddy"" to assist in combat and provide support.

Another notable aspect of Code Vein is its deep character customization options. Players can create their own Revenant character, customizing various aspects such as appearance, gender, voice, and more. The extensive options for personalization allow players to create unique and diverse characters that suit their preferences.

The game's story is presented through a mix of cutscenes, dialogue, and exploration. While the narrative may not reach the heights of some other RPGs, it still offers an engaging and mysterious tale that unfolds as players progress through the game. Additionally, Code Vein features multiple endings, adding replayability and incentive for players to explore different story paths.

Overall, Code Vein offers an engaging and atmospheric action RPG experience. Its dark and visually stunning world, challenging combat, and deep character customization options make it a solid choice for fans of the ""Soulsborne"" genre. If you enjoy challenging gameplay, immersive environments, and a unique blend of vampire lore and post-apocalyptic settings, Code Vein is definitely worth considering.",1684615627,1684615627,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- enemies can't stunlock you to death if you stunlock them to death first

- dodge-rolling is cool, dodge-zooming with blue sparkles at your feet is cooler

- huge ass swords are comfy lol weapons for people like me who are too lazy to git gud

- cleavage-jiggle anime freakazoids with technicolor hair and glossy eyes the size of fists are significantly more tolerable when they heal you up to 80% at the verge of certain death; I appreciate this design decision

- with multiple enemies around, the lock-on exists mostly just to troll the player

- while the cathedral was obviously architectured by M.C. Escher, it's not quite as awful and confusing as I had expected; it looks like they forgot to texture it, though

- people might call the writing in this game anime cringe, but as someone not at all familiar with the tropes of this genre, I think the story and the characters are pretty cool so far, and the backstory to the world is honestly quite fascinating

- while the character creator is pretty extensive, it's a shame you can't be bald, because most of the hair options look like the protagonist has an additional, invisible companion following him around who's a hairdresser who carefully readjusts each and every single lock in between battles; it's also a challenge to create a male character that doesn't look like he skipped out on puberty

Code Vein is a thrilling action role-playing game that offers a unique blend of anime-inspired visuals and challenging gameplay. Set in a post-apocalyptic world, the game follows a group of Revenants, vampire-like beings, as they fight to survive and uncover the mysteries of their existence.

One of the standout features of Code Vein is its character customization system. Players have an extensive range of options to create their own Revenant, allowing for a high level of personalization and creativity. The attention to detail in the character designs is impressive, and the overall aesthetic of the game is visually stunning, with a dark and gothic atmosphere.

In terms of gameplay, Code Vein presents a satisfying combat experience. Players are equipped with a variety of weapons and blood-based abilities, which can be customized to suit different playstyles. The combat is fast-paced and requires strategic thinking, as well as well-timed dodges and attacks. It can be challenging at times, but the sense of accomplishment after defeating tough enemies or bosses is incredibly rewarding.",1684349834,1684349834,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have LOVED this one so far, combat is smooth as hell, might not be as refined as DS or some of the others, but overall it's very good. Awesome character customization as well, if you love making the perfect character you are going to lose a lot of time in the initial creation process like I did!

Before this my only experience with the genre were games that little people actually call ""a soulslike"". Those being Hollow Knight and Jedi Fallen Order. So my experience with the genre is next to none and as such YOU should take my opinion with a grain of salt.

So, what is appealing to me about this game and why in god's name am i even leaving a positive review about this otherwise relatively ""nothing"" game? 

Let's begin with the very first area of the game. You are dumped straight in after a short tutorial that leaves nothing in your head and some exposition cutscenes. You have no idea who you are, what you are doing and why do the women have such big boobs. Going through the first area was quite a challenge for me and i respawned about a dozen times before meeting up with louis. And damn i loved every single second of it. Pressing onwards i beat my first boss and stumbled upon the thing that made me consider getting the full game instead of the demo. The memory vesitges. I absolutely adore this approach to lore dumps and character exposition. The music, the visuals create this nice atmosphere that is, as far as i am aware, unique to this game.

So, what about the full game then? It is a mixed bag for certain.

The combat is your generic souls combat, maybe lacking some things, but i wouldn't know. There is no actual combo system, so you just kinda end up button mashing attacks. There are also 3 defensive options in the parry, block and dodge. Almost noone uses the parry, because of the surprisingly lengthy delay for the actual ""parry frames"" to begin. Blocking is very build dependant (we will get to that) and dodging is your standart invincibility roll, which you are going to be using 90% of the time. 

The story is your generic anime apocalypse story. If you played god eater, you are gonna find some neat references and lore, but that is about it. However this story isnt plot focused, it is entirely character driven. Are the characters good? Uhhhhhhhhh, maybe, depends on who you ask. The writing is very much all over the place just like this review. But it is all generic anime stuff, if you like that sort of stuff, you will find enjoyment from the characters. (Why does yakumo have a fucking glock)

The music fucks A LOT (it is really awesome and you can totally shred out sometimes). 

The graphics i dont care for, as i am a low end scrub, but the artstyle is pretty nice. Will definetly hold up for a while.

Now if it is such a mixed bag, why bother? The answer is customisation. And god almighty does it have it.

First up the obvious character creator being fucking amazing, especially if you install some extra outfit mods (you do not gain extra outfits for your character by playing the game, sorry)

But what is more important, is the build customization. Half the fun of this game is building your very own build. It goes deeper than just ""i use big sword, i use fast sword, i use gun"". You see every weapon has stat scaling, but the stats work in an interesting way. You have your standart str, dex, etc. from other souls games, but it is all determined by the class (blood code) that you choose. So you can have a class that has high str for a heavy sword, but maybe it has low fortitude and you can't get the invisibility spell. Well in that situation you can fine pick the perfect class for that, maybe sacrifice some str, but hey you can now shove a giant hammer up someone's ass, which is honestly very much worth it. Those spells i mentioned? They also scale from your class, but you can also amplify your spells with armor. Oh god i forgot armor. Armor determines your mobility, your damage/status resistances, your stagger resistance AND your spell potency. And every armor is balanced with certain aspects being way lower or higher. There are glass cannon fast generalist mages. Tankier damage mages, status resistant defense mages, just tanky stuff in general. Point is you can find a build that you will spend hours perfecting and obsessing over.


So, the TLDR? Awesome customisation and min maxing that is brought down by mediocre combat. 


DLC is optional content like cosmetics, item variations and 3 new areas with unique bosses. The only good one of these is the hellfire knight dlc, which is a strong contendor for the best boss in this game (and definetly the most fun one too). The other 2 are just unfun stat races.

Let's first state the obvious: this is not a perfect game. I have seen lots of people's comments complaining how Code Vein is not ""Dark Souls, but anime"", and they are right, it's not, but it is a very enjoyable game with a lot of shortcommings but some aspects in which it is brilliant. 

The long rant:

CONS:
-I cannot overstate this: the dialogues are so, soooo cringe, and the narrative is so stupid that overshadows what is an underlying very good story
-The abundance of cosmetics for character doesn't makes up for the very limited armor or at least aesthetic clothing (a miss here because it has lots and lots of customisation options)
-The female character design is sexy but borderline hentai
-Items description is stupid and nonsensical sometimes
-A stupid plot twist that adds absolutely nothing to overall value of the experience but doubles up in stupidness
-Annoying cutscenes that don't add depth, they just try to look cool (emphasis on the ""try"" 'cause is so obvious that ends up not being cool, just annoying)
-Why so many loading screens????
-Little enemy variety
-The ability to change blood codes (builds) on the fly takes away gameplay depth
-The fact that there is a door to DLC content in base game is undeliable proof of the horrible corporate practice of cutting pieces of the game to sell them as DLC's that everyone ends hating, just to make some more bucks

PROS:
-The combat is really, really enjoyable
-Blood codes are a bad choice at first glance, but it turns really fun trying different builds for different areas
-The ""training room"" is an awesome choice that more games need to have, it lets you actually see and quantify the effects of the gifts you equip with (gifts are abilities: the equivalent of magic and passive augments)
-The story is actually good if you filter all the cringeyness of dialogues; and more than anything, the short character stories are very good (although a different delivery than ""memory echoes"" would have made them justice)
-Although there is an overuse of enemy reskins, there are some enemies that are such a pleasure to figh: Black Hunters, all the female warriors, specially the Golden and the Queen's Vanguard (except those fatsos that are just big blobs with no depth to their encounters), the Cerberous units
-The Guilded Knight fight is such a beautifully coreographed dance
-Companions (here's a tricky one) can be pretty annoying or an absolute unit by your side, it's a matter of choosing the correct companion for the correct area, plus their abilities must have synergy with your own equipped abilities.
-The combo-based combat: you don't need to always use an ability; dodge, parry and combo the hell out of enemies
-Different Blood Veils have different parry windows and some drain more ichor than others, making them specially useful for ranged attack bluilds (""ichor"" is the equivalent of a magick pool, different builds have different limits and consumption effectiveness)
-The fact that you have to earn mastery over gifts by using the different blood codes in battle, which actually forces you to know the benefits of different builds (unless you have enough Awake resources to unlock mastery, which is not possible in your first run)

Pros:
- Highly customizable character design and playstyle / abilities
- Fully voiced. Every character you interact with is voiced. Used the english ones which were decent.
- Great Soundtrack.
- A complete story with different outcomes depending on how you complete the game.
- A beginner friendly souls-like game. Not too difficult if you suck at these games like me.
- Great mod-support for additional content like clothes, weapons, re-shaders, QOL mods etc.

Cons:
- No native widescreen support. Gotta fiddle around in the game files to make it work despite the game giving you the resolution option (It´s basicly 16:9 with black bars).
- Clipping. Hair and character clothing clipping into everything which just looks weird af.
- Dungeons feel rather tedious. At least if you want too discover 100% of it. And we better not mention the cathedral.
- Repetetive enemies. They decided on a few enemy designs and just copy-pasted them.

Decided to 100% the game and what can I say. It's okay but nothing really groundbreaking what I might re-play in the future.

The level design unfortunately can be poorly made especially with the infamous cathedral map.

  Pros:
1) Great unique anime style with fabulous music score by Go Shiina.
2) Decent gameplay with lots of mechanics to utilise. Thanks to the Blood Codes you can create any build you desire at any time with just a bit of resources and time. In addition to that, the game offers a number of companions with their distinctive playstyle and abilities to aid the protagonist on his journey and make it more lively.
3) Decent plot, characters and lore. [spoiler] Also is a God Eater spin off [/spoiler].
4) Various pleasant interactions at Home Base as well as additional gameplay content in the form of DLCs and Depths.
  Cons:
1) Occasional stutters and bugs during some fights with enemies leave an unpleasant aftertaste.
2) Due to the developers pushing the best ending so hard to the player, the direction of some otherwise really dramatic moments turns to some comic relief, which is a real shame.
3) NG+ difficulty philosophy is ""One-shot them before they one-shot you"", really bad decision which can be truly experienced by going for towers of trials while underleveled.
4) Some awful level design here and there. Can't imagine what might have led them to design Cathedral of Sacred Blood and Crypt Spire as they exist in the game.
5) Having to earn Dweller in the Dark ending two times with minor difference for all achivements is pretty stupid.

1. The game's difficulty curve is all over the place. It's not like a Souls game (even if that's the joke) in that it's very hard, it's like a Souls game in that you HAVE TO learn HOW to play it. This isn't a hack'n'slash that you can just pick up, no, you have to practice and THAT means there are areas that are harder or easier at random until you learn where they are and how to approach them. I'd prefer if the difficulty ramped up a little more evenly.

2. I wish there was more story to this game as it seems like there was meant to be more in several places.

3. bigger variety of weapons and weapon skills. Do yourself a favor, rely on your personal/gained skills. There's a LOT of magic use in this game. Not saying weapons are uselesss, but you're going to be using your magic skills more than your weapon skills at some point.

Being a souls-like means the game has a very steep learning curve, and the way it teaches you to play is by killing you. Time and time again. Which for me meant that I never really learnt how to play the game. I am a very experienced Dark Souls player, so learning how to time dodges and finding openings to attack came very naturally to me. I didn't beat the game as I dropped it due to losing interest, but I only died 4 or 5 times. I beat the Cathedral of sacred blood as well as the memories, and I'll probably come back to finish the game one day.

But for now, I'll leave it on the shelf. To me, it has the same issue that Dark Souls 2 had, the foundation of the game isn't strong enough. Movement is very slow, making a fast paced, dodge and punish playstyle harder to do than in Souls. Movement isn't 360 degrees and feels very rigid because of it, which is also reflected in attack animations being robotic and rigid.

I think the game would benefit from a remake or an update on a newer engine, for as unlikely as that is for a 4 year old game.",1682215127,1682215127,True,0,0,0.466601163148880005,2,True,False,False

Difficulty
- It's not that difficult for a Soulslike, but if you're not used to that style of gameplay you might be in for a bit of a learning curve. 
- Most people find that particular bosses are a lot more difficult than others. I beat some of the bosses in one attempt and others took dozens. 
- Sometimes you can figure out gift (ability) combos that cheese the boss easily, especially with a partner. 
- In terms of exploring, there's one area that's particularly bullshit and the rest are a lot more straightforward. 
- Part of the experience is the satisfaction at beating a tough challenge, in my personal opinion. If you don't find it rewarding to try something either repeatedly to learn patterns or from various angles to try different strategies, you might not find this game very rewarding. But you could still probably manage to get through it if you like the other elements. 

Gameplay
- It really doesn't feel the same as Dark Souls, besides having the same basic mechanics. You won't get significantly better at Dark Souls after playing this game unless this was your introduction to reflex-based games and you improved your reaction time. 
- It's not grindy. In fact, overlevelling can be slightly detrimental (but not as much as some people make it out to be). The main focus is finding a good build with your gifts (abilities) and upgrading your weapon and blood veil (gear) in different ways that fit your playstyle. 
- Your core gameplay loop is always the same throughout the game, but there's actually a lot of variation as to how you can play. Rushing in and trying to deplete the enemy's HP within a literal minute versus kiting them with venom - it can feel very different, and it's the most fun if you try every different style, in my opinion. 
- The game likes to reward completionists, as it seems, so be sure to explore every area if you want the best ending (and play through the game a few more times if you want all the endings). They don't seem to want you to rush through things. 

Plot
- People say it's cliché and meme on it for being ""weeb souls"", so be warned that it does have a lot of edgy anime tropes. But if you enjoy those, like me, you'll enjoy the plot too. 
- I've heard critique that you can pretty much guess the character archetypes as soon as their introductory scenes, but although the characters are indeed somewhat static, they're not too flat as you do uncover hidden sides of them as you discover their backstory through a gameplay mechanic - although, if you're genre-savvy enough, it's true that you may be able to predict them. 
- The fanservice is mainly in the visual designs of the characters and not their personalities, if that's something worth considering for you. 
- This may not be strictly plot, but the areas are beautiful and the cutscenes are nicely animated. Seriously, it's a better visual experience than some anime I've watched. 

Co-op
- Co-op is dogwater. I know it's a Soulslike and not meant to be multiplayer, but please, I just want to chill at the home base with my friends. 
- You cannot play with a friend if you haven't unlocked the area on your end (including on NG+). Or if you've already cleared the boss (Depths don't count, making it the only place you can hang out or farm for Marks of Honour). 
- There's a hard limit of only two PCs and one NPC companion, so if you have more than one friend who plays this game, you'll have to take turns interacting with each other. 
- If you're progressing through the whole game with a friend, beating a boss only counts on the host's side, so you'll have to do each area twice.

- Literally THE best character creator I've ever seen, the eyebrows alone have more options than my future

I am the target audience for this game. I love vampires, post-apocalypse, anime, and weird horror. I even like souls type games as long as they are not as punishing. Such as Bloodborn being my fav in the genre (haven't played elden ring) AND YET this game gets a thumbs down from me. It's a case of a game having no quality control and getting in it's own way too much.

The vampires or....REVENANTS as they are called here are the whole story reason for why you can die and come back over and over. The story is just plain bad. There is plenty of overly dramatic anime moments but that's not the worst part at all. Aside from being complicated for no reason it also adds a mustache twirling bad guy at the very end for no discernable reason other than to reveal a TWIST that really wasn't needed and to give one of the characters more TRAUMA. lol

The world is very anime destroyed with giant spikes of....??? ripping the city you inhabit asunder. it's never revealed what really caused all the destruction. but hey! it's there and we deal. There's plenty of horror-ish elements in the form of body horror, gore, and general medical malpractice. Also the horror of developers fanservicing the body of characters that look underage. MIA LOOKS LIKE A CHILD Don't @ me.

all of that is pretty sad, but still serviceable for a game. it's the gameplay where it gets a big fat F.

No quality control at all. Hit boxes are all over the place. the camera....oh my god the camera. expect lots of tight corridors with HUGE monsters and the inability to SEE anything either cause the camera is blocked by SOMETHING or it's spinning uncontrollably cause you tried to target something. The starting bosses are insanely hard compared to later bosses which are....just easy? 

There are way too many blood codes (builds) and most of them are entirely useless except for maybe one skill in it. Speaking of skills and abilities and VESTIGAES (yet another mechanic of the game) these are never really explained as to how they affect the story. In fact you'll never know unless you google it or play it again and again yourself. This is my biggest gripe about the game. it doesn't explain anything. it's one thing to not explain the whole souls mechanic again for the 4000th time, but it's another to introduce entirely new mechanics to a game and just assume you'll figure it out. there's got to be a middle ground between treating players with baby gloves or GIT-GUD mentality.

Lastly, I played this game to the end and no one, NOT ONCE, gave Io a fucking t-shirt or sweater to wear over her ripped ass dress in that chilly fucking church.

Every single one of them is a maze with maybe 2 exceptions. I watched all the story on the PC but skipped it on the PS5 and didnt lose out on anything. If Monster Hunter World is the king of useless items, this game is the Ace. Awake MJ212, old cog-wheels, chemical lights, element suppressors, [b]No One[/b] is using these. Even the items that add elements to your weapon only last 10 seconds, so by the time you use it its only got 5 seconds left.

90% of the weapons are bad. This game encourages a strength build because every other build is borderline unplayable. Any replay ability is killed since you can swap your gift at any time to change your scaling. Do not let the wiggle bones distract you from the problems of this game. The only partners that pull their weight are Asuki (red hair guy) and Wiggle bones lady (mummy girl). The rest are just blood banks to save you when you die. Except this game has no chill and bosses can kill you twice within the same combo.

CODE VEIN is an easy game to get into if you're into the Soulsborne genre, all the key mechanics are there. The story is quite enjoyable (in my point of view) and it isn't shoved into your face, you have to dig deep to get to the sweet bits of lore concerning your companions and such.

Oh, did I mention? You have companions in this game, and they're quite fun to play around and experiment with (comes with the added benefit of making you feel less lonely!). The builds you can make are plenty, but not infinite due to how builds work in this game: You earn codes that act as pre-determined builds. You also get stylish armor which you can swap and upgrade as you please.

Character customization is another strength here - half of my time was practically spent making my character, the other half was finishing the game. There are simply so many options to choose from that it makes you struggle.

My only criticism would be the fact that enemies can get repetitive at times - but it is not too important, as they make up for it by varying the move sets just enough to throw you off and force you to adapt.

Not a must play for the Soulsborne fan, but this game will genuinely keep you entertained and make you love it in a matter of an hour or so. I love this game so much, and can't wait for the sequel.",1681767469,1681767469,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

From the character creator (which I'm sure some people can easily spend over an hour just creating their character) to the atmosphere, visuals and story, everything was fantastic. Speaking of story, Code Vein has undoubtedly the best one among the Souls-like games imo. I suggest trying to find all the [spoiler] vestiges aka memories [/spoiler] to find out even more about the world, your companions, side characters,...
The only (minor) negative thing I can say about this game is that it can be more challenging than regular souls-game mainly because of its (kinda) different approach to classes & builds. For instance, leveling up does not increase your character's damage at all. But after figuring out how they work, there shouldn't be any further issues.

Beat the first playthrough in about 16 hours with most of the areas being fully explored. So not much in terms of content compared to other Souls-Like games but if you find it on sale like I did then it's worth picking up. Probably wouldn't pay full price for this game tho due to the lack of content.

Known bugs: Many will hate on this game because there is a serious glitch in the merchant windows that shows its head when you give multiple gifts to a npc at once then go to try and redeem your trade points for an item. The bug causes you to be stuck in the menu with 0 control input forcing you to ALT+F4. 

However there is an easy way to sidestep this from happening. Once you give all of your gifts, back out of the dialog and go rest at the mistle (It will take a moment for the option to be available due to the effects of the bug) then once you've done that, go back to the npc and trade away without an issue.

DLC: The dlc in this game is honestly a joke, it's just depth maps which are a very short adventure with no story and multiple boss encounters. Perks of this are additional vesitge parts, weapons, mats, etc. However the fact that these are dlc items makes me wish I had just bought the base game rather than spending the few extra bucks for the deluxe. 

All in all, not a bad game. There are two different endings to encounter but I won't spoil anything. Would be cool to see a sequel of this with more content.",1681339809,1681339809,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'll be honest - I have a gas-mask fetish which goes CRIMINALLY under-served in the the realms of pornography (except with a weird subsection of fart-fetishes which honestly, what in the entire fuck?!) so hearing they made an essential hentai with gasmasks as a prerequisite made my masked boner inflate with the power of 20 or 30 hydrogen balloons!

Unfortunately, it required that thing you can't do while masturbating - think.

And this game is a thinker. Not in it's story which is somewhere between ""Is this fucking weeaboo seriously trying to create a sequel to FF7?"" and ""Holy shit this weeaboo does not know anything about weaponry at all""

I finally got to play it, and it was quite fun, even though it didn’t change my opinion about this specific genre.

The detailed customisation of your very own anime protagonist was definitely a nice touch (pity that they’re almost completely mute throughout the story…), and in general, I liked most of the characters, as well. The graphics and music/sounds were also cool, and the gothic-postapocalyptic setting was really unique. We also get a surprisingly complex plot with lots of terms and names, so you need to pay close attention to it – and let me tell you, we only scratch the surface of this world here, so there’s lots of stuff left to discover and explain in a potential sequel.

As for the gameplay, if you ever played a similar game, you know what you’re going to get. Don’t expect anything on the level of [i]Dark Souls[/i] or [i]Bloodborne[/i], of course, but still, even if you’re a pro, I believe you’ll find some of the bosses and levels quite challenging, not to mention the (in my opinion) overcomplicated skills system.

678960,136430520,76561198056777256,0,2,2884,0,2870,1681077278,"Bought this game because I like soulslikes and I like anime, so I figured this would be a good combo, but I was off the mark.

Firstly, I beat this game without a partner, which is choosing to suffer, so take this review with a grain of salt. With that however, the difficulty is optional, which isn't unique to games but is different for a souls game. The partnership system takes away any intimacy you can have with an enemy, you don't have to learn the intricacies of a boss or the tells of their attacks if your partner can take their aggro and demolish their HP while the boss is aggro on you. It took me 1 try to beat a boss it took 10 tries to defeat solo.

The boss design varies, there were a few fun fights but it is abundantly clear that they allowed flaws in their boss design because the partnership system weighs the fights too heavily in the players favour. There are bosses in this game that have zero tells on their attacks yet the attacks clean out your entire health bar. I have two requirements for souls bosses, and that is: good tells that aren't overly obvious or cruel, and the ability to allow the player to breath to assess their situation every now and then, these bosses are relentless with almost none, to no tells. However, as I said, there were a few fun fights in this game, and some of the bosses could be fixed if you could just remove one horrible attack.

The weapons system is just abysmal, I found a weapon in level 3 that stuck with me the entire game, all weapons are super close in damage regardless of where you find them, the weapons in the end-game level are worse than the early-game ones. Progression is poor, to the point levelling up costs you 100,000 souls or 'haze', but grants you +2 attack.

The only thing I can say about the level design in this game is 'big corridors' and 'destroyed city in different colours', so don't expect much there.

The biggest and most detrimental factor to my enjoyment of this game however, is inconsistency. It is plagued with inconsistency in every facet, to the fact you are fighting enemies from the first level, in the last level, except they have a ton of health, or sometimes attacks land, sometimes they don't, sometimes your magic hits an enemy and stuns them, sometimes it won't, sometimes your weapon reaches the enemy, sometimes it's a toothpick. The enemies may be unique to their environment, or they are the same generic enemies you see everywhere. If you press dodge, 90% of time you will dodge the attack, but the 10% will show its face and kill you at the worst place for it to.

This game caused me a lot of grief, and by the end, I was too committed to put it down, it wasn't a completely bad experience, the title screen blew me away deviously. But, there are good aspects to this game, the unique abilities you have are great when you are allowed to use them creatively, the items were fun and interesting, and the story was great for 3/4ths of the game. All I can say is, buy this game if you're looking for a downgraded anime Dark Souls that you will mess around with, and play with the AI partners, but if you're looking for a decent soulslike, look elsewhere.",1681069080,1681079284,False,6,1,0.562557339668273926,0,True,False,False

-Oyun girişinde karakter tasarım kısmını çok beğendim detaylı ve güzel.
-Oyunun grafiklerini ve sanatsallığını beğendim
-Vuruş hissiyatı ve oynanış güzel
-Sinematik kısımlardaki hikaye anlatımı güzel
-Harita içersinde ilerlerken daha önce gezdiğin yerlerin haritada iz bırakacak şekilde belli olması güzel

15 saat oynadıktan sonra Olumsuz Gördüğüm Kısımlar:

Hikayenin gidişatı gereği bazı anıları oyun içinde kısmi oyun gibi yapılmış bir bölümde yürüyerek yaşıyoruz bu kısımlar biraz kafa karıştırıcı olmuş. Çok dikkatli okumayan birisi önemli yerleri kaçırabilir bu yüzden ana hikaye kurgusunun daha oturaklı ve anlaşılır gitmesini tercih ederdim.

Evet haritada çözmemiz gereken şeylere saygı duyuyorum, ancak bazen işler öyle bir hal alıyorki açılmamış bir haritada resmen samanlıkta iğne arıyoruz ve uzun süre karmaşık haritada o dikkatli toplamak göreceli olarak çok zor. Harita canavar ve boss kestiğimiz zaman bir şekilde kendini oynatıyor, ancak iş kör bir yerde doğru yolu bulmaya geldiğinde o harita iyice yavan bir oyun deneyimi sunuyor, çünkü keşfetmeye değer ögeler barındırmıyor.

Roll animations are terrible.
Extremely shallow level up system (can't level up specific stats).
Playing with a partner makes the game a complete joke.
Playing without a partner and playing a strength build makes the Ornstein and Smough fight completely unfair due to the fact that both of them have ranged attacks and can stun-lock you easily.
Speaking of which, the armor is basically useless as it does nothing defensively nor does it give you enough poise to properly play a strength build.
If you play a strength or heavyweight build you are stuck fat-rolling for probably the entire game since you can't manually increase your carry weight outside of the blood code that you choose.
The voice acting is terrible (except for Mido, that VA did pretty well) but maybe it's just because I played it in English instead of Japanese.
Everything is so overly dramatic for no reason, the smallest revelation results in a soliloquy that goes on for five minutes when it has been blaringly obvious for the last two hours of the game.

The story is interesting, characters are not annoying and its fun listening/watching the memories fallen and present characters. Its like the other half of the team forgot they had to make a game with a fun battle system...

Story/Characters/Map(good): The story is by far the best thing about this game. If that's all you care about go for it. You are remnants of a human civilization.  Waking up as your own character you've created, you adventure on with a big bosom sidekick. All the characters you discover fit the role are decent in their purpose a few stand out as cool. Surprisingly they didn't mess up the voice acting, I couldn't believe not one annoying voice for 50 hours of this game. Map design looks amazing and with the sound effects give the area its feel.

Gameplay/Map(bad)/leveling: Now this is when it takes a turn for the worst. You start with a weak tutorial and get thrown in a tough game. Their are a bunch of ways to spec your character in, not so much in the beginning but as you get going it gets overwhelming and confusing. Some are limited to certain weapons and moves and while others are just useless. I beat the whole game as Ranger and should be an achievement on its own (I don't recommended). This is how bad the fighting is you need a companion to beat almost anything  and theirs only one that can hang all the others will die in a few hits. Is it my class? That shouldn't be the reason if it is why make so many of them ? Healing can be so dumb, very slow and you have a great chance of being hit again, not fun when your character is made of glass. Attacking can get you locked in a combo so you can't stop and get hit. You have pretty much 3 class of enemies. Grunt style enemies, some tougher than others, Boss fights which some are beyond ridiculous. I'm all about a challenge but when its just broken and not fun, you have to ask what are we doing here ? The third is the map. The bad side of it. They make it where you can fall off, get ambush or be affected by a affliction. Some map designs are beyond confusing  and you can tell that the people who made it need some help with their personal life. Now the final nail in the coffin. When you die you lose your exp. Although you have a chance to get it back but if you die that's it all gone, just like some of your real life.

Inside this madness game play/ map, is a gem of a game. With a revamp in some battle mechanics and common sense things. The specializing and leveling system needs a K.I.S.S. (keep it simple stupid).

So I bought this game during a sale which made it around ~$9 I think. I only bought it because I had just received my Steam Deck and wanted to play a game very similar to Dark Souls, but none of the Souls’ were on sale during the Spring Sale. 

Overall, it is a fun game. The combat is really cool which is really all I was looking for. The different Blood Codes, weapons, and armors are fun to play around with too.

The bad: You know the most annoying parts of Dark Souls? This game has fun levels/areas that take those annoyances and set them to 1000. This game mostly copies the Souls formula, but when they try to be unique, it shows…in the worst way possible. I would’ve liked this game more if they had stuck more to being a complete clone of Dark Souls. Now the most annoying part, the cutscenes. Oh the cutscenes…should’ve just released a companion movie for how long this game’s cutscenes are. I really wanted to watch them but I just could not stand watching a slow-moving cutscene with weird dialogue for 20 minutes at a time. It really did detract from the experience cause the cutscenes usually had important information about where to go next in order to progress. Luckily, google and Youtube exist to help you out there. So seriously, just skip the cutscenes. My only other main complaint was how it felt too easy to get high-leveled and the enemy scaling was pretty abysmal. I would mow through the new areas with a breeze and then get smacked by the boss. The only time the enemies are scaled well is endgame. 

I wanted a soulslike game with cool combat and at its bare bones this is it. But only get it on a deep sale, if not just buy Dark Souls.",1680836489,1680836489,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Its fantastic and unique story kept the experience entertaining throughout with each side character and enemies story being explained/developed, some better than others but they are all awesome and really flesh out the world. Its combat is also great with hundreds of abilities without being too overwhelming. The sound design and music are absolutely banging! The setting is post-apocalyptic yet somewhat dull, but this only enhances the world's devastation. On my first play-through, the game was very hard, but on my second play, things became significantly easier as this game rewards you for knowledge of the game and its subsequent combat systems, which can be somewhat hard to understand but after a while, it will feel very smooth. A few nitpicks are the controls, I play on PC and personally, the default controls are horrendous and needed like 20 mins of tweaking to make them better, and there are a few clipping issues with cosmetics and clothes but they are not too big of a deal; The game runs very smoothly with the only lag I experienced was going between zones (Only happened twice). Multiplayer is absolutely crap, but it's a very fun single-player experience. 
Overall I suggest you try Code Vein especially if you're looking for a fun combat system with a good story, probably not the best game to play with friends and try to get it when it's on offer in case you don't like it.

Between hitboxes and animations not matching up even in the slightest and absurd levels of damage and HP on enemies, the game just becomes a tedious slugfest.

There is no nuance here, you will just get extremely bored of the repetitive, poorly designed enemies. If you do ever make the extremely poor decision to play this game, save yourself the trouble just load up on a cheap oneshot build or something that gives you the only usable Quick speed dodge - because the iframes of all the other dodges are useless - and brute force your way to the end.

its a Mix from Dark Souls and God Eater 3 which sounds pretty nice
the combat is okish aswell, feels a bit sluggish but could be worse.

Enemys design is a bit off in my opinion
you either have the ULTRA SUPER DEMON from literally every other Anime Demon kinda world / Game
the Female enemys coulds all ( except the huge fat whatever women ) go straight to a Hentai
the NPC women are the except same ( Mia is 24/7 teasing since she dont know how to dress ) 

now to the point where i actually gave up

im in the Cathedral which is an Area you get after meeting Mia, im wandering around there for the last couple of hours, jump down here, open this door, kill the teleport bi..., go through next door literally 100 more of those teleport women with skimpy clothes then a lost invasion here, a Samurai here and the list goes on. 

from the difficulty this game is okish
not to hard not to easy
but from the level design, enemys, moveset, hitbox etc i just cant take it atm.

Combat feels like hitting enemies with a tube of cardboard; it's missing that impact that makes it feel good to fight. IMO, it would be much better without a stamina system, or losing exp points when you die, or . . . basically this game would be much better if it was not a souls-like that I then compare to Elden Ring. 

Things I liked: the customization for your character is very detailed, it's much easier than Elden Ring or any other souls game I've played in that you have a partner with you, and the map is very handy. The story is so very vampire anime in the way that I like. Wanting to know what happens next is what has gotten me through this game so far.

It has good build variety through the blood codes and even with the weapons all feeling very similar it isn't much of a problem. Beyond this bosses generally feel very fair though without a partner bosses become significantly harder but still feel very fair with the exception of the Blade Bearer and Cannoneer becoming pure pain and suffering without a partner. The visuals of levels are pretty good but the optional side dungeons called The Depths are all very samey. Additionally there are just the same copy paste enemies everywhere with versions that have higher stats in later areas which feels a bit lazy but it's still fine as new enemies get introduced sometimes. 

Where the game design fails though I would say is in the three dlc areas which have over inflated stats for every enemy and the main boss of each dlc is equally ridiculous so the dlc definitely gives an air of extreme post game rather than something you can do coming off of the final boss. Which needless to say is not the recommended way to handle dlc without challenges that act as a reasonable middle ground between them. The game's story is flat and the word blood is said every two seconds so it just gets very silly and getting actually invested is hard as such. 

Lastly the best part of the game is the character creator. You can access it at any time from the home base and it is probably the best character creator I've seen in a game whose focus wasn't on character creation. The character creator isn't good for someone who doesn't like an anime style though so it isn't for everyone. That could be said for the entire game actually. It's a good well designed game for the most part but unless you like the anime style an very edgy nature of the game it probably isn't for you. But if you do like that you'll have a good time.

Not a bad game, it´s just too ""meh"".

Combat is repetitive, enemies are all the same with little variety. Leveling up or upgrading gear does not make you feel better (stats do change ofc, but the feeling of getting stronger isn´t there). Story and worldbuilding is sort of ok, but anime characters just don´t fit there. However, I´m not denying that female characters were nice to look at...

Worst part is level design. While levels alone are fine but nothing special, world layout does not make any sense. For instance, you are in snowy mountains, then you run maybe 30 seconds thru few hallways that serve as level transition, and then boom, you are in a burning city. If you look around, there is no trace of mountains you were at earlier. After burning city level, you go on foot to sand city and again, if you look back behind map borders where you basically came from, there is no hint of burning city. So in the end, everything is randomly sticked together.

All put together, every part of Code Vein is average at best, and has more cons than pros.",1680035393,1680035393,False,4,0,0.555487155914306641,0,True,False,False

Story is there i guess, it's not the best or most comprehensible story out there, but not that bad either. I've seen worse. Also Yakumo bestest boy. You cannot say otherwise. If you just want to run around and hit things with a big Hammer, that works too. Combat is fun, as soon as you learn how it works. Especially the parry mechanic, as far as i know there is not one game out there that did something similar.

Multiplayer kinda empty, but it's an old game, so that figures. Still fun at times though.
Yesterday i met a Flimsy Redhead on crack who dashed over half the map before i could even swing my hammer once. Was always at like 1 health and still managed to die less as me with my Tank build. Also noticed that tank builds just dont work if you're lvl 7, you still get annahilated.
Hit me up if you wanna play multiplayer sometimes.

Amazing Character creator unlike any I've seen this far. You can make your edgy teenage OC you've always wanted, or you could make something that actually looks good. If you want to see more, just check out the community hub for this game.

Booba's also there for those who are interested. It's called *Anime* Dark souls for a reason.

DLC's are kinda just sad, so much wasted potential. Buy them if you want some new abilities, and only if they're like 90% off. At least.

Modding is possible, if you're into that.

Certainly one of the Games of all time, and not that bad either. Buy it on sale and try it, or just try the Demo to see if youre into that.

Probably won't see a sequel, but I'd like to see a remaster someday, improve a few things (including in the story). Or a New game that could be seen as an AU.

Some people may say it's anime dark souls, well, it's half-true. It's more like dumb souls-like like Nioh, where you're frail one-hit dude while all bosses are fat strong tough monsters. It has a bit different mechanics, so you shall to adopt or drop. 
Bosses difficulty is pretty strange and uncomfortable. Like, first couple of bosses are hard like hell, because you have no good damage, but just bit later you nuke all others till you meet anime Ornstein and anime Smough, and after them - Mido. I find them be hardest bosses of game, but all is after them - pity bosses worth nothing.
Lore is good, plot is 'anime friendship'. Like it because I want to like, dislike it by story style.

While the game's combat system and mechanics feel very similar to those of its inspiration, it still manages to be an enjoyable experience.

The gameplay in CODE VEIN is challenging and rewarding, with a focus on exploration, strategic combat, and character progression. The game's difficulty level is high, requiring players to master the intricacies of the combat system and learn from their mistakes to progress. The bosses are particularly challenging, with each one presenting a unique and formidable foe to overcome.

The customization options in CODE VEIN are also impressive, allowing players to fully customize their character's appearance, abilities, and weapons. This adds a personal touch to the game and encourages experimentation with different playstyles.

However, one cannot deny that the game's mechanics and systems feel like a direct copy of those in the Dark Souls series and Elden Ring. From the stamina-based combat system to the bonfire-like checkpoints, the similarities are impossible to ignore. This may be a turnoff for some players who are looking for a more original experience.

Despite this, CODE VEIN manages to be a fun and enjoyable game in its own right. The story is engaging and the world is beautifully designed, with a dark and atmospheric aesthetic that draws you in. The game's co-op mode is also a welcome addition, allowing you to team up with other players and take on the challenges together.

In conclusion, CODE VEIN may feel like a copy of the Dark Souls series and Elden Ring, but it still manages to be a fun and engaging game. If you're a fan of challenging action RPGs and don't mind the similarities to its inspirations, then CODE VEIN is definitely worth a look..",1679266507,1679333610,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1: The story is pretty much you're basic Anime story trope, If you like God Eater I'd recommend (it take's place in the God Eater universe)!
2: There are a lot cutscenes for a souls-like, but it's passable for the most part.
3: Music feels a bit lack-luster do to the fact that the same theme is used for the most of bosses. (Except for certain cutscenes)
4: Gameplay is near Fantastic. (I've beat it on xbox and here on pc)
5: Queenslayer items feel too weak for being used to fight the Queen!
6: The world is gorgeous, the weapon's are really dope (aesthetic wise), Graphic's are gorgeous for being anime style.
7: No Difficulty options, so if you hate challenges dont play, but if you love a challenge i'd highly recommend!
8: Campanion's feel a bit overpowered at time's.
9: Animation's at time's feel ganky (if you use mods).
10: Boss's feel like a boss, unless you have a one shot build.
11: the multiplayer can be utter garbage at time's (mostly do to the fact that the developer's pretty much said no updates to the servers), Level design can be a bit confusing, that's why you can send a distress signal.

Coming back to this game after playing Elden Ring and replaying the DS trilogy, I guess I'm just spoiled by things making sense because this game is worse than Dark Souls 2 in a lot of aspects. Beating this load of shxt for the 3rd time has only cemented my hatred. Don't get me wrong the first blind playthrough was pretty fun, but you quickly realize how empty and meaningless 80% of the content is. Every area uses the same scrub enemies and the same elites. The amount of times you can get combo'd by the environment to death happens way to often. Most elite enemies can completely invalidate you guarding regardless of poise, guard boost, and physical defense. Most bosses have extremely hard to dodge combos that will drain your health before you can roll out of it amongst also dealing 60 - 80% of your health in one hit (even with the highest defense armors) Weapons look cool but are extremely weak or niche in application. You'll quickly find that this game favors strength builds as the ""big smackem' do big damage"" strategy tends to work the best. The best defense is more offense.

- AI: When facing many enemies you can easily get chain stunned and some fast enemies deal more damage than slow ones per hit

It's main problem comes from the combat being so... inconsistent. 

Sometimes you can backstab enemies by attacking them from behind, Sometimes you can hit them in the back five times and nothing happens. Sometimes you can backstab them from the side or even from the front.

Sometimes attacks do so little damage you can face tank and button mash through a new area, sometimes you get one-shot by an attack with no wind-up. Sometimes enemies have so little health you one shot every thing in an area, sometimes basic enemies take multiple fully charged heavy attacks to kill.

Sometimes you dodge in the direction you are moving in, sometimes you dodge in a random-feeling direction based on where the enemy you are locked onto is. Sometimes you get stunlocked to death after getting hit once, sometimes you randomly don't get stunned at all.

Sometimes the bosses are very fun and feel like a genuine test of skill that rewards studying their moveset and learning from each attempt, sometimes they feel like nonsensical BS where you throw yourself into the meatgrinder until they stop spamming an undodgable insta-kill move... sometimes the bosses are such a pathetic joke that you go ""Wait, it's over already? What does this boss even do, again?"" 

Sometimes the game is genuinely fun and a great time, other times it is completely miserable. It's a mixed bag, and the good does not outweigh the bad. Just go replay Dark Souls 1 instead.",1678164435,1678164435,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

No, these two games cannot be compared, they are similar only in a few mechanics that Dark Souls has. This is a part of God Eater. But the game remains just as atmospheric and interesting, beautiful and masterpiece music, good story, deep and sad character stories, VERY COOL CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION (I spent 2 hours creating a character), cool weapons (although there are not so many of them), also cool mechanics, well-made game world, which was very interesting to explore, and also from the big advantages you can lie on the lap of a girl.
This game can be both easy and difficult at the same time, if you exclude the help of an ally, then the difficulty of many enemies can be equated to the difficulty of enemies from Dark Souls.
Also, this game has a very interesting mechanic in the form of ""Ichor"", which is something like mana, but it can be obtained from killing enemies (and backsteps). 
And also a very interesting mechanic called ""Blood codes""
Throughout the game, players will unlock what is effectively classes that govern what abilities and spells can be used, known as Blood Codes. Each code offers a set of abilities and skills that can be unlocked for use with other codes in a sort of mix and match style, by either having them equipped with the class or outright buying them out. The codes also affect other combat abilities, such as the armor and weapons one can equip, and what spells/buffs can be used. Essentially, each Blood Code has its own letter grade in a given category and as long as the ability/spell requirements fit, and it has been unlocked, you can use it! Some abilities and spells are just locked to their parent code and can’t be shared, usually for game balance purposes.
I was also shocked by the designer of the location ""Cathedral of the Sacred Blood"" alternative to ""Anor Londo"" from Dark souls remastered, but how difficult this location is with mazes, I hope the designer of this level will have a house with such mazes.
In general, the game is very, very good (in my opinion).
but there are also disadvantages like ""the character does not feel the weight of the weapon"" or ""hair is visible in some moments through the clothes"" or ""you can't skip a scene"".

From the very first moments of the game, I was entranced by the stunning visuals and the deep, immersive lore that surrounded me.

But it wasn't just the aesthetics that drew me in - the gameplay itself was incredibly satisfying. With a wide range of weapons and abilities to choose from, I was able to tailor my character's abilities to my own unique playstyle. Whether I was unleashing devastating combos with my trusty sword or blasting my enemies with powerful spells, every encounter felt like a thrilling battle of wits and skill.

And the enemies themselves were no slouches, either. From hulking beasts to nimble assassins, every enemy presented a unique challenge that required me to stay on my toes and be ready for anything.

But what really set Code Vein apart was its narrative. With a complex, multi-layered story that explored themes of redemption, sacrifice, and the dangers of power, I found myself deeply invested in the world and its characters. And the fact that I could interact with these characters and influence the course of the story only added to the sense of agency and immersion.

This game is a very good souls-like and while it may not particularly challenging save for no partners, the game is absolutely gorgeous, the enemies, enviornments, and the weapons all have that souls appeal and charm to them whilst being original to the formula. A big thing about this game that's also amazing in terms of quality is the character creator, never have I seen a more fun and complex creator ever in the history of me playing games. The partners AI is...debatable from being either really good or npc in a GTA game that gets molly-whopped. But all of that is well and good because you shouldn't rely on them so much anyways. The story in this game is pretty good too, not the best I've heard but a pretty good one all things considered.

The only complaint I have and that might stop people from playing is the Cathedral of the Sacred Blood, that area is not only massive, but the enemies in there are not the greatest to say the least all of them (except the common bad guy or the large enemy) know how to teleport onto your position, this isn't particularly a new concept but when you run through and several enemies start teleporting onto you and deal immediate damage, to new players this may come off as annoying and frustrating. I personally know people who dropped the game at this exact point because of the enemies. So be wary about the Cathedral.

Fantastic souls-like. Highly recommend to anyone who is new to the genre as well.

CODE VEIN is an action RPG where the player takes control of a custom-created Revenant - an undead human who needs to feed on living human blood in order to survive. The game boasts a wide variety of features, such as a fully voice-acted narrative, high-octane real-time combat, multitudes of options for customizing your character, and a wide variety of environments to explore, but only about half of these meet an acceptable standard of quality, making for a clunky and inconsistent experience.

Starting with the things the game does well, it must be noted that the character customization options in this game are phenomenal. An extremely detailed character creator allows players to design almost any type of human they can think of, and a plethora of costumes and accessories allow them to give their characters a unique sense of style. Throughout the game, players will acquire ""blood codes"" - combat archetypes through which new skills can be unlocked. By obtaining many blood codes, players can obtain a multitude of skills that result in thousands upon thousands of different ways to build their character's combat prowess, and the game makes it easy to change skills and stats at any time, encouraging experimentation.

Additionally, the game's narrative is interesting and manages to stay engaging throughout its ~25-hour main story, in spite of having a silent protagonist. The supporting characters are well-developed and have relatable struggles that they learn to overcome. The blocking and direction of the cutscenes are cinematic, and the voice actors' performances range from great to serviceable. Tons of lines of dialogue were recorded for the player's companions, who appropriately react to the player's actions during gameplay, deepening immersive feeling.

Although it's incredibly satisfying to experiment with different combat loadouts, the actual combat of CODE VEIN is pretty hit-or-miss. Players obtain ""ichor"" by landing basic attacks on enemies that they can later spend to unleash their powerful skills, which keep battles more interesting than they would be if players could spam their strongest skills all the time. However, enemies deal high damage, move quickly, and many of their attacks launch with breakneck speed and little wind-up, requiring the player to sometimes predict when to dodge in advance of an attack instead of reacting to an wind-up with a dodge, which creates a frustrating experience. Furthermore, many skills and actions the player can take during combat have significant animation locks, easily punished by the quick attacks from enemies, which can discourage the use of many interesting combat options the players have. With practice, players can circumvent these issues, but they create a steep learning curve that feels more irritating to climb than it does satisfying. The game is difficult in ways that aren't intuitive, and learning how to account for this is a long part of the process to ""get good"" at it.

The design of CODE VEIN's levels are, unfortunately, inexcusably terrible. Aesthetically speaking, most areas in CODE VEIN look aesthetically identical, save for some slight changes to the color palette between ruined cities or monochrome cathedrals. Many levels are very confusing to navigate; although there is a map that tracks the player's movement through a level to help them see where they've been and where they have yet to go, the map does a poor job at communicating vertical differences and there are often very few environmental details for players to use as landmarks as they navigate identical looking empty hallways and corridors. Enemy and trap placement are interesting at first, but quickly become repetitive and predictable due to how little differences there are between one level and the next (with a few exceptions).

There could be a fantastic game somewhere within CODE VEIN's programming, but unfortunately it's muddled by its desire to copycat the industry leader in the ARPG genre instead of standing on its own original ideas and mechanics. Overall, I enjoyed my time with CODE VEIN, but I probably wouldn't recommend it to most players; only to people who have a passion for dark, punishing ARPGs that allows them to look past the inconsistent combat and poor level design.",1677194758,1677194758,False,2,0,0.491952955722808838,0,True,False,False

What few strengths this game has, mainly character customization and build variety, are marred and shadowed by absolutely atrocious level design, convoluted and relatively uninteresting plot design, canned and forcefully overdramatic dialogue that contributes neither meaningful world development nor character depth, and game balance that veers near the edge of unplayability.

If you are someone coming from another soulslike (probably Elden Ring), I implore you to choose almost literally any other major soulslike title, for this one will, with complete certainty, ruin your mood of the genre and leave a lasting, unforgivably sour taste in your mouth. And if you do decide to buy it, for whatever reason you may have, disregard the rules of ""blind playthroughs"" and just look up a walkthrough for Cathedral of the Sacred Blood. Trust me.

Bosses range from legitimately fun, interesting, and enjoyably challenging to masochistically absurd and zealously artificial, and usually fall in the banal category of forgettable and unenjoyable. The environmental design and level layout is, at times, a callback to some of the better-designed areas of Dark Souls 1-3 that leaves genuine joy within you to discover its secrets, but most often are either semi-linear at best or infuriatingly confusing at worst, with the majority of areas having the exact same layout throughout the entire zone, meaning your only hope of having even a fraction of a chance of making it to the end is somehow trying to make sense of the barely helpful minimap that has become nothing but hundreds of little dots across a half-graphed landscape of lines and curves that still do not even begin to provide an idea of where to go next.

At its absolute best, Code Vein is a simplified rehashing of a bad Bloodborne clone. At its worst, it's a shameful and incomprehensibly bad replication of some of the greatest games of all time.

Most video games that lets you create your own character, usually, only show first person view, only shows you standing around, or only show your manly hands despite how pretty you make them look(I'm talking to you Toukiden...!). I rarely liked those games(I still love you Toukiden) since I would lose will power too quickly, I needed something that would drive me....and watching my character do some cool backflips, was just what I needed.

Anyways, if you want to play as a anime character doing anime character kind of things, and actually seeing your character move around in a cutscene, I really recommend this game and also the Godeater series, which I think is created by the same people.

The graphics looks pretty to me, although most of the scenes are too dark, or has a red/orange/rustic feeling to it. A sense of dread just overfills the screen as you explore whatever area you decide to go which is mostly some place in ruins. But hey, there's anime characters that are pretty to look at in the cutscenes. Weeee. Also you can even look back on those cutscenes, which is great if you want to change up your character's look and stare at the cutscenes over and over again, like me.

If you're asking if I have played Dark Souls before and if this is anything like it, I wouldn't know. I never played Dark Souls, but I imagine that it's much harder than this game. That is why I don't play Dark Souls...cause I suck. 

If you're the same type as me who knows they suck at action rpgs, rejoice! I can say you can probably finish this, cause I did. I can definitely say I suck at action RPGs (Haven't finished Beyonetta or DMC on normal difficulty) Despite me, dying a lot of times, in the stupidest way possible(like falling off a cliff) I was able to finish it. Btw, I also rarely understood what I was doing. But, with the power of NPC allies, anything is possible. Thank you NPC allies.

Overall, I loved this game. Even though sometimes I cursed under my breath a lot and threw the controller in frustration. It was all worth it...my anime character has made it till the end and looked awesome.

A fantastic role playing game, whose unique style of models and textures are quite attractive to the eye. The game is certainly a must play if you're a JRPG fan full of epic moves to help take down even the toughest foes while looking stylish! Watch out, though! This game is quite punishing like the Dark Souls and other similar games. The differences between the battle systems and enemies though can throw you off your game however. So be warned! This game is NOT a Souls game. But it punishes you like one.

Pros:
- Interesting game environments that are both beautiful and hazardous. From dreary dungeons full of foes and obstacle to environments that sap your ability to fight.

- Your game, your way. Take advantage of the Blood Codes which act like insta-builds together with abilities from others to come up with your own unique build that can take down even the greatest of foes in one blow, or become a devilish maelstrom taking down crowds of the Lost!

-Charge forth alone or grab other Players online or NPC partner for offline fun!

- Get to know your friends and their stories as you take them through their memories while unlocking their own abilities for your own!

- Challenging yet very rewarding. The game severely punishes you for mistakes, with ever more powerful foes and obstacles. But pushing forward and exploring every nook can yield useful items and powers!

- An immersive story with multiple endings. Determine the fate of you and your friends. Find your tiny bit of paradise in this world-turned-hell.

Cons:
- Game is not optimized well. While certainly playable at max settings on even lower end cards, be wary of CTD over longer sessions. Save frequently via resting at Mistles.

- Story while certainly interesting does leave a number of loose ends.

- DLC, while entertaining, only consists of boss fights with little lore value. Go for it only if you are a fan of God Eater or truly love Code Vein.

- Although the game can be solo-ed, most of the area mobs and bosses were designed with co-op in mind. Without atleast an NPC partnering you, the game can feel very unbalanced and unfair.",1676726357,1676726357,True,1,0,0.502526819705963135,0,True,False,False

Bad parts: 
The combat is a good bit worse than dark souls as animations are a bit more stiff, and enemy variety is really limited.
The level design is pretty bland except a couple of the end game areas, best bet is to just traverse the level by always turning left at an intersection.
The story is very anime which might be a turn off for some people but not to me, figured I would mention it here too.
Dialogue proceeds rather slowly and there is a lot of ""dead air"" between voiced lines.
The game does not respect your time due to above, slow ""walking cutscenes"" (which are optional) and the terrible time wasting achievements.
There is too much blatant boobage for my tastes.

The Good:
Character customization is really good if anime edge is what you want.
The story is surprisingly heartfelt and engaging, its take on (essentially) vampires feels reasonably unique.
Characters are fun
I personally really like the AI partner system, both in the help they give in battle and the small quips they make during exploration (though you can play without companions, and turn off the exploration quips). 
Creating builds is incredibly easy as there is a ton to choose from, and respecing can be done at literally any time.
Active and passive skills and buffs feel incredibly useful and are a ton of fun (and are flashy and cool, which makes up for the fact that normal attack animations are less interesting).

However, it makes up for these things with its brilliant character customization, a deep narrative with twists and turns, and skills and abilities that challenge the player to defeat enemies in a way they never would have thought of before. Code Vein is a stylish JRPG that just falls short in a few areas. Its inspirations are clearly worn on its sleeve, but it brings enough to the table to stand out on its own. If you're a soulslike fan, Code Vein should be played.

PROS:
✓ In-depth character customization
✓ Memorable story
✓ Gorgeous anime art
✓ Blood Codes and their distinct Gifts offer plenty of customization and flexibility
✓ Interesting level design encourages exploration
✓ Approachable Souls-like with helpful tutorials
✓ Ease of travel between locations

Combat is good, having less weapon types means combat isn't as varied, but the many different abilities/gifts help make up for that. Exploration is good, lots of beautiful post-apocalyptic scenery, with items you find being single use items with some weapons/armors sprinkled around. Graphics are good, though I do recommend installing mods to bump up lighting and the like if you have a decent PC. Has a much more in your face/direct story than Dark Souls. Characters/NPCs are middling at best when compared to the NPCs of Dark Souls, very much your stereotypical action anime characters. Not to say that's a bad thing, but don't go in expecting Dark Souls-like characters. Character creation is great, with my only gripe being the number of outfits to choose from and body types/parameters. Enemy design is good, not as varied as Dark Souls. Bosses are good, I'd say just as good as Dark Souls if not tougher, but lacking much of the charm that comes with the backstories of Dark Souls bosses.

I was using Dragon Lunge and more often I would dash through enemies to just attack behind them, missing everything. Combat is honestly too simple and stiff. I've been getting away with a giant hammer, heavy charge attacking everything into the ground until the gank party arrives where I run around the 6 goons at the same time.

It feels like most bosses just dash and spin around the arena. Their hitboxes are huge as well! I was behind Invading Executioner as she dashes away, hitting me while I wasn't touching her. There's been some questionable hitboxes at times.

I'm currently at the Anor Londo look-alike and at this moment, it's just disinteresting and boring to run around in. I'll give this game more time and try my best to get the full experience before I give it my final thoughts.

The quest design in the game is disappointing, lacking the depth and creativity that players expect from a Souls-style game. The developers seem to have misinterpreted what makes the Souls franchise so successful, and as a result, the game feels like a shallow imitation of the original.

Despite these shortcomings, the game does have some redeeming features. The character design details in Code Vein are truly exceptional, and the level of detail in each character is impressive. The intricate designs and attention to detail are some of the best aspects of the game and help to make the characters feel unique and memorable.

The graphics in Code Vein are average at best, and the music is also unimpressive. While the graphics are not bad, they are not particularly impressive either, and the same can be said for the soundtrack. The audio design fails to captivate the player and adds little to the overall experience of the game.

In conclusion, Code Vein is a game that is let down by its quest design and the misinterpretation of the Souls-like concept by the developers. While the character design details are excellent, the average graphics and unimpressive music make the game feel unfulfilling.

Definitely a Game to Try and have fun-Recommended for all Gamers who are looking for a Souls-like, Anime style, Less Punishing Game (bought it on sale).

At the time of Review i just completed the first map and boss and waiting for my friend to download the game to play some co-op and have fun. 

This Game Offers some good mechanics to play with and challenges that require different type of weapons to kill enemies in a quick way, which makes everyone to try every weapon as they have unique attack style (so far for the first mission, the game made me try 4 different weapons(on choice) to make my way quick and little easy to complete the first mission). 

Pros:
1. Great Graphics (Anime Style)
2. Able to change classes in between the battles
3. Enemy design and uniqueness
4. Buttery smooth game-play 
5. Optimisation at peaks(played on a potato laptop containing MX-150 at highest settings)
6. Mechanics
7. Bouncy physics (WAIFU)
8. Very fast loading times


cons:
1. Linear game-play (not an open world which is not necessary for this game)
2. Jellies who can poison (hate them)
3.  Missed opportunity of adding cut scene for Boss transformation at phases in boss battle (just completed first boss and noticed this).
4. waiting for a friend to download the game, only if u want to experience co-op game-play
(Note: This game is fun as a Single-player as well)

Thanks for everyone who got past my review and if it had helped you. Have Fun :)

Code Vein is in my opinion the second best souls like I have played just after Hellpoint.

The game has a way more linear map Design which helps to collect items without looking for youtube videos explaining how to get this specific item. If you explore every way you see, you will easily find all the memory parts (used in this game to unlock lore as well as more skills). Although some maps are so damn confusing cause everything looks the same you can literally run in circles.

You dont spend skill points per level up like in standard souls like games but you get more HP, Stamina and DMG per LvL.
Instead your armor (its just 1 armor piece) and the Blood Code (class) you equip determine what weapon or spell requirements you fulfill.
I started with a 1H sword build and switched before the end to a mage build which was way more fun and just better. I noticed that my dmg was utter garbage and my companion was just carrying me through every fight.
You can unlock spells, passives or skills from a specific class and after defeating enemies with that class you are able to equip that spell/passive/skill on a different class resulting in some fun combinations and builds.

The story/lore was keeping me entertained enough that I wanted to find all the memories. Although I wanted them to lean more into the vampire part. 

Character creation is superb and you can build your very own edgelord vampire or a cute anime girl.

The game has some weird technical problems that have sadly never been fixed, nothing gamebreaking though in the 3 years post release it should have been easily fixable. Problems are badly cut cutscenes (they didnt cut them together but made each their separate 5s cutscene which makes the audio cut out between them), the last frame before a cutscene stays onscreen like an overlay while the cutscene plays, which is mildly distracting. Also this game isnt that graphic intense so some of my fellow gamers who want to play in 144hz beware that the elevators dont work! The game engine used in this game ties the elevator movement to frames and well... elevators stop working if you play the game above 90-100 frames so either limit frames to 60 or minimize/tab out of the game everytime you are in an elevator else you will sit there for 10min with nothing happening.
As I said nothing gamebreaking but definitely fixable!

I didnt play the DLC but the base game took me 20 hours while exploring everything on every area.
The game is at the moment of this game 7,50€ and I would definitely recommend this for either souls or anime fans!",1675981621,1675981621,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You're like a tool to further Louis's ambitions and you stayed that way till near the ending. At the last part they make your character speak, this is obviously an attempt to recreate the same feeling back in God Eater 1 when your character spoke to Lindow, but this attempt in Code Vein doesn't even come close to how epic the delivery in God Eater 1 was. This is pathetic. A mimicry of a good climax scene. I only felt pity at the protagonist at this moment where he continued to be used as a tool by other people for their own purposes. Look to GE1 or GER if you want to review how to make good silent protagonists. How come you made GE1 and GER but fail on making decent silent protagonists afterwards? This is just sad Bamco.

First, I like Code Vein. The Souls like fighting, mixed with using of different gifts and blood veil drastically increases the variety of your moveset. Managing your Ichor is definitely needed to be kept in mind, but it only added good in my experience since It's quite nice to fight the harder bosses on a sliver of health, no companion, an no ichor.

The base bosses can be a little bit hit or miss, most the time they are easy. But there are a handful of bosses that are hard and some of those I think are relatively too hard in progression. (But it's manageable, including the towers)

But my gripe with this game, is the DLC (not because it lacks content, which I'm not bothered with it). The problem is some of those challenges are unfair, and doesn't consider the attack pattern and difference between DLC Bosses. (Especially a certain DLC boss that you have to dodge 5-10 times... Which doesn't sound hard. But because of it's hitbox, you dodge mechanic, it's barrage and timing window. You have little to no chance of completing it if you're a casual player)

Get the Base game it's great, the dlcs it's your choice. But be prepared for a bad time if you're 100% completing the game or just even getting all the blood codes with all dlcs.",1624489748,1675712001,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
678960,132333714,76561198344977739,0,36,7236,0,5441,1677342065,"People say this is ""Anime Souls"", and while it's definitely using a similar format and took inspiration from it, it really doesn't [i] feel [/i] or plays like Dark Souls. There are 2 major key difference that makes this game stands out; the character building aspect and companions.

Making a build in Code Vein is very flexible. There are Blood Codes you can choose and find, these are basically character class and niche that dictates your stats distribution and [b] unlockable [/b] skills (passive or active abilities). You can switch Codes freely almost anytime anywhere with zero cost, skills are initially locked for a specific Code but you can ""master"" them and use them on any other Codes either by using them a lot or use limited resource to skip the process. Basically it is, for the most part, pretty low commitment and you can choose the optimum Code for your weapon of choice. 
You do need to progress some sort of Code level to unlock more skills from that code, but that is done from doing exploration and finding the specific Code fragment, leveling up one Code doesn't really affect your ability on leveling up another.

As for combat, this game is practically meant to be played with a companion. The encounters are designed assuming you'll have someone to back you up (either AI or other players), hence there's plenty of gank ambushes and even BS boss moves that aren't telegraphed well just to trip you up; you can go solo, sure, but that's akin to a challenge run (although by no means impossible since your character can be very overpowered easily). Most of the satisfaction in combat comes from your skills/abilities and how they make you [i] feel [/i] like an anime vampire protagonist, and sometimes from good cooperation with your teammates.

The story is mostly told in a flashback and in Assassin's Creed Unity fashion, you for some reason just have the ability to experience someone else's memories (even the dead). The majority of big events happened in the past and you're collecting the puzzle pieces to get the full picture. While it is satisfying getting things slowly unraveled to you, the storytelling left a lot to be desired because 80% of information are conveyed through glorified moving picture book narrations (with sad music to go along with it!). 
While some might say this is no worse than how Souls games tell their stories (item descriptions), they felt more involved since it's an active player choice to read something completely optional and it's ambiguous nature leads to the players having to fill in the gaps themselves, to theorize and discuss with others about the story. In this respect Code Vein is quite lacking, most of the flashbacks are mandatory and if you're going level up Blood Codes you'll see even more of them, there is almost no ambiguity as well.

There some other weak spots: the map/environment design (it's really just the dreaded white castle maze holy heaven it can burn in hell) can be annoying and confusing (for a game without jumping, there sure is a lot of places where you have to drop to some hidden platforms); you can get overpowered way too quickly, removing any semblance of challenge that one might expect from these types of games, which will often lead to boredom and lost of interest in continuing to play.

In summation; while not perfect, it's a different refreshing take on a ""Souls-like"" experience, with decent story, fun character building aspect, and flashy combat.",1675711466,1675711466,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You have currency that works like souls, you spend them on weapon upgrades, level up, purchases , etc.. Lose them upon death.
You have a shrine where you can teleport around , upgrade your character etc...
And other things too like limited regens and stuff. 

The game is not too difficult as I thought it would be. Coming here after Sekiro and Dark Souls 1, there is not much challenges in fighting basic enemies, but some bosses can be abit of a challenge, but still easier to get by. 

It has interesting characters in its story and also to highlight, a wide range of customisation for character design. Furthermore, you can change your fighting class at any point of the game without being locked into a specific type of class, as most games would do. 

So far 16 hours in, i am definitely enjoying this game due to its interesting characters and also the story of the game.

[i]Code Vein[/i] is a third person combat heavy experience, designed around the concept of “trial and error”, all wrapped in an Anime aesthetic. Players are constantly walled by tougher and tougher enemies with differing resistances, weaknesses, attack patterns, abilities, and spells. Learning the mechanics and how the game handles even the littlest of details, as well as the visual and audio cues during fights, is crucial for success.

[h2]Isn’t this like...[/h2]

I feel I should preface my full thought piece by stating where I stand with the “Souls-like” genre: I’ve never played a single one, in any capacity, so I have no real frame of reference (for better or for worse) in regards to what would entail a good Souls game. For the sake of this review, even if I did play one, I’d try to explain what [i]Code Vein[/i] is on its own merit, and not just write another Souls spiel. In short, if you’re looking for a review that encompasses what this game does well that others of the genre do and vise versa, this won’t be an informative read I’m afraid.

With all that said, [b][i]if this is indicative of what this genre has to offer, I’m 100% into it[/i][/b].

[h2]A Revenant’s Plea[/h2]

This tale begins with our hero/heroine confined in a void, trapped with a woman. After going through her tutorial, our warrior awakens to the sight of a woman. She is simply called [i]Girl in White[/i] at this point in our story, (her name is Io, and she’s best girl just saying) and both make their way over to a tree of some kind, walking through a seemingly desolate city. Its only moments later, that it becomes painfully clear they’re not alone, and shortly after they become unwilling scavengers.

The game progressively gets more interesting, but this foundation weaves a tapestry of a woeful world fighting to get by day to day. [i]CV[/i] slowly introduces the concept of what our protagonist and most every other living sane beings are: [i]Revenants[/i]. Creatures of endless death and rebirth, constantly thirsting  for blood, else they lose their minds and become one with the ranks of [i]The Lost[/i], which are the creatures that appose our leading [i]Revenant[/i]. In true Anime fashion, the protagonist is the world’s only hope and holds the power to help mitigate the suffering of those who haven’t lost themselves. Through their travels, our hero/heroine and Co. make new friends, and reminisce old ones using one of the protagonist’s many unique abilities. Our protagonist can read latent memories from [i]Vestiges[/i] that happen to be laying around, or from certain enemies. This serves as a decent means of giving both context to what has happened in this world, who was involved, expanding on character lore, and unlocking [i]Blood Codes[/i] which I will come back to momentarily.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2926475524
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2926475379

The story as a whole is… Serviceable. It isn’t inherently bad or doomed to fail and I did enjoy it here and there, I just have a few gripes with how events sometimes play out. For one, sometimes the friendship moments were layered on too thick for my liking. It felt like the writers were trying too hard to make the player believe that these people are truly your friends, and that’s fine and all, I would just rather it not be so forced. Another issue I have is with the progression of the story, with the goal mostly being a back and forth and not much else. There are loads of cool enemies to fight in between, and the story picks up a few hours in though so I was able to cope.

[h2]Codes for Success[/h2]

Throughout the game, players will unlock what is effectively classes that govern what abilities and spells can be used, known as [i]Blood Codes[/i]. Each code offers a set of abilities and skills that can be unlocked for use with other codes in a sort of mix and match style, by either having them equipped with the class or outright buying them out. The codes also affect other combat abilities, such as the armor and weapons one can equip, and what spells/buffs can be used. Essentially, each [i]Blood Code[/i] has its own letter grade in a given category and as long as the ability/spell requirements fit, and it has been unlocked, you can use it! Some abilities and spells are just locked to their parent code and can’t be shared, usually for game balance purposes.

[h2]Overall Performance[/h2]

The game performed somewhat optimally with all settings at their highest value, at 60 FPS. Any higher FPS value and things like elevators wouldn’t work correctly. I didn’t want to keep switching so I stuck with 60, and that was more than sufficient.

Very rarely, aside from the last few levels, turning corners too fast would allow me to see beyond the area or room, until the area loaded in. Rather Jarring, and thankfully didn’t hinder gameplay.

[h2]In Conclusion...[/h2]

At the end of the day, I can say I really enjoyed this game. I wouldn’t quantify it as 10/10 or anything like that, probably not even 8/10, but I like this game enough to say with confidence that if other souls games are like this I’m interested in trying them. Most of my disdain at first came from my lack of understanding what this game is really trying to do. I can’t see any reason to not recommend this on a decent sale. 60 USD, at the time of this review’s publishing, is unacceptable and would be the only real reason I’d recommend against buying this.

Fast forward to the 2022 winter sale, I was looking for games to buy and I saw that this was 85% off.  I figured that there will probably be mods to fix some annoyances so decided to give this a try.

[B]Positives:[/b]
-Combat doesn't feel as good as Dark Souls but it's still fun.
-NPC partners are decent in combat when exploring. You don't have to babysit them.  You can also go solo if you want. I played this 100% offline so I can't comment on co-op.
-Photo mode is pretty good. The camera's travel distance is limited, but it could be extended by using a mod.
-Skippable cutscenes and memory sequences. My second and third playthroughs were so much better than the first after skipping almost all of those.
-I used a PS4 controller and the game shows PS4 buttons without having to install a mod. I just had to uncheck ""PlayStation Configuration Support"" and check ""Generic Gamepad Configuration Support"" in Steam's settings to make the controller work correctly.
-All achievements can be unlocked with the base game only. You don't have to buy the DLC to get 100%.

[B]Neutral:[/b]
-There are no fixed classes. Leveling just increases HP, stamina, and attack power. Your other stats depend on your blood code (class) and your gear. You can swap blood codes anytime.
-As for difficulty, I thought it's generally easier than the Souls games.  Regular enemies are easy to backstab.  Some late game bosses took me some time to beat but I think I was underleveled. Even then, the hardest bosses here are still easier compared to the hardest Souls bosses.
-Story and characters are meh and dialogue is kinda cheesy.

[B]Negatives:[/b]
-Fanservice. I know that many consider it positive, but it's a huge turn off for me, especially when it's excessive.  Almost all female characters, including the protagonist, NPCs, enemies, and bosses, are dressed either in skimpy/revealing clothing or something that doesn't look practical in combat. If you don't skip cutscenes, unnecessary fanservice will pretty much be shoved in your face every time a female character appears in them. I would have been less annoyed if the male characters are also similarly dressed in skimpy/revealing outfits. I still won't like the outfits, but at least the designs would be consistent. Thankfully, there are mods that allow the female protagonist and a couple of female NPCs to have more decent outfits.
-Silent protagonist worked in the Souls games/Elden Ring.  Here, it just makes the cutscenes with dialogue look very awkward. The other characters talk to your character but he/she responds only with gestures, nods, etc.  It wouldn't have been that bad if you only see your chacter's back, but the camera focuses on your character's face and he/she doesn't say anything.  [spoiler]But after hearing my character speak 2 lines near the very end of the game, I'm not sure if I want to hear more voiced lines.[/spoiler]
-There is an extremely grindy RNG-based achievement.  It took me around 8 hours repeatedly killing one enemy to get those 400 Marks of Honor required for the achievement.  Not sure if it's faster in co-op, but I read that it's still extremely grindy.
-Gift (ability) mastery can also be very grindy, whether you're repeatedly killing enemies to master gifts or you're farming items for automatic mastery. The good news is that you don't have to master all gifts, just the ones you need.


tl;dr - Not as good as the FromSoft games, but the gameplay is fun enough. The experience would have been better if it didn't shove fanservice in your face, and without the extreme grind for one achievement.",1675437050,1675437478,True,14,3,0.547874391078948975,0,True,False,False

Strategy wise, it really is all about experimentation and finding out how you want to play. Code Vein really is a cut above most games in it's niche because unlike say Dark Souls, you can change and mix and match classes and abilities as much as you want, and the game encourages doing so.

Also for a new player it is recommended to play with a AI partner, as they often will comment on things you might miss, and the AI isn't bad at all in fighting along side you. Some say doing so makes the game too easy, but for others it helps a great deal.",1675420861,1675436522,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I originally did like it, I liked the story, character customisation, the level of difficulty etc. This was my first souls-like game, and y'know can't deny the  i n t e r e s t i n g  looking bosses were a nice factor for me even though it might not be for everyone but hey ho. 

I made the mistake of buying Elden Ring a few weeks after i started this game and my gosh that was a mistake. I realised what was wrong with Code Vein after I went back to it recently. The mechanics are quite jank, I don't know if its like this for others but it felt like there is a delay when dodging so I kept having to spam it. The movement isn't really smooth, so when turning left or right the character isn't as polished as it should be and clips quite a bit. This can go in line with how I feel about the hair and clothes on any character, I feel like its not thought out properly and the clothes will clip into the character model, which just threw me off when there was a cut scene, all I could see was a piece of hair going into Louis's face or a piece of cape clipping into Io's booba.

Combat is more versatile, but given the difficulty, there's really not much incentive to explore play styles. Also the move set of some bosses feel clunky - many bosses can be easily defeated in you stay behind them.

The main story is much more detailed, and the overall tone is much more positive. Most characters have solid background stories, and these stories are introduced without breaking the flow of the game.

Level design is fine - I got lost in quite a few maps, but overall, most maps are good - a few feel rushed, but not that much rushed.

Side quests & depths are really boring. Skip unless you are after some achievements.

Music is fantastic, both on its own and in terms of fit. This is partially due to the game being much more explicit in emotional expression and storytelling compares to souls games, allowing the music to be the same.

Lastly, I really like Io, almost considered not finishing the game for her :/ 

Won't elaborate too much as it'll be spoilers otherwise, but I like her not being so much like human, but trying to become one - Human qua human.

This game is either so piss easy or just hemorrhoid inducing difficulty where the game will literally spawn like 20 enemies out of nowhere, this also applies to the most wack boss fights I have ever played as well.

The gameplay isn't nearly as crisp and direct as that title implies. And even though yes levels are somewhat intertwined with shortcuts, they are often illogical and exhaustingly annoying. And let me tell you, sometimes you have to walk A LOT through weird, repetitive floors. It also felt poorly balanced. Sometimes you get basically one shot and most of the time you just tank through your enemies with healing or getting revived by you AI-companion.

But I still had a lot of fun and I'm not entirely sure why, but I DO recommend you playing Code Vein. So I did like the graphics design. It is a fresh concept of steam-punkish cyber-vampires which sounds a lot more cringe than it actually was for me. And also the plot and characters were very solid. Nothing out of the ordinary but I did like almost everything about it. Big parts of the story are told through memories of all the characters you meet or hear of. Those memories are scattered all over the place and even though exploring isn't exactly a lot of fun it is at least rewarding for the plot.

Also worth mentioning is the way of building your character, gearing and leveling up. Most of it is very straight forward upgrade after upgrade. At least it was for me because I played a very simple Dex build. But I did like that you are basically never tied to a class or playstyle because your stats are linked to your equipment and on top of that the memories I mentioned before unlock new skills and there are quite a few skills you can learn. 

And lastly I do feel the love the developers had for this project. Though hard to explain, it is generally a good, well-rounded game with some corners you are either okay with or hate to death. And I really dislike a few things about it. But after playing it through it was kinda cool, it really hooked me and I am really on the edge right now of seeing other endings, trying different playstyles, going 100% and wishing (though not very likely?) for a sequel. Or maybe I just ditch it, because no matter how much I like it, there are a lot of games on my list that easily might be a better time invest.",1674986172,1674986172,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story is decent, and the characters that help you throughout the story are mostly interesting; the combat is mostly satisfying, although I have my gripes about it.

What I think is that this game fell a little flatter than it should have, it has many great ups, but many low downs towards the end of the game. Most of my gripes are game design gripes with this game, which I will break down below:

The level-up system gives you many paths to follow through blood codes, and you can change many many things about how you want to set up your character, you can get more than one blood code, and mix and match things to make your character better, you can also upgrade them in various ways. This is mostly fine, but I have a couple disappointments with it as a two-handed player. 

The characters that I made wield great swords, but two-handed weapons in this game give a significant speed penalty in terms of dodging that I couldn't help but notice when switching back and forth between my one-handed to two-handed weapons. 

There is a way to fix this problem, but it requires you to dodge the best ending possible in a collect-a-thon that is too long to be thoroughly enjoyable twice solo for me.

The level design half way through this game falls completely flat once you reach the cathedral, it reuses assets throughout the whole environment way too much, to make it more stupid, they reuse the same assets again to build another area later just like it.

The game has various memories and items you need to pick up throughout the game, but the memories are what will give you your best ending, you need to gather all of them. The map will reveal where they are, but you also will need to go into the sub dungeons that you need maps to go to. The game will force you to get everything, if you want the best ending.

The story itself was beautiful, the game had many fun moments, but I don't think that I would want to replay it twice, and I have muiltiple reasons why, but here are my main ones:

The combat while having amazing parts to it, has a lot of repetitive design. I don't feel that many of the weapons in the same style have too many varying features, like in Dark Souls, and while I don't want to compare this game to Dark Souls, I have to compare it on some levels.

The weapons feel identical to each other in this game, but have different skins on them, with a few exceptions, but they don't feel very unique either outside of cosmetic and stat upgrades.

The combat for what it is, is mostly fine, some of the enemies get very annoying, but it's mostly okay.

The art style in this game is extemely beautful, I love the world design when it's not being reused as assets, but even the reused areas have a unique feature that is enjoyable about them to an extent. 

The character creation is satisfying, you can recreate so many anime characters using this game, but I had more fun using the character creation to bring my original story characters to life, I love how the game does justice on customization. If only more character creation screens were this awesome.

I guess another gripe I have is the lack of feeliing unique with my character though, your character is silent throughout the game, forced to follow the collect-a-thon, or ignore it for other endings with no choice in action to define who your character is. I think the lack of roleplaying elements are what bore me a little, but I can't fault the game if it didn't want to do that either, that's just a minor gripe of mine.

Overall a fun game, at least for your first playthrough, fair combat, amazing character customization, and probably even better if you can coop with a friend.

I only got to play coop a couple of times, and usually failed to connect to other players, so that was an issue, but the game was mostly fine.

If I had one last thing that I wish could have been improved on, it would both be cooperative play being better and more rewarding, and either a pvp mode, or something to make me want to continue even after I want to beat the game.

This game lacks any means of me wanting to continue once I beat it, I have the weapons I want to use, but once I even learned about the two-handed upgrade, it was far too late for me, and I just didn't want to go back and do it twice.

Overall, I give this a 7/10.",1587603755,1674786388,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It has a new unique mechanism called Blood Codes, that allows players to change the style of their gameplay anytime they want and this was very enjoyable, but since you can try everything with it in your first playthrough, it kills the replayability (unless you want to try other endings). Anyway, I totally recommend this anime-souls game, and I hope we can see a sequel soon!

P.S. I spent a lot of time in the character customization menu at the beginning of the game and then spent more time changing the style of my male character in the mid-game. Is that make me ... (ꏿ﹏ꏿ;) ... you know ... ¯\_ಠ_ಠ_/¯

As a person who finds they don't play games so much anymore I was pleasantly surprised to find I played this one straight through. It has most of what makes a souls game a souls game. I found myself on edge quite a lot, worried while fighting, terrified by edges etc. 

I did find the game easier than some, I had way more haze (souls) than I ever really needed to use and rarely levelled up (which only affects health, stamina and weapon damage but also makes it slower to master abilities). I had so much haze at the end that I could level up every weapon and blood veil (armour) to +9 and still had millions to lose from death.. Keeping my level low helped keep things fun, I only really levelled up when I struggled on a boss and ended the game at level 90-100 (there are 300 levels if I recall).

I liked the blood code idea and abilities, you don't gain stats from levelling but instead get them from the 'blood code' that you use - which can be swapped easily at a mistle (bonfire). You can swap abilities (4 passives, 8 active) almost anytime. This system works great and gives you a huge variety to play with.

Character customization is good but I did it once at the start and never changed my character after. I am a fan of the anime styling but it's not to everyone's liking. there are also plenty of mods, of which can add more character looks.

Code Vein is essentially a souls-like but in reality it's more like a souls-like mixed with a Devil May Cry. The most interesting idea in the game is the idea of changing classes on the fly with abilities that, once mastered, can be mixed and matched. This is a great idea, but even it has weird execution issues. For example, why not also allow the player to create their *own* class with custom stat arrays?  Regardless, it's the best idea in the game.

The game's combat is very meh. Any good ideas are drug down by an absolutely pace-killing special attacks (that either have mini-cut-scenes or, if such is disabled, still stop combat flow). They are a bad idea. The parry system is also an utter mess. While an interesting idea Sekiro pretty much established that good parry systems are those that rely on quick reactions in time with attacks, not long parry predictions based on enemy wind ups. The game is also balanced around constantly having a companion, and for being under-leveled. You actively penalize your ability to acquire and learn abilities while you level, with no information provided about that in the tutorial. All of this combines to a mediocre combat system with elementary errors. It feels like the designers didn't understand what worked in From Soft combat and instead kept making bad decisions.

The actual non-combat game play is average. The game suffers from reused assets very quickly. The environments are also extremely same-y, and a lot of the levels feel like dead space or padding. The notorious cathedral level is a great example of this - it is maze-like and confusing for no real reason and it feels like a lot of asset reuse. And it loses the most important From Soft design philosophy - have the world feel connected (so that you can see where you'll go) and not disconnected set pieces. And if they are disconnected, have them be spectacular (and not ""ruined city"" part 9).

The game's story is fairly generic, while also feeling slap-dash. Story beats and elements do not flow well into each other, and characters are one dimensional. It feels like the game couldn't figure out how to get it's story in line, and really wanted to add twists, despite never laying the ground work for us to care. At one point a character notes that they hate a villain because they knew them, but at no point prior is this ever brought up. It's just slap-dash and disorganized. The ""memory"" system is also a *major* pace-killer. While the idea might make sense if handled properly, it is just a slog in its  current state. Any interesting story concepts in the idea are so flubbed by the execution that it is just a chore.

In the same vein, the game is *extremely* fan-service-y for truly no reason. There is virtually no female main character in the game that isn't wearing lingerie or less, and even non-main characters have outrageous figures and nonsensical uniforms. There is *no* male equivalent anywhere. It is so outrageous that it is off putting. If you're going to go over the top on fan service - have it go both ways. Hell, you can't even make a normally clothed female character that isn't in bondage gear or a miniskirt.

The whole experience feels like someone wrote a story for a 12 year old, and then tried to make it ""adult"" by just tossing every female into lingerie. It comes off as a sophomoric attempt to seem ""edgy."" In fact, Code Vein could be better understood as a Chunibyo's attempt at an ""adult game"" with blood, breasts, and battle. Code Vein feels like a twelve year old trying to fit in at the Dark Souls adult table.

There are neat enough ideas to warrant a play through, and I had fun at times. But this is a *deeply* flawed game and if you're looking for something similar, play Dark Souls 1-3, Sekiro, and Elden Ring first. Coming from Elden Ring (as my last 3d souls-like) to this, it really highlights just how *lesser* Code Vein is to that game.

If you can find it on sale (I got it for about $10) it's worth grabbing if you're curious and like Souls Like. It is not worth $60 and it is a *joke* that the game is still offered for that if not on sale.",1674455402,1674455402,False,1,0,0.50120919942855835,0,True,False,False

Update 2023 review:

- Map design is HORRENDOUS, claustrophobic design with absolutely no originality and a never-ending ""find a lever to open that door that leads to another lever that opens that other door to find a lever that opens that other door""

- The absolute worst 15 minutes interactive cutscenes where your character is forced to walk extremely slow in some ""dream"" or whatever, absolutely frustrating to the highest degree

- Combat is ""ok"" at best, very rigid

Like Bayonetta or Devil may Cry.    But you are stuck with a souls-like mechanic.  While the enemies get the hack and slash mechanic.   Feels like you just never have any stamina.   And enemies can 1 - 2 hit you at like all the time regardless your health.  Pretty sure their damage is by percent.   And it grows depending on your lvl to ensure you are never getting strong.   There is a special bar that fills up and lets ya do something extra depending on ya build.  Enemies get that too and it fills up so fast for them they basically spamming their super 1 hit kill attacks.   I don't think blocking actually works.   Enemies get shields that block everything.  You get no shield and they can break through your guard and deplete ya stamina in a hit.   Once a hit from the enemy connects ya boned.  All you can do is sit there and wait until the combo is over.   And you'll often have  multiple enemies hitting you with a combo.   Just put the controller down and wait to die.  Cause you not going to escape.  Your stamina was gone the second the combo started so you aren't going to be rolling out of the combo any time soon.   

Visually the game is purdy.   Most the females are very heavily ""gifted"".   The character customization is pretty cool.  And the whole class customizing did seem pretty neat.

There is a lot of them and different types and styles and you have little passive or active abilities to choose from on the side with fighting play style to also choose from.

Was going to write a long exhaustive review but came to the conclusion it feels like it doesn't really deserve it. But made sure to call out what in my opinion was important.

Character Art/Design is actually top notion but completely disjointed from literally every aspect of the game, so it's pointless :upsidedownsmiley:
Environment Art is sometimes great but usually bad (Also sometimes disjointed from the game, but no where near as bad as Character Art/Design)
Level design / Enemy placement is sometimes good but usually awful
Combat & AI Design & Engineering: I feel like was brought in last minute and given an extreme and impossible deadline or was a very small team or something there's just a few questionable decisions here and not much work put into Enemies even though you fight them 95% of the time, while a lot of work was put into some of the bosses (Not the final 4 I can tell you that), but ultimately wasted because they are easy and short experiences that make up prob less than 5% of the time playing.

It would be in my top 10 if its characters were fully developed, this game had so much potential. It dropped the ball in a lot of areas and I think the main one being how they fleshed out characters through the equivalent of holotapes/audio logs. They incentivized watching these in return for skills which would have been fine but this being the only way to learn about specific characters got old. The lack of any sidequests or ways to really bond with this cast of characters make it a struggle to find a reason to care about some of them. Watching someone's memories from the past and not making new ones with them is wasted potential. Near the end of the game I felt disconnected with some of the squad because they hadn't been relevant in the story in such a long time. Jack and Eva were better developed characters than Louis who you meet in the very beginning which is disappointing. Aside from the story the gameplay is relatively good but not fantastic. The general area design is bad but it makes up for it with the combat. If there's one thing this game does well is its large variety of viable weapons/spells/builds. Being able to do things like buffing yourself to do 10x damage or stunlock the enemy keeps it fresh and entertaining. To end on a closing note, regardless of what I've said, if an anime souls-like sounds interesting you should give this a shot. It can be rough around the edges but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't having fun the whole way through. Even if I wished the game to be more than what it was I still enjoying myself despite its many faults. If a code vein 2 ever comes out and they learn from their mistakes I would 100% recommend.

A strong story, the odd cheesy line here and there but the plot and overall arcs of the characters are memorable and compelling.

Game-play is heavily darksouls inspired yet tamer (basically easier dark souls.) With a good variety of weapons and armour types to mess around with to keep things fresh, oh there's also ranged attacks like spellcasting and guns.

Also, this game often goes on sale for like 20 bucks, I finished the game with the ""best ending"" (longest to get) in 31.5 hours there is still a few loose ends i'd estimate to take me another 5 hours to wrap up, so value for money is extremely good.

[b] Pros: [/b]
[list]
[*]Good story. I didn't know this one has multiple endings. So better to achieve / watch all the endings for full impact. Also get all the memories. The characters have interesting backstories. 
[*]For players that are just starting or would like to dive into souls / souls-like games, this game could be for you. Not very punishing. I even finished the game without upgrading the amount of heals I can use because I didn't check there was an item for its upgrade. Also, if you want a challenge, you can opt to play without a partner.
[*]Waifus and nakama power.
[/list]

[b] Cons: [/b]
[list]
[*]There are areas that are badly designed. One I can particularly think is the cathedral. The visuals are pretty but it's just so huge compared to the other areas and can easily get lost. Curse that area.
[*]The final boss is badly designed, IMHO. Tip: When you battle the final boss, don't target lock him.

This is [i]not[/i] weeb dark souls (the tiddies are still there for sure tho so that's nice) and I can't fail to pinpoint why exactly that is. The floaty and weightless combat? The simple character leveling? The lackluster bosses (who sometimes have da anime tiddies) The constant stream of special abilities that makes this feel like some mmo action adventure, further simplifying the combat?

Played with the Japanese dub like the total weeb I am after the first attempt with the English dub made me wrongfully assume the English VA lackluster performances made the story uninteresting, nah that's just the story all by itself.

Character creation is probably the highlight of this game, but then you realize that supposedly replaces finding unique sets of armor to customize and change your appearance as you progress the game like pretty much any other game (outside of a fucking cape I guess).

Cons:
In my experience, the game will often just f*cking refuse to let you attack or block, even when at full stamina and hitting the attack / block button, it will just not let you do that. I have no clue if this is an issue anyone else has had but it was incredibly annoying. But other than that Issue, I have no other real negatives to give, aside from the partners really taking away from the challenge in most boss fights except the DLC ones.

Despite me going out of my way to gather everything, it took me a total of 50 hours to finish the whole game. I didn't bother with the DLCs yet, though.

Most of the characters are just kind of eh. They're there, they serve your usual cliche roles and most of them feel like little more than plot devices. Some of their stories are so far-fetched it's just absurd to listen to them explain how tragic they are. Some work okay but the story-telling fall flats when the music is so insanely out of tempo. Somebody could be explaining how they bit their own arm off to survive and the orchestra will go so hard you'd think you're fighting a boss.

The graphics are no more than fine. It looks decent at max but the art style just isn't good enough to really make it stand out. Many environments end up looking cluttered and conflicted as to what they want to pull off, with themes clashing like crazy in the same areas. An area can try to be gothic and epic but at the same time you'll have plain slabs of concrete mixed into it and it just looks plain bad. They also really need to tone down the bloom, it's goddamn everywhere and it looks incredibly cheap.

As for combat, it's fun! Combat is the part I enjoyed most of the game. It's not as tense as bloodborne or as well-balanced as dark souls but it strikes a fine balance between being punishing and being easy enough to feel a bit like a power trip. Throughout most of the game, even when you're learning new things and experimenting, you do feel like you're never really threatened until a boss enters the fray. 

A word of warning though. Hitboxes are frankly awful. I've never had so many moments where I think to myself ""Why didn't I take damage just now?"" or ""How are all these attacks misses? I'm literally inside the boss and they're not taking damage""
It happened far too often to be just a miscalculation, or a fluke. It's especially common when you try to strike an enemy that's on the ground. Even if you do an over-head slash to reach the enemy while they're low, you can miss several hits. Bad hitboxes or extremely long i-frames, I'm not sure. End result is the same.

I didn't play much multiplayer, only in Fake-Anor-Londo, where I summoned a random player in the hopes of them helping me sniff the right path out. (I did eventually manage to find the path and the cooperator helped me fight a bit) 
Multiplayer is nice. It's not as restrictive as Dark Souls, Bloodborne and so on. You can have an NPC by your side and still call a cooperator which is cool. Basic for a souls-like but still nice that they didn't punish you in any way for having your NPC alongside you. 
I didn't notice any major network hiccups during coop play. 

But speaking of the NPC partners... 
I stuck with Io, one of main characters as far as the main plot goes, simply because I figured there might be some kind of secret story arc or whatever. In the end, I'm not sure if that affected the story at all but I did notice that for somebody whose whole gimmick it is to be very quiet, she spoke... A LOT. The NPCs have certain points where they will drop comments on what is happening or what you're looking at and uh, she would comment alright. Repeatedly. Regarding the same thing. Multiple times in a row. Sometimes she had so many comments lined up that she kept talking for a minute or more. This is especially true for the last 2 areas in the game. The partners start talking way, way too much in those two areas and it feels incredibly sudden. Your partner goes from just saying random things like ""Oh, you should heal!"" and ""Do you like traveling with me?"" to suddenly dropping multi-sentence voice clips of them explaining how oh-so-eye-opening your travels have been, immediately after shouting in pain and then telling you they are out of healing. 

That's kind of a nitpick, to be entirely reasonable but I started noticing how weird the voice lines got after I went through the snow area and realized the partners will repeatedly comment on this one steel girder you spot upon entering the area, and they will do so every single time you pass it. I walked up and down the snowy slope just to try it and they did legitimately spam the line nonstop if you let them. 

In essense, Code Vein is an okay game. The amount of tinkering you can do with classes and gear, as well as picking partners, leads to a game that despite having a fairly average story length-wise (and quality as well I suppose) it does offer a lot of replay value. Multiple endings, a myriad of combinations you can try in combat - there's a lot to like, even though the gameplay can feel wonky at times. To try everything, you do require at least two playthroughs - some actions in the story lock you out of certain ""Blood codes"", or classes. 

tl;dr:
It's okay - fun combat, plenty of build-variety in the classes. Some fun weapons too. Story's average. Art-style is all over the place. Music's forgettable, sadly. Genuinely can't remember a single piece of music from the game.",1672787050,1672787050,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Cons 
No head tracking for player interaction.
No actual camera lock when conversing with npcs. 
FPS Pacing is not top tier. Use RTSS.
The difficulty is fine for its genre, be warned to new players though.
Bugs and crashes.
Performance drops sometimes, elevator loading screens or simply panning the camera too quickly will gib u fps drops.


So why did I complain about headtracking and how npc interaction works? Because Persona 5 Royal spoiled me so much on that aspect. When you converse with npcs the camera should lock and to exit is to either complete the dialogue or press B. I cannot appreciate the dialogue if the one I'm talking to is zoomed out as hecc or there's no focus in terms of camera.

In the 3D models you'll see some clipping, but that's kinda fine given the characters, equipment, and anime style. Even in other Anime style games, you'll see some clipping also.

I bought the deluxe bundle on sale and you should. Do not buy the DLCs base price.

Pros:
-Nice anime aesthetics and world
-Character creation is really great
-Combat is better than some others in the genre

Cons:
-Storyline is utterly dull, souls games while not having a clear story or alot of dialogue have better story
-Voice acting is eh
-Bosses are sponges with ridiculous stun locks that make them less of a challenge you feel good about and more of a migraine you're just glad to have finished.
-Enemies are either really stupidly easy or just....annoying there is no inbetween
-Level ups are almost pointless, mostly netting HP and scaling is more on weapons/gear you obtain
-You will find more swords seemingky then other weapon types making preferring bayonets and some weapons frustrating.

Its a B tier soulslike build simulator with a lot of story.

The Good:
- story is main selling point,
- decent build simulator, a lot of things to tinker with, altough weapons and armors are few and similar on most part,
- pretty deep character creation,
- 40h+ of decent content, excluding dlcs and post endgame stuff,
- can still scratch that soulslike itch if you played other games already,

The Bad:
- I personally dont like an npc cuck following me around and i didnt like chunk of the game is balanced around having one, you can turn companion off (which i did right away) but things like invasions and some of multi enemy fights (1 boss fight in perticular) is absolute cancer if done solo, having enemies that spam quick aoe attacks endlessly with no breaks in between (looking at you Boreal Brute) is bad design, especially if you have to fight more than one at a time,
- gameplay wise this is B tier soulslike, despite From Software name on it greatly lacks polish, things like backstabs are wonky, enemy variety is limited, maps are very simplistic and catherdral is the worst one i have ever seen,
- game is way too easy with npc or human companion, yet if you dont use them some parts like few of the  invasions become bordeline impossible depending on your build, the chain stagger deaths feel like a very cheap way to implement difficulty,
- Im not a weeb so the anime style was hurting my eyes a bit, every single character in the game having tragic backstory also made me squint my eyes a bit,",1672405788,1672405788,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

To put this game simply, this is a JRPG with metroidvania and souls-like element, and edgy story.
this game was developed by the God Eater team, so just like God Eater was to Monster Hunter, this game has stronger emphasis on the story compared to Dark Souls.

Difficulty wise, as a lot of people say, this game is easier than Dark Souls, but that doesn't mean this game is a sleeper, this game can prove to be challenging, but fair, so don't expect to run and slash and win.
for people who hates reading and talking, you can skip the cutscenes, but if you do want to care about the story later on, you can revisit those cutscenes in the game.

I'd say just give this game a try, probably grab this on sale if you're unsure if you'd like this game or not.

[h1]Long Review[/h1]
[h2]Gameplay[/h2]
First thing first, I'd like to explain my initial statements in my quick review further.
[h3]A Soulslike JRPG[/h3]
As I mentioned earlier this game was developed by the God Eater team, so I think instead of appealing only to Dark Souls fans, this game was more likely catered towards God Eater fans, or both.
Which explains why this game is more forgiving than Dark Souls.

For a starter, just like in God Eater, you can have an NPC partner in this game, which wasn't a main focus in Dark Souls, yeah you could have an NPC partner in Dark Souls as well, but they're not someone who you can bring with you for the entirety of the game, your partner can also interact with you in this game, so they're not just there and follows you around, but they don't talk too much either, it's just the right amount of talking.

Secondly, it's the leveling system, instead of individually increasing your stats, in this game you only have to manually increase your level. This leveling system is much more easier to understand for JRPG fans where the game usually automatically increases the level and stats for you by experience points.

Another point is the skill system, or the Gift system is what it's called in this game, skills like buff or just offensive skills in general are very useful in this game that it's almost mandatory to learn about them, but if you like the game to be much more challenging you can ignore these skills.

Last but not least is how this game handles the story, so instead of looking for lores in flavor text of the items or equipments that you got, or just by looking around the environment like in Dark Souls, the story is spoonfed to you in this game, it is of course not a bad thing, but I understand if Souls fans hates this type of storytelling, which is why I describe this game as a JRPG because it follows that same formula of storytelling.

[h3]As a Metroidvania[/h3]
People might not realize that Dark Souls is a metroidvania because it only borrows few elements of the genre, but it is, and it's the truth.
But this game is much more obvious that it's a metroidvania, all the stages are interconnected, there are branching paths in each dungeon/stages, there is a map (which in my opinion is a required feature for a metroidvania), there are branching routes (albeit only for the first three dungeons, afterwards it's pretty much linear), and there are backtracking.
There are even border areas, something that Castlevania usually has, short area that separates two dungeons/stages.

Other than the level design, this game also has multiple endings, but unlike in other metroidvanias which if you somehow got the bad ending, you can reload your save, do the things required to get another ending and fight the boss again or something, and you get another ending.
In this game, once you see one ending, you can't fight the last boss again to get another ending, in fact, the pieces that matters for the ending starts when the game starts being linear, not going to spoil anything here, but it means that unless you go all the way back to that point, you won't be able to get another ending, which isn't really possible, so to get another ending you have to replay the whole game.
But luckily, unlike Dark Souls, you can start a New Game+ without increasing the difficulty, meaning you can restart the game while being overpowered, this is very useful for people who only cares about the story.

Another thing that I like about this game is, the variety of the weapons and blood veil (the armor), to me it's always nice to have weapon options in a metroidvania that it's almost important.
And more importantly the weapons for each types aren't just upgrades, it depends on your build, they all do different things and motions, and yes, I'm not lying when I said motions, each weapon behaves differently, so for example if you're more into offense build you might rather take the sword that's faster than the one that's stronger but much slower.

This game hits almost everything perfectly for me as a metroidvania, except for the stamina system. I like to casually speedrun a metroidvania sometimes but I don't speedrun games that has stamina system because it's a system that slows you down and a lot of times it makes speedrunning not fun, atleast for me.
Luckily in this game though, there's a technique which I like to call, Bayonet Backdash Cancelling, which is a traversal technique that doesn't cost stamina, and much like Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow's speedrunning technique, the Backdash Cancel, is something that's easy to do but hard to master, you can make yourself faster by doing this, but only if you do it correctly and precisely.

[h2]Story/Lore[/h2]
I'm not going to talk much about the story here, but let me just say that it's a lot less cliche than I thought, this game definitely has its own thing, a lot of ideas that doesn't exist in other media.

[h2]Music[/h2]
Okay, have you heard of Go Shiina? the GOAT? okay well, you better remember that name now, cuz he only makes bangers, and that includes the musics in this game.
But really, I love the music design in this game, especially the battle music, depending on how many the enemies are and how much in a pinch you are, the intensity of the music will change. 
When there's only one enemy, the music is pretty quiet, and when you're surrounded, or if the enemy is really strong, or if you don't have a lot of health left, the music is going to be very intense.

[h2]Art[/h2]
You really gotta appreaciate how much work has put into making this, some people might not notice and it's understandable, because everything just graphically feels natural, you won't really hear from someone playing this game who said things like, this game feels empty or the environment looks bad or stuff like that, from start to end, all the dungeon/stages were very well designed, especially the Cathedral, the motifs/patterns on the floor, the building design, it made the dungeon less stressful to explore. I just love all the design choices in this game.
Besides the environment, the character creation is also well made, it's much more detailed compared to God Eater's character creator, you can make (almost) any kind of hairstyle in this, making your favorite anime character wouldn't be as impossible as you might think.

[h2]Outro[/h2]
Before I close this review I want to point out some things that I think are interesting, but beware minor spoilers.

[h3]Dark Souls II[/h3]
I like to think that this game took inspiration from Dark Souls II, which is my favorite Souls game (don't @ me) so far, and I'd like to mention some of the similarities.
There's one dungeon in this game in which you're required to gradually falls down into a huge hole in order to enter it, just like that sewer in Majula.
Then the Cathedral, some people might say it's Anor Londo, but to me it's more like Anor Londo mashed with Tower of Flame from Dark Souls II.
Finally, the ending, I'm not going to explain further but if you know, you know.

Leveling:
When you use points to level, you cannot allocate them to specific stats, you just raise your level.
To change specific stats you must change Blood Code. These are almost like classes and can be changed whenever.
Each Blood Code comes with active and passive abilities called Gifts. To get more Gifts you must find memories, sit through multiple cutscenes, and then master that gift the same way everytime: kill an enemy.

Story:
The story could be more interesting but it didn't captivate me at all. The game is overflowing with long cutscenes that really pulls you out of the gameplay. It got to the point where I skipped everything just so I could play the game.

Combat:
As I said, very shallow. The weapon variety is somewhat lacking. The weapon abilities aren't very varied either. Most enemies can be killed with a backstab and a smack. Adding status effects to your weapons are usually useless as they don't affect bosses much and you'll usually kill normal enemies before the status effect even works.

Enemies:
There is some variety here but in the late game they're mostly reskins of earlier enemies. Most of them aren't very tough which is a strong contrast to the bosses which can be tough or annoying.

To reiterate, if you like the Souls series you probably won't like this game. If you find the Souls games too challenging, you may enjoy this game.",1672263547,1672263547,False,5,0,0.571900665760040283,0,True,False,False

Have an interesting story which can feel a bit cheesy sometimes, but the cutscene and voice acting is great especially the japanese one. I recognized the big names that did the VA. 

The gameplay is quite good, with an interesting build system. Nevertheless the animations feel airy and not  as intuitive as other soulslike game, and some opponents don't really telegraph the attack which occasionally made me irritated. Overall the difficulty level is not that high with the companion help.

Level designs are meh most of the times, except for budget anor londo which are both interesting and frustrating at the same time.

It has edgy anime style visual which can turn down some people, but I think It's a huge plus for anime fan. The character customization is great and your character will also looks good on the cutscenes, unlike most games

If you like anime action game, I think you will like this. If you're a soulslike fan, give it a try but don't expect much

Essentially, the game combines the gameplay elements of Dark Souls, with the aesthetic of a Japanese RPG (titles like God Eater, Tales of Arise, and even Final Fantasy come to mind.) But where this game really shines in my opinion, is that it takes these elements and doesn't overdo any of them. You have a fair share of ""anime edginess"" and goofy tropes but not to such an extent that the game's tone is ruined. 

As mentioned previously, the gameplay is similar to Dark Souls but is more elaborate and statistical. As a result, the game is easier on new players, and the learning curve isn't as severe as DS. The gameplay is very fun, and to a level addicting. You'll constantly be shifting your playstyle, because this game (unlike the original DS) features distinct classes that each have their own ""perks."" 

The pacing in this game works well with the classes you've acquired, because each new setting allows you to ""test-out"" the different classes you've acquired, allowing you to refine what style of play appeals to you. 

Maybe you want to swing a giant anime sword that twice your size and makes it look like your compensating (looking at you Cloud Strife-looking ass) and want to stagger your opponents and tank hits. Alternatively, maybe you'd rather go for a traditional DS build that focuses on decent stamina for dodge rolling and parrying. There's a class for every playstyle here, and if you're having trouble with the game I strongly urge you to switch your class (called ""blood-codes"" in this game) and see if the game is easier for you. 

My main gripes with this game is the level of content and playtime available. I think as an opening to a new franchise that hasn't developed a loyal fanbase, the length is fair. It's not ridiculously short, but once you've finished the game you'll have enjoyed it so much you'll want more and likely feel unsatisfied. 

The other gripe I have relates to a lack of enemies and how small the world feels. Some of the transitional scenes have you walking through memories of the player and other characters and although it provides an interesting narrative often drags a bit and leaves me wanting to get back to fighting ASAP. Maybe offer players the option to skip the walk-through sections in future releases. 

Summary:

Code Vein is a Hack and Slash, Dark Souls-like that in my opinion is a great starting point for anyone interested in playing games like DS. It's less intimidating, easier to learn and you have a partner backing you up who revives you if you go down. In every way, shape, and form- CV is less intimidating than DS. As a fan of DS this is a good thing, because it feels like less of an undertaking than replaying DS and missing something.

Imma be honest when I say, this game took me 2 years to finish due to low motivation to play. It's not boring per se, but when you compare this to Dark Souls or Nioh, this game pale in comparison. Now, souls like is not known for it's story telling, not to the extend of having a cutscenes to tell it's story. Here, even the cutscenes makes me confused at times. The difficulty is also fall on the scale of bullshit, unlike Dark Souls that tries to be difficult but also clever on how difficult they are. Anything else is average.

What they were going for was exactly what ds3 was going for, to give you multiple different sets of playstyles to choose from where each playstyle varies your weapons and your weapons vary your playstyle, but what they ended up with was the player not knowing ANY of the details of how these weapons, bloodcodes, and gifts synergize. Probably because none of them actually do. The stats page for each weapon is SO in depth but the range of loot in the game makes it so that you're only ever looking at the damage output for any weapon because the rest of the stuff you'll find is quite literally exactly the same. 

You straight up won't hit any backstabs whether it's because of the pin-perfect precision you have to have to find where the backstab will stab (again, not explained where the hit boxes are or are near at any point and every hit box is different), or because the camera is freaking out so much that you can't see what you're trying to backstab. 

There is only one viable class, and it's the ranger because it gives you more I-frames and you can attack from a distance. Tried the first boss using the fighter code, and I never beat it. The animations are just too damn long on any other blood code, the dodge rolls are dodgy, in that they barely give you invulnerability at all to the point that when I went to look up a playthrough, I was appalled to find that you are ""supposed to dodge twice just in case the first dodge doesn't work"" - some walkthrough person on youtube idk.

It's really nothing like souls, tbh, it's like dark souls 1 maybe but everything's infinitely faster and more precise than you could ever be just due to the frames and animations of your character, so it feels slow, the ""class customization"" is linear and clunky with little to no info given effectively to the player, and the bosses aren't just unfair, but unfun. Whereas souls and souls like bosses feel challenging, but like there's a puzzle and a million different ways you can solve them while beating them, these just feel like a bad crossword puzzle. Like ""3 letters, animal. Dog"" and the game's like ""No, cat you fucking idiot.""

There's also this problem with inputs, like I'd go forward, but the game'd freak out and make me roll backward if I was locked onto an enemy. It's little things like that that make this feel less tight and yet more constrained than any From Software title.

They also attempted a Sekiro Posture system in this where (and I don't know how you build this posture meter, but I can assure you that I indeed did, somehow) you can do one extra attack that does better damage but sacrifices all your stamina no matter what. It doesn't auto aim even when you're focused on an enemy, though so good luck hitting.

That being said...

I got it for 9 bucks on sale. i'd pay 9 for it for a few reasons:

- It's beautiful. The graphics, voice acting, and character customization options are astounding at every glance. I wish there was an option to adjust my fov, but it never felt motion sickening.
- There's this hub with a bunch of different characters and a couch. Your character will pass out on any surface they can sit or lie on and there's a jukebox that they can listen to while they fall asleep. I'd buy the game if it was just this couch, it's more cozy and inviting than any dreamlight valley or animal crossing house I've ever experienced. 
- They have Black Characters and Characters of Color. Seems like it should just be this way, but I just played Genshin impact for the first time, so I sadly have to give credit where credit's due. Not just that, the character creator is very expansive and fun to play around with. I loved my character I made, too bad they can't fight.
- Great level design with looping structures and secrets to be found.
- I assume the story'd be a lot of fun too, I liked the 5 hrs I played of it. I'm not gonna play any more, but if you're just here for that, it does seem sort of DMC meets Bloodborne.
- The armor system is very interesting. Each armor grants you a special backstab, parry, and heavy attack animation with different frame animations and speeds. I'd love to see this implemented into a better combat system. The same with the companions you find. You have the option to play solo or with people you meet throughout the game. When you die, they have the option to give you some of their health and they each play somewhat differently. I liked the companions, it made me feel like I was playing a solo multiplayer game, which must be what the devs had in mind.
- Overall, the game has a certain charm to it that did really invest me more than most games I play. 

To call this a 6/10 is generous. 4/10 with some flavor bc it's very pretty. Again, i'd pay 9 bucks for it, going in knowing that it's clunky, but I'm not playing it again lol",1671942578,1671942578,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game also has far too much anime cringe for me, but that may boil down to personal preference. 

If you enjoy Souls-like games and have nothing else to play, the combat is satisfying enough to hold you over for 20-50hrs, depending how deep you want to go. If you enjoy stereotypical anime designs, you may like this as well. Otherwise, I'd say you're probably better off playing something else.

It leans more towards A/JRPG than what you might expect.

Some things to note:
[list]
    [*]+Distinct anime artstyle, which looks pretty good
    [*]+Great OST
    [*]+Interesting story, although very anime logic at points
    [*]+One of the best character creators in an RPG
    [*]+Very good JP Voice acting
    [*]-Prone to rare UE4 crashing
    [*]-Hiccups in obvious loading zones
    [*]-Some story fragments are very interruptive and slow (Both optional and mandatory ones)
    [*]-Sometimes very annoying level mechanics
[/list]

Besides the main point, we need to discuss of course, it being a Soulslike, and it's distinctions:
[list]
    [*]The game is much easier, thanks to the companions, and its more RPG-like elements
    [*]I felt only mostly the late game bosses were well-designed and memorable
    [*]Heavier story focus and linearity
    [*]Mostly linear level design with branching paths(if not it's a hell maze), sometimes tries to be DS1 or Bloodborne too much in my opinion
    [*]Easy class and build changing possibilities, lot of space for experimentation
    [*]Interconnected world with loading tunnels, sadly not bringing out the potential
    [*]Has some interesting and good ideas on it's own, which I wish other games would learn from.
    [*]Pretty short[/list]

Its easy to see in that many of the notable aspects of Dark Souls are pretty much just copied into the game and renamed (Undead -> Revenants, Souls -> Haze, Bonfires are Mistles, etc).  

Combat feels like a combination of Dark Souls and Spectacle Fighter games like Nier but ends up worse than either by themselves. Base DS mechanics are pretty much copied in but without understanding the nuances behind them or weren't balanced right with the SP mechanics.  Parry is useful but has a long animation leading to limited windows of execution.  Dodge is there but lacks consistent i-frames.  You can block but still take a portion of damage. Enemies often launch quick successive combo and close distance faster than you can move away.  Many times you will find yourself mashing the dodge/block button while stuck in lengthy cast/use animations.  The game allows for AI companions throughout the game which can help can but is also inconsistent.  Sometimes you end up watching as the AI just solos mobs while others they'll get trapped in a combo and 1 shoted.  This combination can often lead to you frantically running around until the boss changes to the AI so you have time for lengthy recovery animations.  This also leads to you standing at the entrance of the room for the boss to kill you because the companion got wrecked at the start of the fight.  There's also a special attack but again its an extra long cast animation dramatically limiting use.  You can also use it in combo but it aborts the combo and feels out of place.

Character setup is probably where it differs the most from DS but overall feels unpolished.  Throughout the game you unlock what are basically classes which have a different base stats scale skills and abilities.  However most skills/abilities can be ""mastered"" allowing for use outside the class leading to most classes being left by the wayside as once these are mastered.  Used classes limited to those with the best stats for a build and the select few with unique abilities that cannot be used outside the class.  The high number of skill/abilities lead to some seeming to be duplicates or having the smallest of differences.  The large number ability slots does allow for a nice of selection of choices mixing both buffs and casts.

For equipment you have 3 slots, 2 weapons and 1 armor.  There are 5 category of weapons but weapons in the same category can have different combos which gives a good variety of combat styles.  There isn't an obvious way to tell which combo weapons have and what the swing speed of the combo is.  This can be frustrating in the beginning when you get a bayonet that fire is a shotgun spray instead the expected rifle shot.  The armor piece gives defense but is also determines which of the special attacks you have. However similar to classes the armor share designed to allow an abundance of customization, mixing different stats with each special type so you can have the ranged tail attack with stats better suited for close in melees tank.  This makes trying to find/determine which to use difficult as options can be counter intuitive.  All 3 can be upgrade in a DS manner but for the most part only damage is modified so it really isn't useful for armor if you aren't using the special attack.

The world and background for the story has potential though in normal fashion it consists of a world following a calamity where survivors cling to life, dead roam freely and player has to save everyone with there special powers.  It could be an interesting take but the execution is poor.  Feels like they tried to follow the DS route where the player has to piece everything together from different fragments but still wanted the anime style cut scenes and characters which results in dialog and interactions missing context.  Gives the feeling that everyone but the player know whats going on and the player's character is to afraid ask.  The characters are all over the place where their actions not reflecting events that have happened some of which might be do the game branching at times so they have to react as though things may or may not have happened.  But it wouldn't account for all the inconsistencies and a lot of it seems like they acceptance of events is because the story demands.  The memory collection is an interesting concept to fill in background and details but characters barely respond to their content.  The party is given every reason to distrust/hate a character but then immediately accept them because the story demands it.  By the end the story comes full circle to the Dark Souls comparison with the its own version of linking of the bonfire.",1671773583,1671773583,False,2,0,0.479682862758636475,0,True,False,False

 CONS :The level design is a bit meh, and the story is going to be a big hit-or-miss for certain folks (cheesy anime vibes). The fact that there's only 5 weapon types feels a bit restrictive, altough there's quite a few weapons with different movesets in each types.

 if those things do not bother you (or not too much) then i'd say you should give it a go! the game will run you about 30-35 hours to finish, and there's a few achivements to hunt afterwards for an extra little bit of game time. you can run it again on NG+ to challenge yourself and see the different endings. pro-tip : don't look at the achivements of steam, they do spoil a few things.

i'd say it's an 8/10",1671722328,1671722328,True,10,0,0.620664298534393311,0,True,False,False

_________________________________________________________

There are a lot of other reviews that cover most of what I'd say, so I'll get into the things I liked about this game. It offers a souls-like experience with way more flexibility than the other games in that style that I've tried. Don't like your character class? Change it whenever you want. Don't like your abilities? Unlock other ones and put together the whackiest build you can think of. Is the game too easy? Play it solo without a companion. Is the game too hard? Play it with the AI companion. Is it still too hard? Play it with a companion and a friend. The level of control you have over your experience is very refreshing in this game, and there is never a point where you are stuck in a certain playstyle or tactic. That's the main thing I liked about CV.

This game is dumb, cheesy, completely un-self-aware, has some really questionable design choices (looking at that one pole-dancing salamander hatsune miku boss as an example), and it's excessively anime-y (like there is an early 2010s level AMV midway through the game). But underneath all that is a fun souls-like that really puts you in control of how you get beaten down by its brutal bosses. 

I give it 7/10 onigiri that you eat even though you don't need to eat them because you're a vampire, but they remind you of your anime cat-girlfriend so you're gonna do it anyways.",1671555716,1671555716,True,2,1,0.515516161918640137,0,True,False,False

So I get in, spend like 7 hours making characters, and decided ""but I want to see them in action :("", and slammed the start button.

Now, I'm not a ""gamer"". Objectively I am still bad at the game, and there's a lot I can improve upon (what's a parry button?). Code Vein itself isn't a story-driven masterpiece, some things look wacky and the cutscenes are all designed with the player wielding a one-handed sword in mind. That said, the story isn't bad. I'd say it's actually pretty good. 
The best part is that character lore isn't really shoved on you. You can collect Vestiges (memories?) for the abilities and just skip the cutscenes, or watch them all and learn in-depth the story of the character behind a certain Blood Code.
What you choose and what you don't makes an active difference in the direction the story takes, up to a certain extent of course. Collecting all the shinies can make the difference between sobbing and crying happy tears. Conversely, not collecting them causes all sorts of plot threads to go in a different direction.

Is the game itself hard? Yes, I mean it's a souls-like what did you expect? The combat gameplay is golden to my fresh eyes, having never touched anything remotely like this before. Every weapon, Blood Code (class?), and Blood Veil (armor) that you choose directly impacts how you move and by that extent, how you play. The Gifts (magic/skills) you can get are as varied as the Blood Codes themselves, and each Gift or Code you unlock brings a new flavor of possibility. You can also change Gifts, Blood Codes, and Veils on the fly which is pretty cool (and continues to save my life).
Being bad at the game, I of course wanted to give up several times after spending anywhere upwards of an hour beating my head against the brick wall that was map-less navigation or a hard boss/enemy. What kept me going was the NPC dialogue. Yes, you get your choice of (at the latter third of the game, if certain conditions are met) one out of 6 NPC companions to accompany you into the field. Each wields a different weapon, fights a different way, and brings different party buffs to the fight. 

In my opinion, the best part about having a companion with you is the mental support they give, not the physical. Sure having a waifu with a gun or a hot guy with a sword is cool and all, but each NPC will encourage you, calm you down, or get you back on your feet again in their own different way. They don't complain about dying over and over, they talk about finding a solution, and say it's ok to try. Unironically, that same dialogue is what kept me playing and yes I somehow beat the final boss.

Can I guarantee you'll like it? No, the art style, story direction, gameplay etc isn't for everyone. There are some parts I don't like, things I wish were added in, and so on, but the game itself is definitely worth a shot. Take the step out of your comfort zone and let Code Vein bring what may very well be a new flavor of entertainment to your world.

Slightly easier since you have a partner through the entire game that can take aggro when you need to flee. The game is of course, pretty challenging and definitely throws some cheap ways to kill you.

The story was pretty decent and teh game offers 3 different endings. The environments are really detailed as well as teh character and enemy designs. The boss designs are really cool looking too. Levels are mostly linear but can get confusing since the devs designed them like a maze that get you to circle back alot. They do feel rather large since most areas transition into each other without a loading screen. Like FromSoft games, the weapons and armors all have unique designs and compliment the characters really well. CodeVein has it's own style though and with your partner, you can obtain special skills from other partners to use in combat.

There were some minor micro stutters here and there but nothing too drastic and I never experienced a stutter during an actual fight. There are a few clipping visuals in early cutscenes with armors and hair, but is just more of a nitpick really. Running also feels sluggish and almost similar to Monster Hunter in a way, I was usually dodge rolling everywhere I could since it was faster.

Out of all the level designs, The Cathedral of the Sacred Blood is probably one of the worst designs i've ever played in a Souls game, let alone any game. The sheer size of it mixed with the massive back tracking, specific keys, hidden pathways, death around every ledge and corner, and teh massive maze like structure, made this specific part of the game a true test of patience. At times I got lost, and other times I found myself falling off ledges and floor holes. Compared to the other levels of teh game, this part took me a better part of 4hrs to do specifically because of how lost I got.

Overall a fun souls game. It's different, but enjoyable, with cool designs and decent story.",1671379980,1671379980,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

• Combat is very anime, but also kind of clunky, which doesn't feel good
• A lot of weird quality-of-life designs. Example: skills are represented as simple, minimalistic, monochromatic icons, and there's a lot of them. Looking for a particular one is like needle in a haystack
• Far too many cutscenes (some of them unskippable!) - sometimes you watch a cutscene, walk 20m and get another cutscene, it just shatters the flow of gameplay
• Enemies and locations are kind of forgettable at best, and some are inspired (bordering on ripped off) by other games (including a scuffed version of Anor Londo and even Ornstein and Smough!)
• A lot of tight spaces and narrow walkways that make too little space for combat with an AI companion...
• ...but the game is balanced for playing with the companion, so playing alone is like hard mode - in a soulslike
• Blood codes are cool on paper, but lack the option of fine-tuning your character - you need a C+ stat for a weapon, but have C? Shame, choose another code, or another weapon. (To be fair, later in game you unlock passive skills increasing your stats)

Anime boobs cannot make up for all of the bad parts. If you care for them at all in the first place.

The nitty gritty:
As implied above, Code Vein is a souls-like game but in an anime universe. As a person who has tried playing Dark Souls one 6 or 7 times and not finished it once, I can say that Code Vein does things differently, and in my personal opinion it does those things better than Dark Souls (since I continued playing all the way through, unlike Dark Souls).

With that out of the way, the good:
*Gameplay mechanics are quite interesting and dare I say unique. Some things are of course ""borrowed"" from other souls like games, however there are unique aspects that made it different and interesting (mainly the blood code system and various skills.
Control of your character, unlike in Dark Souls is quite responsive and quick which at least makes you feel like you're more in control of your character.
*Story - while not something earth-shattering, the story is unique and at times quite interesting. 

The okay:
*Character development - During the span of the game I did become attached to a couple of the characters (namely Yakumo and Louis), but some of the other characters I just couldn't force myself to care about. Maybe that says something about me, but I'm leaning towards the writing for the characters. It seems like some trauma is introduced at random and I just struggled to connect with the characters. That being said it wasn't all bad so this lands in this middle section.
*Map design - Whilst generally the maps are okay and have a degree of variance to them, I take particular issue with the cathedral and also extensive reuse of the assets from it in a lot of other maps.

The bad:
*Controls - despite the responsiveness of the controls, this definitely feels like a ported game. The default controls for keyboard and mouse are atrocious and I highly recommend using a controller to play this game.
*Aspect-ratio - it seems Bandai Namco continues to not support 21:9 aspect ratios, which is really odd to me, especially for a game released in 2019 and even more so when support for it is ""technically"" in the game, but is just obfuscated.
*Optimisation - this game has some bad optimisation issues. Playing on 3440x1440 with everything maxed on an RTX 3070 I would easilly hit my frame limit of 144Hz, but at certain times during regular gameplay this framerate would absolutely crater into the ~60 range with bad stuttering (but would then recover within a fraction of a second). This made the game feel choppy and laggy at times, despite my hardware being fully capable of running this game full tilt.
*Achievements - I hate it when games have achievements that are basically impossible to achieve or are unbelievably difficult to achieve just for the hell of it. This game is no exception and whilst the majority of the achievements are not very difficult to get, there's one in particular that forces you to grind tens of hours to achieve and even more if you dont have a friend to play with. This is bad design.
*DLC - the DLCs really shouldnt be DLCs and should just be part of the base game with how little the add to the game. Dont believe me? Have a look at the individual reviews for them.

Summary:
Overall, Code Vein is an interesting take on souls-like games and I think its worth your time and money if you can get it on sale. That being said, tailor your expectations and dont expect to be blown away by it.",1670449182,1670449319,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Anime Dark Souls is a fair summary, but going deeper:

[b] Pros [/b]: Combat is nice, character creation is really nice, building is very versatile and the story ends up being different/innovative and cool to see, albeit confusing at times (and I ended feeling like many questions went unanswered). Also, the difficulty is there (definitely not an easy game), but it gets very manageable  after you learn to dodge (even at boss fights).

[b] Cons [/b]: Game is too linear, story drags on for quite some time and only gets interesting from the mid-game onwards (before that you really have no idea why you're doing all that stuff), enemies and most maps are between the boring and the uninspiring. [b] TOO MANY SEXUALIZED CHARACTERS: why the hell is every female NPC wearing rags or super revealing clothes? [/b] Seeing that only in the female characters made me feel like a creep. 
Albeit the skills are very varied, there's not many viable weapons and ""armors"", so I ended up using the same bunch of equipments for most of the game.

Not entirely unplayable, just make sure you are not very easy to get frustrated if you want to enjoy your time. From my personal experience, I cannot bring myself to recommend this game as it is at the moment. If my opinion change further into the game, I will update this review. (UPDATE: Finished the game, opinion stands).

SPOILERS WARNING.

- Level design: Maze simulator, and not 2D maze, it's 3D maze. Finally lost it after 5 hours walking around in the cathedral. Apparently it is quite universal that this is the infamously most notorious level of this game, so I hope it get better. Quite a few dead-end that does not reward anything (some big empty rooms that have reward worth one trash mob money, for example: I saw quite a few of them to be ""Queen Iron"" which cost 1k in shop, and you get 970 from killing the weakest enemy type in the level).  Multiple instances of ""check point just out of reach"". Constructively speaking, a feature that tell player where to go to progress would do nicely here (like an on-screen quest objective with suggestive texts, for example, ""Find the mechanism just opened somewhere near the right side of the Cathedral entrance""). ""Let"" them explore, don't ""make"" them explore.
- Combat: Decent combat design, questionable implementation. Unclear distinction (or is there any at all?) between counterable and non-counterable attacks, most counters take too long to wind up to be usable with reflexes. Counter boss only stop their combo. Other mobs still continue attacking you while you are in counter animation, and counter have recovery frames where you don't have control and vulnerable at the end of it, so if you counter while face against more than 1 mob, you will get hit. Back stab super inconsistent, and you CAN ""back stab"" when enemy aware of you or mid-combat (what?).
- UX: Game objectives unclear (Example: I got stuck when first enter Home Base. According to a walkthrough, I HAVE to trigger both dialog with Io then talk to Louis right after. If I talk to anyone else or enter the hotspring in between those steps, the story will not continue. I know this is true, because by the time I found the solution I already know what Io say in both of her dialogues so I clearly had triggered them before, yet Louis still tell me to go rest when I tried one last time before talking to Io again.)
- Story: up to now (cathedral, after Berserker and memory) I can only say it's meh. You don't know who you are, what you need to do, what is your mission, you just follow who ever you meet on the way while helping another person and help them, which make the story go everywhere.
- Challenges: only one I can see so far called ""Depth"", basically a small level where you farm old bosses for materials, but they do not scale up in any way (yet?), and become redundant after literally one single run for completion sake.
- Replayability: There are multiple ""classes"" you can build into, and master skills in that class let you use the skill when spec into other classes, which in theory can open up different combat styles when you play the game again. One down side is there are not many weapon/ veil type. The replayability is there, but not a lot as far as I have seen. So far I haven't seen any ""unique"" gear with interesting stats, like a 2 handed weapon but scale with Mind instead of Strength for example, just in the interest of expand the playstyle combinations.


- UPDATE: I finished the game, and decided to keep my review as is, because of some newly discovered things that I found to be negative to my gameplay experience, plus I can't say the game get better other than maps become less confusing.
     + Bosses are pushover, none of them are challenging, not sure because I was overleveled so much after cathedral but I doubt it will change even if my damage is cut in half. Fist-tried most bosses in the game. (Died once to Breath, and twice to Ribcage).
     + Unclear status effect: sometimes monster enter states where they take what feel like 95% less damage without any indication. The boreus ice armor is a good implementation with clear visual indication and casting animation, but the Canoneer and the Butterfly of Delirium I have zero idea why they take sub 100 damage sometimes when I normally swing at them for almost 2k.
     + Some abilities got unlocked too late into the game, limiting build viability (status effect stacking speed passive get unlocked after the 4th to the last level, and hidden in the depth. I tried venom build, but most thing died before I can even fully stack venom, this one trait would open so many possibility if it's unlocked near the beginning).
      + Tease a highly-detailed monster (the horrors) just for it to appear in ONE cutscene will lead player to think they going to face those monsters down the line. And when the game end before they have the chance to fight it, that is an immeasurable disappointment.
      + Gimmicky unavoidable level design mechanic that flat out negate an entire build option. Yes I'm looking at you, sand.
      + Story flaws:
             = The shortest main villain life time I have ever seen in any media. The dude only get 2 cutscenes and the plot is shallow. ""Here is the villain, now he's dead, now you tie the lose ends and the credit roll.""
             = I don't know why Yakumo have a relic inside him, but counting that, there should be total of 4 extra relics. I'm guessed those are cut contents. And as the result, we got a weirdly paced story.
             = And what's the deal with Karen? She's one-off character so far, beside that one time in MC memory. And why didn't the villain take her relic? If she have the power to create blood bead, seize that relic and give it to one of his puppet would effectively monopolize blood bead no? And just from that, Silva's Levy system would be broken and the wall is just a matter of time before he run out of blood. (Oh wait, so the villain is scared of the cathedral as well? well that's understandable.)",1669144494,1669820202,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As I get reamed by the Cannoneer and Blade Bearer I see it clearly - Both bosses are fully focused on my partner. I am low on health, I try to heal, the Cannoneer summons a fire pillar below me, I die. I see it clearly.

Code vein's story is great in my opinion it has 3 different ending and 2 of them are great i haven't seen the 3rd one yet. 
The combat system in this game's quite easy BUT when you get to ng+ ( new game+ ) the enemies pretty much 1 or 2 hit you. So you better be good at parrying or dodging.
You also have a compainion that helps you in your fights and can also revive you even tho they seem to sometimes forget to do that.
There are also quite a few bosses in the game, some of them are easy and some are quite difficult.
I bought the game when it was on discount, it's on discount quite often actually so don't worry about the 50$ just wait for a discount if you don't want to spend that much money. 
That's all you'll get from me, I hope you enjoy the game.

After 30hrs, completed the game and very much enjoyed it. 
Initially it's a bit confusing with the way codes/weapons/armor/stats are connected- but it slowly started to make sense and turned out to be an interesting twist to the souls like formula. It's not perfect (the way armor/vestiges are handled is just useless/dumb/pointless) but it's the other apects are neat and the system allows for fun build tweaking.
The anime style isn't for me , but yet the game was enjoyable and the art style was cool enough. I skipped every cutscene immediately and didn't care about the story , yet found the game enjoyable regardless.

That said, it isn't without its problems - The main ones being that parrying is completely worthless, back/sneak attacks feel like a coin toss a lot of the time, and constantly swapping weapons/veils, codes and passives/gifts can get really annoying, especially at endgame.

All in all, it's a slightly janky, anime Dark Souls with the best character creation I've ever seen in a game. Story is also anime AF, but under all that cheez, it's got a lot of heart.

👎🏻This game is not made for keyboard play.👎🏻
Even after remapping the keys, it simply just does not work without taking your hand from the mouse to hit additional keys on the keyboard at times. The two shift keys are set independently. Trying to reset one to another while already set does not work. You can not have 'Run' shift and 'Drain' shift + left mouse set to the same shift(like left shift).  The game expects you to use Alt, C and Ctrl. You will also need to use the up arrow and down arrow. You have 8 'Gifts'(skills) keys you need to use in battle, these come preset as Shift + Fkeys. I remapped the 'Gifts' to Q, E, R, F, 1, 2, 3, and 4 with no shift. Even with remapping as best I could I ran out of keys I could hit with my left hand while still using WASD to move and on my 5 button mouse. You will need to hit additional keys while moving in boss fights(item use, weapon swap etc). Get a controller if you are going to play this game. To exit this IS one of those games where 'Exit Game' brings you back to the game start and you have to hit like 6 more keys to actually exit.

That being said about the keys. The game is well done. ❤️You can spend over an hour designing your character, male or female.❤️ 

This is not a game for people who throw controllers or slam keyboards. The combat is for realz.

Not only that but it also explains the type of blood codes, veils, and Ichor usages.

As a JRPG - just like Final Fantasy - they share some common things, like sexy-, cute- or chibi-looking characters, a specific type of visuals (models, shaders, textures) and some sort of skill-tree. 
I personally specified myself on 1 of these trees, unlocked most things on the others, so i can use these abilities on my skill-tree and it went pretty fine so far. 


Sadly I already have played the game for a while, but unfortunately could not finish it yet. 
But this surely is something, you won't encounter as well, since i got a questionable individual on my tail, that tries to spoil some games for me by manipulating things - like in this game, enemies (not only boss-monsters) become incredibly hard, though - if i refer to some videos on youtube just as on logic and by using my brain - they can't be that hard, because else they'd be unbeatable and it's not the purpose of enemies in a game to be so - aside from Slender, maybe. 

Currently my char is level 136 already (usually it takes level 50 to beat the final boss in a ""normal""-mode game and 75 to 100 in a ""hard""-mode)...i play it hard, but struggle with some of the enemies, because that questionable individual remotely manipulates the game's balance. 

I got this proven, since i struggled at 2 pretty decent enemies for a while, then set up my system again, reinstalled the game, loaded the savegame from the cloud and viola, these 2 enemies now were defeatable as they're asumed to be - not to mention with halfway ease for a level 135 character. 
Next enemy though now has been remotely modified again, just like the 2 have been before...on youtube a guy with 900hp less has defeated him easily, whilst my char becomes slaughtered at least, when i got that one to his 2nd form and his hp-bar to the lower quarter. 
You don't have a stupid individual on your tail, so you won't suffer from this mad experience. 


Just saying, you'll surely be able to enjoy it and with the 3 DLCs included, it's worth being bought on discount. 

Sadly i only had it once in a lifetime by now, that playing online and sending a distress-signal was answered by a helpfull player, joining and helping out, so best thing to do, would be, to play it together with friends, so you can help out each other. 
As far as i can tell, there always only can be 2 players in 1 session at a moment, unfortunately there's no real lobby-system, so you can't see, if anyone currently is playing the game at all, making my suggestion above a maybe even more relevant advice, since you can use Steam's integrated messenger to team up.

However I do have some issues with the game, one being the glitches when interacting with npc's, if you interact too fast, the game may think youre still talking to the npc, thus you will be unable to talk to other npcs for abit or until to press esc a few times. Another issues is Cathedral of the Sacred blood. That map in my opinion just looks like the laziest level/map design I've seen, you'll find yourself spending hours going around the same paths up and down the same set of stairs and ladders trying to figure out where in the fk you need to go. That place isn't a Cathedral, its a fken Labyrinth. Lastly, the game doesn't really guide you on how to progress the maps/story, Thus in a way forces you to explore the whole area till 100% til you give up and go to youtube to find out what you should actually be doing.

as Dark Souls, Bloodborne, The Surge and even Elden Ring, Code Vein is set in the same post-apocalyptic
world of God Eater. if anything it's a side-story of God Eater, and surprisingly enough to me, D.C. Douglas
aka Albert Wesker plays a couple of characters in this...among them is the Revenant commander, Gregorio Silva.

Now, in terms of gameplay for Code Vein, it play just like any other Souls-like games...with a few exceptions.
Those exceptions being that your weapons, armor & abilities can only be used depending on what class you use.
However, more classes become available whenever you come across these shards called ""Vestiges"".
They not only reveal narrative to the game's story, but also unlock new classes, and skills to said classes.
The game allows to mix & match skills with other classes to create the ideal build for you.

Beyond that, it plays as good & solid as any Souls game, and the story itself is affected by your completion rate of each map
...and also, depending on how you complete the overall story also affects the ending too. There's 3 endings in total

+ General performance is pretty good (I never had performance drops or stability issues like crashing)
+ Story is quite solid when you start to understand it
+ Extensive character creator that is staggeringly well-made and detailed
+ Graphics are very pretty, especially if you get a mod (4K texture mod) to make it even better
+ There is a map! In a souls-like! [b]AND IT'S ACTUALLY USEFUL![/b] (I'm surprised)
+ Voice acting is nothing short of perfect (at least for Japanese)
+ NPC companions have clever AI and can follow you by teleporting if needed
+ You can't roll off a cliff or into a chasm, be it intentionally or unintentionally
+ The ability to use any [b]inheritable[/b] Gift regardless of Blood Code provides incredible build flexibility
+ You can choose to not increase difficulty for an NG+ cycle if you want

+/- Music is masterpiece-tier, [b]BUT[/b] certain tracks get repetitive [i]real fast[/i]
+/- Screenshake can only be disabled by a mod called ""Stop Shaking""
+/- Boss fights could have been much better, but I still loved them all (even Oneshot Gilded Hunter / Mido / Skull King and Clusterf*ck The Virgin Born)
+/- Some areas require incredible patience and persistence to traverse
+/- Almost all maps are mazes in one way or another
+/- Many people will dislike the map design (and by extension, the game) because of the previous two points
+/- Gear variety is fairly modest but sufficient
+/- You can get all DLC content (except maps and bosses/fights) if you get a save that has DLC items in it (and that's without owning DLC)
+/- No DLC-exclusive achievements

- The game has Denuvo (get it on a big sale if you hate Denuvo, just like I did)
- Co-op system is [b]ABYSMAL[/b] (especially if you want to consistently progress together with a friend)
- Low replayability unless you go for achievements or do DLC challenges
- Save system could have been better (manual saving is tedious and autosave is wonky)
- Too many cutscenes and walking segments (causes pacing issues if you ask me)
- Teleporting between Mistles gets tedious because of the interface (you have to double-check where you are and where you want to go every time until you learn the location names)
- Some animations are too long for their own (and quite literally everyone else's) good
- DLCs suck big time and add nothing to the story, so they're not essential whatsoever (you can skip them if you are on the fence, check DLC reviews as well if you have doubts or want to know more)


[h2]Other Notes[/h2]

[i][b]ʰᵘᵍᵉ ᵉⁿᵒʳᵐᵒᵘˢ ᵍᶦᵍᵃⁿᵗᶦᶜ ᵃⁿᶦᵐᵉ ᵗᶦᵈ⁻[/b][/i]

[i]Why is everyone's past stories so damn sad? ;-;[/i] Oh, right, the Great Collapse happened.

Teleporting NPC companions spooked me more times than I'd like to admit.

Elevators are a mystery to everyone (even the NPCs).

Dark Souls games have the exact same co-op structure as Code Vein and people complain about Code Vein's. The only difference is how many people you can have in one session at a time. Rest is pretty much identical.

I'm pretty good at noticing inconsistencies in video games and apart from minor environmental inconsistencies, I haven't found any in the story.

A bit of a rant but I wish we could auto-skip cutscenes we already saw just like in Nioh. Considering you have to finish the game 3 times to get all endings, it'd be a very nice QoL addition.

The game constantly tries to pull a sneaky on you with the enemy placements. Enemies around the corners, hanging from ledges, in the snow, on the ceiling, playing dead in a pool of blood... The list goes on. Good part is, you get used to it after the 5th time. Make sure you stab the corpses a few times just in case. Those bastards know how to hide well.

I guess I'm a genuine masochist for liking the map designs, playing through the game 3 times and on top of those, getting all achievements. No one in their right mind would do that, if you ask me.

The infamous [i]Cathedral of the Sacred Blood[/i] is unironically my favorite area. After reading a lot of bad things about it, I was expecting an abysmal experience, but instead I had one hell of a field trip to the 3D Anor Mazelondo. It's as if the map was designed for me. It requires insane levels of patience, persistence and awareness to traverse effectively. Furthermore, it took me 3~ hours to 100% the map (in NG, with 95%+ of the loot discovered) and I struggled very little. Every other map (structurally) was a cakewalk after the Cathedral.",1624942560,1668708963,True,4,0,0.496300607919692993,0,True,False,False

The game somehow grasps Dark Souls game loop pretty nice, but that's one of the few good things, regrettable.
So many things in the game rubs you in the wrong spot (just like Nioh if you play it not looking what your character is wearing). Where defeat in Dark Souls mostly triggers the feeling ""yeah, that's my fault, but I'll persevere"", the only thing Code Vein's many bosses, enemies and locations did manage is to get me question it's game and level design. The last boss emphasises almost all bad things the game design has.
The story and characters are bland, the only redeeming quality from that side is that the game doesn't shy its fanservice design - but everything else proves it to be more of a hindrance than a feature.
There is nice music, but overall OST is inconsistent, there are some orchestral+choir pieces, rock, 'sad piano anime music', and whatever else. And when the last boss appears it sounds like a parody on a Star Wars theme.
Unfortunately, I can tell many more bad things about the game. But, once again, despite everything I had some fun, and even managed to finish it.

Code Vein got everything you love (and so do I): a simple combat system that hasn't changed much since Demon Souls; cute girls with big tidies; Warhammer 40k style weaponry - extra huge and pompous guns and melee weapons that the Emperor himself would envy; and STALKER themed respirators but with a bit edgy design. 

There are lots of features that were kindly used from Dark Souls series, besides PVP(there’s simply no PVP). If you’re keen on souls like games, then this game is a good choice especially if you don’t mind anime, and its cliches like extremely unnecessary nudity, impractical weaponry and armory, and way too big anime boobies. However, if you’re fed up with anime related stuff and especially its ecchi, then it’s better to refrain from buying this game. But if you’re looking for some not that hard and punishing souls like coop game without PVP, then this game is a fine choice. 

Overall combat, animations, cutscenes, lore, plot, soundtrack and especially character customization are really nice. The game’s soundtrack and character customization worth a separate review. Of course, the lore and characters’ backstory are not that deep and well-written in comparison with Dark Souls franchise, but still, I can’t consider it bad, just not that memorable, but good enough to immerse you in the world of Code Vein. In short, I do recommend this game for ppl who are looking for good, but not that challenging coop experience. 

Advantages

-Way too beautiful soundtrack that highly suits to the game’s mood. (I personally think this souls inspired game has the best ost among souls like clones)
-Smooth and various combat animations, the animations are nicely done overall. Each weapon has unique several animations, not to mention some active attack gifts for each Blood Code and different finishers. 
-Quite unique lore and characters backstory, you may think the game’s story is meh, but
you’ll find out the game’s world building is above average if you delve into the story.
-Various builds that may diversify gameplay a little. You can also easily change to another build at any time due to simplicity of leveling up your character. 
-Good voice acting. Well, it’s no match to Dark Souls level, but still VA actors did really descent job. Many voice options in character customization.
-Extremely content rich character customization, that offers tons of ways to make your character stand out amongst the others + has great potential in cosplay making. You can easily spend a few hours in creating a character of your dream or your favorite character from tv show.
-Well, it may be controversial, but the game has its unique aesthetic which is far from either medieval design of Dark Souls series or steampunk style of Bloodborne. Art style is strongly inspired DMC & God Eater series, but may be a bit edgy.
-Brings in the new concept of blood veils, that allow to use special drain attacks within their normal attacks to get their ichor back, which is used to cast magic and use special abilities. 
-You can change your build anytime you feel like it. If you’re done being typical tankie swordsman, then you can easily change your build for another typical rogue play style or focus on magic or become a gunner thanks to free-class-changing and no-stat-points system.

Disadvantages

-Way too easy bosses, most of which have quite mediocre look with extremely unnecessary oversexualization. Most of hostile npc have quite varied design, but then the boss appears to be another gigantic, half naked woman with big tidies.
-Excessive nudity, most of outfits, bosses, both hostile and friendly npc are wearing way too revealing and impractical clothes. I don’t mind boobs but cute anime girls with big tidies are ruining immersion of the game’s apocalypse, making it impossible to take the game seriously.
-Like it was mentioned before but the visual part of the game itself is also its problem, as the allegedly gritty story and hopeless world are being wrongly depicted in anime styles, which has its common problem - fan service. Code vein failed to combine something gritty and dark with cute anime girls in sexy outfits, swinging sledgehammers bigger than themselves.
-Quite inconvenient map that can’t be adjusted. You can’t move the map and adjust the elevation, which makes it difficult to navigate in some areas. 
-Character creator lack some things like modifying body shape: no sliders for hands, legs and especially breasts; there’s no option to add muscles, abs and etc. Your character can be just a cute teenage girl as a female or just a skinny teenage boy as male. Character creation requires much more diversity when it comes to adjusting body shape. 
-Poorly made map design in certain locations. Some locations are way too frustrating, grey and monotone, repetitive and far too long. Sometimes during your gameplay, you may 
feel like the devs were too lazy to use more than very few textures. Overall, the game’s map isn’t that bad, but it’s not as genius as Dark Souls. 
-Edgy fashion. Despite the game has its own unique aesthetic strongly inspired by God Eater and DMC, I personally find the game’s fashion quite unfitting to its overall lore, cuz fairly neat and tailored, spiky, sexy and yet edgy girlish clothes are a bit out of place in the gritty, ruined, full of despair apocalyptic world. 
-Allegedly interactive memory cutscenes aren’t interactive at all. You do nothing during the cutscenes, but walking through linear level with depressing music and no less depressing blue lightning. With the time it’s getting more and more boring.",1667605872,1667605872,True,42,2,0.740396082401275635,0,True,False,False

Each blood code has unique stats (STR, DEX etc) and also a unique set of gifts (=skills and perks). After ""mastering"" these gifts by using them enough, you can use them with other blood codes as well. They way, you can customize your character a lot more than in other souls-likes.

There are a few different styles of weapons in the game, including swords, axes, halberts and bayonettes. Especially the latter is interesting, because you can actually fire a bullet as well. Weapons can (temporary) be infused with different kinds of damage (stun, poison, ice etc), making them more effective against certain types of enemies and bosses. Nice thing is that weapon infusion increases resistance against this type of damage as well. 

The combat is good. Not ""From Software"" perfect, but lots of fun nevertheless. The difficulty isn't too hard. You're being accompanied by an AI partner all the time, which gives you time to heal when health is low. Some of the boss fights are really frustrating though, mostly because your AI partner dies too soon or because the boss has attacks with a huge range that are hard to predict. Beating these bosses felt more luck than skill to me.

The most significant issue I have with this game is the story telling: the story is mediocre and the characters and cut scenes are very boring. There's also the monotone level design. Most of the levels barely have variation in textures and colors, making them extremely boring to explore. This is a huge disappointment after playing the Souls games with their impressive level design. You're also fighting the same enemies over and over again, once again something that From Software does so much better.

They are mixable with your regular attacks almost seamlessly. The game has a very convenient build system you could switch around at will, though perhaps a gear loadout would be a nice company to that.

I am playing with a GTX 2080 XC2 ultra gaming, I9 9900k, M.2, and a 1920X1080 144hz monitor and the game most of the time looks really good.

The game has some really good parts as well 
-the character stories and the over all story are good 
-the fighting 
-the bosses 
-a map for the people that like to 100% an area in a game 
-the class that you can pick from
-the character customization 
-a small tutorial for some new people to the souls like games 

the only part of the game i am a little be neutral with is the season pass 

But some things I find problems with right now is 
-when going to a new area the game Stutters and or Frame Drop 
-the game has crashed on me when trying to join someone in multiplayer and i lost all my haze and some time so I get a little scared just trying to do the multiplayer stuff
-graphics fall in quality a lot in the cutscenes 
-not being able to play the multiplayer because it kicks me out in the loading screen 
-the game not giving that great of direction in some parts 

But with all the things wrong with it I am still in love with this game and do not have an second thoughts on my purchase

I highly recommend this game for souls fans and for people trying to dip their feet in to the games because I think this can be a good stepping stone to get into them.

 Yes, the cathedral is annoying, but there are several guides you can look up to get through it. I promise the games pace picks up very quickly after that. The story is decent, especially if you're into anime. The different endings do keep it fresh for each play through and conveniently, you can opt to either enhance or not enhance the difficulty on the new game plus modes.
 The DLC, while adding a bit more content, is rather disappointing for a souls game.

-- Pros
• The epic battle music is pretty damn good
• Great character customization
• You can have sexy waifu follower (Eva is best waifu)
• Sexy anime girl waifus in skimpy clothing
• Some mods on nexusmods to make sexy anime girls sexier
• A lot of the bosses are super sexy anime girl monsters with nice bootays and boobas
• Not a bad game to play through in co-op for some casual dark souls experience with sexy anime girl flavor
• Mia isn't wearing granny panties or shorts and is wearing actual pantsu
• Works on windows 7
• Visually the game looks pretty appealing even when I played on the lowest graphics with high anti-aliasing
• EVA'S ASS IS SO SEXY!!! I NEED HER TO SIT ON ME!!!!!!!!

-- Cons
• There's fps drops frequently on some maps and when loading into places. kind of annoying, but bearable
• Playing the game co-op sucks unless you download a mod on nexus to allow your friend to connect to you even after beating the boss then you can 100% explore places
• The weapons have wacky hitboxes, for example I used a great sword the whole run ( I think called zweinhendier or somethn) and even though it's a big-ass sword sometimes it felt like its paper thin because I hit it so close to the enemy and doesn't hit it super annoying.
• Everytime you die in co-op you have to go through loading screen which takes like 20-30 seconds and then you have to rejoin your friend again another 20-30 seconds its super annoying
• You can't hide the ugly masks without the use of mod on nexus mod except in photo mode
• Unlocking all the different powers and stuff is a pain in the ass, I just stuck with 3 powers from the beginning till the end
• Not enough graphic settings to disable certain stuff like screen shake, the afterimage effect when moving around, ect. which probably would have made my experience better
• The game has retarted DRM
• You can't use the DLC maps from the start of the game or whenever you want because of that even though I bought the deluxe edition with all the DLC I couldn't play on the DLC maps and it's too much of a hassle to have to find them on the non-DLC maps, pretty lame. The only dlc I got to use from the season pass included in the deluxe version was ""Mia (white ver.)"" :/
• Some of the bosses are super retarted like their entire thing is to teleport behind you and attack you, it's super BS",1666913017,1666913095,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Code Vein was rewarding, the right amount of challenging and the multiple build options for your character (with the ability to change them up at any time!) mean you always have an option to fit your playstyle or you can just change it up if things aren't working.  The story features some excellent moments, though your mileage may vary there.  The more ""anime"" moments thankfully didn't feel too over-the-top here.  Visually, CV has some gorgeous areas, effects and direction.  

Is it flawless?  God, no.  There's model clipping, some dull spots and a handful of ""how do I deal with this"" moments in the gameplay, including some late-game areas that were a bit of a chore to navigate (looking at you, burning city), but I wouldn't trade my experience for anything.

This game has a great first 15 hours and as systems and enemy types expand the game becomes less enjoyable.  Some of my favorite souls likes have you learn monster move types and boss patterns.  This game isn't so much about that.  

Other downsides are the horrendous level design that makes up some of the area later into the game.  The cathedral is both massive and the absolute worst area I've ever played in any souls game.  If that was the only bad area it would be one thing but the game has others.  

The story disappointed as well.  I love that this tried to tell a more direct story but I can't pretend that I got invested in the games events.

The anime look comes out alright and the Blood Veils (armour) look snappy enough, but the soundtrack is largely forgettable. The variety of weapons and monsters is not terrific, but for a shorter game it's adequate.

The story wasn't very good, I'd rather play a Dark Souls or Elden Ring with minimal story than a game with a poor one. The Blood Code memories in particular were self-indulgent and pretentious. For all the time they took, they explained very little of the backstory. I wish you could just fast forward though these.

People accuse Dark Souls 2 of having disjointed areas but that game has nothing on this. You finish climbing a massive set of fantasy medieval towers and arrive at...A modern battlefield? What? The largest area is also the most convoluted and poorly designed, should have called it the Cathedral of the Lost.

As far as battle mechanics go, it's just a stripped down and less well-polished version of Dark Souls. There's a couple of decent little ideas here but it just isn't enough to hold up an independent title.

The game is moderately challenging, but it's not particularly hard for a Souls-like. I was always running out of healing just before the next rest point, and the last few bosses took a few attempts, so at least the difficulty level wasn't too uneven and ramped up appropriately. 

If you're really craving to play another Souls game, it won't exactly disappoint, but it's not the high point of the series either.",1666592657,1666592657,False,0,0,0.480225980281829834,0,True,False,False

Eso es lo que más disfrutarás del juego, un mundo interconectado, una historia que en lo personal fue la razón por la cual me entrara esta fase de obsesión con JRPG's, unos personajes cuyos nombres no puedo olvidar (y eso que suelo olvidar los nombres mucho), una progresión rítmica prácticamente perfecta, una vez lo agarras, lo entiendes, no lo sueltas, no puedes soltarlo. 
El combate es muy soulslike al inicio que necesitas ser más cauteloso porque los enemigos no perdonan, pero recuerda; ritmo, el ritmo será lo que te salve y te empezará a dar más libertad para que tomes velocidad, con el agregado que esto es un anime y no estás solo. 
Vas a obtener power-ups divertidos y compañeros que mejor te convengan dependiendo de tu estilo de juego, además que no te castiga por no llevar a todos tus compañeros o usar o no un tipo de arma distinto, nah, el juego entiende que todos somos diferentes y no todo es para todos, pero ahí está por si quieres variedad, ahí están los demás personajes por si algo se te complica o por si simplemente lo quieres volver a jugar de otra manera.

También el juego tiene un arte que encuentro particularmente precioso, que por andar inmerso en la historia se me pasaron muy buenos screenshots (lo cual sólo me da otra excusa para volverlo a jugar).

El sentimiento es personal, más grande que en otros juegos del género porque es tu personaje y no uno predeterminado (refiriéndome a los JRPG's).

It has some cool concepts with how you can spend Ichor (points you use to do attacks) to use moves without using Stamina to continue your barrage of attacks, or how you can mix and match the different characters skills in the game to make a custom build. But those systems are just about all the game has going for it in my eyes. The characters got really boring and cliche really quickly, and their backstories were unbearably boring to watch mainly because they never change how the memory sequences look. Its always the same Dark Blue and Black color pallet and usually takes place in some kind of run down or abandoned building. Besides for that the areas in the game look interesting on the surface, when you actually start exploring them they just tend to loop around on each other over and over and over again. The Cathedral of Blood for an example is an area in the game that has that exact same issue. Its a maze like level that loops back on itself, gives you ""Shortcuts"" you never use, a painfully boring atmosphere with the entire areas design being ""haha white and spikey"". The bosses are no exception either, they are either stupidly easy or they are so artificially hard that they take like 20 minutes of just you wailing on them to even take down. With all of these combined things of the story being mid at best, the overall poor design of the bosses and dungeons, and the cliche characters I will not be playing this game again. I tried to stick it out to see if the end of the game makes up for the rest of the game, and while I did beat it I can say that it just didn't make up for it in my eyes.

The story is really good and emotional, I cried a little bit during the game. I love the art decisions of the game and how they chose to deliver the story. The thing that I didn't really like is how that when the player resumed their memories in the cathedral, there was no reaction from our companions when we got back and we just resumed exploring as if nothing happen. Even a simple: hey, are you okay? You spaced out for a little bit would add impact to it. It was one of the most important moment for the player, when they found out who they were before the game and how their abilities are so special. I was sure at least Louis will say something, since he commented before that the abilities of our blood is similar to the blood of the queen. 

I just feel like some scenes were rushed and not written fully. Like the little timeskip at the end of the true ending, where we spoke to everyone at our home. It's like we were comatose for a long time and they shared with us what happened instead of us actually experiencing those moments. Such as everyone turning into normal and coming to our homes.

What you need to bear in mind is that this might look and feel like a Dark Souls game, but you cannot play it like a Dark Souls game. You'll gain ""Blood Codes"" that function more like jobs in a Final Fantasy game, changing your stats and giving you access to different offensive and defensive ""Gifts"". Master a Gift and you can use it with other Codes, and switching between Codes is like completely resetting your build in Dark Souls. The game is designed around you changing your Code, changing your Gifts, and changing your equipment to best suit the bosses.

Ah, the bosses. The difficulty level of the areas you explore gradually increases throughout the game, with the layouts becoming more convoluted and challenging to navigate, whereas each boss is accompanied by a difficulty spike almost as enormous as some of the female characters' breasts. You will likely get absolutely destroyed by them on your first, second, and third attempts; they're all fast, aggressive, unpredictable, and can kill you in 2 or 3 hits. Almost every boss has a save point nearby, so it's not like you have to travel far to get back to them, although throwing yourself at them time and time again isn't really going to get you anywhere.

Having trouble with a boss that uses poison attacks? Equip armour with high poison resistance, keep an eye out for any Blood Codes with Gifts that protect you from or let you cure poison, and explore the areas to find items to boost your healing ability. That doesn't make the fight easy, just a lot more manageable. I was ready to give up on the final boss until I thought ""Well, if it resists all of those, then why don't I use..."" and I thrashed it on my next attempt. That's just how the game is designed, for better or worse.

My one serious issue with the game is how you are punished for over-levelling. As I mentioned before, Gifts can be mastered and used with other Blood Codes. Defeating an enemy earns you Gift experience... unless you're at too high a level in a particular area, in which case you don't earn anything. I stayed at as low a level as possible throughout the game anyway, however I can imagine a situation where a player is struggling with a boss, keeps dumping all their souls-sorry, ""Haze"" into levels to get past it, and then finds that they're stuck with limited move-sets for their Blood Codes, until they move on to an area with a higher level cap. There are items you can use instead to master gifts, but it can be tedious to farm them from enemies.

Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys Souls-like games, as long as you go into it knowing that it's going to be lacking polish and there will be times when you get frustrated by some sloppy design choices. And there are pretty anime ladies with huge boobs, did I mention that already?",1666356176,1666368724,True,15,0,0.687556684017181396,0,True,False,False

Maybe not a masterpiece, but certainly a good game. And it stays like this for about the first third of it all. The combat system feels nice, has quite some variety. The world seems cool, the story is intriguing.

Then you get to the cathedral, which has absolutely abysmal level design and sets the tone for most of the rest of the game. After that behemoth of a terrible level, most of everything just blends together. Level design is needlessly complex, often doesn't make much sense. Has too many branches, more than half of the loot is terrible. There's also the depths, which is even more filler content that just exists to pad the time but ultimately feels like a chore to go through.

The final nails in the coffin for me: some of the late game boss fights feel unnecessarily overpowered. And there's a ""good ending"" that you can miss easily, because the requirement to reach it isn't fully explained. It's not exactly hidden, but still easy to miss one of the steps.

Code Vein could have been a real treat, but in the end, I was just happy I was done with it.",1666276867,1666276867,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Good game with an excellent character creator, many weapon and skill options and interesting characters.
It's well worth the experience when the game is on sale. I wouldn't recommend it that much at full price though.
The character creator and the anime aesthetic in a souls-like game are probably enough to justify the purchase, aligned with good side characters and story. However, the game's combat is not that good compared to other games of the genre and the difficulty spikes might cause a little frustration.
It's a great game and a brand new IP that has it's own uniqueness. It has its flaws, but considering that it's a first take of the studio on a souls-like game, they did a good job and a second game has a lot of potential to become one of the pillars of the genre alongside Nioh and Dark Souls.

[b]Good:[/b]
[list]
[*]Excellent character creator. Can create your own Souls waifu; There aren't many games with anime character creators at this level and I've seen amazing creations on the community hub. 
[*]Interesting story and characters with great designs and their own background stories. The character's visuals alone are probably why you're buying this lol
[*]Many types of weapons, skills and builds that can be changed at any time. Can also inherit skills from different Cores to others. Depending on how you build, can change the results dramatically, especially when dealing with bosses.
[*]Satisfying progress and leveling, as expected from a Souls-like game. Deep exploration and puzzling with many forks leading to different areas or interconnect previous areas.
[*]Good PC Port. Runs perfectly at 1440p60 Max on a RTX 2060 Super. Graphics and art style look really good and the frame rate is smooth and stable. Stutters just a little bit when loading new areas but that's a very known Unreal Engine problem.
[*]Takes about 30 hours to finish. I know it has multiple endings and a lot of missable stuff related to the story. I ended up watching the endings on YouTube, but there's a NG+ that carries over everything to unlock the endings.
[/list]

[b]Bad:[/b]
[list]
[*]Memory vestige restoration is incredibly boring, where you just walk and look at static objects with voice which represents the character's past. The stories looked interesting though since it's an important part of character development and better understanding of the story, but the way it was executed made me feel like skipping a lot of it.
[*]Combat is not a prime example of the genre. It's slow and a bit clunky. Healing is the worst part of this game lol
[*]Difficulty spikes and balancing issues are real. It's not that hard overall, but some bosses are very cheap with amazing range, speed and damage while others are very easy.
[*]Relies a lot on the companion's help and damage output to play effectively.
[*]Most of the items you get through exploration are useless.

[i] Relevant for the Steam version of the game. The absolute majority of the game was completed in a co-op with[url=steamcommunity.com/id/androidsentbycyberlife/] my homeboy[/url].[/i]

[b]Cons:[/b]

- Atrocious tutorial, which immediately dumps an enormous amount of information on the player, but at least gives you an opportunity to test everything in the process. Thankfully you can return to the tutorial later on and read text notes about how things work, nonetheless such an introduction to the basic abilities is unacceptable for a 2019 game.

- You're very likely to get lost in a few locations.


[b]Neuter:[/b]

• Just another soulslike with all the usual suspects: bosses, shortcuts, bonfires (mistles), stamina, souls (xp points), etc. You can probably fill in the rest of them by now.

• The game's storytelling is far more comprehensible in Code Vein than in other representatives of the subgenre.


[b]Pros:[/b]

+ Without going into confusing in-game terminology, the player can switch between character classes an unlimited number of times on the fly, whenever they want, even during the fight. Not only it creates infinite replay value and opportunities for experimentation with the build, but in general it's nice to have such a wide variety of choices.

+ Convenient online co-op, which allows you to summon specific players by setting the same password.

+ The combat system is deep thanks to a flexible character class management system. As long as the player fully grasps the nuances of the combat system, the fun is almost guaranteed to be had.

+ You can go on a solo journey through the game, or team up with a friend online. You can also bring AI companions with you (both in solo and co-op modes) and they're hella useful: they can single-handedly dismantle the majority of the enemies and, what's really surprising for a souslike, they can also revive you multiple times. There are 7 companions in the game and you can switch between them at the mistles. Some of them are better, others are worse, but each of them makes tangible contributions not only during the fights, but outside of them too: they react to everything that's happening in the world and make their remarks, and thus participate in the storytelling.

+ Some abilities are unlocked by collecting certain items and by watching mandatory interactive scenes, which shed light on the past events. This is a rather interesting concept, especially for the fans of the lore and players who get invested in the characters. For those who don't, there is an option to skip these cutscenes with memories entirely.

[b]Code Vein is one of the best representatives of the soulslike subgenre with its own story presentation and gameplay features, which unfortunately doesn't make it any less unoriginal. At least give it a shot.[/b]

I honestly think this is one of the best souls-like out there so far. The combat is nice and addictive as usual in the genre, but to me, the big plus in this game is in the story, and specially in the way it is told. I found it very unique, in a pleasant way. The anime style graphics are also pretty cool, for those who like it (like me).

Character creation is great giving you lots of options to style your character in the way you like.

Story was coherent albeit pretty cliché. Nonetheless I was still invested in both the characters and the world.

Combat is your standard soulslike affair though it can feel somewhat stiff at times (could be because of the build I went with).

But Code Vein is at heart more a hack and slasher, so I gave it a go. Also, let me admit that I felt no guilt in going to Nexus and downloading a few mods to up the fun. The Partyspawner Mod was great because I could actually play with all the characters that appear in the cut scenes, and it made the fighting a lot less stressful (and the story a tad more immersive). But even by making myself relatively OP, this was kind of a chore to finish.

The Good:
Beautiful environments and sexy anime character designs.
Great character creator.
Good voice acting.
An amazing variety of possible loadouts to fit various play styles.

The meh
The combat is...not bad. It kind of depends on your preferences. I enjoyed playing with the bayonet, but it never got as much fun as I'd hoped.
The ending wasn't bad. But I just felt kind of empty.
Not a lot of enemy types and a few too many baddies overall. I honestly think a few memorable sub-bosses would've been better than this avalanche of samey bad guys.

The bad
The story is written very poorly and cutscenes are pretentious and maudlin and drag on forever. Every time I chose to do a memory walkthrough through one of those vestiges, I regretted it. Such a waste. And being a (mostly) silent protagonist made every cutscene even more awkward. I mean how many times can you nod earnestly in one game?
The Cathedral of the Sacred Blood is a huge blindingly bright maze of a level that is most likely the most irritating couple of hours I've spent in a video game in recent memory. And looking at other reviews, I think I'm not alone in hating this.
And that music. The BGM is technically quite good - dramatic organ and operatic vocals - kinda reminded me of Dragon's Dogma. But the same whiny theme plays constantly throughout the game - and is particularly annoying during the almost comically melodramatic flashback scenes. By the end of my playthrough it might be the music that I was most happy never to experience again.

The verdict: Modding made this tolerable. I mean I was able to finish it. And I only scratched the surface with possible builds. I can see how some people might be able to forgive the terrible, depressing story and just focus on building an amazing badass of a character. But as for me, I couldn't wait to finish this so I could play something else.",1664981096,1665812963,False,10,5,0.481240808963775635,0,True,False,False

Do not buy this game if you intend to beat it first with a friend. When you party up you will be faced with those restrictions :

- Host cannot rest nor the second player.
- Second player cannot pick up items, open chests and finally the most ridiculous one CANNOT USE A LADDER. (What a joke)
- Second player will respawn from the beginning since progression is only carried for the Host. 
- Second player won't get the new weapons as long as they don't go loot them in their game.

Seriously this is unacceptable, the fact that when the  host loots the item on the floor it stays for the second player and it's unlootable is laughable. The fact I had to drop from a ladder and loose 300 HP to go where my friend go is freaking laughable... What a load a rubbish.

I bought it already before on PS4 and didn't even get to the first boss - Now I saw the sale and thought to myself, I really like the style and want to know the story, so I looked tipps up for Builds for an ""easy mode"" because srly I'm bad at dodging, Blocking, timing etc. I found a tank build online and started the game, got some times from friends who play the game and love to challenge themselfs even more in such games - Now I'm enjoying this game really much - much more then before.
I may die sometimes but I clear maps, have fun doing the bosses, mobs etc and enjoy the good story - I even think about switching or testing other builds and experiment soemthing i would never had thought about before. Even If you're not good in this kind of games, if you find and use a build you're comfortable with - and there are alot of builds you can make and even more the more you progress - then this will be a good and enjoyable exp. Coop Mode is fun too :) To be honest I never thought I play such a game and have fun without frustration and just stay with my ""farm simulation"", JRPGs and slow pace games xD but it's really fun.

The Musik, Anime-Style and Story are really good, the combat is now fun too after a bit of research on builds and tips - it's challanging or no depending on your build, practice and if you choose to use NPC Partners or and Co-op friends or do it solo.

The only negative thing I can say is, that I would love to have the option to dye blood veils (your Armor) so you could costumazie it to fit your outift/colors.

Plenty of mechanics to keep you immersed and focused in the action, with tons of customization in terms of your builds, weapon sets, equipment, and play style. 

Environments: Lackluster. Lots of winding, splitting corridors and multi-layered floors. Some areas have decent aesthetics, some a bit boring in terms of layout. Fortunately not so massive you get hopelessly lost, wandering around getting ganked on repeat until you find the way forward, but sometimes confusing due to some areas feeling repetitive. Suffers from ""Ambush souls formula"" in too many places.

Bosses: Multi-phase monstrosities or intimidating humanoids, just like you'd expect from Soulsborne titles. Slow but unpredictable combos with varying enders, fast lunges with misleading hitboxes/points of impact, wide ranged magical spells the coat an area and keep you running around to avoid them. Plus a lot of them have Tiddies. Honestly the high point of the game in many ways.

Story: If you don't like Anime/Anime-style works, or have seen too much Anime, you're going to see a lot of clichés and tropes that fail to land, are predictable and uninteresting, or surprise you and hit just the way you need them to in order to stay invested. Typical silent protagonist that stares blankly and nods when addressed.  Can be rewarding.

Characters: Mia is okay. Nicola isn't a character. Yakumo is boyfriend. Jack starts off SUPER edgy but chills out quickly. Louis is the bro. Coco is a more mature Cindy Aurum. Rin is fun. Io is Wife.

The world-building is not as in-depth as what you would expect from a traditional dark fantasy, but it is enjoyable and does not take away from the story in any way. 
The companions are fun to have along and all have their own respective personalities and tendencies in a fight, therefore, bringing someone who would complement your own fighting style makes the game all the more enjoyable, immersive even. 
Each individual map is a sandbox. Much like the game Crusader's Quest, CodeVein's levels can be fully explored (by which they mean all the items have been collected) or left as is. Whether the levels are explored or not does not affect the story as a whole. 
Exploration is also encouraged by the existence of mapping as well as teleportation being available from the get-go. 

Regarding player freedom: 
- You are able to customize your character's color scheme and clothing whenever you want in the game, however, the character's features (their body type, their face style/shape/size) cannot be changed after the starting customization 
- You are free to explore maps without the game or story prompting you to do so. Exploration is highly encouraged. 
- (For those who are concerned with the story) You are able to rewatch cutscenes
- You are free to choose between a few companions to better complement your preferred fighting style, as well as switch them out anytime at any savepoint (you may also choose to play solo) 
-You are free to switch between different fighting styles anytime you desire
- SOS signals can only be sent in the vicinity of a boss  
- Like every Soulslike, the difficulty is what you choose it to be

anime Dark Souls

with talent trees and (with what are essentially) vampires.

Only 2 complaints myself: 

1. The dialog doesn't match the lips very well if at all. I expected more out of BN. 

2. The companion dialog gets repetitive. Although it is nice to have it. I feel like a larger variety could be used.

2 complaints from other reviews I didn't understand: 

1. The labyrinths weren't really all that bad. (use. your. map). I mean, I did get stuck in one area once for a couple hours. Immediately after that it was fine.

edit: Also I've discovered the source of these complaints. Iron Pineapple and other large content creators complained about it. You all need to have your own original thoughts. Content creators purposely play up these types of opinions for the views. The cathedral really wasn't that bad.

2. And the companions really aren't that overpowered. If anything it feels like they scale just right.

Got all the endings, lots of different emotional endings. And i gotta say, if a new sequal comes about code vein, then it will go to my top wishlist. 

The lore of Code vein was pretty sick, It was always entertaining to watch all the cutscenes, even after multiple times. Each character had their own perspective, which made it more interesting for me. The plot twist were also pretty cool and shocking and the endings were pretty well made! The physics on the game was brand new for me, but I liked it.

Gameplay is intruiging, and I respect the devs for their innovative thinking with changing classes on the fly whenever you want and the partner system is actually pretty interesting, but it doesn't save this game from its incredibly unpolished combat system.

None of your attacks have impact at any point and it genuinely feels really clunky. Backstabbing is a constant inconsistency at every point because sometimes it works and sometimes it just becomes a regular attack despite the fact that you're pressing the same button at the same position as you did last time and made sure that your enemy wasn't in any form of stun.

Speaking of story, the game really REALLY wants you to be invested in it so they force you to go through a ""memory lane"" sequence every time you upgrade a class(which you can thankfully skip, but you're still going through 2 loading screens and potentially a conversation based on which upgrade you got so it's still a massive downtime). This is the only game that does this and it's definitely nothing to praise it about. This also happens when you beat a main boss but that gets a pass because THAT makes more sense.

Clusterfuck of mechanics, the game doesn't know what it wants to be. I can't recommend it, sorry...",1665106061,1665106061,False,5,0,0.512996971607208252,0,True,False,False

Code Vein has similar founding mechanics and movement to Dark Souls, but also has other traits that link it with games like Scarlet Nexus. The world-building is coherent and probably warranting some sort of sequel to fully realise it, characters are all likeable and befitting their roles, combat is fluid, areas are very distinct, character customisation is some of the best I've ever seen, build variety is through the roof thanks to how many blood codes (and how easy it is to switch them) there are, and the partner AI is better than most other games.

The soundtrack isn't particularly expansive, with no real music in most areas (like the Souls series) and the same battle themes re-used a lot. There are a few amazing tracks, which you'll know when you get to hear them. At some points it feels like it doesn't have the budget it should've gotten, because if it did then it could've easily had the ""polish"" Scarlet Nexus does.

However, Souls-likes are my shit, and a lot of people keep recommending Code Vein - especially for the difficulty of its bosses and fluid combat. So, I thought I'll give CV a spin and at least enjoy the basic gameplay loop. I gotta say, I'm massively disappointed - and the anime-booba stuff and ham-fisted story-telling is not the part I dislike the most by a good mile. 

The level design is uninspired, boring, repetitive, and unnecessarily drawn-out. Rarely has a game world unintentionally felt so, for a lack of better words, 'video-gamey'. Boy, do these levels grate on me. It was okay in the beginning, but ever since the Cathedral of Running-in-circles-forever it got worse and worse. Most of the mobs boil down to variants of ""dude-with-armour"", and sometimes, for some reason, there are monkeys. I'd take a 10 minute level with decently challenging enemies and good atmosphere any day over this mess. 
The combat is fluid-ish, but the weapons don't have a weighty feeling to them nor do hits feel in any way satisfying or impactful. Walls and pillars are also only somewhat consistent as to what attacks they actually block, nor do they work in breaking aggro. In short, the combat can be entertaining but it also often feels janky.
Now, the bosses. So far, the Butterfly tore me a new one, maybe due to me being a bit overconfident after the joke that is good ol' Olly C. After that I have mixed feelings. There were some decent bosses, even though many of their designs are rather uninspired. The only design I really liked so far is the Gilded Hunter who is a superb DPS test. The Ribcage, on the other hand, looks great but the fight is a mess of diarrhea christmaslights and horrible mechanics. Still, I probably keep at least going until I see Blade Bearer & Cannoneer, their famous comparisons to OnS was the main reason I picked up this game in the first place. 

I know a lot of people like this game for its anime aesthetics, and that is all good and well, however, it does nothing for me. I could not care less about the story as well. So, in short: If you're not into anime and the whole weeb stuff, and just want to play a good Souls-like, I can not recommend Code Vein. My guess is I'm about half-way-ish through the game now and, so far, it is an uneven and often lazy mess.

Small update: 
I've now finished the game, and towards its end there are several cool bossfights to be had, but those aren't the norm and basically every single time you're confronted by a caster boss expect camera and sight issues. Still, fights like the Skull King or Juzo Mido are pretty cool, and BB & Cn surely are one tough duo, but that is not enough to change my opinion on Code Vein as a whole.",1633728880,1664790811,False,1,0,0.493480443954467773,0,True,False,False

The story is easy to follow especially if you were to forget what happened (instance: you did not play the game for weeks) you can go to the spa and there is past check to take the grasp of the story again. The main character which is you of course , forgot who she/he is. The vestiges which allow you to check the back story of the other characters is a huge plus for me, I loved exploring and taking my time taking those vestiges just to see the memories of their character before.

The story is a 10.
The mechanics and the character customisation are well-made (+boob size). Overall 9.6
Gameplay (combat wise) to be fair some of the skills were really easy to be countered and cancelled by the enemy. The range is confusing and I never played it so no opinion ab it. Parry...you guys parry...?not going to say anything ab it. 9.5 cause of the parrying mechanic that I never understood.
Difficulty is.. from my experience since it's my first souls game that I complete so uh.. not hard and not easy.. in the middle somewhere to be fair. (not souls difficulty tho.. Dark souls series is something else..). Overall 9, recommending it for starters, but you have to learn how the stats work, because it's not really explained..

Newbies might want to pick one style and stick with it until they become strong enough to experiment with different styles though, just saying.

Awful level design, floaty non-impactful combat, all weapons feel like shit, spamming abilities is boring. 
""The Cathedral of the Sacred Blood"" level might be one of the worst designed levels I have ever seen in a video game (other areas are boring hallways as well but this one sticks out like a sore thumb). 
Bosses are boring to fight.

Cliché boring story that reeks of bad anime story telling, like all of their games (god eater series and scarlet nexus). 
Boring characters and boring dialogue that does not really fit in. 
The vestige cutscenes you have to go trough to get powers and the true ending are a slog, like the whole story.

The game itself is too long for its own good and it keeps dragging on and on.

The only real pro of the game, is that its a good anime character creator, but there are hentai games that do even that better.

I mean, it's definitely a ""clone"" made in Unreal engine and it definitely shows / plays like it.

-Combat is wonky (some of the abilities are cool but default attacks are very lackluster. Also, a lot of the times I got hit, nothing happened to my character, it was like there was no effect other than my health bar going down. No knockdown, no stagger, no animation to indicate that I was hit)

-I honestly really like the bloodcode system they have

-The bosses are uninspiring and not difficult at all. You don't get any satisfaction beating them because their move-sets are more annoying than actually challenging. You don't adapt to any of their moves, you just more or less have the same combat scenario every time.

-Majority of the maps are very plain and not really memorable. The 'praised' Cathedral area is just a lazy copy & paste maze that is more annoying than anything. Felt like the designers rushed that area

-For a large sum of the story bits they will give you 4-6 separate cutscenes that explain / show the same exact thing as the previous cutscene did

-Story is okay at best

-Soundtrack is beautiful however, you'll constantly get the same two tracks in a lot of the cutscenes

-The companion characters are honestly my favorite part of the game. Their interactions are great and I love them! I absolutely love Louis and Yakumo! All of the English and Japanese VA's did a great job!

The main appeal of this game is just anime weeb-souls but is very much lacking in the souls part. To even call it a souls game is disrespectful for the soulsborne series.

As a Souls player, the half second between input and when your character actually begins to dodge-roll was a lot to content with. I'm more accustomed to rolling to dodge when a hit will land, while Code Vein has you dodge when your opponent starts to swing. I can deal with this, though. For the most part, mobility isn't too much of an issue. The only other area where it bugs me is how your character comes to a standstill when they block, but with more play this may not irk me so much. I don't really rely on blocking unless necessary. 

Thus far, and I'm only three bosses (plus the three optional repeat bosses) deep, the aspect that's bugged me the most has been the environments. They're not particularly confusing layouts, but the scenery is so same-y that I found myself getting turned around a lot. There's a handy-dandy map in the corner to help out, but it still left me wanting more visually from the scenery. 

Combat is satisfying. I'm playing with great swords, so attacks are slower but do heavy damage. Finding the right openings can be a bit more of a challenge but I like that. The thing I'm less a fan of is the lengthy 'backstab' animation. The launch attacks and ripostes are also exuberant, but they feel earned when you pull them off. Backstabs are comparatively very easy, on the other hand, so you'll be seeing that 7-second animation of your character's face getting wrapped in black bandages before they strike A LOT.

The game has great visuals, and a lot available customization in character creation. Level system is simplified where you level up your character in general and not only in strength, dexterity etc (from what you choose). You rather use desired blood codes, blood veils, and weapons for your character build.

Combat needs to be improved as it is very noticeable that the game ""forcefully"" makes it harder by adding AOE to many of the enemies, especially bosses. Bosses gives you almost no time to replenish your health, and that takes sbout 3 or so seconds to do. So, basically you are almost fucked all the time and have to rely on your partner to distract the enemy until you have healed enough.

Furthermore, the areas could be better designed because there where so many unnecessary roundabouts and long corridors, and the some areas are almost designed as a maze. I also want to mention that some areas needs elevator maintenance.

Otherwise, I didn't feel  that I had to grind anything, the game is pretty much straight forward and entertaining.

I would not buy this game unless it's on sale.

First off, this game is amazing.

Raiting: 7/10

The game is a RPG Souls-like with a few little quirks, the game is overall good but it does have some small pet peves.

Cons
-  Cathedral map layout goes from (fun) confusing to just plain boring
- Many lass abilities are weak compared to others
- Except a few, most bloodcodes are pretty copy paste,
- Bloodecodes get picked by lore because it does thing similar to others

Pro
- Combat is clean and smooth
- Spells that do damage do feel balanced and specialised 
- All other maps feel stunning and the music is so impactful 

Overall would recommend to any one who loves anime and rpg with amazing lore.

For Code Vein, now I'm done with my first playthrough, and about to head into NG+ for another ending and I'm loving it.

I wish other souls-like would be more like this story-wise. Yes, our character is speaking only through written lines, but here it feels like he/she is truly relevant and part of the story, not some random someone. What's more, mixing the slow unveiling of the world through cut-scenes and dialog and still adding some details in equipment descriptions works much better for discovering the world imo. Add to it the ""Vestige"" system and the music coming with it... Awesome.

The game certainly could've been longer if it's about the story itself, but I'm not regretting farming the ""Depths"" (repeatable side dungeons), as maxing out gift (skills/abilities/spells) proficiencies and experimenting with different builds was fun in itself.

The Blood Code, or rather class system is innovative, though I can understand that some players may be annoyed by the prospect of ""farming"" proficiency, especially with something unfitting their playstyle...

The world we can see in-game is... It's not anything that new, but it certainly is able to add to the atmosphere and remind us of the situation we're in. Although, I must critique few indoor/man-made levels as they're little too confusing to move through...

Now, onto the DLCs, for which I feel very conflicted. I got them while the game was available with Season Pass and at a discount... And I wouldn't pay full price for them. Each DLC is a Depths/Dungeon area with 2 mini bosses (reskins), 1 new boss... and with difficulty automatically turned to NG+ level even if you play for the first time. Despite the description, the only new ""story"" is 1 vestige memory per DLC for ONE class. (Yes, you need all 3 DLCs to get through short side-story divided into 3 parts...)
As for the bosses themselves... Annoying, though mainly due to health pools being over 100k each, but certainly doable. The achievement system for them is somewhat rewarding and satisfying... But most importantly, some of the abilities of new Blood codes/classes they bring are insanely powerful.

All in all... Yes, I certainly would recommed playing this, though mainly because of the story and anime-style. For those unfamiliar with souls-like games... It's not as difficult after all, but difficulty spikes every now and then can easily discourage some people.",1663455742,1663455742,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

I always knew that it was ""souls-like"" but with ANIME sprinkled in for the weebiest of weebs, and gosh darn was it true. After finishing Elden Ring, I decided to tackle Code Vein and was generally surprised with how much fun I had playing it (I finished the game 4 times). The story is acceptable, and the endings do well enough to convey a satisfying tone, wrapping up MOST story arcs. 

The Souls-like comparison makes sense. Think of it as Bloodborne for weebs (Blood being a central theme) with a lot of anime tiddies (Seriously), but if you can look past the aesthetics, you'll be rewarded with fun combat that offers flexibility and player choice since you're never really locked into a specific build. 

Throughout the game, you can have an AI partner, which honestly diminishes the difficulty by a huge amount (they can revive you if they have enough ichor and the skill is not on CD).  You can opt for a solo playthrough but be warned that some parts are not really balanced for solo-play albeit still doable.

-braindead hallway simulator with incredibly clunky combat
-enemy attack hitboxes not being coherent with their animations
-regular enemy attacks taking up the whole screen
-badly designed bosses and badly designed enemies in general
-getting staggered to death
-getting revived by your partner only to get instantly killed again because you couldn't move while being revived and the enemy is still doing its combo
-the game mostly throwing you one or two enemies at once because the devs pretty much knew that you mechanically cannot handle more enemies due to their aggressiveness, hitboxes, stagger and damage output
-a bunch of mildly useless skills
-a class and attribute system that pretends to be complex and deep with all the amount of stats it throws at you
-all the anime stereotypes you already know inside out if you've seen more than two anime shows
-uninteresting story set in a somewhat interesting world
-lots and lots of needless cutscenes (especially the memory ones where you have to walk)
Then it's obvious you're just playing it for the anime waifus.

At the begining, i couldn't shake the feeling i was playing Dark Souls 2 due to the mechanical pace and speed of the combat, but it turned out to be worse.
Enemies are always way faster than you and the only real strategy is to brute force everything through balance(poise) damage, meaning; take the biggest weapon you can find, activate the skills that help you stagger more, choose a partner with a big weapon and stagger enemies to death. By playing with any other weapon you just make yourself the game needlessly difficult.

Should you buy this game? Yes, if you want to kill time.
Glad i bought this on sale for 13.99, because it isn't worth more than 20 bucks, let alone the full price.

+Great character creation; made a post-apocalyptic priest with an afro.

-Not really challenging, AI holds your hand all the way and 0 achievements for soloing.
-Bosses take only a few tries at best before you make 'em keel over.
-Maps are basically one colour, nothing sticks out. I even got to a map where the AI points it out.
-Every female in the game is scantily dressed. The game revolves around it; it's a generic souls game, but that's the one part that sticks out, it's goofy; the most prurient minds were conjured up to take the Souls formula and barf on it and they surely did.

The game is more story driven then souls games and you have the ability to customise your character and change from wielding a two handed great sword to using magic. The world however is not as interesting to explore. The map expands as you progress through the story and different ""classes"" also known as blood codes are locked away behind the story and some are locked behind different story path. 

One interesting aspect of the game is the option of getting an AI NPC to follow you around. Most do a good job but when you are fighting a boss the AI doesn't hold up all to well. Can also make things worse as the items you are able to carry in to combat are shared. So you can find yourself with an AI blowing through all of your items in a difficult fight.

The bosses are well created and have different variety. Most bosses are challenging and you cannot always just stand back and observe the boss and wait to attack. Depending on your play style you can be stubborn and stick to one Blood Code or change up as you go depending on the challenge.

The Blood Codes can be enhanced to unlock new abilities which adds variety and allows for customisations to create your build and playstyle.

If you have never played any souls games then this is also a really good game to start playing and get an idea why soo many love soul games. The tutorial gives you fair amount of information and you are allowed to change your build, try out any and all weapons, change passive and active buffs and skills however you want.",1607185507,1663016282,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Overall the bosses were challenging but not impossible, though there was a pretty big decrease in quality and a pretty big increase in enemy spamming later in the game. The Level design is terrible, some of the bosses require you to walk minutes if you die to them to challenge them again. I liked the visual style and the characters, but their stories and interactions are very cliche.

Try to dodge? Guess what? You are still gonna get hit. Your swings or shots will not register on the enemy at times. Like 3+ powerful enemies attacking you at once in chaos with you instadying? This is the game. Its crazy how you have to have a NPC side kick just to make it through this game. Like no, its almots like you are the side kick to the NPC bc of how many times you will die compared to them. Good luck going it alone. Camera angle is bad, combat is very clunky, Bosses and regular enemies have ZERO cool down, zero stun, rarely can you cancel their attacks, but guess what? They can cancel your attacks, 2-3 hit combo you until you are near zero health. Oh and no sense of direction in this game, level design is just horrible, have fun wondering around figuring out where to go with this weird combination of platforming mixed into a JRPG mixed into the game, literally I somehow ended up skipping a entire section of the game that I was suppose to go to first and went to the 2nd Boss fight, beat the boss and then realized that I skipped the first section with the first boss. Oh and the over the top sexualization of female characters , like i've played many JRPG games, but my goodness the creators of this game went out of their way to make nearly every female character barely dressed and female parts protruding in a way its almost cartoonish, like the character models are disproportionate. At least Nier automata had a good story to tell. I guess the developers of this game thought they could just make a NSFW RPG game with a half baked story and  could get away with it.

gameplay is souls like i guess. hell they even tried to remake anor londo but made it the worst place in the game. that is my biggest problem with this game. the cathedral part the whole place looks the same and you barely know where to go the game also starts to ask you to backtrack and stuff there you know the whole ""open this gate to get to this door to get to that gate"" type of thing. if it was a short part it would've been bearable but it takes soooo long to get through that part in the game.

Review after finishing the game, several words. Bullshit does NOT equal good design. Enemy spam, unbalanced scaling with progression (extreme amount of damage taken from enemies).

If you die, it will for sure autosave. Pretty standard, no one's mad here. But if you beat a boss and sit through 30 minutes of mediocre, moody, anime cutscenes and then when they're finally over, log out (through the menu). Nope, you're back at the last time you died, better buckle in.

I'll be honest that's when I quit. It was less of a rage quit, and more the realization that I fundamentally did not care enough to replay that section when I could do literally anything else. The difficulty isn't nearly Soulsborne level, you don't need to try that many times to succeed, but it also doesn't really come with the same payoff.

The mediocre settings makes the souls-like grinds feel way worse, and the Blood Veil system wants to be good, and maybe it is, but it never clicked for me. 

The pros are that you can change ""class"" on the fly, and unlock more classes with different abilities as you go. It's a great concept, but it still feels like it falls flat in the end.

It's like the bubblegum pop of DS clones, far simpler, very ""tween"" vibes.  If Dark Souls is a heavy metal album, Weeb Souls is an anime official sound track.  The combat isn't nearly as engaging or balanced, the leveling takes a second to understand but it's incredibly simplified.  You never feel the same level of ""high stakes risk for reward"" that you do in DS.  I suppose there's probably an actual anime this game is based on, so I guess it'll appeal to fans of said anime as well.  I wish I didn't have to choose between ""thumbs up"" and ""thumbs down"" the game deserves a solid weeb out of 10.  If your looking for a good Dark Souls game, just play one of the many Dark Souls games.  Got it on sale to play coop with a friend, never could get it working, playing with rando's worked flawlessly though, even on a 100kbps connection.

Pros: 
- Adequate for a soulslike.
- Deep character customization.
- Easier to play mindlessly while you listen to a lecture or watch a documentary or something.
- Deep modding possibilities.
Cons:
- Only just adequate for a soulslike.
- All that character customization and you only get six outfits to choose from, plus it gets covered up with these super annoying and ugly ""blood veils"", gas masks and these backstab masks, what's the point of customizing a character if your forced to wear generic armor that clashes with any color scheme that isn't ""red and black.""
- Super uncomfortable to play with M&KB setup, controller is almost mandatory if you want to play the game how it was designed to be played, and even then the fighting feels unintuitive
- Mods can only be found on Nexus mods, which means you have to create an account.  Unreasonable, unacceptable.  Screw Nexus and their mandatory account creation, Somebody should add the ""remove ugly masks and armors"" mods on Steam Workshop.",1662508498,1662508498,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Sadly as someone who willingly subjects themselves to the entirety of the God Eater series, I did not want to miss out on this latest me-too from the developers that could only dream of riding Monster Hunter's coattails and are now, of all things, attempting to apply their formula to the Dark Souls category. Once again all the familiar post-apocalyptic story tropes from GE are present here as well, including their uninspired takes on slavery, sacrifice, and survival, all robbed of their drama by largely taking place off-screen.

If you play this game, remember that it's by the same devs behind God Eater, and all that entails for how jank, uneven, and unforgiving the gameplay will be for the sake of development expediency and ""anime style"". For a game that pulls you so close into the action, the controls lack a lot of nuance, demand high commitment, and are extremely punishing in a very unrewarding, unintuitive, and uneducational manner. It's a fun romp with a friend, especially if you're a sucker for anime stories and characters, but the chore of grinding Awakes and unlocking Codes is a heartless one for how little is on the line and how little reward you receive for wagering it. The levels are linear in their structure, predictable in their malice, and lacking in their spectacle. This may make for an interesting challenge for hardcore players who want to wrangle an uncooperative camera and dishonest hitboxes, but it's largely an exercise in masochism.

As a cherry on top of a pile of chocolate ice cream, Shift continues to disappoint on another key front as well for four games running: your character's tits cannot be nearly as big as the NPCs'.

1) Falling off ledges.
2) Getting stuck in a menu after trying out the gifting system. (Very repeatable - ALT F4 requiring bug that was never remedied) 
3) Enemies that can teleport around corners.
4) Lots of dramatic moments where you are walking very slow - that could have just been a cutscene.

So far, twenty hours in - I spend a lot of time in the character creation screen just making characters I'll probably never play and saving them for a later that will probably never come.    Grinding probably too much - but it's fun to wreck enemies business.   Made it to a place that is basically 1 colour - while pretty initially - kinda not so fun to navigate. 

I think that if you aren't running your character should stop at a ledge.  It would honestly be a great quality of life for this game that will probably never see another update.

If this finds its way to the developers I would recommend they put some resources into fixing bugs rather than trying to charge people for cosmetic packs.

They could also take a crack at fixing the hair clipping through armor issue if they want too because it happens to every character with slightly long hair and it's extremely noticeable.

What? You mean it's Souls type game?

Hahahaha.

Wait? You are serious?

Let me laugh harder. HAHAHAHA.

It's a hack&slash. Pure and simple.

Let's go through attacks.

You have basic attack, which is your go to attack.
You have heavy attack... for some reason? I mean, it deals 25% more damage than basic attack and takes twice as long, so I guess it's there? 
There are special weapon attacks... They are there. I mean, I saw them myself. But they are just basic attack level of damage, so... why would you use them when they are slower and more annoying to use? Guess you can use them if you like  pain, or something.
There is a special attack tied to the armor you are wearing. I swear it's there! It's very flashy, very cool and very much useless. The wind up time takes so long that if I didn't have to hold the buttons to use it I could make myself a sandwitch before it can fire. Oh, and once you charge it you cannot move, so all enemy has to do is fire a projectile, or stay away from its range.
There is magic as well, hence my hack&slash designation. All good hack&slash games have magic and this one isn't an exception. You can fire bolts of stuff. Bullets of stuff, balls of stuff. All kind of stuff. It obviously costs mana, which you get by smashing people with basic melee attack, or that fancy takes-so-long-you-die-from-boredoom attack.

Now defense.
You have dodge. Very slow dodge. Your character moves as if they were 90 year old grandma with rheumatism. Oh, and enemies have auto-tracking, so good luck dodging to the side. It's only away. Pray that your dodge gets you away from melee range of enemies as it not always happen.
There is block. I mean, I saw block on key bindings list, so it's there, right? All it does is making you die slightly slower as it costs stamina and doesn't eliminate the damage. Might as well try to dodge.
Finally there is pary. Pary is based on those super slow speshul attacks tied to the armor. And just as those super speshul attacks it's very, very slow. Only gives a tiny window where you negate the damage and allows you to instantly kill enemies if you DO get it right. So you can learn how to perfectly press one button, or just mash basic attack until what's in front of you dies.

The final Mechanis That's There To Make It Look Different Than Other Soul Games is focus. All focus does is stun you (or your enemies) and interrupt your combo if you take enough damage. Yeah, it's supposed to help. If it happens to my enemies, not me. I could play the game without focus just fine. It also charges up when you dodge an attack, I guess? I think the game said something about it, but it has never happened to me so I can only relay what game said about this mechanic.

There are sneak attacks, but if you play on mouse&keyboard you won't be able to use them because people forgot about 'walk' button, so good luck sneaking while running. This is not Sekiro. Oh, and half of the time if you DO get behind someone your character can just forget how to attack. Or if you are in front of the enemy, or beside him. Essentially being near the enemy can cause your character to forget how to swing your weapon.  Even if your stamina bar is full.

Leveling.
The leveling system is rather bare, you just increase level. That improves HP, stamina and weapon damage. There are also dozens of statistics that should be at school not in a video game. I don't care that my Strength got C+ on that math test, I want to know how much damage I will do with that weapon.

Character classes.
Yup, they are there. Not sure why when skills can be used outside class that has them, but they are there. I guess you need them to unlock new skills? A bit roundabout way, but hey - they needed something to look different than another Diablo 2 clone.

Character design.
This one is great. Tons of options, tons of accesories. Tons of disappointment. After spending an hour crafting my cute character all of that work was wasted because my awesome clothes were covered by some ugly armor and the face was covered by a gas mask.

Gear.
The biggest complaint about gear I have is lack of DPS statistic. Different weapons have different attack speeds (also not mentioned anywhere I could see it), so you have no idea if grabbing that sword that deals 50dmg more will increase DPS, or lower it. This missing feature is a huge oversight.
Customization sadly is a bit lacking, you only have one armor slot. I guess that's due to money saving on character design as more slots would need more time and money spent on graphics. You have two weapon slots you can switch between, and that's it. A bit bare bones, but I guess you can't have everything.

Gameplay.
It's hack&slash. What do you expect? Difficult enemies? Grind levels and weapons. Maybe grab better skills, or spells. 

Graphics.
Meh, never cared about those. Just look at the pictures if you are curious.

- in-depth character customization
- gaming but anime
- pretty wives / handsome hubbies
- challenging enemies
- a wide range of character classes
- allows you to mix and match abilities
- good story
- replayable due to the classes and additional trials (and endings)
- not leveling up does not punish you [i]that much[/i]. i reached the final boss at level 32 and lived to see the day.
- io and my best friend yakumo
- you play as a cool vampire
- cathedral of the sacred blood

✿ CONS
- what is parry? you guys parry?
- the game throws you into the world without much knowledge of what to do
- co-op mechanic is weird
- cathedral of the sacred blood

✿ RATING: 4/5
// this is my first souls-like game ever so when i say that the enemies are tough, please remember that i had no experience in this genre prior to playing. at first, i had no idea what to do but i was able to understand what it was after finishing several maps and defeating several boss fights. so i'd say keep playing before deciding to put it down for good. it's a good game and i'm only rating it as a 4 out of 5 because it gave me the ""power of friendship"" cheesy theme from animes which made me cringe at times. not hating tho.

This anime soulslike game not as hard as Dark Souls, but still consider as hard. The story gameplay needs 20 - 30 hours to complete except you're a speedrunner who keep moonwalking. There are 5 types of Weapon and Blood Veils, which affect the drain attack. Every weapon has it's own unique ""attack"" and sometimes it needs ichor. And Blood Veils has variety of drain attack, parry, backstab, and that focus attack (or anything, I forget the term for that). There are The close-ranged ""Ogre"". The long-ranged tail ""Stinger Blood"", ""Hound Blood"" which good for parrying but heavies among of those, and lightest Ivy Blood with unique Charge Drain and the ""Area of Effect"". There are also ""Blood code"" that will affect the statistics and the Gift (spell) some of Gifts can be used on every blood code which needs to maxed out the Proficiency first, also there are some Exclusive Gifts that can only used on specific Blood code.

[h1] Story [/h1]

Starting from an apocalyptic event ""The Great Collapse"" which almost caused humans to become extinct. However, there are some scientists who have succeeded in making cells that can turn humans into ""Revenants"", the Vampire-like creature. Revenants do not eat human food, they drink human blood and will experience a Frenzy phase if they do not drink human blood. If they have reached the Frenzy phase and are still not given blood, they will become Lost, which is a monster who is our enemy in this game. You, the main character will wake up without memory next to the unknown white girl. And the journey start from here. There are 3 endings which you can achieve with [spoiler] either restore the Successor's Vestige or not [/spoiler]. The Good Ending can be achieve by [spoiler] Restore/Repair all Successor's Vestige before fighting them [/spoiler]. The second Good Ending can be achieve the same way with the first, but you'll need to [spoiler] restore all Eos Vestige too [/spoiler]. The Neutral Ending (probably most of people got this ending on first gameplay) can be achieve by [spoiler] Restore/Repair some of the Successor's Vestige [/spoiler]. The Bad Ending, you can just [spoiler] fight all Successors without restore/repair their Vestige [/spoiler]. After you complete the story, you can start the story again with the same level and equipment. You can choose between the same difficulty or the enhanced

[h1] Graphics and Soundtrack [/h1]

I don't know what to say, but the graphics quite good. I have mid-end device run the game with 30 - 60 FPS, I play on Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 14ARE05, Ryzen 7 4700U (Vega 7 Renoir) if you wonder, and play on 720p with Medium-Low setting except the Texture is Highest. The BGM is good too, I love the tutorial BGM and the Choir on Main Menu.

[h1] My Impression [/h1]

This is a good game for someone who likes souls-like game, but not that hard so you can play this game without tryhard as dark souls. I kinda hate the delay parry animation which makes parry a little harder. The hardest boss is actually Cannoneer and Blade Bearer

[h1] Cathedral is the most liked map on the entire community [/h1]",1661557658,1661557658,True,2,0,0.522048354148864746,0,True,False,False

[h1]Prologue[/h1]
Parasite, by definition a being that lives in or inside another organism and takes its food from it without giving anything in return to its host and often even causing damage to the host. This definition includes the Biological Organ Regenerative or to summarize BOR, a parasite that attaches itself to the heart of its host and feeds on the blood, until the day when, due to a threat that humanity had no chance of, it was modified, becoming powers their vampire-like host, these new hosts came to be called Revenants. ^^

As soon as the Revenants took over the battlefield the tide turned, as they had power superior to any human and were nearly immortal, but at the cost of regularly needing human blood. Trying to solve this problem, humanity tried again to modify the parasite, through a project known as Queen, but something went terribly wrong, causing a part of the city to be isolated from the world by a wall of giant thorns and a red mist that is deadly to anyone, revenant or human. In this place isolated from the rest of the world and with limited resources, an revenant wakes up from its sleep, not knowing how important it will be to this place. ^^

[b]Pros:[/b]
+ An excellent character creator that allows the player great freedom to customize the character's appearance, thus giving a very unique appearance to the protagonist.
+ Very devastated and dark world from cities to mountains but at the same time with lots to explore and interesting companions to help in the mission of trying to bring hope to this world.
+ Great use of music and silence to create the atmosphere, both in the moments of struggle and in the quieter moments of exploration.
+ Beautiful anime-style graphics, personally I think the graphic style of the characters, clothes and equipment matched a lot with that of the created world.
+ Great Japanese voices for the characters, both main and secondary characters.
+ Frenetic and fun action with good commands that make the battles fast, while we attack and dodge the attacks of the monsters.
+ History of the world and its very interesting universe. Completing with three different ending options.

[b]Cons:[/b]
- Although for me it is not as difficult as other Souslike games, it is still a game of this genre, so expect a good degree of difficulty. I myself don't remember any boss that I didn't die a few times before I managed to defeat them.
- DLC dungeons are not interesting and do not impact the game's story.

[h1] Game mechanics[/h1]
In this shattered city where the main revenant of our story wakes up without memory, it is necessary to fight to survive, because human blood is limited and the revenants are thirsty, luckily after the city was sealed, a mysterious white plant appeared that produces a fruit known as blood crystals that work in the same way as human blood, unfortunately many of them are guarded by revenants that have not fed in a long time and have become aggressive monsters that need to be fought with weapons such as swords and axes, in a true Souslike style, collecting the essence of defeated enemies to strengthen yourself. ^^

But it's not because it's a gray world and without much hope of a way out of this ruined city that this journey should be lonely. Because throughout the battles and exploration, from ruined cities to snow-covered mountains, we find revenants that want more than just to quench their thirst, in search of some way to improve the world, and with the help of our protagonist, make day to day at least with a little more hope. But little do they know, that they will soon discover much more than what was revealed to the population about the Queen project and more. ^^

[h1] Art and sound[/h1]
Produced by BANDAI NAMCO, I must say that the graphics of the game pleased me a lot, managing to pass both in the animations and in the maps a gray world and without much reason to hope while presenting its characters in anime style, with their big eyes, more clothes and well-detailed weapons, combined with a character editor with a good variety of colors, hair styles and everything else, in my opinion having combined very well. As for the soundtrack, another point that I liked a lot, due to the great use of the songs, or in this case the lack of them, because in several moments without battles, we only have the company of the sound of the wind, giving the feeling of emptiness and isolation. , with only the sounds of the creatures and our partner breaking the silence, I even need to quote the great voices of the Japanese version of this work. ^^

[h1] Conclusion[/h1]
CODE VEIN was a game that I pre-purchased without much information, and I must say that I don't regret it, because from beginning to end I wanted to explore this world from beginning to end and see all its history, even though I didn't being a big fan of Souslike style games before. It's a game that needs a little patience because the monsters will give the player a good challenge, but I guarantee that all the work will be worth it, especially when reaching the good ending, precisely the most difficult of the three endings, but without any doubt the more rewarding. So this is a work that I really recommend, both for fans of Souslike, and for those looking for a more different story and to become a revenant in this gray world that still has salvation. ^^",1660171718,1660836812,True,34,1,0.686686873435974121,0,True,False,False

I unfortunatly stop at the montain, but i do have a great understand of the game.

Narrative:
some anime stuff story line that is between the very good one and cringe one. It is mostlikely already known territory. But the Cenematic are pretty good.

Aesthetic:
Extremely interesting and very beatifull visual. 10 on 10 here

Sound:
the music is good but the sound is near terrible.

Gameplay:
BAsicly darksoul but with extremely static animation and cheated ennemy. specificly the one in the montain that has no animation for is rolling attack that deal more damage then any boss in the game, and it makes him glitch and teleport in some occasion.
The character leveling and gift system is actually interesting forcing the player to try several diferrent style, but the great weapon are just better, since the light weapon don't deal any kind of damage.

Level design:
I am a player and level design that mostly play game to feel something trhough the level design. in this game it is not the well crafted Darksoul dungeon and world. Only the 3 first area correspond to a well crafted level design, after that it goes full shit show. There is onl;y maze without any way to indentify a main path. you will follow the same corridor that always branch in 3 to 2 secret path way. The issue with the secret path way, is that every path is a secret path way! making it even worst and meaningless to try to track the main path.

Conclusion: combine the terrible level design and the terrible mob roaster and you just get a extremely frustrating game that doesn't apply the first rule of a soul game, HArd but Fair. the game is HArd and also tell you fuck you in the process with trap that you can`t predict unless you already got it in the face a first time, but it is deadly every time.

and never finished it, don't even remember why
got it now on some steam sale and finaly finished it, and by ""finished it"" i mean i did most things you can do

a) i'm realy not into anime, manga, etc. and stopped caring for the genres when my puberty ended some two decades ago
b) soulslike is a stupid-term. do enemies and you consumables respawn at a rest point? yeah. but other than that the term usualy is just a standin for ""action-rpg"" and that's what Code Vein is

typical japanese rpg-cringe aside the plot, characters and general tone of the game are pretty great. it takes a while to get going, but that also means that things develope. don't expect a full fletched jrpg narrative with extensive cut-scenes and dialoge, but there are actualy cut-scenes and there's quite some dialogue especialy for a game tagged as ""soulslike"".
the plot is not cryptik, you pretty much get all the details, lore, etc. along the way and both the start of your journey and it's end (multiple endings) are clearly explained and shown.

where the game differs a lot from usual soulslikes is the way the rpg-mechanics work. you still gain levels through exp earned by killing enemies, but levels do not increase your attributes (STR, DEX, MIND, etc.) but instead generaly increase your health-pool, stamine (slightly) and your attack stats (weapon damage and spell damage), but not by much. you can sorta power-grind, but it's not like spending 50 STR in a STR-build in Elden Ring. the impact of levels is less noticable, but levels combined with gear upgrades and the right setup make a hughe difference still.

the real meat of the mechanics is more akind to FF-Tactic's job-system. you equip jobs (Blood Code) each offering active and passive abilities, which you unlock permanently by getting kill-exp while having the corresponding job equipped. 
thus you can mix'n match a total of 4 passive skills and 8 active skills in your build. 
additionaly jobs define your general stat scaling (similiary to From games shown as letters, aka ""S"" or ""C+"", etc.), your base weight limit, hp, stamina and ichor (mana) pools. 
every weapon and armor has the same scaling statistics, which offers a nice amount of complexety. it just takes some getting used to. 

another ""special"" feature is the way mana (ichor) is handeled. even on pure caster jobs the pool ain't hughe, but you get nummerous ways to fill it on the fly. apart from straight up using consumables, you can either backstab (even mid-fight), counter/parry or charge attack to get ichor back. later on you also get the ability to expend health for ichor or a physical statistics debuff while you passivly reg ichor. sounds more complicated than it is, in reality once you get the hang of it, the whole combat feels realy great due to how your combat choices actualy have effects on your whole build, ressources and kill speed. it's a nice little dance between expending ressources and getting em back. or you can straight up equip the larges 2handed sword forget ichor and just build for smashing things. 

there's a surprisingly large amount of jobs, active and passive abilities, armors and weapons to be found and used in Code Vein. standing at the end of the game and looking through your inventories is pretty impressive and so are the potential build options (even though it might take a while for the average person to realize it, like myself). quick 1 handed buffed up damage dealer, 2 handed cleaver, perma leeching caster or gun wielding sharpshoot, there's quite a lot here.

the grafics still hold up quite well, Bandai Namco produced quite some good looking anime games in recent years and Code Vein is definitly amongst the best. on max settings it's a very clean picture, with nice textures and great animations/effetcs. about the only downside beeing that some enviroments are a bit repetative.

the english dub is top notch and so are the sound effects and music. conversations aren't minutes long but transport what you need to know in a pleasent pace. there's still the typical anime-cringe, but compared to other entries in the genre the game should be manageable for people more used to western rpgs. 

the dlcs however are absolute throw-away content. typical for Bandai Namco. they produce great, sometimes even amazing core-games, but have a horrible track record when it comes to dlc..and Code Vein is no exception. it's basicaly 3 mini-dungeons, endgame material, that offers little but more combat, items, gear and jobs/skills. 
if you get the game as a package take em, but i would never recommend buying the dlcs seperatly. 

all in all a great action-rpg, with some Dark Souls mechanics, but defnitly more a j-arpg.",1660741595,1660741595,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are no set jobs/classes that you pick at the beginning, and you don't level specific stats, you strengthen the character as a whole. 

In this game, you have a selection of classes that you can change any time you aren't fighting, and these classes change the scaling of your equipment and skills. Pair these classes with the armor, weapons, and skills of your choice to create your preferred playstyle. 

I've enjoyed an up-close and personal aggressive playstyle with light-weight guns, high-cost spells, and stacking poison that allows me to get out of dodge and step back if things get hairy. Another friend of mine has taken to a hard-hitting tank with a big sword and an absurd number of buffs that let them stay firmly planted in the enemy's face. 

There is one locale that will look vaguely familiar to veterans of the Souls series, and when you first hit it, you will feel right at home if you know what I mean. Other than that, the environments of Code Vein are all their own. It offers light mini-dungeons and challenges to unlock more jobs/classes and give you deeper insight to the characters that share the world with you. 

The game features multiple endings that are affected by your choices throughout. The jobs/classes you gain through the game are also affected by your choices, so if you want to unlock all of them, multiple playthroughs are required. 

The DLCs are interesting options. They are all extra mini-dungeons, but much larger ones than are featured in the main game, and each one has a powerful boss monster. On top of that, they feature challenges to complete during the repeatable boss fights that grant new armor, weapons, and jobs/classes... as well as some cosmetic things that I personally don't care about. The challenges will test your abilities and your game knowledge more than anything else in the main game. 

The Wikis for the game are horribly unwritten. They don't cover nearly enough information, and it feels like the people that wrote them might not have even finished the game, which is frustrating if you're trying to find information that they don't cover.

Alright, moving on to the game’s features that I’d like to talk about the most.

The Bosses: There’s no boss in this game that I outright despise. Though I find some bosses to be quite annoying or the fact that the game has one of the hardest bosses I’ve ever faced, they are still doable with the right strategy to face them. Also, 6 of the bosses in the game are some of my favourites, where I’d rate them 9-10 in terms of fight quality. And frankly enough, 2 of my favourite bosses in the game belongs to my top 10 favourite souls-like fights. 

Challenges: One of the things that I love the most in the game, ranging from Level 1, Gifts Only, No Gifts and more. I love Level 1 in this game, mainly because of the big potential of creating numerous builds even at low levels to the point where it doesn’t feel too restrictive in terms of creating creative builds. Beating bosses with no gifts also felt like a fun endurance challenge to me, especially against the likes of the fun bosses in the game

Character creation: Though it’s pretty lacking on the clothing selection department, the other parts of the character creation are amazing, notably the hairstyle variety and the accessories. 

Weapon/Build Variety: Like I said before, it’s diverse especially in Level 1 playthroughs and I like the blood code system because of that. For the weapons though, I’d wish there’s more variety added into it, like having Axes as their own weapon type whilst adding more of them, Twin Blade weapons or even fist type weapons to punch your way to victory.

Maps: They’re visually beautiful and I especially love the maps involving castle-like structures like Crypt Spire and the final map. Though there’s one map that felt too long since I got to memorize the pathing to get to the bosses without wasting time but it’s one of my favourite maps visually.

NPC Partners: I couldn’t say much about it since I played the game solo most of the time but they can be pretty fun to bring along, especially in Photo Mode but other than that I just soloed the game since I just find it more fun to play the game that way.

Photo Mode: I love this feature. This is one of the first games that gave me a chance to try out in-game photography and I can say that I love what the game provided in photo mode. 

Story: Story-wise, I find it interesting since I feel like the game has more than just one story to tell due to vestiges being able to tell stories of various revenants before the main game story even began. My favourite stories out of all of them are mainly from the Successors’ PoV.

DLC: I find the DLCs to be a missed potential. If anything, I’d like a DLC where we get a chance to fight the actual Queen but now I can only wait for the modders in this game to make it possible. The bosses in the DLC felt like it isn’t really unique since they are based from Hannibal, Marduk and Dyaus Pita from the God Eater series but they have their own charms (Hellfire Knight is one of the fun bosses in the DLC though I’d give it an 8 due to previous experiences of having fought something very similar that’s one of my favourite enemies in GE)

That’s pretty much everything that I’d like to cover about this game. Though there are some downsides that I feel like it could’ve been better, the upsides are what made the game replayable for me.

There's a lot to admire about this game, and it all kept me entertained for a solid 800+ hours. There are too, however, a few areas where this game falls short, and I will cover everything I can think of. Of course, I am not much of a gamer, so take it all in with a grain of salt. If you are not one to entertain the ravings of a fanatic, refer to the bottom for a TL;DR.

Graphics: 9/10; I bought this game expecting decent graphics. In reality, I was blown away. Short of a few inconsequential low-res textures, some visible polys, and a few clipping issues, this game looks incredible.

Combat: 8/10; Overall, the combat in this game was enjoyable and challenging, but frustrating at times. I played one character on one save for all 800 hours, so I'd like to think I have a good feel for everything; I have experimented with a great variety of builds and combat styles. All of them had their shortcomings, strengths, and one thing in common: they were all fun. However, the combat left a few things to be desired. For one, your gift resource (Ichor) is difficult to recover and too easy to burn through. For another, a lot of offensive buffs don't last nearly as long as they should to be effective. Finally, and what is in my humble opinion the biggest flaw in the combat system, your drain attacks via parry and back stab do NOT have enough iFrames. There is a split-second discrepancy between when your iFrames expire and when you regain the ability to move, dodge, and attack. I know that doesn't sound bad, it is sometimes enough time for enemies around you to wait for you to be vulnerable and attack just in time for you to be defenseless. A small part of me thinks that may have been intentional, but I digress—it was annoying. 

Character Creation: 10/10; In all my life, I have seldom experienced character creation kits that were as intuitive as Code Vein's. It was refreshing to be able to make a unique character with the abundance of customization features! I only wish that there were a few more outfits.

DLC: 5/10; I've got to be realistic: I was disappointed with the DLC. The new weapons, blood veils, and partner skins were pretty cool, but the blood codes were fairly one-dimensional. The boss fights were challenging, but for the most part, the rewards get cheesy once you've unlocked the new equipment/skins. My biggest complaint, though, is the lack of additional story content beyond one vestige track with a heartbreaking backstory. I only say that because Code Vein's main story line is too fleeting. However, I do have to give credit where it's due, given that I use equipment from the DLC on my main build. For what it was meant to be (new dungeons with unique rewards), the DLC is okay. Still, I was hungry for more content.

Story: 8/10; It could have been better, but it also could have been worse. For all intents and purposes, you're basically a special vampire among vampires, and you play the role of a deus ex machina in a dying world that was clung to by a thread after a detrimental disaster. Personally, I really enjoyed it. The lore and the NPCs were all interesting. I also appreciate the room that was left for a sequel; even after having completed the story and knowing everything players were supposed to know, there is still so much mystery surrounding the state of the world that I am hoping will be covered in a sequel. My biggest complaint is that the story is too short. Still, and to reiterate, I liked it.

World: 7/10; First and foremost, the maps were beautiful (as beautiful as ruins could be). However, it is all too clear that several corners were cut in production. For one, the vast majority of the ruined buildings look similar. Of course, this is a niche detail for most and hardly a game breaker; just because it bothered me doesn't mean it will bother others. Still, it was noticeable to the mildly trained eye and, for me, bothersome. The last and final complaint I have is that the maps are quite small and can be cleared in mere minutes if you understand the layout. That said, I feel it is important to make one clarification: when I first started, the maps felt a lot larger, and some of them required several hours of playtime for me to clear them. In that respect, it could be said that they are adequate in size. It isn't until you understand the layout that you realize just how small they actually are. 

Multiplayer: 4/10; I would not consider rating the multiplayer system for a predominantly single-player game were it not for the fact that you have to do it for an achievement. And so the multiplayer in this game is atrocious. To my knowledge, there are no dedicated servers for it, so you are running off of the host's router. Often, there are rampant connectivity and latency issues that make combat annoyingly difficult. This is sad because I find a lot of replay value in playing with others and helping them by absolutely shredding bosses that used to give me trouble. Sadly, making a solid connection to a host is rare (at least it is for me), so lag is a huge issue. I'll end this section with a PSA to my fellow completionists: if you are after the achievement for reaching the multiplayer rank, use the Tower of Trials dungeons to earn marks of honor! It is the quickest and easiest route. Multiplayer is quite fun when you have a reliable connection to the host. Sadly, though, this is seldom the case.

Overall: 8/10; Despite its few flaws, I enjoyed the game thoroughly and continue to do so. At the time of this review, I have invested 800+ hours into it. Despite my harsh criticality of the multiplayer system, I find a lot of replay value in helping others by absolutely shredding bosses that used to give me trouble on my lower NG cycles. Sometimes I can feel the gratitude of these newer players without really needing to see it, and for me, that is quite rewarding. 

Finally, this game has my loyalty, and if and when a sequel is announced, I will be among the first to buy it. In the sequel, I just hope that some of the aforementioned flaws are addressed (particularly a better multiplayer system), and that we are able to bring our characters from the first game over and go on an entirely new, revamped adventure with them!

+Of course as you expect from soulslike games, you can expect excellent gameplay. It has it all from bonfires to iframe dodges to making u want to throw your controller on the wall from sheer frustration. The skill requirement is evident and this game rewards consistency on top of getting good.

+The combat of the different weapons is quite different and it helps with finding how you want to engage the battle. There are weapons that cater to everyone's liking and you have two weapon slots so you can swap weapons on the fly if suddenly needed.

+On the same note, just like other soulslike games, you can build your characters anyway you truly want. Personally I just went for a guard build with my two-handed sword and it carried me throughout the game. 

+The character building portion of this game might be the funnest part honestly. There are so many ways to customize your characters to the way you want to play its actually insane. I didn't bother experimenting with other builds but there were so many possibilities. It also helps that haze isn't hard to come by so you can easily make other builds on a whim. I was happy with my guard build no matter how scrubby and corny it may seem to others as it definitely did the job

+These games aren't souslike games without their frustrating bosses that can just kill you. Punishment on dying is present in this game as well and nothing makes me want to quit more than dying on the way to picking up my lost haze. These games really are about learning and adapting the opponents moves to avoid death rather than just brute force button mashing.

+The dam bosses deserve their own special shoutout. They were all unique and really fun. I am pretty sure besides the first few bosses, I did not first try any of the bosses. Some bosses may be more frustrating than fun but it just adds to the satisfaction of finally beating them. My favorite and at the same time least favorite boss fight was the Cannoneer and Blade Bearer fight. That fight was so dam stupid and it's so hard to deal with them simultaneously but when you do get it done the feeling is unrivaled.

+The soundtrack is amazing. Really makes you feel in danger when you hear the battle themes. Outside the battle themes, the soundtrack helps really make the world seem really dark. Honestly the soundtrack did give me some anxiety when it stayed in battle theme when I couldn't see opponents or when it transitioned to it when I couldn't see opponents.

+Exploring the different dungeons really tells you how the world is like. I really like this on top of the soundtrack in soulslike games. This really goes to show you don't need a ton of dialogue to develop a world. The way the world is devastated is clearly seen in the different areas and I was happy to explore the different places as they were all unique and fun to explore (except the cathedral). My favorite place was definitely the City of Falling Flame. It looked amazing and I mean it may seem obvious but the city was in flames and it was cool to see.

+The companion does help in exploration as there are so many surprise enemies and they do help tank the damage in exploration. They also helped me by telling me what to do as I got lost pretty often in this game as for the most part, I wasn't paying close attention to dialogue and the narrative kinda flew over my head for the most part.

+The companion did carry me through a fair amount of fights and maybe it was dumb a fair amount of times (a lot of the time). It was not any dumber than I am at least

+Io

-On the note of you don't need a ton of dialogue, this game has way too much dialogue and the cutscenes are boring. I wish they just stuck with just exploration as the main drive for telling the story. The story itself was boring and way too edgy for my liking.

-Visually this game would make you think its from the early 2010s but actually it was made in 2019. Why is this game so ugly compared to earlier games.

-I found leveling up near useless. I wish there was more stats it upgraded for its cost. It doesn't seem too worth to level up over getting more gifts.

-The cathedral level was awful. Frustrating, boring and way way too long. Definitely will just run around in circles here all day long.

-I found that the companion does a bit too much in combat and you can honestly let them do a ton of the fighting. This did lower the difficulty a fair amount especially with my guard build. This wasn't honestly a con for me. The real con is the fact that the companion won't stop talking at all. At least you can remove them.

Wouldn't say its a must play but definitely give it a try if you want a new souls-like game to play and you have played the other ones.",1651727203,1659698560,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- A lot of customization. You can create some cool builds! Also, the level of character creation is top notch. Some of the best I've seen in a good while. 
- Difficulty is fair. There's some cool boss battles. I usually prefer to do things solo, but for this game, I really loved the collaborative aspect. You can either play with friends or have an AI companion help you out. 
- Looks great aesthetically. 
- Combat is fun. This is the main thing that made me keep playing the game. 
- If you dig anime anything, you'll feel right at home. 

Con:
- Honestly, the story didn't hook me in at the beginning. This made it difficult for me to stay invested throughout. I tried really hard to get into it. I even made sure not to skip any of the ""memory"" cut-scenes to try and understand the side character stories. At the end, I just didn't really care and that sucks. I usually love the typical anime story, but for whatever reason this one didn't grab me. 
- Some of the level designs and maps just felt, I don't know...bland? They looked cool, but I think it had more to do with the mapping layout. It was just too samey to me. 
- The music is great for sure. I just felt that at some point, the same tracks were being overused. Going back to the ""memory"" cut-scenes, I can only recall 2 tracks being used. At some point, listening to the same thing over and over again just becomes a drag. There are at TON of these cut-scenes too. Would have loved it if each character's story had a different theme/motif. Maybe that might have helped me with trying get into the story. Music for these types of games is important!
- There's one particular thing with the combat that was annoying and that was the lock-on system. It just felt off at times. There would be instances where I'm trying to attack an enemy and my character loses line of sight of that enemy. This causes my character to swing at nothing. My reaction usually is to focus the camera (right joystick) towards the boss, but you have to make your character turn (left joystick) and have line of sight of the enemy again. The number of times I've died just to this is absurd. I mean I've played all the SoulsBorne games and believe me, I have my own problems with the camera, but this one just felt unique to Code Vein. 

Overall, it's a solid game! I had fun with it even though I have issues with a few things. It's a 7/10 for me.",1631479983,1659672405,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

678960,119962758,76561198120397460,0,5,760,0,752,1674621847,"First, the positives:

	In terms of difficulty, Code Vein is easier than a FromSoftware game. This does not make it inherently better or worse than those titles (I personally prefer more difficulty), but it may be more appealing to people who find those particular games too difficult.

	This game also has a very interesting take on soulsborne progression. Rather than leveling up by allocating stat points, Code Vein has a number of classes for the player to choose from. Each class has it’s own stat-line distribution and starting abilities, making them the equivalent of different builds. Classes can be switched between freely whenever you are not in combat, which gives you much more flexibility to explore different play styles than a traditional souls game. As you meet various npc’s and defeat certain bosses, you will unlock classes associated with these characters, giving you access to their signature abilities and play styles. You can also find special items when exploring the world, which allow you to access class abilities that were previously locked off. Progression in this system revolves around spending Haze (the game’s equivalent of souls) in order to raise your character level, which raises the stat scores of all your classes. Haze can also be used to make the abilities of one class available for use in others. This allows the player to mix and match abilities and stat-line’s in order to create one or several builds that suit them.

Now for the negatives:

	Combat is stale and uninteresting, because it never requires thought or adaptation on the part of the player. Most enemies operate very similarly to each other, so they don’t pose unique challenges that force the player to consider alternative avenues of approach. Once you find an effective combination of abilities, you can simply repeat it for every encounter in an area and succeed. Only bosses feel like they have unique mechanical identities, but even then the variety of their move sets is fairly limited compared to the soulsborne games. Compounding this issue, both health and Ichor (FP) restoration are readily available, so you rarely feel in danger of running out of resources. This means that you are not forced to think tactically about when and how abilities should be used for maximum effect, and instead are incentivized to simply spam every ability off cool down.

	The game’s narrative is weak and uninteresting, full of overused tropes. It also has a crippling inability to communicate anything to the player except through cut scenes. There is no environmental storytelling or meaningful npc interactions, something the Souls genre is famous for. You will also quickly grow tired of hearing the word “blood” and its variations, which are said a comical number of times.

	Perhaps the most frustrating aspect of this lackluster storytelling is how they tied it to the progression system. The in universe explanation for how you learn new abilities is by absorbing the knowledge and experience of others. This idea is fine in of itself, but the way they choose to represent this idea is that every time you unlock a new ability, you are pulled into a dream/memory sequence about one of the character’s pasts. These are not cut-scenes, so they are not skippable, but instead you are forced to walk very slowly through a part of the characters backstory. Once you finally get through this dream sequence, you are immediately thrown into a mandatory conversation with the character in question, which is again not skippable. This means that it can take several minutes of nothing but walking and talking to unlock just a single ability, and there are dozens of ability unlocks in the game. This turns what should be one of the most exciting aspects of the game into a dreaded chore. Bizarrely, these dream sequences don’t even necessarily relate to the character you get the ability from. The game has a preset order of dream sequences based on the order they seem to think you will unlock abilities in, but there is no restriction on what abilities you unlock first. You could easily be unlocking abilities for the Atlas class but getting dream sequences for the character associated with the Prometheus class or vice versa.

In conclusion, despite Code Vein having many features of a Souls game, it fails to deliver a true souls experience, which is why I cannot recommend it.",1659480388,1659480388,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you're in the market for a Souls-like game with an unapologetic emphasis on anime aesthetic, great visual polish, satisfying combat and a haunting OST, then Code Vein is the game for you.  It's optimized well for PC and runs smoothly with medium to high graphical settings, which can always be adjusted lower for better performance depending on one's system.  The Blood Code system works in conjunction with the Blood Veils to allow for a good degree of build crafting, and it's taken further by the fact that you can inherit and carry over certain skills from other Blood Codes once you've mastered them.

The aesthetics are unapologetically anime and the story is melodramatic to the point of absurdity at times. Yet there's this sincerity behind it that makes it all strangely endearing. You might find yourself getting attached to a character or two in spite of how ridiculous the story can be at times.

But at the end of the day, Code Vein is a Souls-like, so chances are gameplay is what you're here for. What sets Code Vein apart from the rest of the sub-genre? First, Code Vein's combat pacing is fairly fast, encouraging a fair bit of calculated aggression from the player. This game was made by the developers of God Eater and it shows in this game's DNA. 

This game also encourages experimenting with builds a fair bit with how simple it is to make and switch between them. You don't distribute stats on level up, instead your stat distribution is determined by a mix of your Blood Code, which is essentially your class, and your Blood Veil, which is your armor that also determines the nature of your Drain attacks. Each Blood Code has a set of Gifts, which are essentially skills, both passive and active. Most Gifts can be mastered by beating enemies with them equipped or by using some haze and specific drops, allowing you to use them with other Blood Codes, though some have stat requirements to prevent you from going TOO nuts with them. With fast enough menu-ing, you can even switch build mid-fight, as shown by Challenger Andy's Gift only run on youtube. You start out with three Blood Codes and accumulate more as you go through the story and explore the world, and there are four types of Blood Veil, which affect how your drain attacks work and the speed of your parry.

Ogre-type Blood Veils have you manifest a set of claws on your arm for your drain attack, are light to medium in weight, and boast the fastest parry, but are lacking in range. Stinger-types make a scorpion-like tail for fairly far-reaching drain attacks, have decent defenses, and are medium to heavy, making them kind of like all-rounders. Hound-types manifest a pair of wolf heads to bite into the enemy. They tend to be heavy but have very good defenses, so they're made for more tanky builds. Lastly are Ivy-types, with a charge drain that you can control where they hit from, allowing you to hit enemies from far away, along with being very light weight, but they also tend to have the lowest defenses. Each veil type also has a distinct silhouette, allowing you to recognize what type a veil is at a glance; Ogre-types are half-capes that drape over the left arm, Stinger-types are longcoats, Hound-types are jackets that are worn like a cape, and Ivy-types are scarves.

As for downsides to this game, there are a couple of parts that are just a pain. The Cathedral of the Sacred Blood is a chore to navigate since everything looks the same and the area itself is absolutely massive, there's a fight in the Depths with two Boreal Brutes that is just downright nasty even with the right tools for the job, and sometimes you can't find that last Vestige to finish restoring your new blood code. The enemy variety is also somewhat lacking. Overall though, Code Vein is a fun game and I'd dare say a good way to get into the Souls-like subgenre.",1657120658,1659242767,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Now the story was a bit interesting and the world did make sense but I felt like I was playing catch up for half the play through. It felt like I should have known what was going on but little by little it started to make sense.

For combat I played a buffing bayonet, got to the point where I was 2-3 shotting enemies. Back stabs are risky because sometimes they just don't work and I felt very squishy and sometimes my normal attacks would just miss. Maybe a sword or hammer build is better but I haven't tried.

Music and sound was alright nothing to cry home about or awful enough to mention but I'm not a music and sound buff.

Character creation is amazing. It's really an anime gpose game but with so many options you really see where they lack. With the deluxe version of the game you only get like 5-6 outfits.

Level design was mid. It's nice that there is so many environments but it lacked that something. I hated the sound my feet would make when running in the snow area.

Never touched co-op so couldn't tell you that experienced.

You see, soulsborn games are not only about having clunky controls, beating big scary bosses and dying a lot. They are about exploration, mystery, character building and accepting the challenge in form of various enemies. Alas, Code Vein has neither of that.

First of all, exploration and level design. All locations are absolutely huge (so you spend a lot of time simply running around), but pretty much linear (even more so than in Nioh) and don't have a lot of secrets to discover. Actually, for secrets the game uses the same trick over and over again: find a spot to drop below, walk on a ledge or through a tunnel, then get up using ladder and discover a valuable item or purify mist (unveils part of the location on the mini-map). The game so desperately and often uses this one trick that it become really cheap after just a few hours. It doesn't have that intricasy and interconnectiveness of Dark Souls locations (among the clones, only The Surge managed to achieve that to a degree), it doesn't even come close to that. And visually locations in Code Vein are also quite bland and boring, though anime stylistic makes them a bit livier than your typical gloomy soulsborn game.

Secondly, the mystery. Do you remember reading item descriptions and talking to all characters in DS just for a glimpse of the game lore, because it was interesting? Au contraire, Code Vein has just the opposite. Cutscenes upon cutscenes after cutscenes, long boring dialogues, and too many characters you couldn't care less about (half of those characters have huge boobs, and it doesn't help the story at all).

Thirdly, character building. You could argue that Code Vein does this better because you can switch all your stats (blood cores) and abilities (gifts) at any time, completely changing the gameplay experience , but I think it hurts the game, because you just don't feel a connection to your character, can't really make them your own. Besides, all weapons of the same class (one and two hand swords, halberds, bayonettes, and hammers) have the same moveset and differ only visually and a bit in stats. Sure, some weapons have special attacks like creating an ice spikes in front of you, but generally they don't feel too different within each class.

So there's little to no discovery, no looking for the weapon that suits your playstyle the best, it all feels the same. Moreover, the difference between quick and slow mobility (roll) is so miniscule it makes much more sense using heavier armors and weapons and blocking than trying to evade attacks which often are completely unexpected and unpredictable.

Then, challenges and enemies. 90% of adversaries (including bosses) are humanoids with the same attack patterns and weapons, and compared to bestiary of any From Software game this feels absolutely underwhelming. Only a few bosses are actually fun to fight, the rest are the same as common enemies, just with higher damage and bigger health pools.

I also want to mention AI companions that work similar to shades in Dark Souls. While they do help (they can even resurrect the player character!), their vocabulary is very limited, and listening to the same 5-10 different phrases really breaks the immersion. I mean, the game has dozens of cutscenes with tons of dialogues, was it too hard to add more variety to companions' phrases? Hearing ""oh, you have sharp eyes, I didn't see that"" for the hundreds of times when you pick up another item from the ground doesn't make the game better, believe it or not.

Last but not least, performance. I have 12900k, 32 GB RAM, 3080Ti, 980 EVO Pro, and the game failed to consistently achieve 120 fps@1440p. Moreover, when playing above 100 fps, there are some bugs (like elevators not working). And even with 60 fps limit it dropped to 55-57 sometimes when streaming in new data. So yep, this proves again that Japanese developers and PC is a bad combination even when they use UE4.

Overall, Code Vein feels like a very bland and generic DS clone without bringing anything unique to the board. Again, you might argue about blood cores, but I didn't think it was a good mechanic for the reasons above. Still, you can get the game just to scratch that Dark Souls itch you might have.

A great game. 
- The story is not complicated yet you can find some of it a little surprising.
- Personally, this game is hard (I'm not used to this type of game) and requires you to experiment the equipment to find the right one for you (or you can just search recommendation on internet).
- Characters are fine as hell, especially Io and Coco. Also, each characters that you interact with (mostly the one you're partnering and NPCs that have relation with your partner) have background stories.
- The equipments look are diverse and awesome, it also goes for the stats but some of them can be a real trash so choose based on what you need.
- I bought the DELUXE EDITION, but for now I only experienced additional customization on my own character, different version of Mia (partner NPC), and additional depth maps. I will update for more.

I recommend you, who types and clicks hard unintentionally, to have spare keyboard and mouse because I broke mine when I completed the main story (exc. side missions). It's a bit lonely because online co-op only playable for max 2 people (including ourselves) and I only have few friends to play with :( SO PLS, LET'S PLAY TOGETHER IF YOU'RE INTERESTED HEHE",1658742437,1658742437,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Pros:
- Souls-Like, not saying it does this well, because it doesn't, but the genre itself is a plus from me.

- Flexible Build system, you aren't stuck as the build you've been making throughout your play through. Whenever you feel like it, you can change up your build, experiment and play around doing whatever you like.

- Unique ""drain"" mechanic, allowing you to perform some pretty cool attacks for some bonuses.

- Graphics. The graphics are pretty good, though it's nothing amazing.

Here we go...

Cons:
- The most intentionally bad multiplayer system I've ever encountered and it is genuinely more frustrating than trying to set up your own server for a game from 2007. If you want to play with a friend, you need to send out a ""distress signal"" with a set password and then your friend needs to ""search for distress signals"" with the same password. Once that happens, you can no longer use certain items from your inventory, you can no longer use mistles, you can not teleport to mistles, if your friend dies, they are kicked and they are required to join again. If you die, they are kicked. If you kill a boss, they are kicked. If you go to scratch your balls, they are kicked. The game likes to orient itself around team work, but punishes you for indulging in it. If you want to play COOP, play on the fastest SSD you have, because you'll be going through a lot of loading screens if you're not the host.

- The combat is just bad, like, really bad. It's the same thing over and over again, poor choreographing from enemies, inconsistent timing, iframes just... don't work half the time. This game's version of increasing the difficulty as you go along is just throwing more enemies at you without any thought. The devs seem to be under the impression that the relationship between enemy count and difficulty is entirely linear, which it is not. If you use the lock-on feature (which you'll have to if you want your hits to actually land, but even when it is on, you have to pray for it), you're going to be stunned locked into a corner and your camera will be covered by some 10 foot tall knight.

- Terrible bosses. Some of them are fine, but most of them are just stronger versions of existing enemies except somehow even buggier. Queens knight reborn just turns invisible meaning the advantage of information is just taken from you, the only thing you'll know is where they are if you're using the lock-on feature. None of the bosses are particularly exciting either. Skull King is probably one of the easiest bosses in the game, despite it being the (sort of) final boss of the game.

- Cut-scenes. The game hates letting you play. 90% of the time you'll spend on this game will be the loading screens from all of the stupidly abundant boring cut-scenes in the game (that you can't disable). I once counted 8 consecutive cut-scenes, all to entertain the boring, generic non-engaging plot. Not only that, but some cut-scenes, that if skipped give you an entirely different ending to the game, preventing you from fighting the final boss. 

- Hidden statistics and mechanics. This game LOVES hiding as much information as possible while still giving you a little glimpse about the statistics of your character. Instead of using something logical like, say, numbers to represent things, they decided to use letters that have a maximum display value, also meaning that the precision of the stats you are shown are abysmal. If you like min-maxing, this game doesn't like you.

- Abysmal level design. The level design of this game is the worse I've ever experienced, and I played hunt-down the freeman (pirated of course). On your first play through, most of the progress you'll make in a lot of levels will be entirely accidental. You will feel not sense of accomplishment or achievement upon reaching the next mistle (if the level is generous enough to give you more than 2). But by far, the worst level I've ever played of any game ever, is Cathedral of The Sacred Blood. Think of a maze, now imagine that maze has vertical levels, now imagine that you have to jump off the sides of walkways to get there, now imagine that you have to make a giant loopty loop around the entire level to get 10 different keys to unlock a single door that leads you to more of the same stuff. The errors of the level design of this game aren't excusable simply for the fact that these poor choices aren't something that can be chalked up to not being a good designer, these levels are intentionally this way, it is a fundamental part of the level itself. Cathedral wouldn't be as bad had it not been the longest level in the entire game and the most boring (you'll find more enjoyment in the training area). The whole level is walking down pathways with the occasional teleporting enemy.

- Terrible partner AI. I would rather teach a toddler computer science than spend another minute with these stupid AIs. They make the poorest decisions and play like blind grandmothers. Instead of making careful choices, they just run at the enemy, attack, get hit, die and beg you to sacrifice YOUR HEALTH to revive them.

- Refresh rate issues. I play on a 144hz monitor. This game LETS you use a refresh rate greater than 60hz, however the game will drill a screw into its head when you do. So many things break and you will encounter more issues than your money's worth.

- Price. This game's price tag is absolutely laughable. If you want this game, wait for a sale, otherwise you will never EVER get your money's worth.

- Cringe worthy stereotypical anime stuff, nobody who lives above ground would enjoy it.

- Overpriced DLC, the content is alright, but for the price it's nowhere near enough content.",1658665757,1658665757,False,42,14,0.53468400239944458,9,True,True,False

Long Version

The good things Code Vein provides:

>Graphics, this is probably where most budget went into.
>Level Design is smth between average and good
>Character animations

The bad things Code Vein provides

>Gameplay design is confusing when you start the game and doesnt really get better with time 
>UI for stats/ equipment etc is all over the place
>Code Vein was designed with an AI/ Coop online in mind (this might be subjective, for me its a con)
>Combat itself: gets really boring and tedious; tried out bayonet/halberd/2handed/1handed + ""magic"" .  i sticked with halberd/2handed most times as weapon arts are really powerful but it in the end it was still not my preferred playstyle. 
>dodging/iframes are sometimes....weird???
>some attack animations (which can also oneshot) from bosses happen too fast....? Feels like some animation frames get skipped and later ones happen thus way sooner. especially annying if boss has a dash attack
>Audio quality is good, OST itself is nothing outstanding. all area zones have same boring combat music which annoyed me more with time after time

Conclusion

i cant really recommend an ARPG with an edgy/clunky combat system.

Either get this game if you want to play COOP with a friend or if you fancy some anime booba.

If you want good ARPG gameplay AND surpass Code Vein in every aspect i mentioned get Hellpoint,Surge1/2, DS Series or Nioh 1 (maybe 2 aswell, didnt play that one) instead. Almost forgot Elden Ring lul",1658426974,1658426974,False,1,0,0.515625,0,True,False,False

Probably the worst souls-like game that bandai namco have published, but it does have some good stuff.

pros:
- partner system for easier play (for people who don't like difficulty)
- great original lore
- really nice visuals
- excellent character customisation
- very unique ability to change your entire appearance (except gender i think) in the home base

cons: 
- mid gameplay (junky mechanics and really stupid hitboxes)
- most of the bosses are boring
- zero direction half the time
- some areas are an absolute maze
- poor mouth movement (sometimes none at all)
- Mislabelling of loading screen descriptions and consumable items (i had a loading screen talking about the sand area when it was labelled as the flame area)

The story and lore are excellent and the background stories of the characters you know in the world are touching, despite this, most of the characters are unidimensional, being or kind and full of virtues or corrupt and selfish, without points in between, ergo there is no growth of any of them in the development of the story.

While this fitted the story better than running around alone, it impacted boss fights in a severe and sometimes infuriating way, since bosses randomly switched their aggro from you to your buddy and back again,  making the whole ordeal more chaotic than necessary. It just never felt as good to defeat a boss as it does in the From Software games, somethings just missing here. And: The true final boss makes a mockery of the otherwise grandiose build diversity of this game. I managed to beat it after many many attempts but it definitely left a sour taste. 

However, in spite of all these more negative points, the game was just fun to play. The skill system is interesting once you get the hang of it, there is a nice upgrade system for your gear, it's nicely balanced, has the right length and despite the sometimes clichéd story the world-building elevates the whole thing maybe higher than it should be.

Combat abilities are very diverse and fun to play around  with, especially as builds can be changed on the fly to deal with any boss you might face. Coop works very well, better than most games in the genre but still not as convenient as I personally would like. Story is mostly miss, not engaging whatsoever and the devs clearly ran out of time/budget after the cathedral section as every level past that is remarkably short. Going for 100% achievements will require many playthroughs, recommend you being a friend to ease the boredom. 

Buying the DLC is absolutely not recommended, it is incredibly overpriced for what it is. Even on deep sale I wouldn't recommend.

In conclusion, this is the DarkWaifu of Souls and is possibly worth your time, especially if you have a friend to play through it with you. Pick up on deep sale if possible, I payed 30ish dollars for it and definitely got my money's worth.

- CV copies mechanics of DS, like stamina bar, weight load, confusing stats, bonfire, estus etc
- CV copies frustrating features of DS, like annoying & unfair enemies, tedious side quest, crappy camera etc
- CV character creation is far superior than DS. The game comes with a dress up simulator
- CV has switchable classes, which allows players to adopt different playstyle in different situations
- CV combat is more interesting as compared to DS. Unpopular opinion:- DS is a rolling simulator   
- CV map design is far inferior compared to DS. Every map is designed to punish players
- CV isn't an open world game. It's more like a dungeon crawler with infuriating mazes
- CV story/lore is straightforward. Treat it like an anime, not a dark fantasy

Spoiler free review:

[b]Pro:[/b]
- Character creation and clothing customization are surprisingly fantastic. Anime haters will yell cringe
- Control and mechanics are straightforward. There is a bit of learning curve but nothing overwhelming
- A variety of classes, weapon, skills which are switchable throughout the game. Allows room for customization, either for player's preference or adopting certain situations. 
- Decent English voice acting and script. No cringey anime main character yelling power of friendship.
- Graphic are decent, probably better than most try hard games out there 
- Companion system. People that does not have friends in real life (like me) can finally experience friendship
- NG+ promotes replayability. However the difficulty spike is so intense it feels like SL1 or NG+7 runs in DS. Most enemies can and will one shot you. 

[b]Cons:[/b]
- Incredibly horrible map design. Everything is: lazy copy and paste; confusing mazes; routes that are easily missed; ledges you can easily fall off; enemy ambushes/invasion etc. People who designed the maps as well as people who enjoys playing should be locked up in the deepest part of an asylum and have the keys thrown away.
- Ugly weapon design. Most of them are too long and huge they look unnatural, not proportional and unrealistic to the extend of cringe worthy (even for people that binge watches anime)
- Boss fights has significant RNG element and hence luck dependent at times. The final boss is an amalgamation of the worst elements of DS bosses. HP and skill set like Midir, camera like Nameless King, unpredictable like Soul of Cinder. Put them together and speed up the fight by 2x times, make the enemy attack hitboxes 10x wider, halve the enemy charge time and recovery time, and give the attacks insane tracking. There you go, ""souls-like""! 
- With the exception of a few great soundtrack, 99% of the time there's this low humming, ringing sound on loop. No area specific BGM. Boss fight music isn't epic or memorable either. 
- Lags, every time when you enter a different area. On rare occasions I have encountered stutter, FPS drop, screen freeze, delays etc. No game breaking bugs or crashes so far. 

[b]Summary:[/b]
- By being a DS clone, this game carries over lots of flaws from DS (which toxic fans of DS refuse to admit). There are some areas which CV improves, at the same time some areas CV mess up so bad you want to punch the developers in their face. Worth a try on sales, but do not set your expectation too high. This game is fun and entertaining but please don't expect it to be revolutionary or change your life.

 Options and variability in play styles are also very good.  The one problem I have (and which I have with all anime style games) is:

1.  Cut-scenes can be ridiculously long and unnecessary; however, some are important to understand the overall story.
2.  The girls and women look bizarre the way they are represented with minimal clothes and watermelon chests - just saying it is weird.  Anime games for some reason just can't seem to make a woman who doesn't have barbells up top or a skirt that is one inch lower than their crotch.  
3.  The other weird thing is your player (the one you create) has no voice.  Sort of weird since everyone else talks in the game.

However, I give the game a thumbs up for the game play and the evolving story.  The rest of pretty blah - buy this on sale like I did.

the story is...fine. there's a weird bit where you go into your own memories and retrieve items from them somehow? not sure how that works, logistically. Mia and Nicola are excruciating. not sure I jive with Io or the attendants, it always seems to devolve into ""waifu serves you"" territory despite sometimes threatening to critique that exact arc. overall it does try to be interesting though, and the characters and their personal stories are mostly alright. it's got that anime-ass dialogue though, which is to say atrocious.

the balance is way off. to dismiss any ideas that I'm just bad, I beat this game like, 7 times. I 100%'d it. literally, I have all the achievements (including the stupid one that's only approaching reasonable if you can co-op the depths with someone for several days). For a laugh I ported a NG+3 character into a base-difficulty playthrough to see if I could just sweep through. Regular enemies still killed me in 2-3 hits sometimes, and bosses could still 1-shot me pretty regularly. that's offset by companions being able to revive you, but the bosses especially will throw out these long combos where every hit is death, and half of them can cover the entire arena or track you, and the companion revive is on a cooldown, and when you get revived there's a delay where you don't have i-frames but you can't move yet, and so you can pretty often get revived into the middle of a combo or a tracking aoe or whatever which instantly kills you again. and then you gotta walk back. usually the walk back is pretty short, but the amount of times I had to make the trek up to Mido are hours I'm not getting back.

anyway, if you're the kind of masochist that actually enjoys dark souls and you don't have anything better to do, you might have fun with this.

Dodging is really finiky and sometimes just doesn't work, i-frames are really inconsistent, weapon variety is non-existent, bosses just deal tons of damage and have tons of health but nothing in the world seems very reactive, everything is somewhat on rails with a very poor 'run straight at the agro target' AI. Dungeons (from the few I actually explored) can be pretty, but it's just a long tunnel with no real exploration, just keep going down the only path possible. See a breakable box? oh boy, secret item.

The game encourages you to switch styles (blood codes) a lot and use what you see is the most fit to your playstyle, it's definitely one of the most entertaining aspects of the game. Game can be a bit clunky and buggy sometimes but overall doesn't really destroy the experience. Did I also mention the banger OSTs of the game? Yep.

- You can not REALLY choose a class such as fighter, rogue or similar. (The game has something like this but does not function properly)
- There is a pointless class-like system but nothing changes and matters. Maybe 3% damage.
- Skill are ... nothing to say. Nearly all of them are garbage. There is a leap forward and strike skill. If you can not adjust distance, you may (teleport and) strike behind enemy. Sometimes in front of enemy.
- You can not choose armor, shield and such. Can not choose according to your liking.
- Enemies are nearly all same with no AI.
- Your weapons cover 25% of the screen. When your companion starts striking enemies, you see nothing. Some sword swinging visual effects cover the screen and see nothing. 
- When you lock on an enemy, lock on does not continue when enemy dies.
- Game is like an 90s beat em up arcade game. You just swing your weapon (most often) randomly.
- The game does not have pause. When speaking on the phone, your companion (NPC) just kills everyone.

Good: There's good music. Every track is pretty good, some I'd even say are great. 
Bad: Shame they play so many times that you get sick of them.
 
Good: Lots of build variety between weapons, bloodcodes, gifts, and bloodveils
Bad: You'll be grinding for hours to get the gifts you want, and you better not over level because then you'll stop earning gift EXP in the zone you're in

Good: The companions add a nice breathe of fresh air to the otherwise isolating experience that souls likes are known for
Bad: The game is balanced around this and if you want to go solo, you're in for a bad time
 
Good: The gameplay is fast, and rewards usage of all mechanics
Bad: You die in about 2-3 hits, only get 10 heals by the end of the game (that only heal 33% of your HP at this point), and you can be stunlocked to death. So play perfect, or die. 
 
Good: Story/lore is very intriguing and the world they've built is good.
Bad: The characters are painfully written, the stakes do not feel high, and the level design is soul suckingly bad.
 
Good: General combat is very fun and there are multiple weapons to choose from, with varying movesets within each category to suit many styles.
Bad: The enemy and boss variety is incredibly lack luster to the point of bosses being repeated in many cases, or them just being incredibly uninspired in their mechanics. I can count on 1 hand how many GOOD bosses there are.

Good: The character creator potential is really grand. Probably where a lot of the budget was blown.
Bad: The art direction sucks. It just straight sucks. The lighting is crap without a reshade, the colour palette is so flat and monotone in many areas, and it just feels depressing to look at.

The customization is pretty amazing, so much so it's sometimes overwhelming.
Fun exploration, although the level design certainly gets pretty annoying during certain areas. So much so that a second playthrough seems completely impossible in my eyes, don't want to go through that Cathedral torture again. 
The music is pretty amazing honestly, loved almost every track.
The art design is pretty on point too. Some of the bosses/boss arenas look absolutely GORGEOUS. Eva stands out in my mind.
You get rewarded constantly and the progression feels fluid. You're always getting new weapons and outfits to try out, leveled up accordingly, encouraging you to try out everything. 
There's a lot of different weapons and play styles to choose from, everything felt pretty viable.
The story is interesting and easy to follow, I never felt lost or confused as to how to progress. 
All the characters are fun although pretty goofy at times, sometimes trying too hard to be taken seriously and it was hard not to burst out laughing. You, the main character, doesn't talk so It makes for some super awkward interactions, especially when it's supposed to be emotional. Some story lines don't truly conclude either so the ending I got at least felt pretty weak. That being said it was always pretty charming though, made me want to continue playing.
The game is pretty challenging, especially towards the end. Some later bosses life pools seemed waaaay too large for the variety of their movesets in my opinion though. It gets pretty tedious. 
Some of the ""challenges"" where dozens and dozens of enemies come towards you of course were pretty frustrating too LMAO. They always felt pretty lazy to me.
Only other gripe probably are some of the animations, there were some super strong boss attacks that gave minuscule tells and felt pretty cheap, but that just may be because I've gotten spoiled by Fromsoftware quality. Which I don't necessarily see as a bad thing, we should thrive for that type of quality, they should never feel cheap of unfair. 

Overall, the game looks good, sound great, and plays pretty good too. It was enjoyable and I found myself excited to continue playing, invested in the story and characters. I'd say wait for a sale and get It to try out. 7/10",1657254278,1657254278,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you like a game similar to Souls series games + anime style graphics then I recommend this game. FYI - This game is in the same universe as God Eater but on a different timeline. Meaning, if you aren't familiar to God Eater then you might find the story a bit confusing and hard to digest at first since you know nothing prior to when the story in the game begins. 

So the question is, Will the game care explain you what had happened in the past? or will you be able to enjoy and immerse yourself into the story even without knowing the event prior to the current timeline? The answer is Yes, absolutely. The game will tell you about the state of the current world you're in, the situation of the remaining survivors including yourself and what's going to happen in the near future. You'll be able to understand all of that even without the knowledge prior to when Code Vein starts. The side story of each characters was written pretty well, combined with the the impressively heart touching OST. It will make you almost cry at some point.

Now, about the OST. If you're an OST fanatics like me then you'll really really love this game! It contains an absolutely amazing OST! Unlike Elden ring or Dark soul main menu theme, Code Vein main menu OST has a really really strong opener and it will make your heart soar like a rocket! As if that wasn't enough, The OST in tutorial really caught me off guard. Two amazing OST in a row! and in a span of few minutes at that! I'm not gonna talk about other OST since it might be too long but they're equally amazing and fit perfectly well with the story where they'll be using at. 

I have no problem with the gameplay and control(PC) Some says that Code Vein is much more easier than other Souls series games but I don't know about that since I really bad at this kind of game. Even then, still enjoy the game nevertheless.

In this game, your stats solely depend on your class and passive skill. Contrast to other Souls series where you farm souls from monsters to increase your stat as well as your level. The only thing you get from leveling up your character in this game is your increased Hp and stamina. But to compensate that, The game gave you so many classes/passive/active skills. So you can try mix and match or explore your preferred synergies which is fun and refreshing!

I've never even played a AAA title with the depth of character customization that's available in Code Vein. Similiarly, the blood codes (or classes, to keep it simple) can all be mixed and matched, allowing you to pick a skill from a hunter and run it on your berserker, if you so choose.

The Depths can be hardly called depths since it is just a very short stage where you have to kill some enemies and complete some side quests. As for the DLCs, I agree that it was just a copy pasted boss from God Eater. I have played GE1 and GE2. I was hoping there was something more in it. Something like a an expansion. But I don't think that's going to happen. I liked the part in character customization where you can do different stuffs with the accessories section and  can remove/keep some part of the clothing. The souls-like combat is okay. I've played DS1 and DS2. Though it felt a bit limiting when it comes to weapon variation. It might just be me being nit-picky.

Long version... coming into this, I didn't know what to expect. I've played hundreds of hours of Elden Ring and NieR: Automata, and I loved them both, so in hindsight it's easy to see that I would love this game. But gameplay aside, it shares a lot of similarities with both games too, such as in the way the narrative is delivered; that is, you learn about the story in bits and pieces, and the characters are very interesting, diverse, and easy to become attached to. Also, like NieR, you have a partner (who you can change at will) who helps make combat more interesting and approachable. And similar to Elden Ring, different abilities, weapons, and gear have an enormous impact on your battles and chance of success. You can choose to be a tough tanky fighter, a sneaky assassin, a long-range ""mage"" caster, and lots of other things, and you can even mix & match to your liking after becoming proficient in different Gifts.

It feels like it's bogged down by the Souls formula and would play better as an action RPG with Darksiders-esque combat.

The partner system makes most of the game a joke (reminds me of a permanent Elden Ring summon system) and while you could just turn it off, you then run into the problem of multi target fights being overbearing.

Many of the weapons do not have more than a 2 attack chain making them feel really awful to use. On the topic if weapons, only melee truly feels impactful. Damage is pathetically low for bayonets and you can supplement melee with casting with no real penalty.

It suffers from the typical anime dialogue of explaining the same thing 2-3 times worded slightly differently.

The memories are cool for story/lore reasons but would have been better off as cinematic cutscenes like what you get in the snowy mountain portion of the game.",1656786682,1656786682,False,0,1,0.47413790225982666,0,True,False,False

Won't admit defeat so I played again, twice (7 additional hours). Turns out at first I played for 'neutral' ending which is the most boring ending (and shortest). This time I went for the 'true' and 'bad' ending which is significantly more beautiful with longer scenes. Though, I'm still mad at the maps especially the cathedral, good thing is I memorized most of the paths and skipped all the fighting. 

Exploration: Stay at 1/10. Still got lost and slowed by stupid hazards. Monkeys would chase me to the edge of the map, so is the fat elite with giant axe that sprint faster than me. Elevator got stuck unless I lower the fps. Occasionally stopped sprinting despite I still hold the button.

Combat: 7/10. Not as slashy as nier, not as fleshy as souls, but once you knows a few tricks, it won't be as bad as your first run. Weapon choices doesn't matter, I picked a random sword for my 2nd and 3rd play and it does equally good as others, since all weapon with same type has same moveset except its heavy attack which is useless, so the RPG element is not so exciting here. Having ally is a must here otherwise it's harder than souls game. 

Story: 8/10. Not much to say but seeing more endings feels good. This rating includes characters rating which boost the score. They're good fellow.

New Game Plus: 2/10, no exclusive contents? exactly same run just to watch alternative endings.

Still wouldn't recommend unless they shrink the maps or have better navigating system, minimap doesn't help when you get lost.

--

Old Review:

This game is a huge maze, the map is unnecessarily long and confusing. Got my first ending in 30 hours without guides and I don't want to find all those damn vestiges again just to see slightly different cutscenes. 

Exploration: 1 / 10. As stated above.

Combat: 6 / 10. Most melee moves are useless and get cancelled pretty easily. Bosses moves too fast, doesn't give any personal space and would jump to you when you heal, regardless distance. Target lock with not so good hit box. Ranged/magic build is ok. For melee, just normal attack is fine..

Story: 7 / 10. Not counting the damn slow walk speed when restoring memories. Nothing particularly new but each characters got some interesting memories.",1656427208,1656759088,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

If you get engrossed in the story then I'm sure the cutscenes are great, but I'm a bit impatient and just wanted to fight things, which makes the excessive cutscenes accompanying Vestige unlocks a bit of a nuisance. 

Overall though, the fighting and class customization is solid.  Haven't experienced any BS insta-kill traps or stupidly difficult bosses.  If you optimize your build, then every boss is doable.  The game is also generous with gear upgrades, allowing you to find quite a few good weapons just from exploring.  8/10 game though, because It's fun and engaging despite those flaws.

A powerful opening to what could potentially be a great franchise. Extremely satisfying gameplay that rewards fast paced reactions, all backed by a booming operatic score.

Blood code system gives you an opportunity to try every build on the same character and the amount of spells and buffs is akin to MMO. You can make so many builds, that even after 10th playthrough things can be fresh. 
And here comes the greatest part: You always have an NPC summon with you. ALWAYS. Makes your journey through post-apocalyptic world feel less lonely and scary. Once you feel comfy enough, you can disable companion and make things hard.

This is the first time I am writing reviews for a game. I would say Code Vein is definitely one of the best games I have played to date. Even though not everything was explained in game, the world building and story is really intriguing and I had a lot of fun playing through the game. 

Exploring every maps and reaching 100% on them is really satisfying and I really like the souls like gameplay a lot. There's a lot of weapons and blood codes to choose from making builds very creative and flexible. This allows countless of skill combinations which can create more replayability for the game even if you have cleared the game.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EDIT: after completing the game, I have no differing opinions on it. the endgame area is fine, not really too challenging, the final boss is ok and the virgin born was the first interesting fight in the game.

Looking back, all of the bossfights were either hard because of a singular mechanic that they use as a crutch, or way too easy to the point where I defeated most bosses first try/second try and in under 3 minutes. Bear in mind that I have played Dark Souls 3 and Elden Ring, but I am not the best at either, and have used player summons in both semi frequently to help. Meanwhile, in this game, using a greatsword and Yakumo, I found most bosses way too easy.

Another point is also most enemies only have a couple of attacks that are very basic and usually enemy enocunters come down to either them slashing or stabbing, with a few exceptions being some magic or a flourishing move.

Overall, just go and play dark souls or any other actually good soulslike for a better experience and for a similar price, unless you are fixated on the anime booba.",1656171835,1656216803,False,1,0,0.437437862157821655,2,True,False,False

And honestly that generalization wasn't too far off. Its got a universal currency that you mainly acquire from killing enemies, it has a very ""anime-esque"" art style and world, its set in a punishing grim world that will require lots of death to be overcome, and it has the classic roll, parry, backstab, and stamina system Dark souls is so known for albeit with a few minute differences. That's honestly where the similarities end though.

For how much Code Vein is like Dark Souls, it brings so much to the table that sets it a part from the series that very clearly inspired it. Without going into spoilers the story, while simple, is really interesting in its own right because of how interesting the world its set in is. The cast of characters, who's backstories you explore via their bloodcodes, are so interesting. Learning how the state of the world has affected them and how they came to be where they are in relationship to you and the enemies and bosses of the world was honestly such a joy to go through the first time. 

The combat while very souls like is very fun and fast paced. The attacks can feel sluggish at times and the hitboxes feel strange but overall was very doable with time. Blood codes are probably my favorite thing about the class and combat system. Unlike Dark Souls where you level individual stats with your souls to create a build, Code Vein has Blood codes. You just use your souls to level up as often as you'd like and the blood code you equip changes your stats instantly to suit that class. The only thing that's asked of you is to use Haze to unlock the abilities that a certain Blood code or ""Class"" has available. And when you master certain abilities, you can use them on the other Blood Codes you unlock. Its a really neat system that does a fantastic job of promoting experimentation. Never at one point did I feel stuck with whatever class I was playing because I knew that I could just go put on a different blood code and kill some enemies in the world to get some of its abilities.  Blood Veils also add a layer to combat even if it does feel more aesthetic at times than anything. Certain bloodveils work better for certain blood code types such as magic, strength, or more dexterity focused builds. It was really fun trying different classes and seeing how my aesthetic changed, it really made playing different blood codes enjoyable on a visual level as well as a gameplay level. 

The other thing to note would be the bosses. Each boss felt extremely unique and fun in their own way, especially a lot of the later bosses. I also absolutely adored how each of the bosses worked on a narrative level but I won't elaborate for spoiler reasons, I would suggest finding out for yourself. Figuring out the timing for dodges or taking different approaches also made things really interesting. This goes back to the bloodcode system as well. If you're hardstuck on a boss maybe swap bloodcodes and spend a bit of time grinding. Maybe one boss is sort of resistant to magic, just swap to a strength or dexterity bloodcode and get to swinging. You won't be punished for it nearly as badly as other souls like titles.

This game does have its fair share of issues though I won't lie. My main issues being some bosses are absolutely trivialized by certain blood codes or abilities. Strength blood codes are truly the culprit for this. Strength just feels so insanely strong against basically all enemies because you can just knock them over or stunlock them to death with a big weapon and strength abilities. And the same bosses I said were extremely fun to figure out is a personal bias. Some bosses have attacks that have such slim dodge windows that they can almost feel unfair at times. And in the same breadth, as much as I love being able to swap bloodcodes at the drop of a dime to make certain bosses easier, I find it annoying that some bosses are so much harder with certain approaches. I guess one of Code Veins greatest blessings is also a bit of a curse. But that's just how games work. I would hope that none of these problems I had dissuade you from the game, I just felt compelled to include them because I didn't want to seem like this review was pure praise even though I do really love the game.

There's more to this game that you can find out for yourself but it is definitely worth the money. If you can get it on sale even better. I guess I'm just asking that you don't write this off as ""Anime Dark Souls"" like I imagine so many did. 10/10 would play again.",1656170937,1656170937,True,15,0,0.679736018180847168,0,True,False,False

It takes the typical souls formula, and adds a big load of special moves and options to the combat system. I dare say there are so many options that they can become a bit confusing. But in the long run, all those options are rather ""nice to have"" than ""must have"" as Code Vein is never overly challenging. I would not call it an ""easy"" game, but compared to the Dark Souls games, or Nioh, this here feels a bit like a walk in the park. Two or three boss fights still granted me my share of yells and screams and curses. 
Which actually didn't directly have to do with the bosses, but with the controls of my character. Don't get me wrong, the combat controls are swift and responsive. But certain things just take forever. Drinking a healing potion feels like it takes forever. It's like my character performs a Japanese green tea ritual before finally taking the potion after finishing an ongoing character animation. Switching weapons takes forever too but healing is the most critical part. In the later game, you won't be lacking healing potions, but time becomes your worst enemy. 
Sadly, the bosses are... pretty lame. I have to admit, not one will stick to my mind. They are neither unique nor original nor spectacular. Most bosses can easily be defeated on first or second attempt. The harder bosses follow the same cheap formula that all weaker soulslikes use: teleport moves and oversized hitboxes. All boss fights take place in an open arena where the bosses can  happily warp from one side to the other. So actually the only real difficulty is to find the right time slot to heal, which takes a couple seconds in which the boss can teleport-finish you.  
Second on the down list for me was the level design. It could be compared to the Nioh levels. Code Vein has no open world, but the world is fragmented into labyrinths. Literally. Graphics are generally pretty, but the levels are quite obviously designed to be mazes which at later levels can become a bit tiring. Like that cathedral where you spend a big deal of time running through criss crossed corridors that make no sense at all, searching for the way to proceed. At least check points are set very fairly so that you'll usually find a spot to rest when you really need it. 

Third on the down list is the story. There is one, so that's nice, but it's being told via dozens of superbly boring memory sequences. And at the end of the game, the sum of all those story fragments still left me with an ""Aha. Ok."" 
But yeah, all in all it still was a fun game. Combat works. The AI of your companions is actually worth its name. And your companions, and generally most NPCs, are interesting enough to spend some time figuring them out. It's fun trying different weapons or armor, taking different companions on your trips. It's fun trying to find secrets. The camera does its job. 
For those looking for a less punishing souls game, with fun action and pretty, Manga-style graphics, I'd say give it a try.",1656143336,1656143336,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

I want you to know that you are reading a review from a person who has never played Dark Souls before (and probably never will).

Why did i choose to play code vein? because of the gameplay? No. because of a semi-naked waifu that follows you all the time? No. because am I a damn weeb? Definitely NOT. I just bought the game because of the character creator, the style of code vein characters has a badass aesthetic, it just bought me.

Code vein is a poor copy of dark souls (although I've never played the DS series, I know the game well), it's just pretty much the same without any innovation in comparison.

The story is decent and captivating, simple to understand and always makes you want to know more (if you're not a DS fan boy and/or code vein hater).

The game is extremely short, most of my gameplay was in the cathedral (now I understand some of the comments that spoke about it).

Some negative reviews you read talking about ""the game is just straight corridors"", this is almost true, you will notice these corridors in ""extra"" maps called ""depths"", which are recycled maps from the main maps, with bosses you already faced. (Japanese games recycle a lot of maps and mobs).

the game's multiplayer really leaves something to be desired, I simply agree with the negative reviews about it.

the companions that help you during the game (npcs allies), have a decent AI, will save your a*s a lot. I wish the Tales of series npcs were as good as the CV ones.

It's not a very difficult game, I found the difficulty ok, some bosses I won on the first try, others I just need to try 2 or 3 times (this includes the boss duo, whoever played it knows what I'm talking about).

I can't understand the reason for so much rage about DLCs, the bosses have a decent difficult challenge but not impossible, however, the DLCs look like the ""depth"" maps, they are extremely short, it is possible to finish them in 30 minutes, so I highly recommend that only buy on promotion and if you really like the game.

In my opinion, this game could have puzzles in maps just like the legacy of kain series. Yes, don't expect any puzzles, just walk and kill.

Overall, I thought the game was good, I would personally give it a rating of (6/10).

quero que saibam que você está lendo uma analise de uma pessoa que nunca jogou Dark Souls (e provavelmente nunca vá jogar)

por que optei jogar code vein? por causa da gameplay? não. por causa de uma waifu semi pelada que te segue em todo momento? não. por causa que eu sou um maldito otaku nojento? NÃO. Simplesmente comprei o jogo por causa da edição de personagem, o estilo dos personagens de code vein possui uma estetica ""fod*na"", isso simplesmente me comprou.

Code vein é uma cópia pobre de dark souls (embora eu nunca tenha jogado DS series , eu conheço bem o jogo), é simplesmente tudo muito igual sem inovação alguma em comparação. 

A história é decente e cativante, simples de entender e sempre te faz querer saber mais (se você não for nenhum DS fan boy e/ou alguém que simplesmente odeia CV).

O jogo é extremamente curto, boa parte da minha gameplay foi na cathedral (agora eu entendo alguns comentários que falavam dela).

Algumas reviews negativas que você ler falando de ""o jogo é só corredor"", isso é quase verdade, você notará esses corredores em mapas ""extras"" que se chamam ""depths"", que são mapas reciclados dos mapas principais, com bosses que você já enfrentou. (jogos japoneses reciclam muito mapa e mobs).

o multiplayer do jogo realmente deixa a desejar, simplesmente concordo com as reviews negativas sobre isso.

os companheiros que te ajudam durante o jogo (npcs aliados), possuem uma AI decente, vão salvar muito a sua bund*. Gostaria que os npcs da serie Tales of, fossem tão bom quanto os de CV.

Não é um jogo muito difícil, achei a dificuldade ok, alguns bosses eu derrotava de primeira, outros eu precisava apenas tentar umas 2 ou 3 vezes (isso inclui a dupla de bosses, quem jogou sabe do que eu to falando).

As DLCs não entendi o motivo de tanto rage, os bosses possuem um desafio difícil porém não impossível, porém, as DLCs parecem os mapas de ""depth"", são extremamente curtas, é possível termina-las em 30 minutos, então eu altamente recomendo que só compre na promoção e se você realmente gostou do jogo.

Na minha opinião, este jogo poderia ter puzzles nos mapas como os de legacy of kain series. Sim, não espere nenhum puzzles, o jogo é apenas andar e matar.

No geral, achei o jogo bom, eu pessoalmente daria uma nota de (6/10).",1655446857,1655840945,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Hardcore Souls fans might get dissapointed because the game is easier than a souls title even without the partner - main reason for this is the extensive Blood Code (character class) and Gift (magic) system which allows you to change your build on the fly, which opens up some extremely broken combos that basically trivialize most content. But it is also one of the games appeals - there is something in here for everyone.

The gameplay is satisfying enough to keep you coming back - definitely check out this game with an open mind and don't try to compare it to Dark Souls or Bloodborne every step of the way. Yes there is not a lot of enemy variety, like in the souls title, but I don't think that's the point - the gameplay is much, much faster than a souls title so you kinda don't get bored fighting the same guys since you move and progress fast in the area and I have to say the areas look stunning - especially for fans of post-apocalyptic settings.

The story is good. Kinda cliche and predictable at some points but good enough to keep you entertained. The memory sequences are a highlight as they are done very artistically (for example: the setting dissolving around you and then building itself back again - very cool) and every single one of them is unique. The soundtrack is awesome and helps you get involved into the story.

No, really, give this game a try, even if the anime aesthetic is not your cup of tea. There is no ""extreme anime"" like silly faces, blushes and the like - the game takes itself seriously and will appeal to many people",1655503618,1655503618,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pretty fun and good game, however in my opinion it lacks replayability value so if you want it, it's probably better to buy it on sale. 

THE GOOD STUFF: 
- Similar in general vibes and playstyle to Soulsborne games, so if you like the challenge and combat, you'll probably like this. It's also much easier to get into and master than the Soulsborne games, so it's very beginner-friendly. 
- Not the most comprehensive character creator, but it's very simple and intuitive, with more than enough options for most people. 
- Super easy to switch between multiple playstyles and builds within the same playthrough, without having to create a separate character. While it's good, it has its downsides too. 
- Pretty customizable in difficulty. If you want the experience, use the companion system. Otherwise, solo things for a bit of a challenge. 
- Boss designs and level design are cool and vibrant, keeps things fresh. 

THE NOT-SO-GOOD STUFF
- Kinda gets boring after the first playthrough because it feels like if you've done it once, you've done it all. 
- While bosses are very interesting and varied, I think the enemies could do with a little more variety. Very often, enemies in a new area just feel like reskinned versions of previously-fought enemies (i.e. all you have to do is switch to a different element, that's about it). Doesn't help that they're all very humanoid. 
- Enemy movesets and strategies get dull after a while too. Some enemies go ""me swing at you"" and others go ""ME BIGGER SWING AT YOU"". Bit of an exaggeration but you get the point. It would be a little more interesting if maybe some enemies were more susceptible to being hit on the head, from behind, maybe some are invulnerable until you smack a supporting enemy hidden somewhere or something, etc.

This game is okay but it has severe issues with variety and overall fairness to play style. It felt more like a dungeon crawler than an action adventure game. The areas all were beautiful or visually stunning in their own ways but all feel mostly the same gameplay wise other than one or two locations. Each area is packed with enemies which are fun to fight at first but quickly become stale and annoying as their attacks just hit harder and harder and ambushes get more an more frequent. The enemies themselves as well get repeated quickly. Each new area should have a new enemy type to engage with that correlates to the area's overall feel but all you get is a reskin of the previous areas' enemies. Not to mention the dlc which I haven't played but have watched, which is mostly the same garbage. Cramped area with no roaming with reskinned enemies and bosses. 

The way the game approaches blood codes is cool but some blood codes become useless after specific parts of the game. Some status effects or enemy attack types stay within a certain part of the game and once you get through that area there is no point in going back unless you want to grind for cash or xp or something. Poison gets introduced early and it doesn't really come back past the beginning of the game making the blood code abilities for it pointless to have. Grinding for blood code xp doesn't make sense at times either considering you max some out in mere minutes. Then right after you finish the area and don't need that ability anymore. 

Stats are confusing and locked to blood codes or the few outfits you get, nothing new is explored anywhere. Bosses have too much health for their own good and the majority of the tolerable parts of this game are sitting through the cutscenes. This game has almost no re-playability and certain obstacles in the game are so unfun that you feel disgusted at the thought of having to do them again. A big one for me is the cathedral section, its confusing and just downright sucks, especially as early into the game as it is, not to mention how you get there in the first place. 

This game would've been better as a dungeon crawler or a standard jrpg, not whatever the hell this thing is.",1639130262,1654860063,False,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

The story is passable and the dialogue can be a bit weeby at times, but I had a great time playing this. For some reason playing Code Vein was very nostalgic for me, like I was back in '98-'99 and it's 2 a.m. Saturday morning and I'm grinding the hell out of Final Fantasy 7. Not because there are achievements, but just because I wanted to see everything the game had to offer. Code Vein isn't perfect, but the combat was solid enough and the level design was good overall. The levels are linear but there are a bunch of branches in the path for you to check out if you want. I had no trouble getting the good ending and it wasn't tedious at all to find the stuff I needed for it, but if you're just rushing through the game you can definitely miss the things you need. I felt like it had just the right amount of challenge for me. I wasn't looking to be frustrated but I didn't want to breeze through it and it really hit that sweet spot. If you want more of a challenge you can always dismiss your companion. A lot of the mini bosses felt way harder than the main bosses, which was kind of disappointing but not really that big of a deal. I really loved that I was able to switch my build whenever I wanted. The skill system is very similar to Dragon's Dogma.

I couldn't help but laugh at some of the character designs, though. Everyone dresses like Hot Topic is the official sponsor of the apocalypse and some of the women have comically large breasts, which might actually be a selling point for some of you. Their shirts are literally ripping apart because of their size, and there is no more fabric left in the world to mend them because Hot Topic needed it all to make more belts and handkerchiefs that can hang nonchalantly off of your belt loops.

Code Vein

Design the perfect waifu and embark on a bland souls-like that completely is completely devoid of the satisfying game feel of a souls game.

Full disclosure I played this after Elden Ring and my expectations are hugely inflated, I know it, but it is what it is, I played it now not before.

The game play has all the features you'd expect and far far too many more. 
Combat and enemies are janky and very repetitive, your hits feel meaningless with zero feedback. You have dozens of abilities based on your current core and all of them are ambiguous, was it a buff? Can I even perceive the difference it produces?

Stealth almost never works and far too many corners have a cheap ambush behind it. So many stealth kill opportunities are just bait for ambushes. I know these cases are parts of souls likes... but 10x less often and far more subtle.

The level design is literally and figuratively a mess, areas are tend to be mazes made of post-apocalyptic junk strewn around. You wander around fighting the same 2 enemies over and over until you find the same large enemy which then progresses the story/level in some way.

The graphics are plenty good but the art design is weak and uninspired. 

I got to an area early on that you wade blindly, in waist deep water which further slows and cripples the already weak game play... and that was about it for me. I never died which isn't a complaint, I'm just throwing it out there to avoid any of this review sounding like a rage quit.

Surely I've barely scratched the surface of the game at only around 3h of play at the time of this review, maybe it gets better, but I have no inclination to find out.

Everything just felt like a way less polished and interesting gaming experience. The story is boring and convoluted, and also contains an insane number of watered down and unnecessary cutscenes. The combat system is unpolished, buggy, and downright frustrating. In particular, the camera and lock-on systems break constantly. There are a ridiculous number of classes and abilities that will completely overwhelm you, along with weapon types, stats, upgrades, tomes, etc etc. The theme of this game seems to be quantity over quality. The level design is boring, the NPCs aren't particularly interesting in any way, and the boss mechanics are just unrefined and cheesy. Finally, there are a number of really dumb bugs that haven't been fixed, such as elevators not working, and being stuck in a trade menu with no way to close.

Overall I wanted to enjoy this game, but found myself just wanting to beat it so I could move on to something more interesting. This felt like Michael Bay designing a video game. It felt like watching Transformers 2+. Way too long, terribly storyline, garbage characters, and pretty CGI. I could see some hardcore anime type people or stats nerds liking it, but to me, it's not even in the same universe as a game like Sekiro.",1654734196,1654734196,False,2,0,0.469072610139846802,0,True,False,False

For reference, I like this game and hated Monster Hunter World and only ever played Elden Ring from the souls genre. It is more difficult than a lot of games but easier than Elden Ring. You do have a similar dodge and parry mechanic as Elden Ring and a system similar to runes/souls that you drop on death. You go on mission maps similar to monster hunter world. You are looking at ~5-10 min boss fights or maps instead. Open world, you can grind and over level. Have not finished the game, it may get more difficult. I want to be specific on the time frame making things easier. Keeping your timing for 5-10 minutes is a lot easier than doing it for 20-30 and you lose a lot less time per failure.

In spite of this, there are some cons that need to spell out.

Best example is Blade bearer and cannoneer boss battle.
Another drawbacks is that the  Cathedral of the Sacred Blood is a massive area and can be time consuming especially without any guide. Players might be confuse with not only the direction but also with all the mechanism that need to be done to access the next area. This can be very frustrating to player.

2. Incredibly short! Most of the game will have you watching a cinematic movie so bring the popcorn. 
3. Side quests were lackluster/dull and you had to back track to find them. Most of them have you kill a singular non-boss type monster and that was the quest.
4. All the non-boss monsters within the game are just reskins of the 5 or so variants.

You have a slider to increase your female characters breast size and thats about it.

Without mods: Not recommended
With mods: Recommended

If you also have difficulty progressing the game for the story, consider visiting nexus and installing ""Precision Enhance"" and/or ""Queen Aura"" (Version with updated TimeMaster)

Precision Enhance: Boosts an ability in-game called Precision to a degree which makes it last for very long and makes every attack you land on an enemy stagger 100%.

Queen Aura with TimeMaster: Lets you Freeze/Slow time for everything except yourself (or yourself if you want) allowing you to time out mid battle to either heal or just completely end your foe. I've mainly used this for stress healing or to nuke unreasonably difficult battles/bosses. Like that time you had to fight the same boss twice for story reason instead of giving you a cool fight cutscene for the second battle. With this you can just say, nah I'm not doing that.
I recommend setting the slow for enemies to 0.2 instead of 0.05. If not every hit you land in slow mode will freeze your character for a good few seconds. Z is the keybind for the TimeMenu and T is the toggle for slow/freeze mode. It can't be used unless you visit homebase everytime you boot up the game.",1654044329,1654198667,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's nowhere near as unforgiving as other souls games and the combat system is really fun to play around with since you have so many different blood codes with all kinds of abilities and weapons.
The story is also pretty good and much easier to follow, alongside a cast of likeable characters

Ultimately I can't recommend this game because I don't think it's worth finishing, but there’s enough to like here that you may want to play the game anyway.

[h1]The Good[/h1]

I’ll start with the things Code Vein does well. Code Vein has fantastic core systems. Instead of allocating your stats directly, you pick a “Code” (kind of like a class) which allocates your stats for you. For example, the Berserker Code has high Strength and Vitality, whereas the Caster Code has high Mind and Willpower. Associated with each Code are “Gifts,” active or passive abilities of which you can equip a limited number. Gifts are initially restricted to the Code they’re associated with, but you can “master” them over time by using them, and once a Gift is mastered it can be equipped on any Code. These systems offer a ton of variety and customizability, far more than any other Souls-like I’ve played. You can also change your equipped Code and Gifts at any time, making it easy to tweak your build to suit the challenge at hand.

Code Vein also includes a “transformation” system for gear akin to the infusion system in Dark Souls 3. By using special materials, you can add elemental or status damage to your weapons in exchange for reduced stat scaling. You can similarly transform your armor to change its resistances. Code Vein makes it easy to swap transformations, meaning you can tweak your weapon’s damage type and your armor’s resistances to suit the challenge at hand. Code Vein also makes all transformations available from the start, provided you have the materials to perform the infusion. This is in stark contrast to Dark Souls, where certain infusions aren’t available until close to the end of the game no matter what materials you have on hand.

Finally, Code Vein’s gifts are fueled by the “Ichor” system. Ichor functions like mana - you spend it to use your active gifts. Ichor is regained by dealing damage to enemies, which encourages you to play aggressively rather than defensively when running low on Ichor. If you’re in the middle of a boss fight and a key buff runs out, you don’t retreat and chug from a flask like you would in Dark Souls 3. Instead, you go on the offensive and take the Ichor you need.

[h1]The Bad[/h1]

Unfortunately, that’s where the good ends in Code Vein. The core systems are fantastic, but the actual content of the game is lacklustre. This means that Code Vein is fun initially as you experiment with its core systems, but starts to drag as you settle into a build and get further into the game.

The first issue is the lack of variety, both in areas and in enemies. Most of the game’s areas are variations on the same “ruined city” theme. The fire area is just a ruined city that’s on fire. The desert area is just a ruined city that’s been partially filled in with sand. And etc. There are a few areas that deviate from this theme, but they’re few and far between. The same is true of the enemies. You’re going to spend a lot of time fighting the same basic grunts. Almost every area uses these grunts, just with varying health and damage numbers. Each area also has a few “unique” enemy types to spice things up, but even these enemy types are reskinned and reused multiple times. The number of unique enemy types in the game is quite small.

The second issue is the boss roster. By and large, it’s lacklustre. There are a few standouts that really require you to buckle down and “git gud,” but they’re few and far between. Most of the bosses are quite easy and can be beaten in only a few attempts. There are also a handful of stinkers in the boss roster, with insufficient telegraphs and unfair mechanics. All in all, it’s a pretty disappointing collection of bosses.

The third issue is the story. Code Vein does away with the atmosphere and mystery typical to the genre and instead opts to tell a more straightforward story with straightforward characters. Code Vein also puts a much larger focus on its narrative than most Souls-likes. The problem is that the story and the characters aren’t compelling enough to carry the larger narrative focus. The characters are mostly stock anime tropes, as are most of the major plot beats. Over time the story and characters become predictable, and consequently become boring.

When you add all three issues together, you get a game that grows increasingly dull the further into it you get. The enemies are initially dangerous and exciting, but you eventually master them and start hungering for more. It’s fine that the early bosses are pushovers, but the difficulty curve doesn’t rise with your skill level. While it’s fun to indulge the cheesiness of the story early on, it eventually grows dull and your motivation to see it to the end fades. By the end of the game, there’s not a whole lot left to compel you to keep playing.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

Ultimately, I can’t recommend Code Vein because I don’t think it’s a game worth finishing. That being said, I did actually quite enjoy my time with Code Vein. I really enjoyed experimenting with its core systems in the first half of my playthrough, and I don’t regret playing the game. If you don’t mind not finishing the game, it may be worth picking up Code Vein despite its problems.

I really hope the team behind this game gets a chance to make a sequel, because I think the game’s core systems attached to a world and enemy roster with more variety could make for a really excellent game.",1637845480,1654169900,False,156,0,0.80573660135269165,5,True,False,False

Pretty decent combat.

A lot of in-depth ""loadout"" building.

Decent character customization.

Very nice graphics.

Great dialogue and voice overs.

V Cons V

If you're looking for a game to play with friends I do not recommend this game what so ever. The multiplayer works in very weird ways. Sometimes the other player joining you gets a bug where they can not pick up items, or climb ladders. Other players do not get shared loot from for example chests. After each boss kill they get sent back to their world and get no ""Haze"" which is the needed balance to level up your character and weapons etc.. Whenever you die they get sent back to their own world, you also can not rest at ""Mistle's"" which are basically ""Bonfires"" to heal up and regain your healing items / mana.. So for multiplayer though it can be fun to just mess around I'd give it nothing more than a 3/10.

Sometimes when you go into a dialogue with npcs to exchange, buy or sell things you get stuck in a screen you can't back out of and you need to restart the game.

Sometimes whenever you are in combat your character hits a completely different way than where you are actually aiming at, (even if locked onto the enemy).

I still only have around 18 hours in-game which is from only about one day of playing this game, but this is what I've gathered so far.

Overall I'd say it's worth a shot if you like souls-like games, dungeon crawling, grinding and a pretty linear story. Great for offline play.

I should also mention that I've heard the DLC's are terrible and add nothing really exciting to the game, mostly just copy paste and re-skins. So if you're buying the game, go for only the base game! :)",1654001339,1654001339,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Anime + Dark Souls + Vampires n' Shit = Fun as hell. As the game progresses and you become increasingly badass, it becomes really rewarding collecting vestige fragments and opening up more more lore and blood codes. Each code has a fun and unique playstyle, and with the ability to cross-tree abilities, you really can build however you want basically. The combat in this game feels really responsive (Use a controller if you can, I find that much more intuitive to play with)

Plan to spend like an hour on character creation because there are a TON of options if you really wanna get detailed with it. Make your badass vampire waifu/husbando and go to town.

The learning curve is challenging, but not painfully so, because then the only real kerfuffle comes from new enemy types who grind you into paste until you learn how they behave, bosses included. Maybe you bang your face against it a few times, adjust your build, and boom, dopamine when you clear the room. Although, I will admit, the dual-boss fight near the end of the game (folks who've done it know exactly the pain I'm talking about), messed me up good until I figured it out. I had no friends and I was determined to play by myself and beat it, and after many grueling tries pulled it off.

The characters are fun and interesting, and unraveling the lore and mysteries throughout the plot is easy to digest, but has a lot of depth if you're an emotional person like me. The song that plays inside the Vestiges is friggin gorgeous, and it alone has made me cry. The story is fleshed out, and a lot of questions are answered as you play through the different endings.

So, if you like anime, and enjoy a bit of a challenge, this is a great intro to soulslike games. (I tried to hop into Elden Ring and found it almost needlessly difficult and sluggish in comparison, (Basically why bother having a health bar if you're just gonna die instantly most of the time. But I'm a filthy casual so xD)

As someone who can't get more than hour into any SoulsBorne game without subsequently dying and raging, I'm here to tell you this game isn't as hard as Dark Souls, however, you do have to time your attacks and dodges juuuust right. Also, the first boss, for me, for some reason, was the hardest boss of all of them. Took days of attempts, but I could finish most of the other bosses in the first 3 attempts. Also, there's more colors than gray-scale in here. 

The character creation was amazing and in-depth, and you can re-customize your character once you're out of the prologue at any time. I can be a pink-haired girl with cat-eyes, which was cool. I wish your character was voice acted to the extent of the other characters tho. The ""class"" system, which allows you to switch between classes between excursions, based on your needs, is pretty nice. 

I'm not sure if it qualifies as ""open-world"" since it operates very similarly to Dragon Age and Legends: Arceus in that there's one ""base"" and several very large ""rooms"" for you to explore. However, you are free to enter and leave them, and explore the extent of them, to your heart's content, as soon as you unlock them (through progressing the story-line).

The story-line was nice, a little predictable, but really nice. It's definitely trying to be on the ""heavy"" side of things with tragic backstories and injustices. I'm glad that it doesn't feel like a ""vampire game"". 

Performance wise, it ran great! I could run it at normal graphics on my old Radeon 570, and could stream it on low graphics with it (though the cut scenes lagged on-stream, as expected). I did not encounter any bugs, personally. 

If you're interested, but on the fence, I recommend playing the demo! It's exactly the prologue, nothing more, nothing less. It helped me make my purchase decision and didn't take away from playing the whole game. It ultimately didn't spoil any of the story for me.",1653695947,1653695947,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Many things were taken directly from those games, and if you like those games you may like Code Vein. However, I think the game is flawed enough that I cannot recommend it.
The real issue with this game is that the level design is awful. One of the things that many people don’t think about, but what makes the souls games amazing as they are is the level design. The interconnectedness makes things like backtracking and opening shortcuts feel natural. It also makes it much easier to form a mental map and know how things are connected. None of this is true in Code Vein. Often the way forward feels unintuitive, and the levels feel like laboranths. This is not helped by how the environments are very bland with no distinguishing features within them. Within an area, one hallway or ledge looks the same as every other passage and ledge in that area. The worst offender is the Cathedral, which is the largest and worst area, and is one of the most painful areas to explore. 
The level design is inexcusable how bad it is, and I think it alone makes it really not worth playing, because it is ever present and something that can’t be ignored. However, there are more issues. The enemies and bosses are often alright, but they don’t compare to the quality of other similar games. Often they are just a little too basic, with a very limited moveset, that doesn’t really make good use of all of the possibilities that come with this genre. 
The weapons are often very cool looking, but there is not much variation within types. The swords feel pretty identical no matter the sword, and so it is preference on what it looks like.
I think a persisting issue of this game is that there just isn’t enough variation in order for the game to feel full. The weapons, enemies and levels all mush together, without there being enough of a compelling reason to continue. However, there are anime girls and you can wear a towel so maybe that is enough for some people.",1653355741,1653355741,False,1,0,0.503448247909545898,0,True,False,False

- Game has a rich story with slight expanding moments with every collected [b]blood vestige[/b] 
Those vestiges are basically shiny red crystals containing some memories of a character and some update to their abilities. Unlike other characters, main character has an ability to change their class. This classes are coming with vestiges or proceeding with story and interacting with other side characters.

- Game has several endings: Bad, neutral and good. To finish the game with good ending you must [spoiler] collect all critical vestiges that has a connection to important side characters(Vassals of Queen relics). If you miss a vestige you might no be able to save a side character which has no replay [/spoiler] and the game automatically will end with neutral or bad ending, depending on the next acts. The key to good ending is to [spoiler] save all of the vassals after you defeat them in a boss fight. [/spoiler] Yeah it sounds kinda complicated here but dont forget to check wiki sites.

- Game requires grinding to collect somekind of souls to update the level of the main character or unlock some abilities of classes. [b]Unlike souls you can not increase the stats manually you just level up and other stats go up accordingly[/b]. As it was mentioned up ahead, we can change the class of the character anytime. There are around 24 classes that are being unlocked with continuation in story, collecting vestiges or interacting with side characters. Some classes has weapon restrictions or debuffs, be careful. Each class has their own skills that can be inherited to other classes by filling their gauge by killing monsters.

- Graphics are cool, general ambiance kinda resambles to [i]Darksiders[/i] if you have ever played it. Character design and graphics similar to [i]Devil May Cry[/i] but slightly different.
- Musics are epic, especially main menu theme. Character voice and game language settings are separate. Which means you can keep the game in English but the audio in Japanese or other language.
- Gameplay is giving players cancer sometimes. As it was mentioned before this game is Darksouls-like.

Fighting - epic, awesome, flashy, extremely annoying at times.
Visuals - love them, especially blood veils. Locations are interesting - most of the time (*caugh*Cathedral*caugh*). Also you can customize the hell out of MC.

I believe the story is what sets this title apart from other souls likes. You get to know not just the protagonists but some of the antagonists stories (perhaps through the view of the protagonist but it does explain a few things).

My main gripe with the game is how they have named different things. A vein is armor. A gift is a spell. A blood code is a class. It may be in line with the story, just not needed.

The main gimmick of the game is blood codes (class) you have to play the game with a blood code equipped to learn different gifts (spells). Some gifts are specific to a class meanig you have to have that blood code equipped, others, once you've learnt them are inherited. Meaning if you have the prerequisite stats you can equip them to any other blood code. NOT ALL blood codes can have ALL gifts, Heavy duty caster/ranger skills can't be applied to a greatsword wielding tank and vice versa. Still you can come up with some good builds if you take the time to grind out unlocking each gift by playing that blood code till you've unlocked said gift. Gifts are action based requiring ichor (mana) or passive meaning they just do what they say permanently. You get 4 passives, which are normally stat boosts, though some allow extra equipment weight, reducing your health to 1 instead of a fatal blow and others that restore ichor (mana) based on other requirements. You also get 8 actions. Actions range from combo moves to +defense, +attack or imbuing your weapon with an elemental debuff or defense against the same debuffs. Personally i relied on items to do these things, especially once later fights negate elemental properties, so buffing attack vs buffing elemental becomes negligent.

You can upgrade equipment, for the most part any weapon will scale to any other weapon if it is max upgraded. Meaning if you like the way a weapon looks by all means upgrade it. Weapons dropped from bosses are slightly more powerful but i do mean only slightly. You can also permanently imbue weapons with elemental values, this i don't recommend, even bosses that will get severely hurt by elemental attacks, you're stuck with that weapon, just use items (they drop frequently enough or are sold by coco). You face the next boss that is immune to the element, you're dealing 5% damage, vs 100% with just attack power.

As an addition to the main campaign there are Depth (Dungeon) maps. You need to find the corresponding map to access them in the game world, but they don't take alot of investigation to find. These Depth maps consist of 2-4 areas each with a mini boss and key, upon which you return to the starting area and fight the real boss (bosses from the campaign just stronger). According to other reviews the DLC is just another 3 depth maps with 3 new bosses, whilst 1 is directly from God Eater 3. I didn't purchase the DLC, instead i got God Eater 3 on sale for less than the DLC cost (I mean, i'm gonna be playing 1/3 of the DLC in GES3 right?). 

Next, the ridiculous parry mechanic. If you press the parry button just before an enemy attack you go into the parry animation, Which is at least 10 seconds long, you refill your stamina, but enemies have had the chance to reposition, so they are behind or next to you. The game doesn't pause. I have finished the game using nothing but dodging. Block and parry can honestly be ignored.

Combat is what you'd expect, though there are probably too many 'gifts' you need to use in a fight so button mapping on M+K can be tricky, i'm sure theres enough buttons on a gamepad though.  

The story is quite short, so if you're expecting the same amount of gameplay you got from a dark souls, well no. You do get the NG+ option, keeping everything from your last save and starting on higher difficulty....but....meh. Seen the story. THOUGH i hear there are multiple endings....if that's enough to make you play it again.

All in all i thoroughly enjoyed code vein, will i play an NG+? maybe one day, but attempting it back to back, there wasn't enough there.

P.S. My gametime could have been halved for a single playthrough, i ground out levels expecting Dark Souls, but i was over powered by the final boss fight. Don't spend too long grinding. The story isn't that long.

It is a game that experiments and does some interesting and cool things with the souls formula. I also do like that they fully embrace the absolute edgy weeby anime side of things. I find that sort of thing always respectable. 

However, I do think it is rough around the edges in terms of combat, graphics, story and I really don't like most of the bosses. Which I will mention in a positive/negative comparison down below based on the mentioned categories.

Combat:
In terms of combat, it is still very souls like. There are certain weapons types that have a different attack patterns. It has light and heavy attacks. It also has a very cool backstab/execute mechanic (which I will go over in more detail soon) and has pretty cool dodge mechanics. But it also has a lot of abilities (also known as gifts) which if mastered can be used with any build you wish. To activate these gifts, you need to have enough of the resource ichor, which can be aquired by attacking enemies or performing backstabs. The armor in this game doesn't just give you defenses, but it also increases your damage, scaling and gift power. On top of that  because of its weight system it has a rolling and running speed for your two different weapons. For example you can have a weapon with normal speed and a seperate weapon with a slow speed and still have a normal running and rolling speed with the normal speed weapon.

The first combat mechanic I mentioned was the backstab. It's one of my favorite things to do in this game. To perform a backstab as it is self explanitory, you go around their back and use a light attack on them, like any other other souls like game. However, not only does the backstab deal massive damage, it also fills and increases your amount of ichor. On top of that, you get a really cool animation for it aswell, like a glory kill from doom 2016 and doom eternal. Do beware that like a backstab, it doesn't automaticlly kill. It just deals a whole lot of damage. 

It does some interesting things with the dodge mechanic with its focus meter. For example if you dodge a enemy attack at the right time, your focus meter goes full. Giving you things like instant refilled stamina (there are a few other things but I forgot) rewarding you for dodging properly, which is surprisingly rare in a souls game I must say. Also, if you have a armor piece that gives your weapons quick speed you can basiclly dodge like bloodborne, which is really cool and interesting.

I do think that code vein has a lot more variety in terms of ability usage then DS or BB with the blood cores and gifts. When you master an ability from a different blood code you prefer, you can use it on your most used/best bloodcode instead. It is really fun too find a build that fits me in order to progress through the game and you can also combo with the attacking gifts.

Story:
My opinion on the story and graphics is around the same. Both the story and graphics to me are around the rough. 
The story tries to tell a deep and meaningful story, but I end up laughing at how cheesy it is and the plot holes it creates depending on the ending you get. Don't get me wrong, I was somewhat invested in the characters. (Spoiler coming up) Like Mia's story arc ending depending on you restoring Nicolas memory, I found it sweet (or bitter sweet depending on you restoring nicola) and a nice conclusion to that arc. But I just laughed throughout most of it because of how anime and stupid it is.

Graphics:
In terms of graphics and the world, they are pretty rough around the edges. I just think if they polished them a bit more, I would find it more pleasant to walk through the world. Like seriously, (spoiler alert) I had a hard time navigating though the giant white castle shrine looking place because it all looked the same and the bright lighting didn't help at all. Or the fact that whenever I am on some rubble it is obvious I float slightly above it like jesus on water.

Bosses:
There were only three bosses I really liked and that were the invading executioner, the queens knight reborn and the skull king. But that's about it really. I just think the bosses are artificially more difficult and are designed to do with a partner. Which I just think is stupid as hell. Because you then have to deal with a boss which is on you 24/7 while it is dealing massive damage and potentially one shotting you even when overleveled while having massive amount of health. 
My only suggestion is to strip away some of their health (Like 15% -20%) or get rid of the damage reduction all together, that's it, those two things is what frustrates me about the bosses. 
They have damage reduction on top of a lot health. Making it artificially difficult and making you using a partner when you don't want to. Which for most early game bosses is fine, because they don't have as many mechanics to deal with when fighting solo (except for the butterfly, god I despise that thing with its damage over time debuff). But for the late game it isn't fun for me in terms of soloing bosses since they are aggressive as hell on top of a ridiculous amount of health and damage.
I liked the bosses i mentioned at the start of this section since they have much clearer telegraphed moves that punish you enough when hit. But the same rule falls under them aswell, too much health for a damage reduction to be necessary.

But that is about it, they have tried to do experiment with the souls formula and there are some obvious ups and downs to what they did (Like what I mentioned) but I really enjoyed the game overal. 
It is fun to walk around the levels and killing enemies, the home base has some funny things that make it very anime. The character customization is very anime (which is a win for me) and the photo mode is pretty cool aswell.",1651582181,1651582181,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

One major one is there are two or three bosses in the game that'll just randomly turn invisible when they vanish to do a move. Like straight up bug invisible not the ""oh it's just it's power"" kinda invisible.

Second is the elevators - These things in the later part of the game only work if you alt tab multiple times. This makes it seems like this wasn't set up appropriately for PC port..

Third is just how the enemies track... Your PC (Player Character) will have issues with their moves whilst the enemies will glady rotate to just 360 no scope smack that ass.

Honestly though I do love the game and its story that seems to be a precursor to the God Eater series. I just don't think i can recommend it unless you really want to go through all of the issues above.

Pros:
+The game has what are essentially classes with their own unique abilities but it also allows the player to use abilities from one class on another after they've become proficient in it. This allows for hundreds of different build types and unique playstyles.

+The story/plot is engaging with each character having their own backstory. Some of the information is hidden sadly but the dialogue, cinematics, and memories stitch together a well made story that is sure to get the player interested and invested.

+The bosses generally make for some really entertaining fights that either make you put up a fight or have unique effects and abilities that make it seem like a proper boss and not just some really buffed normal enemy...usually. There are a few bosses that are exceptions to this but I won't get into that.

+There is a map that tells you where you've already been and also displays how recent you've been there by the size of the dotted path marked on the map. No one likes getting lost in mazes so this definitely makes it easier to see where you've already been but this doesn't mean there aren't any secrets you still have to look for.

+There is a demo. I personally haven't tried it so I can't say how much of an idea it would give you of the game, it's better than nothing.

+Beautiful animations. The abilities have nice visuals and great effects. Then there is of course the parry and backstab animations which are well made.

+The requirement to run this game isn't bad so most people should be able to play with little to no issues.


Cons:
-The parry and backstab animations can get extremely repetitive later on but there is a setting for this

-The co-op is limited to you and 1 other friend which is less than ideal

-There isn't any PvP so if you were hoping for that, you're out of luck

-The game is still $60 and considering many people would enjoy this with friends, as much as I love this game and enjoy seeing new players get into it, this would probably be best to pass on if that's your goal.


Massive thanks to anyone who has made it this far for hearing me out. These are my personal takes on the game and the overall review is subject to change. I was pretty tired at the time of making it so there may have been something I missed but regardless I hope this helps you decide whether or not to get it.

The combat is passable and laughably absurd, but the mechanics behind parrying and counter attacking feel so janky. In a game where being hit can be incredibly punishing and lead into you being repeatedly staggered, having the player be punished for being slightly off an incredibly strict timing is frustrating. Timing on parrying and counter attacking doesn't feel satisfying, as if the window is too short to allow someone the ability to learn how to perform these vital defensive strategies without experiencing frustration. This is a razor-thin balance that requires care, for if the window is too big, the game is easy. But if too tight, then the player just relies on the AI companion that is ever present in the story. Additionally, the tutorial just flings everything at you at once and leaves you trying to sort it all out. One of the things mentioned in the tutorial is drain attacks, but I've never found use in them since they seemed to be more risk than reward. I don't think this makes the combat bad, because I had a lot of fun with it, but I did experience frustration a lot. I think the combat opens up many opportunities for a vast wealth of character customization, but falls short with being mechanically deficient. It is such a shame because the boss fights are fairly well designed and fun.  

Something worth noting is that i-frames are totally broken and are the way to protect your character. 

Speaking of character customization, this is where this game really shines. The character customization is incredibly extensive, to the point where you could spend hours just tinkering around trying to re-create your favorite characters from other franchises... and you most likely could! But like combat, even this high point falls short with a lack of clothing, which is what you're going to see your character wearing for the entire game with no exception. There are about 5 options for each sex, and the female options are (of course) mostly skimpy. Even the named female NPCs have very skimpy outfits, with one essentially wearing rags and having multiple boob windows. For a game that lets you manually place where you want your braids and how big they are, it is sad that the clothing options are so thin. There should have been more and a great place to start would have been allowing mixing and matching of pieces. 

For the final bit of deep lows, I have to point at level design. This is why I am DNFing Code Vein. Some of them are all right, but not super exceptional. Others are so incredibly short they pass by in a blink. These levels are fine. Even some of the longer levels like Ruined City Center are fine because they don't outstay their welcome.

Then there's the level that made me quit: Cathedral of the Sacred Blood. 

The only other level that compares in poor quality is Howling Pit, for how much of a slog it is to get through because your movement speed is cut down sharply. Both levels more than outstay their welcome. Pit is a truly bad level not just for the cut in movement speed, but in how long it is. Both levels are long and tedious. But Cathedral is somehow even worse! Whoever designed Cathedral needs to never be allowed near level design ever again. It is borderline sadistic, being a series of long and boring corridors where you spend 95% of your time running in a straight line and probably backtracking because of the maze-like design. As if such an overly expansive waste of space wasn't enough, this level is where the difficulty curve doesn't even become a spike. It's more like a cliff. And you have to grind, die, grind again, die again in order to progress. Even then, you will likely get stagger chained and have to run back to heal at the nearest ""fire"" (if we're relating to Dark Souls here) because you got chunked for 65% of your health... or more if you just got here from Dried-Up Trenches! 

I intended to finish Code Vein, but with how 2 of the 7 levels I played were unbearable slogs, I decided that it's not worth it. There is something pretty good here, despite the weird jankyness with combat. I've gotten through plenty of games that are diamonds in the rough, but level design can make or break a game. In this case, two truly horrible levels ruined the game for me. As I result, I'd say the game is a 3/5 or 6/10. It could be enjoyed by the right people who could overlook such a flaw, but I'm not one of these people.",1651221691,1651221736,False,1,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

On top of its creativity, it has a smooth performance, even on less powerful software. I only have two issues. My biggest issue is that level design is not varied in this game. Almost every level is just a set of hallways or small arenas with a miniboss placed in; compared to other games of the genre that occasionally break off into large explorable plateaus like darkroot basin from Dark Souls. My second is that the game is generally quite slow story wise.

Don't expect it to be an easy game and although it's a Souls like game it's not as hard as the Souls franchise. It does have its difficulty to beat.

There are a lot of troll spots in some areas that drop you off the map and insta kill you without any warning.  player or ai getting stuck on corners, texture ripping in some areas, player not being able to use skills because of random non-response from buttons or keys .  
This is  a really fun game when it all works, but more times than not, it becomes a chore.  
This game tries to be Dark Souls too much, and ends up being a poor mirror of that style.  There is no nuance, some of the enemies go off into random combo attacks and you're left watching them as they drop themselves off a cliff, or fall down one of the random glitch holes in the ground.

There's something about dying over and over again and still wanting to play. It feels like gambling but with time. I tell myself ""if I just keep trying one more time, I'll finally defeat this enemy."" I imagine this is what most of think that keeps us playing. I love the character customization. It's fun to use. I should let you know, most of the women in this game have largely exaggerated boobs. Yes, I know my profile pic is a girl with large boobs. But I would've preferred a more realistic boob size for these women. Some of the boobs in this game could kill monsters if they allowed it. More outfit customization would've been great. It doesn't take away from the rest of the game though. The blood codes are a cool idea that allows the character to execute certain moves. I'm not even finished with the game. I die so much. As for navigation, I did just fine. But I have a great sense of direction. The cathedral area was not confusing to me like some reviewers said it was. I understand people wanting more from the dlc. But I don't mind what we got. More boss levels, blood codes and outfits. Also, I've died so many times from enemies knocking me off the map. I HATE it. Overall, get it on SALE.

You play as an avatar of your creation (great character customisation) who is amnesiac and also a Revenant, people that are infected with the Red Mist and need to survive with human blood. Succumbing to the effects of the Red Mist will turn the Revenants into monsters known as the Lost which are riddled throughout the world you are in. With your big tiddy anime girl and other characters you'll meet, you will venture through this cursed world in order to fight the Red Mist and also its source.

This game has a reputation of being an ""Anime Soulslike"". There are lots of gameplay mechanics inspired by the Souls games such as bonfires, intricate level designs, enemy placements, traps, and ambushes. The only difference is Code Vein is more cutscene heavy featuring a tale of Revenants you are in and the world you are fighting. And also the difficulty although is hard at first, will reach to an acceptable difficulty once knowing where the threads are. This is coming from someone who only yet played Dark Souls 2 SOTFS. 

The story is good once you accept the cheesiness of it. Cheese in story is when plot is not good but the execution of it is masterful (atleast thats how intepret it). Being in the world of Revenants where living is pain and dying will only bring you back, the story can be sometimes sad and depressing. But in each sorrowful moments from the game there are many hopeful messages that kinda hit me more than other story driven games. The story here is something I will remember for long. 

The artstyle of the game is beautiful aesthatically. You can customise your characters full of whack or an awesome OC of your creation. Other character designs are also nice. Boobies galore. Big tiddy honka honka. Maybe the downsides are that the female characters clothing are, hmmm, lets just someone's fantasy out there is being fulfilled. 

Took a while to talk about the combat since the story of this game hits more than the combat. Combat here is more fluid than what I experienced in Dark Souls 2 (obviously). You have the traditional light and heavy attack with guard, dodge, parry, and heal (or use item). You have a variety of weapons you can use from the heavy Greatswords to ranged Bayonettes. I personally mained a Greatsword, since big damage made me harder than Eren's hardening abilities.

To aid you in combat you can also equip classes, like job systems in JRPGs, called Bloodcodes. Bloodcodes have their own stats and skills you can equip. Each skill can be leveled up to a proficient stage that canbe used outside the Bloodcode. Basically the Final Fantasy V Job system. There are a variety of builds you can use and play.

Speaking of combat and anime tiddies, you will also encounter bosses that have anime tiddies. Bosses are okay. The initial bosses gave me a hard time but knowing the threads made me first tried all the other bosses. During fighting or exploring you can also have one companion to aid you. This is by the games' design since some bosses needs you to have a companion to aid. Companions can carry you as they carry. Those who want a hard mode can just switch to not having partner at all.

The soundtrack of this game is great. I'm becoming more interested in Go Shiina's work. All the songs are amazing to listen to especially the main theme.

On to the downsides, although this game are beautifull aesthetically, but the assets in this game can be repetitive. There are some unique and notable areas, but most of them just have the same copy and pasted ""Ruined City"" vibes. I know this is postapocalyptic, but atleast have some unique spots or landmarks in the already repetitive gameplay-loop. It doesn't help the fact that the side content to grind materials is just an inferior version of the main maps which made the copy paste nature of it so transparent.

Which brings me to side content you can engage with in this game. You can go to alternate areas from the mai campaign to grind for materials, which features the most arcadey, mind numbing, tedious objectives to do. You have to go to a number of areas, fight the bosses, gather the keys, open the door that leads to the final boss of the area. You have to do this almost TEN TIMES. Since this is not really mandatory and just a side thing, there are important plot items in these areas that I wanted and will not achieve until I've done all of them.

This brings me to the third flaw, the sidestories. This is not really a flaw and maybe a nitpick since I didi find out about this until the end, but there are plot items called Vestiges where you can explore the memories of the characters you know. These are payed as interactable cutscenes where you walk and explore the memories of the Vestiges. The stories in this memories are what amazing and fleshes out the story and the world more. But, having many more than maybe 20 Vestiges meaning you have to watch all these cutscenes to see it all. I spent an hour just experiencing these individual cutscenes that are although enjoyable, are sometimes a drag to get through. Also these Vestiges will also unlock locked skills so another reason to experience it all. You can SKIP it, but that beats the whole the story of the game.

Overall, I love the story of the game. The combat is fun. Some flaws but overall a good enjoyable game.

It's just the same enemy layout over and over and to spice things up they just throw multiple enemies at you all the time, this can be fun but most of the time if you get hit you will get stun locked for 90% of your health or hit from behind by some guy you didn't see since other 4 guys are chasing you. Even if you parry an attack when you are against multiple enemies you won't get time to heal since the remaining enemies will spam you with attacks the moment the i-frames end.
The bosses are a joke they are designed to be fought with an ally so if you try to fight it solo you will get overwhelmed with overly aggressive bosses and hitboxes that do a 360 on every attack and on top of that it does 75% of your health, very frustrating and not worth it in my opinion, I like hard bosses but this is just lazy since all bosses just have like 3-4 moves and the typical 3-4 hit combo, It just feels like all bosses have the same move set.
Enemy variety is a joke, they just reuse the same 4 enemies and re-skin them like it was no big deal, you have the guy with a big sword, the guy with a gun, the guy with a big axe, and the very big guy with a mace that's it, they even re-use most of the bosses ib the depth dungeons.
I wanted to like this game because the combat can be enjoyable at times, the gift system is cool and the abilities/combos you can do feel very good, the soundtrack is good and I like the way they tell the story through the vestiges but the longer I played it became very apparent they just copy-pasted the same thing over and over.
If you are looking for an action RPG with a good story and enjoyable characters and don't care about the janky combat I guess you can give this a try but it's a no for me also make sure to get it on sale, this game is not worth full price. I believe the overall experience of this game would be 100x better if you ignore all the copy-paste side content AKA the depths dungeons and have the opportunity to play with a friend also stay away from the DLC its just more copy-paste dungeons with the same enemies but they have more health now WOW!

The combat is very satisfying and I loved the styles you could change, based on the blood code you have. I haven't played a game with such a mechanic before so I personally find it unique how you need to work on the way you want to play, playing fast with a fast weapon or playing heavy, with the so called zweihander.

The map design is bad, I absolutely hated Cathedral of the Sacred Blood, and I'm sure I am not the only one who hates it. Some zones felt repetitive with no entertainment, which ruins the exploration on this game. You don't need to explore that much, but still takes a bit to take a few stuff that are important for yourself and maybe for an ending.

The bosses were decent, let's say it's balanced even without any partners being with you. I do have a problem with Blade bearer and Cannoneer. I personally don't find it balanced and it's not the same as O&S, but I probably had a bad day. I find it a bad copy of O&S, no fun on it, but it surely brought me relief on finishing it.

The lore is actually pretty good, I love that it's very straightforward, which makes the story very easy to understand. The memory idea was a nice bonus if you are interested in the lore and characters story, I suggest you to not skip it. Nothing much to say to lore.

I haven't played co-op, but I do find the partner choice a really helpful thing for new players, obviously you can decide to have one or no, it's your decision on how difficult you want to make it.

Overall, it's a good game, I would give it a 7/10. You should buy it when it's on sale, I don't find it worth full price, but if you're an anime fan and a soul lover, you should give it a try!",1650671694,1650671694,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

And honestly this is my first souls-like game which is for my first impression is wow this game is hard even i had the normal difficulty lol. The journey from zero to hero is tiring and painful. I got neutral ending at my first playthru without i knew it. And afterwards im gonna find all of the remaining endings. This game is really pain in the ass but somehow it makes wanna play more and more. For me i love this game. All aspect of it. Especially the player customization which is wide and complex in a good way.

I would love to see a new sequel or maybe prequel just like nier series. Anw, love this game and thanks to devs for their hardworks. The most thing that i love is this game is not very hard to find mats to upgrade weapons that we have just simply need one kind of material which is easy to get if u explore. Unlike monster hunter type games, we dont need to find different kinds of mats to make or upgrade weapons and bloodveils. Just need one simple mat. And yeah one last thing of this game i love too, is the engaging scenes and ofcors the memories of revenants that connected each other.

Code Vein is a frustrating unenjoyable grind that ultimately led me to burn out and quit the game.

Code Vein is a Dark Souls clone that fails at almost every aspect of what makes Dark Souls great. Combat is fun at first, until you realize the majority of enemies in the game are re-skinned copies of what you fought 10 hours ago. Itemization and progression is very lackluster. Exploration is an unbelievable chore, and always leaves you feeling as if you'll ""eventually find something cool."" I always felt as if I was waiting for the game to pick up and finally become great, but it simply never happens. Level design is easily this game's WORST aspect -- In short, level design is frustrating, uninteresting, bland, and often very confusing. You'll traverse massive areas where NOTHING is distinguished and EVERYTHING looks the same, and yet you're suppose to be able to navigate your way through these labyrinthine complexes . Gameplay involves elements such as: you just pulled yet another lever for the 11th time that looks identical to all other levers and opens a door somewhere that looks like all other doors. Hmmm where could this door be this time? After searching for an hour, perhaps you'll find it.

The only enjoyable aspect of the game is the boss fights, which are challenging (if playing solo without AI) and very souls-like. However, they're so few and far between that I simply can't justify spending hours and hours grinding a terrible level design just for an OK boss fight.

TLDR: Don't waste your time. Definitely don't waste your money. If you've played Dark Souls, love it, and are looking for more souls-like action, then seriously go replay Dark Souls again. It's a much better use of your time.",1650614328,1650614504,False,1,0,0.440568238496780396,0,True,False,False

After dropping Bloodborne and Nioh due to aggravation with the stress of it, Code Vein caught my eye due to the partner mechanic. Your AI friend will truly be your best buddy as they pick you back up from a random mistake here and there.
If you want a more authentic git gud experience, you can go solo, but this was the first game where I felt like I was actually able to enjoy the game instead of sweating over it.

Gameplay wise the game gives you a variety of different powers and every weapon has something between 4-6 different attacks you can perform. The game relies heavely in its system, where when you level up it gives you points in every status, and the uniqueness of your build resides in the different powers and passives you mix together. Some might see this as a bad thing. Personally, it gives you the possibility to completly change your build to deal with a boss or if you just want to test it without penalizing you for it. 

The story is ok and the side characters are all unique and interesting. The game also offers a lot of customization options for your character and you can change it at any point of the game.

Code Vein is a game which tries to appeal to a variety of kinds of players, it can be a hard or easy game  (you can play without a partner, making the game MUCH more hard) and it's not too grindy.

The anime platitudes, the aesthetics, the sluggish gameplay, the weirdly sexualized representation of women (especially some of the earlier bosses)... it all seems to add up into a boring experience at best, and a frustrating one at worst. 

It's clear this game tries to emulate some of the mechanics made popular by the Fromsoft games, but it does so at a very shallow level; you have your parries, your dodges, your ""bonfire"" checkpoints, strength builds, dex builds... but it seems to kind of not go any deeper than that; your stats are tied to the ""class"" and armor you equip, leading to very one-dimensional builds (and leveling only grants you a flat bonus to all your stats at once; you can't really invest all your points in HP or a damage scaling stat, you're locked into just becoming a tiny bit stronger every time)

The game was designed with co-op in mind as well as being able to have a npc partner at all times (which you can also change out at the games bonefires for an npc that is more suited to the task at hand). It's also very easy to end up over leveled if you find a build that you like and stop buying extra gifts. Is all that a bad thing?

I can't believe this game has a very positive status cause it really is so boring and dull. First off, the environments in the game are absolutely generic, linear and incredibly boring and just not appealing to the eye. Most of the colours are dull and just ideally one colour. There's no point of exploring because all the maps are extremely boring to traverse and there's nothing ever cool or useful to find unless it's just consumables. The weapons are alright but nothing incredible. The blood veils are an interesting concept but very stale and I wish it could've been expanded on. There's no incentive to levelling up either because the game essentially cripples you if you're pass the level cap for an area. Most of the maps just have a linear path and a maze like path, they just basically went safe making this game. And don't get me started on the bosses, it's such a HUGE jump in difficulty at the beginning like it's so unrealistic. The shop in the game is completely useless because they only sell weapons and ""armour"" you find and usually people don't toss away what you find so it's only there for upgrades and even then upgrading is really slow. Customisation in the game is pretty cool except for the clothing, there's I think 3 total clothing and only two nice looking clothing and that's it you can't buy or find more clothes. Next thing is a mechanic called Focus and basically focus is a bar you can build up by getting hit a lot or parrying or doing perfect dodges and once the bar is filled you can't get staggered and you're basically suppose to be OP, HOWEVER THIS APPLIES TO EVERY CHARACTER IN THE GAME, INCLUDING ENEMIES AND IT BENEFITS ENEMIES WAY MORE THAN YOU! I have not once had my focus build up and go ""Wow that really was clutch there"" It never ever works in your favour, by the time your bar fills up the enemy is dead, but the enemies focus bar fills up so much faster so they get to utilize it more than you and the bosses can still stagger you even when your focus is built up and all the bosses just have huge range for whatever reason. Only good thing about this game are gifts and gifts are basically your abilities you can unlock and use in fights. Overall, if you're a souls lover like me this is not a game you wanna play. They basically took the style of souls games and just completely took out the good mechanics and visuals that the souls games have and just made it plain and boring and gave the areas no incentive to explore.

TLDR: Code Vein is, to some extent, a good and fun game, but as a Souls-like it sucks. The only redeeming factor (for me) is that it's Big Tiddy Anime Vampire Souls-like.

============
The good
============
Character creation: it's definitely better than the Souls games but Nioh 2's character creation and transmog mechanic makes customization better. Still, really good looking customization options for anime characters.

Build customization: There's a lot of ""classes"" and skills to obtain. You can even borrow skills from other classes, so there is a whide range of play styles possible. This reason, plus character customization, is the reason why I have maybe a dozen characters now.

Interesting story: as of this writing I haven't finished it yet, but it has the familiar nuances that comes with anime stories. There was a part of the story that made me cry but I'd rather not post it here. Yes, the game's been out for years but just gonna leave it out for those who haven't been spoiled by the internet.

=============
The bad
=============
Dodging is way harder to do than in the Soulsborne games. Heck, I could dodge way better in Nioh 2 and that game is way more fast-paced than this. On the flip-side, the quick dodge animation is awesome, though.

The combat is clunky, even one-hand sword attacks feel slow. If you initiate a fight with an attack you will most likely get hit back, so you always have to wait for the enemy to make the first move if you don't want to take damage.

The parry mechanic's timing is horrendous. I'm bad at parrying but at least in the Souls games I can see the parries connecting or not and it makes sense visually, and the parry window activates almost as soon as you press the parry button. In Code Vein there's still a second or so before it can actually parry.

The backstab mechanic is inconsistent. The chances of you getting a proper backstab is less than 50%. In the Soulsborne games, if you were behind an opponent that can be backstabbed it's almost guaranteed that you will get a successful backstab.

Staggering bosses does nothing. Yeah, it gives you a small window to go ham but by the time you get that window you probably already exhausted your stamina and/or ichor, or your attack skills are on cool-down. At least in Elden Ring you can riposte most staggered bosses.

The ichor mechanic is shit, to some extent. If you want to increase your ichor pool you need to connect drain attacks and that's easier said than done. The easiest way would be to connect backstabs but I already mentioned how the backstab mechanic is shit. The next easiest way is to connect during a combo, but there's a lot of problems here. If the enemy dies you can't connect with the drain attack. If the enemy doesn't get flinched by your attacks, you will get hit and your drain attack will possibly get cancelled. The next way to obtain it is via charged drain attacks, but charging takes forever and if you get hit you get staggered out of the drain attack. And then there's parrying but parrying is shit in this game.

The targeting mechanic is shit.

My final thoughts
================
I still think my purchase is worth it and I have no regrets getting the game, but I'll still give it a downvote. I still think it's fun to some extent and will probably put in a couple hundred hours into it, but it just sucks as a Souls-like.

If you love big tiddy anime vampire waifus and hunky anime vampire husbandos then get the game, but I would suggest to get it on a sale. The original price is not worth it.
If you want a game you think you'll have fun with, that depends on your patience on clunky gameplay mechanics. And still get it on sale.
If you want a good Souls-like, don't get it. It's not worth it.",1650427258,1650428000,False,4,1,0.526566982269287109,0,True,False,False

I'll explain: 

There is so much jank and lack of polish that you actively have to learn the game's strange, strange logic to make sense of it. Ranged attacks like the gun from the bayonet have a 5 foot range, enemies don't see you unless you're within 10 feet of them (which you can use for your benefit). Even with maxed out weapons and armor, you do pixel damage to bosses, while you can die in two or three hits even from generic enemies. Each map is a maze, so unless you know to look at below for connecting platforms and you're willing to retread the same map 500 times (to collect vestiges, items, etc), you will have to have a lot of patience and memory.

However, the character creation system is great, the game is hilariously edgy (I recommend if you're a fan of so-bad-it's-good cheese, or Shadow the Hedgehog), and Io is my wife. There's certain quality of life things, such as the fact you can have a companion helper who takes aggro/heals you when you're at 0 hp, and little dots on the minimap showing where you've been and larger dots for where you've just been to help avoid going in circles (though you will anyways).

Get it on sale, like I did, when it was like ~$15 dollars for the full deluxe edition. I got about 40 hours in for a generous Good Ending playthrough where I reached level 135.

Another tip: use the map markers and lights if there's a fork in the path you want to revisit later. It will save your life.",1650404522,1650404522,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It has similar mechanics like stamina, exp currency, and passives that you can equip to enhance your playstyle. It however skips the stat allocation and uses blood codes for stat setups you can swap on the fly. Nice for the fact you can swap your playstyle art any time, given you grind out the materials that allow you to inherit skills. 

Game balance is kind of all over the place. You can play this game with and without an AI partner, which can make fights much easier, though the aggro system is weird at times. I think overall the game was fair, except for a single boss fight where you face two bosses at once. That fight is really up to the individual to decide whether it was a unfair fight or not. You can use 5 catagories of weapons, one-handed and two-handed swords, axes/ hammers, pole-arms and bayonets. You can also learn skills that can buff. cast spells, or enhance your partners. Mana in this game is restored by attacking or consuming items, or using your special drain attack. 

Story is typical anime flair, our world is now inhabited by vampires called Revenants. Our protag works with other revenants to find a better alternative to human's being used as slaves to feed on by revenants. The main enemy are the Lost, who are revenant that have lost their mind from lack of blood being consumed.

I do like the character customizing but the lack of outfits is quite saddening and would have made this game stand out vs other souls-like games in terms of fashion had they only added more.

Some important things to note based on my own experience: 
- The game can be played alone or in coop mode.
- An AI companion can be selected between 6 different characters and they can assist the player throughout the game. There can be only one AI companion active at the time and not every companion is available from the start. I recommend playing with a companion if the player wants more immersion while exploring. The AI is good, so no need to worry about it getting stuck or falling off a cliff.
- The AI companion talks to the player while exploring dungeons, reacting to different situations and environments adding immersion to the game, the main character is not very talkative tho.
- Fighting with an AI companion gives the player plenty of time to heal, switch items, etc.., ultimately making the fights way easier. If the payer wants the game to be challenging turning off the AI companion is obligatory.
- The enemies drop a great amount of Haze (souls), there's no need to waste hours farming.
- The playstyle is dictated by the Blood Code, which is interchangeable. You can change build whenever you want, wherever you want.
- The level design is intricate, at times it lacks variety. The different areas might be frustrating to some players. I personally love maze-like maps and I loved getting lost in the different areas, it really gave me the feeling of ""getting lost in a dungeon and not knowing where the fuck to go, ultimately feeling frustrated"".
- Hitboxes are good (surprisingly).
- There's a minimap.
- The character creator is good. Unfortunately it's impossible to change every single face feature (chin, cheeks, nose, mouth).
- The OST is AMAZING, featuring anything from powerful choirs to rock to emotional piano.
- The Japanese dubbing is good.
- Avoid buying any DLC, just burn your money instead.",1650257258,1650368083,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Graphics are great. The environments look and feel like bizarre landscapes partly destroyed by war and massive spikes. The character models look good as 3D anime characters.

The audio is good. The soundtrack ranges from eerie music while exploring the environments to pretty epic or heavy metal music during battles and cutscenes.

The storytelling seems slow during cutscenes and while going through memories to unlock vestiges. The cutscenes are like watching a 3D anime which would be fine, except it's in between intense combat. The memories force you to walk and the dialogue takes so long you could take 5-10 minutes to get a tiny tidbit of lore. Both cutscenes and memories feel so slow compared to the rest of the game that it makes you want to skip them.

The subtitles sometimes have spelling or grammatical errors, and sometimes don't match the dialog at all, at least in English. These errors don't seem to be a problem in understanding the dialog as far as I've seen. There are also some errors in texts throughout the game like the hint text during loading screens or in a hint window.

There are bugs which ruin the combat at times;
Sprinting at an enemy and attacking, expecting to do a thrust attack, but your character suddenly turns 90 degrees and misses the target (uncommon),
Rolling in the opposite direction your moving (uncommon),
Targeting an enemy in the distance instead of the one in front of you (rare),
Being revived by the companion, or trying to revive the companion, and it shows that the healing ability was used, but the revive never occurs even when my companion or I have full or near full health (very common),
Holding down the sprint button but your character doesn't sprint even after the normal 1-2 seconds delay if you're in combat (common).

Most of the game is easy, just dodge, block, parry, or level up some more, but there are a few bosses that are insanely difficult. A couple boss battles are against 2 bosses which have too many advantages. The bosses switch targets randomly meaning you have to avoid both bosses instead of attacking. The bosses have attacks that can attack both players so you have to avoid attacks from a boss that's not even focused on you. Both bosses can fly forward practically instantly so you can get hit by either boss at any time. In one boss battle, both bosses have ranged attacks which damage on impact and also explode so if you dodge the attack you can still get hit by the explosion.

That being said, the leveling system seems a little easy. You can farm levels very quickly especially later on in the game where relatively easy enemies give about 10,000 Haze each. Relatively easy, compared to the bosses in the same areas which you could spend 5 hours trying to beat, thanks to random chance, just for 100,000 Haze.",1650320606,1650320606,False,0,0,0.482758641242980957,0,True,False,False

Good game, major similarities to dark souls, still judging it as just a JRPG.


Pros
Combat feels good and large customization to builds
Story was good but not amazing
Side stories were pretty nice imo
Character Customization -> Anime Thirst Traps or whatever your heart desires
Can turn off partner and NG+ if you wanna make the game harder
Enemies can be challenging but its a souls like so like git gud

Cons
Enemies can be repetitive since there's not much change to them
Map layout is straight forward EXCEPT THE GODDAMN CATHEDRAL OF SACRED BLOOD, actual labyrinth but whatever, its doable
Jumps in HP for enemies seemingly feeling like its outta nowhere
Can feel clunky at times
Partner feels stupid if your using them
Weapon choices and upgrades feel limited even though there are a good amount to choose from

They implemented a few similar mechanics (like bonfire and souls collecting - aka mistle plants and haze....), but it doesn't really feel like a true souls game. It's more like a super arcade-y version of one.

A good way to explain it would be to compare it to games in the racing genre. Demon's Souls is Gran Turismo and Code Vein is Ridge Racer. Both great games, but one could easily enjoy one and hate the other.

The world and ideas are actually pretty great, I just didn't enjoy how the story came together, especially combined with the incredibly easy gameplay and mostly linear level design.

pros:
♦ fun romp around souls-like
♦ good visuals

Cons:
♦ hit boxes seem off at the best of times
♦ back stabs work when they feel like it
♦ the damage that enemies do is insanely high like 2 shotting you in the begining of the game high
♦ your only healing is either an item you cant buy of the regen(s) you get and both heal for maybe 1/3 of your hp while most enemies deal much more than that
♦ with those two prior notes in mind, you can be brought back by your partner(s) but this apears to be limmited and theres no way of knowing how many they have left.
♦ i honestly had to check if it was a square enix game cause it felt like there was just a bombardment of cutscenes
♦ the fact that FRAGMENTS of the map are scatted around the area and often reveal the area you just went though and had to manually map out yourself just to find the fragments 
♦ the stats and class differences make 0 sense at a glance
♦ leveling up seems to just be to increase your hp and nothing else cause it doesnt seem like it increases any other stats 

TLDR: if your looking for a replacement for darksouls and are willing to to give it a try, sure i guess but get it on a big sale
overall i reccomend another game in stead though or just play though DS again

If you want a game for story, look elsewhere, if you want something that has fun gameplay, again, elsewhere.\
For the time and effort this game wants you to put into it, there feels to be almost zero reward. 
For the actual gameplay, you have stats that can be altered by gear and 'blood codes', these will affect the 6 choices of weaponry you have, plus the light/dark spells damage output, but ultimately this does not matter as regardless of your level, enemies and bosses will scale with you. 
When it comes to level design i'm positive the design team made the first three areas then just reskinned textures and enemies and said: that'll do for the next 12 stages, except as you progress level design goes from being boring and tedious, to just outright unfair. Pitfalls with no way distinguishable difference to surroundings, wall traps with no way around other than just tanking the damage, enemies designed just to push you into the never-ending pitfalls. As you progress you will find the level will have only one spawn point, being at the start, nothing that bad, except now when you challenge the poorly designed boss and get killed by their completely unavoidable attacks, you now have to spend 5 minutes getting back there, and no damn well this will be a recurring pattern in the second half of the games because the developers don't know the difference between challenging and stupidly un-finished gameplay.",1650099896,1650099896,False,1,0,0.514563083648681641,1,True,False,False

Combat is pretty underwhelming. Hits lack any significant impact, and weapons just look like plastic toys with how effortlessly your character wields them with one hand. Even the huge axes, hammers, and swords look so unconvincing that you could swear your character's just pretending they're heavy. The English voice acting is just as bad as any other dubbed anime, and the story is nothing more than passable.

The game isn't even difficult. Your companion character is super powerful and will do most of the work, congratulating you on a well-fought battle despite you doing barely anything.

It does have some interesting ideas in terms of character mechanics (gear, abilities and the like), but the very core of Souls gameplay is lackluster. 

The world is interesting and pretty. The actual maps - repetitive, uninspired, quite boring quite quickly. 

The game also insists on never telling you what your actual objective is, even if you're aware of the post-it note on the map. The guides are vague, to say the list, and sometimes progression is locked behind talking to the same NPC 6 times in a row for no reason. I've stumbled blindly along the same paths of the map I've cleared 6 times already hopign this time I find the thing the game wants from me - until I gave up and googled what's wrong. I've done that twice in the first two areas of the game, at which point I lost interest. 

Bosses - admittedly I've only seen (I think?) two actual bosses - the butterfly lady makes no sense to me. I beat here multiple times - at neither of these I felt I knew what was really going on. Meh/10

Boss design is very sus, some bosses have 5 frame unreactable bullshit 1 shot move that will destroy you and your sanity, a few of the bosses have very good telegraphs but the animation looks very sus. But difficulty is generally a lot easier if you have played other souls-like game before.

Character creator is very good, you can actually make a lot of your favourite anime character from this nonsense, I completed my playthrough as 2B and it was lit.

Level design is very sus, when I reached Anor Londo I actually managed to find my way to the halfway point because I was just jumping down random ledges and was lucky enough to find a random ladder that took me to the top. But after that I was running in circles and literally have 0 idea where the fuck I was going or where the hell I am suppose to go. I am 100% sure the level designer was doing weed or something when designing that level but okay. The rest of the levels aren't fantastic, with not a lot of visual story telling, the stages and levels are just there for you to play and walk through before finding the boss.

The whole game you will be fighting the same 5 enemy that they throw at you. At least they give you decent exp lmao.

The only redeeming thing about this is the combat. You get a lot of strong options and variations to the few weapon types that they give you. And the gift system where you can inherit moves from other classes makes building your character more flexible. But despite the decent combat, which is a shame because of how bad some of the boss design is. 

Overall, I can recommend the game, it is a fairly easy souls-like game to get into and have a interesting weapon system. Buy on sale and you probably wont regret it?",1650024719,1650024719,True,2,0,0.509933769702911377,0,True,False,False

The mechanics work most of the time, but when four enemies attack, one of them will hit.  And sometimes a single enemy will have so much time on their attack animation that even if you dodge, you still get hit by the end of the attack.

 Bosses tend to completely change it all up and it just becomes a massive aoe fest that you just sort of stumble through until you get lucky and win the fight.

 The story is decent, but for replayability they have four endings.  One ending is like one word different from one of the others.  And three of the endings require you to either be blind or play badly to manage to get them.  The ng+ is okay and some people must like it, but I don't see it as really giving any additional challenge or replayability because as I said, most of the difficulty is just enemies swarming you or attacks that can't really be dodged.  That isn't really going to change in ng+.

The story fell completly flat as did all the characters there is many moments where if u cared about the characters at all you might be interested, but you'll find that you dont and getting thru cutscenes is very boring and hard to do.

The power system is somewhat interesting however, the weapons/movesets are very boring and I mostly just used the very first sword you get for the entire game, they all feel basically the same in their weapon class and theres only like 6 classes of weapon all with very small movesets.

The level design is boring to the extreme it feels like a very dated game. 

The music has a few standout songs that are pretty awesome imo but 90% of the time you get this generic background ""action"" music or like ambient creepy level explore music barely anything good here.

The game can be fairly difficult playing solo which is my preferred method for this game as the NPC's you can have help you make the game a bit too easy for my taste.

I do not recommend buying this game or playing it the only really good thing being you can create a very cute waifu with a good character editor.

Everything is spelled out in laborious detail.  There are cutscenes every 5 minutes which could be completely omitted and nothing would be lost.  There is a 5 minute long tutorial before the 5 minute long intro before you can really take control of your character.  The enemy AI ignores your party members and makes a beeline for you.  Your AI party members are incapable of hitting the enemy (I watched one party member shoot the wall above an enemy 5+ times in a row).  Party members do not shut the fuck up.  I have three hours of gameplay (I left the game on the main menu for almost an hour), and I already have the achievement for having an AI companion talk to you 50 times.  I do not play games to have women constantly nagging me about every little thing that is happening.  There's a bug where the mouse cursor recenters itself and becomes active when certain menus pop up, and it sets focus to whatever is under it.  You will push a button on the controller, the menu opens with ""A"" highlighted, and then it will immediately switch to ""B"" before your button press registers forcing you to reopen the menu again.

One positive thing I noticed immediately upon starting the game is how snappy the menu is.  It's not quite Haydee levels of snappiness, but it's definitely up there.

I gave up after I entered an epic-looking chamber, saw the next save point, ran towards it, and then another stupid cutscene started containing a two minute monologue on eating onigiri and ""are we even real?""-esque thoughts.

I had more fun fiddling with the character creator/customization that with the actual gameplay. Lackluster lonely environments, clunky mechanics, not enough feedback, unbalanced bosses and progression, copy paste enemies everywhere and the DLCs are infamous for how bad they are (I bought the season pass at launch, was a mistake, haven't even touched the DLC to this day). 

For me, the only thing it has going for it are famous japanese voice actors/actresses, the Gilded Hunter battle sound track and Io's boobs.

For starters, it took me 54 hours to complete my first run, primarily because I was trying to get everything (and failed). This is also my first Souls-like too, tho this isn't the reason why I bought and played this game.

First off, starting with the obvious point - this is very anime. If you don't like the anime aesthetics, you probably won't like this game. It's a bit of a slow burn in the first 2-3 hours if you are someone who is going in blind.

The story is meh. Very straight forward like in a typical anime. Not necessarily bad, the plot is actually great if you think about but it really feels like the story is there for the sole purpose for it to be there. Honestly, building your relationships with the characters themselves and the journey to the end itself mattered way more than the story itself.
If you try to dig deeper, you might find some lore/story elements that the game doesn't explicitly tell you but that's up to you to figure out, if you are into this stuff.

Decent character creator, you can spend hours on making and customizing your characters. This is probably one of the best and most detailed anime character creator out there.
Although I think that there is still places for improvement. For example, lack of clothing variety (only 6-7 clothes choices with the options to remove stuff like sleeves for example) and the hairstyles choices feel rather inflated (as half of the hairstyles are really just a mirror variations). Also, sometimes hair clipping through your character's face or hat can happen too, especially during cutscenes and it doesn't look good IMO. If this game ever gets a sequel, I really wish the devs would try and improve on that....

Weapon and armour designs, on other hand, are up in my valley.
Level design is meh, I guess. I really don't care about that, with the exception of the Cathedral (which admittedly can be a pain in the ass even on later runs).
Class builds system has a huge potential and you can switch them on the fly, although be aware that you won't get all possible classes right of the bat. That being said, it is perfect for virtually any play-style.

Combat system is a bit of hit-or-miss. Stuff like parry and backstabbing takes awhile to master.

The voice acting is okay. Sound, music and OST is okay too.

TL;DR:

Overall, a solid 7/10.

The story is pretty weak for me compared to Dark Souls. The characters all have motivations and goals but don't actually do enough to endear me to them. The plot is fairly predictable. And there's a 30 minute cutscene near the end about how the power of friendship is your real strength--not, say, the dozens of hours you've spent building your character's power. 

The combat system is standard Souls fare, with small changes. No shields (or off-hands of any sort, actually), but you can use your weapon to block. And dodge rolls feel a bit different. But the same general principles apply.

The real game changer for me was the blood code system. Each of these is basically a class you layer onto your character. Your level is separate from your blood codes, and applies stat increases to each of them based on their scaling. This makes it much easier than in Souls games to try out different builds. The game encourages build swapping further by allowing you to unlock the skills you've mastered in one blood code for use in another (provided the other code has the requisite stats to use it). As someone who loves trying out different builds, I found this to be a massive breath of fresh air compared to Souls games, where you typically have to either roll a new character or use limited items to try a different build, and the only reward for doing so is that you are now a different class. 

If you like Dark Souls, but don't mind a lackluster story, and wish you could swap builds more easily, try this one out.",1649798110,1649798110,True,1,0,0.507042229175567627,0,True,False,False

Take some of this with a grain of salt, as of writing I've sunk about four hours into this, and this is going to be a deeply subjective breakdown of why I feel this game completely failed to connect with me.

TL;DR, this game feels like a solid experience at heart, but gets lost for me under its unwillingness to embrace its setting and plot completely, poor writing, and a lack of an engaging or believable world in exchange for weeb nonsense.

I'm no expert on these sorts of games, but combat feels pretty solid, though I don't suggest playing this without a controller. Fights for the most part feel fair, but punishing if you mess up, and although there are quite a few enemies that like to ambush you in one way or another, it doesn't feel like they're so common to be either frustrating or predictable. There's also optional companions, which I found helpful in getting into the game initially. I'll give the game credit in that there do seem to be more complex systems in regards to classes, equipment, and skills, but it hasn't been something I've gotten to sink my teeth into.

Character customization was something that sold me on this game initially, and it certainly was in depth. This is the sort of game where you could spend a long time getting every detail perfect, and if I were more in love with the art style, I'm sure I could have gotten lost in there forever. Unfortunately, that ties into where my issues with the game begins. 

So, I don't love anime, and unfortunately this game feels completely buried in the tropes of that medium. The character creation is certainly in depth, but when it comes to clothing choices, you're stuck with few choices, all of which feel straight out of any generic anime MMO. Playing a woman in particular leaves you heavily exposed; the most combat appropriate outfit I could choose was a skin-tight leather bodysuit. 

It's not just your character, of course. NPCs wears outfits that make no sense in a literal apocalypse, with many of the men wearing suits, while the women are in outfits that would make more sense to go out clubbing in than anything else. If that's partly what you're interested in with this game, more power to you. Go make your anime waifu and enjoy. But it was really weird for me because almost everything else in the game plays your situation straight. All of my playtime has been in this ruined wreck of a city, surrounded by the remains of civilization, fighting my way through the twisted victims of this calamity... but my character looks like she forgot to put on real pants and my companion dropped straight out of Genshin Impact. It feels like none of the characters belong there, including, despite my best efforts with the character creator, my own. I would have liked if the art team had embraced the post-apocalyptic setting in regards to character design and creation options, because I actually like the enemy design. They even have you wearing gas masks outside, but apparently that's about as far as the art style was allowed to go.

The art style made this worse for me, but I could have forgiven it if it had told an interesting story, or had fun characters to just be around. Unfortunately, it feels like the writers came up with the reason for the apocalypse and the basic plot, and then phoned it in. The character list features gems like: leader, guy who misses his dead friends and doesn't like having to drink blood, girl who wears tattered clothing, naive guy, bandit leader. The character I related most to was my own character during cutscenes, since her dead, glazed over eyes and blank expression perfectly mirrored mine once an NPC started talking. Seriously, I can't remember a single name of a character in the game except for Louis, and that's just because his name is Louis. Everyone either feels like a stock character I've met a million times before, or just a way of pushing exposition or plot points at you. They aren't even fun to have as companions, with very little to say about the world around you and a burning need to comment on almost every action you take. Speaking up every time you pick up an item or shouting concern every time you take damage isn't done in a way that seems to show off any personality, and got on my nerves super quickly.

The plot itself is... there was an apocalypse, people now need to survive on blood, and apparently you're the only one who can purify the blood trees you find on your journeys. I'm absolutely missing details here, but I genuinely don't remember much more than that because it get delivered in exposition dumps during cutscenes and I ended up tuning everything out. You're rarely given the opportunity to organically explore and wonder about things because an NPC has infodumped on you in a cutscene as soon as it became relevant, alongside a bunch of information you may not have even cared about. Its frustrating, because the experience of learning about the world is poor, but at the same time you can't turn your brain off entirely because the NPCs want to keep you up to date on everything, and will stop the flow of gameplay to lecture you.

I appreciate this game because it introduced me to the soulslike style of game and showed that I could definitely get into it. Unfortunately, mechanics alone don't make a game, and everything outside of that, the story and characters and everything that I remember well after playing, all of that stuff is just... poorly done and tonally dissonant. Gonna pick up Bloodborne when I get the chance.

On the plus side, there's a hot spring where you can make your animes take a bath and take pictures of them, so its objectively a great game. 10/10.",1649786166,1649786691,False,12,0,0.49691203236579895,0,True,False,False

- You always have an AI partner there are multiple to pick from. You can choose to play solo if you'd like.
- stats are determined by equipment instead of you investing in a build so you can move stuff around any time
- enemy variety is very lacking and so is the level design
- you can always block, effectiveness varies by each weapon
- you can always parry, effectiveness and behavior varies by the armor you equip
- progression comes from learning skills from gear you get (blood codes) so you can master them and then mix and match passive/active abilities from there
- MP in this game replenishes from landing attacks, maximum MP increases from landing parries, backstabs, or focus heavies
- focus is a unique mechanic where you get benefits from iframe dodging attacks, also builds up from being hit. Fully restores stamina so it rewards skillful dodging so you can keep attacking.
- some (not all) bosses are replayable from doing depths maps. If you'd played bloodborne they're kinda like chalice dungeons
- the game has a map to help you navigate it tracks where you've been and is developed by finding a thing in the area which reveals the area around you
- no message system like in fromsoft souls games
- no pvp by default but a mod was made if you wanna try that
- co op kind of janky because you have to be in the menu and keep searching for people instead of just putting your status on ""looking for co op"" and keep playing but that's fine this game's online is dead anyway just use my wife Io.

What really surprised me is how invested I became in the world and the characters in it. In the trailers I saw ""Dark Souls but it's anime,"" and at the time Elden Ring was just a silly myth, so that was all the marketing I needed. But after playing it, I was genuinely intrigued by the characters and their stories, memories, and worldly attachments. Having one of these companions around to help in the fight was a fresh addition to the genre; it always feels good knowing someone has your back.

The flexible class system does make for poor replayability (possible pro?), unless you want the multiple endings (possible con, given the replayability?). There is stuff to do after the credits roll, however, in the form of Depths. If you have played Bloodborne they're similar to the Chalice Dungeons; not really any story, just some tilesets, mobs to kill, stuff to get, and re-used boss assets.

PROS:
Code Vein has one of the best anime aesthetics of any game on the market right now.  It's easy to get absolutely lost in the character creator, with a refreshing amount of options limited only to your senses of creativity and imagination.  The story is hard hitting and emotional, and character investment is effortless.  Sporting likeable heroes and villains you love to hate, all of whom are all looking for the same thing, a solution to a very difficult problem.  The character's unique traits allow for near infinite flexibility, and give you the ability to truly make any play style you desire.  Tank, assassin, mage, and even supportive builds that give you the feel of skulking the battlefield as an undying vampiric paladin.  All in all, I absolutely love the sheer amount of things that Code Vein lets you get away with.  This is a game for people who want to do anything and everything with their kits.

CONS:
In comparison to other Souls-like games, Code Vein lacks a feel of precision.  While combat does feel like there's a solid amount of weight behind it, there will be a number of little moments where the slightest slips will occur, resulting in an attack not quite landing right, or a roll that still runs into the tail end of an enemy attack.  Most games that offer this level of difficulty tend to have very solid rules of engagement, and there are a number of monsters in this game that do not follow those rules.  Expect monsters to armor through attacks randomly, land overwhelmingly powerful attacks through walls and barriers, and ambush you from locations that are impossible to know about your first time through an area.  Even mechanics like Backstabbing and Launching seem to be inconsistent at the best of times.  

Lastly, the game's bosses are brutal spikes in difficulty.  While this is nothing new for Souls Like games, the sheer difference between your experiences inside and outside of a boss arena can often lead to a confusing twist of senses, almost as if Code Vein is two separate games smashed into one.  At the time of writing this I'd say I'm at least half way through the game, and up until now I've defeated every boss I have encountered, but each and every one was an arduous slog of death and rebirth. The bosses are brutal, unrelenting, and ultimately unfair, and to some of you, that will be right up your alley, but to others, it will be too much to deal with.",1590026862,1649524641,True,1,0,0.497925341129302979,0,True,False,False

678960,113394328,76561198034991326,0,14,4721,0,4721,1649183660,"Code:Vein is one of many games in the last couple of years that have taken a stab at experimenting with the souls-like formula that many “git gud” gamers have come to enjoy like a rake in the face. But does it deserve to stand among the great titans?

Code:Vein is a souls-like with a hefty Anime paint-job down to the obsessive character creation where every single detail can be fine-tuned where a ton of people have made it their life’s mission to recreate as many fictional – and perhaps real life – characters as the engine will allow. Of course they’re not perfect recreations, but some of them come pretty darn close. So, yeah, if you’re into creating a character down to their nostril hairs you can definitely do that. You might be there for a couple of hours, though.

The story is likewise littered with Anime-tropes and overcomplicated ideas (never mind the abundance of female characters compared to male characters). It’s… bloated to say the least and halfway into the first couple cutscenes I just tuned out and followed the main bits as best I could. You are a revenant, a vampire-like creature that can resurrect itself so long as the heart isn’t destroyed. Much like vampires you need to sustain yourself with blood or otherwise be doomed to frenzy and join the lost; revenants that have discarded their sanity and turned into terrifying creatures that make up the majority of enemies and bosses you end up beating to a pulp. The revenants were created to fight a monster known as the Queen, the first revenant that had incredible powers and wreaked havoc on the living. At some point this Queen was defeated and her body parts scattered and left with several individuals known as successors – People with high compatibility to inherit part of the Queen to then lock themselves away and keep the Queen from resurrecting.

As you start the game you find yourself awake in a desolate city, tired and craving blood. You end up getting roped into a small group of revenants looking for blood beads. Red teardrops that help stave off frenzy. When on the hunt for these blood beads the man you were hunting with ends up frenzying and serves as the first boss of the game. From here you’re introduced to the concept of vestiges. Pieces of a person’s memory that you, the player, are able to interact with and integrate into your own body and allow you to use that person’s ability; or blood code.

It’s from here you join a group of people that want to find out what’s been happening to the world and what the reason is behind the blood beads and the blood springs that have cropped up over the world. Of course beating difficult bosses and gaining strength and abilities on the way.

Code:Vein definitely leans more on the use of special skills rather than skilfully fighting your way through encounters. As I mentioned before, finding vestiges gives you the ability to learn more skills and unlock more classes. These skills range from passive power-ups, buffs/de-buffs and special attacks. Using these active skills takes ichor, the game’s mana pool that can be replenished using items, or attacking/killing enemies. You’re not exactly limited to one class and its skills. If you use a skill for long enough (or spend some money instead) you can master a skill, allowing you to use it with whatever class you see fit. Of course this also depends on what weapon you’re using.

Speaking of weapons, the game has several weapon classes that all have their own unique moveset and skills they can be used with. There are two-handed swords, polearms, axes, one-handed swords and… uniquely, bayonets. Rifles that can be used in melee but have an ability to fire “bullets” by using up one ichor for each shot you fire. Other than that the game has a one piece armour known as blood veils. Blood veils are, essentially armour with nothing much in the way of special properties except for parrying which can be a different animation depending on the type.

Given that the game is a souls-like, it’s also got its fair share of difficult boss fights and long stretches of small-time enemies that may or may not end up mobbing you to death if you’re not careful. But don’t fret, because Code:Vein doesn’t just have NPCs for chatting, you can even take one with you as a fighting partner. This really is what sets Code:Vein apart from all the other souls-likes, a permanent companion that doesn’t rely on a summoning sign and disappears after their job are done. I mean, they can still die, but I’ve had that happen very rarely. And they can be pretty useful in a pinch. They can resurrect you, have some handy buffs/de-buffs and are capable of fighting anything that moves and not stand around like a lemon.

With that said, though, there are a couple of things I believe make Code:Vein a better action-adventure game rather than a souls-like. For one its Anime influences even dragged it into the realm of JRPGs with bosses gaining ridiculous amounts of HP and generally giving me a harder time having to repeat the same pattern for the nth time as opposed to challenging my combat skills. It never felt as though I was studying a boss or enemy to figure out its behaviour, and instead tank the hits until I could beat it into submission by sheer will. The hordes of enemies and their erratic attack patterns made deaths more of a nuisance, like it wasn’t exactly my impatience that did me in and more that I wasn’t given a chance to roll out of the way of a combo attack (sod those martial arts lost in particular).

The leveling system is also bare bones at best. You don’t really dump points into stats, instead use your points to level up which gives you a general increase across the board. So no toothpick ninjas or drunken boxers, just run-of-the-mill fighters that use special attacks to whittle down a boss’s health.

Overall I enjoyed Code:Vein, I just wouldn’t really recommend it to a veteran Souls player if they’re not prepared to face some of the more obtuse Anime elements and the lacklustre levelling system. Still, the character creation is absolutely amazing and the combat is functional enough where it doesn’t feel like a slog.",1649186976,1649186976,True,41,0,0.725349485874176025,0,True,False,False

- Let's start out saying I played this for the first time after Elden Ring because I think hindsight from that whole series is important when judging what this game does well and what it does poorly.
- For the most part, areas and enemies are well balanced. Similar to the main souls series, you can adjust how challenging the game is by choosing to use or not use various components that the game presents to you. 
- You have NPC companions in this game which follow you and help you with fights. The AI seemed to be fairly decent, with the companion being able to fight in a semi-helpful way, and the enemy AI being able to decently split focus between the pair of you. The constant narration from the companion did grate at times though: ""You looking at your inventory?"" ""Ooh what's in the treasure chest?""
- Abilities similar to weapon arts in DS3 and Elden Ring appear in this game also. They range from damaging attacks to buffs and debuffs. I found myself using the buffs for bosses more as the game progressed - a sign of good scaling difficulty. There was also a huge amount of room for customisation since you could level up your abilities and use them to create customised builds and suites of abilities. For me this didn't really manifest because, being a bit of a completionist, I found myself constantly trying to keep up with the new abilities. I think it was only the last area or two of the game I actually caught up and decided to finally put together a build beyond a buff or two.
- The Cathedral area in this game is notoriously horrible. I would say it's about halfway through the game and if you're not invested I think it could kill momentum for a lot of players. The layout is frustratingly labyrinthine, and the enemies are very difficult (I died in this area more than any other). This isn't helped by the fact that it looks very very samey. I took a break out of frustration in this area at least once, which is rare for me.
- Aside from this, I found a few areas where character progression didn't quite keep up with enemies. If they kill you that's fine by me, but sometimes I felt they just had too much health at a couple of points.
- The story was fine and for the first half of the game I was getting into it. It got a little convoluted and dramatic in delivery towards the end and I found myself paying less attention to it. I think skipping the memory shard sequences is a great pro-tip.
- The female character designs are also very provocative with lots of skin showing and cleavage - I think that could be awkward for some players, but the game doesn't cross any lines or contain any nudity.

- Overall, I have highlighted a lot of negatives, but this game is a solid souls-like contender.",1649178394,1649178394,True,273,7,0.900548696517944336,0,True,False,False

This is a great place to start playing souls-likes, I think. The combat is fast paced and you can change your class at any point, which means you can completely switch builds in 30 seconds and use any weapons or armor-- or spells and there's a bunch of those. Getting all the stuff unlocked is greatly rewarded and it really makes you want to pursue all the options. You also get a co-op partner, whose constant commentary you can now turn off (though the Japanese is kind of soothing to have around), and they will revive you if you die while they're still alive, if they don't get caught up looking at the sunset or whatever they do at those key moments. You can also revive the host in multiplayer in this same way, and even build so you can do that better, but now we have to talk about multiplayer...

So, as I said, you have to have 400 successful multiplayer sessions (where you kill the boss) to get the achievement for multiplayer. So I have a crap ton of experience with this. The first thing you will notice when trying to help people is that you've become a noob in the blink of an eye. You can no longer fight properly. This is because Bando Namcai produced this game. The ever-present, yet varying in extremity, lag actually affects combat. Blows from enemies land BEFORE the attacks are launched, if you are the one coming in to assist. This means that once you have the bosses attention, all you can do is estimate their pattern if they launch every attack in the pattern, and dodge whatever that is until they turn away from you. You cannot actually fight them; you just try not to die. The result of this disability is that you have to come in with an overpowered build that lets you beat the living shit out of the boss quick as a flash before they can do anything to you. You have to output the maximum possible damage while they're not paying attention, because that's the only option you have, and the hosts always die at random points to random attacks from the boss if left to fend for themselves. As I said you can revive them though, so that is nice to have. You just have to be primed to do it instantly because you only get a short window for it.

Now the way multiplayer is set up, and I especially do not recommend this game now since it's gotta be much more dead, is that you have to 'search for distress signals'. This means you hit the button, wait 30 seconds (or possibly 4 minutes who fuckin' knows sometimes) for it to come back with nothing, then hit the button again and wait another 30 seconds. You cannot do anything during this time period. (Sometimes you can move, but you can't attack and you definitely can't play.) So, if you want to play multiplayer with random people in this game, you have to sit there twiddling your thumbs until you 'detect a distress signal' and get sent in to the Bamcai Nando lag-fest. If you are not playing at prime time you generally get to enter the Nandai Bamco lag dome every 5 minutes (this is when the game was newish, by the way), and all you can do while you're babysitting this stupid system is fuck around on your phone. Playing with friends also has some issues because it will just fail to detect their signal repeatedly, even when you're using the same password in the same area, until eventually it works. Or you know, it doesn't and you just part ways I guess. 

Oh, but getting help through multiplayer isn't nearly as bad because you just start up the signal, which is the same as launching the flare in Monster Hunter, and go back to doing whatever you were doing while people pop in and out. You also get to keep your NPC partner in multiplayer, so the boss fight will actually be three versus one, so that's nice. It's not as nice for the guy helping you though because you never know if the NPC dude is actually going to revive the host player, so you can wait and pray that they do, or launch your revive instantly and hope that they don't, or what often happens where you and the NPC both spend your revive at the same time so you just get wounded (it costs health) for no reason, and then I swear to God this happens every time that happens, have the host die 5 seconds later while you can't revive them. I hotbarred a backup revive for that exact situation, later on in my 'career' with this game.

But yeah, like Elden Ring, this is another fantastic game that has Bbbbbb Namco's stank on it so the multiplayer is horrible.",1648710409,1648710951,False,5,0,0.522686541080474854,0,True,False,False

- building and learning the story of the NPCS
- Have some nice boss designs 
- You have the option to refight some boss fights if you want(with other builds i think you get the most profit of this feature)

Code Vein is my very first souls/souls-like game i have ever played and I must say i really enjoy the genre. I enjoy it so much so that I am actually looking to start the Dark Souls series and Nioh. With that being said those games have nothing to do with my review.

Code Vein is very fun albeit very annoying at times. The enemy variety is very dull with a lot of areas in my opinion having reskins of existing enemies. The difficulty curve is very wonky going from very easy to rage inducing at times. There were only a couple of bosses I had issues with where as the others i breezed through. Said bosses i struggled with were the Skull King/Virgin Born and Invading Executioner, both of which have weaknesses you can exploit if you're good enough.

The story is.......not the best but not the worst. They don't really explain it all too well and by the time you begin to understand everything you're like halfway through the game or essentially at the end of the game. I'm not gonna fault Bandai Namco for this as from what i have heard the Souls series isn't known for it's story either and I'm not one to critique the story of an game anyways unless it frustrates me. If you're looking for story I do not recommend playing Code Vein in my opinion. It could be that I'm not the wisest person at times piecing stories together but who knows.

The gameplay is where it gets good. Since it's a souls game you'll want to look all over for enemies hiding just waiting to get a surprise smack on you. You're not limited to a blood code (Class) and you can even mix and match gifts (abilities) and passive's to make the build you want. Some blood codes are not available unless you go down a certain route and some of the blood codes you have you're able to make really fun builds with!

The price i do not agree with. For a almost 3 year old game Code Vein still costs $80 Canadian Dollars and on top of that there's DLC which i do not own but have heard are essentially reskins of current existing weapons. I'd recommend getting this game on sale like i did as at $80 i cannot recommend it. Otherwise i recommend this and God Eater if you're curious what the world is like outside of the Code Vein area.

I have encountered bugs in an area that can be frustrating if you have a 144hz monitor. In the crypt spire be sure to turn your refresh rate down to 60hz or the elevators will get stuck when you try to use them. I also heard that there's apparently issues with backstab timings among other things if you're not on 60hz, Could be physics related idk. Not sure why Bandai Namco haven't fixed it but it is safe to say they'll never be fixed

Code vein is a hot pile of feces with the worst gameplay of any souls game or souls clone, period. It is not just a bad souls style game, it is a disgustingly terrible game outright. The only redeeming factor of this game is the character creator, which even then, isn't all that appealing.

Combat: Frustrating, bland, and slow. Every weapon type is the same except for the bayonet, which most people agree is the worst weapon type any ways. They're all slow and irritating. Stacking buffs for your regular attack or one-shotting enemies is your best bet most of the time, and all the faster, longer range builds are slow to kill enemies and just drag out their tedium. Endgame, you can stack enough buffs to make your regular attack do 4-5k per hit, but that doesn't solve the fundamental errors with this game's combat. After getting through the bulk of the game, I wanted to see if it'd be any less frustrating to move around in the world with cheat engine and absolute god-mode enabled. Even with knowledge of enemy patterns and some experience parrying/etc, the stunlocking and sudden walls of 10-20-30 enemies at a time just isn't fun. Whether you're playing the game vanilla or you can't die and you one-shot everything, spending enough time with the enemies and levels of Code Vein just pisses me off so badly. Not in a ""this is challenging"" way, but in a ""this is boring, tedious, and disrespects my time"" kind of way. It's not challenging: it's just BS. Also, blood challenges just happen. You just get ""invaded"" by stumbling in the wrong area unknowingly on your first playthrough, but instead of a souls like invasion, it's just a flood of enemies in cholostrophobic areas. Early on this isn't obtuse, but the moment this starts happening in the Cathedral, things go from ""unique challenge likely to kill you a few times"" to ""go screw yourself."" The difficulty spike is unreal, and EVEN WITH god-mode, it's just a pain in the ass to hit so many of these enemies. Backstabbing is extremely finnicky and the whole cutscene that plays out while you're invincible just slows the game down so much. There's an encyclopedia of stats that just don't matter and it didn't feel interesting to learn about them or experiment with them because they were all trivialized by other more simple dominant strategies (dps to win, parry a lot, and dodge a lot). Partners are their own problem too - they either take aggro and trivialize the whole combat flow souls games were designed around, or they're failing to do their job of healing you until you're already dead from the previous problems. -

Level Design: Whoever designed the levels in this game needs to never design a level again. Steam disallows the usage of inflamatory language,  and so I'd like to emphasize that I, in every way possible, with complete seriousness, have never been so dumbfounded by just how unfun, repetitive, and horrifically designed the levels are. The first two are honestly fine if not a little linear, but the moment you hit the cathedral of the sacred blood, this game completely starts disrespecting your time. I don't know who thought it'd be a good idea to make a backwards ass upside down vertical maze where every environmental area is just a copy paste, or who thought it'd be a good idea to take you out of your train of thought in this level by tricking you with a vestige that just rips you out of the level and into a completely different big-ass level, but they need to be fired. And this vestige is a HUGE problem. Normally, you collect a vestige and that's it. You're done. The vestige after the wolf beserker miniboss though apparently belongs to the player's character. Asside from this being a very left-field place to put what should be an important item, this shoots the pacing in the face. No one in their right mind is going to be happy being caught off in the middle of navigating what is objectively the most confusing level in any souls-like game, period, only to be teleported to another level entirely that takes way too long to get through; also auto save, so you can't opt out. The dialogue box saying ""you're being teleported to another area"" isn't a justification for this either because EVERY vestige ""teleports"" you to another area. That's their thing - but up until this point in the game, you come across countless vestiges and they ALL are just walk-along cutscenes that you can skip. Like, I know there's some stupid ""haha got you"" moments in souls games, but in Code Vein, these kinds of moments come across so much and they feel like oversights that cost you hours of time instead of well designed challenges you can overcome next time. This stuff annihilates the pacing of the game and doesn't feel like it was left there by developers messing with the player, but rather developers who have no idea what they're doing and don't care to figure it out, resulting in the worst pacing in the genre. Speaking of which:

Pacing: I genuinely tried to get invested in the story, but oh my god, it is awful. Every character is paper thin, interactions are some of the most awkward, trashy, generic, cringey amine-trope interactions ever, and they just drag ON and ON and OOOONNN to the point where halfway through the game, I just stopped caring and skipped everything because it's genuinely irritating to sit through these cutscenes. The only moments that didn't make me actively uncomfortable were the moments just playing the game with partner dialogue off - or just removing the partner altogether. - Yakumo going off on a mono tangent about frienship for minutes at a time 2 interactions after meeting Mia isn't interesting, it's cringe. Seeing Io awkwardly rotate her head with her mouth agape for entire long shots at a time doesn't make me interested in her or why she acts that way, it makes me want to press the skip button. At their core, these tropey interactions are most plagued by not being earned; they're the kinds of interactions that only work if they're built up to believably for a long time so that you can get behind a genuine scenario where a character might act like that - but this kind of stuff just happens the moment you meet these characters and it is so unbelievably uncomfortable. - Anime tropes in games can work if done well (Tales of Symphonia! Atelier!), but the characters' interactions are clearly an afterthought. The fact that they take SO LONG to get through in the cutscenes is just a combination that is worse than the sum of it's parts; just like the level design and random teleporting vestige/stunlocking. Terrible things that are more terrible together, almost as if they were tailor made to make you as angry as possible. More on pacing: going through a vestige cutscene just to upgrade you blood codes isn't interesting, it's boring. I don't know who any of these characters are and I'm not about to walk through minutes of cutscenes per vestige to hear about NPC23's story before becoming a not-vampire. So, I started skipping them halfway through too, but even then, you'll get a bunch of vestiges in one level and just have to activate and skip over and over and over and every time you want to do it, Io has to sit back up slowly, then you can talk to her, then you can select the thing, then you can scroll to the vestige, then you can watch the thing, then you have to skip the thing over and OVER and it's inexcusable. It's menuing at it's absolute worst.

Don't waste your money or time. if you want to see the story, watch it on youtube. If you want to play a souls game, play LITERALLY ANY OTHER SOULS GAME but this one. If you want to try the character creator, buy the game, try it, mod it for more customizables, and then return the game to steam in under 2 hours because this game is not worth your money.

Control Scheme:
You CANNOT rebind the ""interact"" key. As someone who uses ESDF for movement, this was the cause of countless deaths (muscle memory). How you put a game on the PC and restrict keybinding is beyond me. Not even the nexus mod community had a solution to this. A straight-up heresy, and more than enough reason to not recommend this game on it's own. But let's continue.

Story:
It's not bad. I liked it, although sometimes the dialogue or memory vestiges kinda fell flat.

New Game+:
Straight-up a waste of time. No new items/gear/outfits, just enemies with +hp +damage until a failed dodge ends in an instagib. Doing a new game+ locks you out of everything and has to be re-earned, so don't do it unless you've bought all the crap you need for your upgrading/transforming, 'cause it's a long way back.

Gameplay:
Hitboxes are jank. Whether it's a foe's right hook that slaps you from the back, or your attack straight-up not registering, a common death will be because something didn't connect the way it should have.
That aside, the actual combat is solid, and I do appreciate each armor type giving you a different timing for counter/parry attacks. That definitely assists a person like me, whose reaction ain't what it used to be, but does well enough on reading telegraphs.

Level Designs:
Passable, except Blood Cathedral. Flog whoever designed that place.
You thought water temples were bad, wait 'till you have to get lost in this dump for multiple runs.

NPC Companions:
It's hit'n'miss. Sometimes the companion is helpful, and other days they'll just roll like an idiot while something is ripping you a new hole.

Overall: Skip this game, even if it's on sale. It's good for one, maybe two playthroughs before issues start bogging your fun.",1647863504,1647863504,False,2,0,0.491438359022140503,0,True,False,False

Was the story good? Well, it's been about 2.5 years since I finished this game, and I couldn't tell you a single detail about the game. I don't remember a damn thing. Except there was a boss that looked like Hatsune Miku in a spooky ass 2007 music video where she turned into a spider cyborg. That's it.

How about the graphics? It looks... pretty bad. Even at the time, it was pretty clear the anime-esque art style was a decision made to try to hide the lack of care and attention given to environments and the models are not particularly good. The character creator is great fun, but beyond that this game doesn't look great.

Well, how was the gameplay? Generic. This game is essentially a souls-like game with pretty much no unique take on the genre. The combat feels sluggish and isn't particularly fun, the enemies that populate the world are rather boring, the maps are extensive, linear, and confusingly laid out, and the boss fights ranged from boring and uninspired to absurdly frustrating to blatant ripoffs of marginally better games (see: Dark Souls).

Well, was it at least bug-free? HAHAHAHA, no. Bosses routinely attack through walls and disappear, you'll find yourself fighting enemies whose attacks seem to phase through obstacles, and woe be upon you if anything ranged happens to fight you.

The weapons are absurdly oversized (I understand that the creators of the game compensated for their pp when creating this game, but ... it's still absurd.).

Even when it comes to female character design we have huge booba + flat booties and thin hips. Really? The beauty of the female body is the beauty of harmony and proportions. If there is much above, let there be much below.

The personalities of the characters are unoriginal, the plot is predictable.

但客观从游戏本身以及战斗系统的角度上讲，体验极差。地图繁琐平庸，点名批评海沟和落火街，白血教堂我奇迹般的居然没咋卡图，更令我自己惊讶的是我居然每张地图都100%收集了，可能是以前被老版本古墓丽影毒打得太狠了，所以适应能力比较强，但人家老版本古墓丽影当年地图设计可是很精妙的，不像这游戏就纯属为了恶心人。 

另外，恶意堆怪物现象很严重，同行NPC虽然很有用，但有时候会导致难以勾引敌人逐个击破，以至于经常不得不进入打群架状态。还有就是恶鬼来袭这个设定很阴间，对于有经验、有准备的玩家来说是刷经验的好时机，但第一次打的话很有可能被坑，尤其是当你踏入某些区域是会自动触发的，而且敌人会锁住仇恨甚至瞬移到玩家的位置。另外怪物种类也很少，很多都是换皮怪，而且有不少怪打不出硬直或者很难打出硬直，于是便可以顶着玩家的攻击霸体出招，这点对于用轻武器玩家尤其不友好。 

背刺判定以及战斗手感也不行，键鼠还会有突然失灵的现象，想象一下落火街在打boss前突然键鼠失灵无法按E开篝火是多么可怕的一件事情，这意味着我得重启游戏然后从第二个篝火再打一遍流程以及搜集一遍重要物品。还有就是由于键鼠失灵，我主线最后双boss战还得重启游戏以后再打一遍，真的是醉了。 

联机体验也欠佳，链接不稳定而且进剧情动画会有踢出救援的现象。省着这钱买同个公司的传说系列也比这个划算，虽然我不会说传说系列有多么多么出彩，但最起码人家品控还算过硬。",1645359653,1647412722,False,3,1,0.462445944547653198,0,True,False,False

You can easily overlevel enemies (and then the game gets much easier, with your high stats)
Death is not really punishing (maybe you want it to be)

Backstories of characters take forever to watch through (can be skipped)

Gameplay is fun, especially magic (""dark/light gifts"") feels more versatile, powerful and useful than in dark souls games. Puts a great emphasis on story, which is told mostly via (skippable) cutscenes. The option of having companions fighting alongside you and reviving you also makes it rather forgiving and beginner-friendly. Even my gf who hates difficult games enjoyed playing it, though mainly thanks to the character editor, where you can create the hot anime guy or gal of your dreams. Environments and enemies are not quite as interesting as in dark souls games, but they're okay, and the sound of the snow beneath your feet in that one area is to die for.

What else... well, most other parts and mechanics of the game are very heavily inspired by dark souls (and bloodborne), to say the least. If you have played dark souls, you will feel right at home, and if you haven't, this (the base game) may be a great introduction to the genre of souls-likes. I haven't bought the DLCs myself, but if you have read any other review on this game, you will probably already know that you should not buy them.

In conclusion, honestly, I enjoyed this game a lot. So much that I spent like almost an hour thinking and writing this review to tell you about it. If I had to put it in numbers, I would give it an 8 or 9 out of 10.

Now that I have absolutely milked everything this game has to offer, it's time to make a proper review. This is the first game I bought on Steam, so it holds a special place in my heart. However, for a review, my feelings matter less and I have to look at the game in an unbiased view. I haven't played Dark Souls (yet), so I won't be comparing Code Vein to Dark Souls. Instead, I view this title on it's own. New players to Dark Souls in general or to Code Vein, this review is for you.

[h2]Easily Overlooked Title[/h2] 
Code Vein seems to fall victim to the assumption that it nothing more than a Dark Souls clone with anime waifu characters. Although the game takes inspiration from Dark Souls, there is enough that it does differently, and in some areas, much better to really stand out as its own game giving players an experience worth checking out.

[h2]Character Creation System[/h2]
This is one of the best character creators I have ever seen, it's like Skyrim with all those anime mods you are too shameful to admit using. It has a ton of accessories and whatever ones you pick, you can place them anywhere on your character, with options to reposition and resize it. See the glasses on my avatar? I can place them on my hair just like how I would in real life. You can now engineer your own catgirl/catboy or waifu/husbando.

[h2]World Building Lacking in Depth[/h2] 
The world design is linear, and I don't feel like everything is interconnected. You move from one area to another to progress, only needing to return to a previous area to do side quests or unlock the door to move to to a different area. Some zones don't even make sense as to how they are connected in the world: Home base is totally separated from everything despite being in the same city of Vein. Most areas have the same theme - everything is rusty, old, and falling apart. Only after the fifth area (my favorite area in the game), will everything look better.  It's a bummer that the game takes place in a big city but you can barely explore it or even just one building.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2633295093
Your actions don't have as much impact as I'd like them. There's a quest involving you taking a map to an NPC to help them make a shelter. After completion they just reward you and stand there for the rest of the game instead of going to that taking, or even letting you go there. Overall, world building is superficial, instead of a being deeper.

[h2]Companions Are Your Life Saver[/h2] 
One of the best companion AIs I've ever played with. They react and perform even better than some players I met. They aren't a liability and can actually carry you. Going with one will make the game a lot easier, so I suggest going solo if you want a real challenge.

[h2]Combat is Fun and Fast-paced[/h2] 
Code Vein takes inspiration from Dark Souls in these aspects: Stamina-based action, lock-on target camera, and parry and back-stab leave you invincible.
What differentiates Code Vein from Dark Souls is its own class and skills system called Blood Code and Gifts, these are what defines your character build. Blood Code is basically a class, with its own attribute distribution and Gifts. The latter are skills, they can be passive, weapon-based or active, with the latter ones requiring Ichor (the equivalent of mana) each time they're performed.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2633289853
This is what defines Code Vein's rapid and flashy combat style. You can change your Blood Code and Gifts instantly, making combat flexible and adaptable. One moment you could be a DPS Halberd glass cannon, the next moment a tank build, blocking 100% of the damage from almost anything comes to you.

[h2]Weapons Look Cool But Not That Interesting[/h2] 
There are five weapon categories in the game, each categories has more than ten varieties. However, there is not much difference between them.
For example, the companions' weapons are just a re-color of the regular weapons, there's no unique model that makes them stand out from the rest, some weapons' movesets are just mix and match of the normal ones. There's only one companion's weapon that has a Gift activation when using charged attacks. 
Some of the weapons dropped from bosses look unique but still have the same moveset as normal ones. There is only one truly unique weapon, in a sense that its own model, exclusive moveset, in just one category, which i think is disappointing, considering there is a total of 74 weapons in the game.

[h2]Blood Veil is Your Armor and Fashion Style[/h2] 
Blood Veil isn't separated pieces like in other RPG games, instead there's only one piece of armor equipped on your character. There are four categories, each has its own charged drain attacks that gain Ichor, parry and back-stab animation. Armors have dyed variants so pick one that suits your clothing, otherwise you can recolor your clothing to suit the Blood Veil.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2633292619

[h2]Enemies and Bosses: Not Enough There[/h2]
The lack of enemy diversification is one of Code Vein's downsides. The ones you see in the second area are also in the last before the final boss. Most enemies react slowly, so you can walk behind them and chain back-stab with ease, which is something you can do even with the mini bosses. The only enemy in the game that really intrigues me is the Recently Converted Lost, both in design and attack pattern. They genuinely look and sound like revenants who are turning into the Lost and fight like so. They are the same size as you but hit hard and wildly, can detect you while cloaking, do range attack, perform a charged attack much faster and parry you. It's a shame there aren't more enemies like this. 
Except for the story-related bosses, neither the bosses in the game don't have any backstory about their origin. They have an introduction cutscene, but after defeating them, you continue the story like if they were just another regular enemy, nothing more special, just beefier or prettier. Their designs are either tough big looking monster-guys or tall big sexy monster-ladies. There are only two bosses that I really like because their models aren't either of those, one of them is in the fifth area, the other one is the final boss.

[h2]Multiplayer Somewhat Active[/h2]
There's only Co-op, no PvP, which is a downside. Surprisingly, there are still few people who play in Co-op mode. During my latest playthrough, I received helps from five different players in just one area, which is unexpected from this game. Not only that, I met some new friends thanks to the Co-op, and had a blast with them. Really recommend playing with friends or finding some strangers to befriend. 

[h2]Underrated Soundtracks[/h2]
Dramatic and emotional, especially in important cutscenes; however, still lack diversity. The bosses' theme is the same, even though it is good, hearing the same track again and again can be boring. Main Menu and Code Vein's theme (Memory of the Lost) are 10/10.

[h2]DLCs[/h2]
Overall really bad for their prices. DLCs are just three extra dungeons with a single side story that isn't relevant, you can skip it and it won't make any impact. New Blood Codes are very powerful in late game. Weapons and Blood Veils added are just recolors, no unique models, some are good, many are indolent. Main bosses' designs are distinctive and outstanding. Only buy DLCs including in Deluxe Edition ON SALE, which is much cheaper and justified considering what they add to the game.
 
[h1][b]Final rating: 7/10[/b][/h1]
Code Vein is a solid game but it could have been much better. Get the Deluxe Edition when it's on sale, you will not regret it.

Instead of some Soulsborne games which doesn't have any time of multiplayer features, in Code Vein unlike those games there is cooperation and it works even better than Dark Souls games. It instantly connects and you start slaughtering shit.

I spend 4 hours on character creation and I could say it's one of the best. There is lack of face modeling, but the art style of game it's nothing wrong to do. Oh, I could say the outfits are lacking a bit, however I really like hair making, makeups and stuff like that.

Then I decided to play without a Partner, and suddenly I started to feel like a souls-like, it became challenging, bosses were suddenly hard to beat, and therefore it felt satisfying to beat them.
Before, with a partner, it was pretty easy, I barely ever died, even beat many bosses on first try.
And since the game/fighting mechanics itself aren't anything special, RPG elements and loot are practically non-existent, it was a bit boring.
So if you want a souls-like experience, play without a partner. But even so I stilly prefer Dark Souls, The Surge or Nioh, there a quite a few things that I didn't like:
- like I said, RPG Elements are pretty much non-existent. This game has the most useless level-up mechanic I have ever seen. There isn't a single thing you can choose when you level-up, attributes depend on your blood code and can't be changed, talents can be bought with haze (=souls) and can't be improved. The only thing a level-up gives you is a minor bonus to health and attack, and I mean minor, like 2126 life instead of 2120, and 715 attack instead of 710.
- there is very little loot, there are only 5 kinds of weapons, and you only find 4-5 of each kind, and they aren't very different, so there is very little to choose from, I would guess that most people that use two-handed swords for example use the same one, because there aren't really a lot of options.  And there is only one single piece of armour you can equip, I changed it only like 3 times in the whole game because it didn't seem to make that much of a difference. Instead there are plentiful of useless/unnecessary consumables.
- since level-ups are pretty much useless, and there isn't a lot of things to buy, collecting haze isn't really necessary. I bought pretty much all talents I could buy, at least half of which I never used, leveled up a lot of weapons I never used, leveled myself over level 100, and still had haze to spare that I didn't know what to do with. So the feeling of relief you get in other souls-likes, when you manage to get to the next bonfire an can finally use your prescious souls, doesn't really happen here. Sometimes I felt like they should have done without the souls-mechanic and just made a DevilMayCry-kind-of-game.
- some areas were really confusing, because there are a lot of different pathes and they all look the same. Quite a few times I had to run around all over for quite a while just to look for the one path I hat forgotten that I needed to proceed. Also, a few times I didn't know where to go at all, objectives just said ""go to the destroyed city centre"" or ""go to the cathedral"", but there were like 6 different waypoints, and apparently I was supposed to remember at which one there was a door that I wasn't able to open 3 hours before
- some areas where pretty ugly, everything just brown and grey
- the movement speed in the memories is soooo slow

There were also some things that I liked:
- the basic fighting mechanism works fine, pretty much like dark souls - except that stamina-management is less important and all classes can use talents, there are also melee-talents (=special attacks)
- some cool bosses
- some areas looked nice
- it has a story (I'm not a big fan of reading the cryptic item descriptions in dark souls)
- music in the memories was nice
- no bugs

So all in all, there are quite a few things that could be improved, but I still had my fun. If I had to rate it I would give it something like 7,5 ord 8/10",1646239422,1646239422,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h2][i]-[u]Overview[/u]-[/i][/h2]
Playing [i]Code Vein[/i] will likely feel familiar to those who have played Dark Souls 3; some of the animations and gameplay elements even look like they were plucked right out of that game.

It keeps the checkpoint, currency, healing and co-op systems, as well as the gear upgrade system and the basic combat mechanics like parrying, rolling, weight and repeatedly getting your face smashed-in by [i]really angry undead.[/i] 

[quote][b]🎮[i]Code Vein[/i] can be played with keyboard/mouse, though I recommend using a controller.🎮[/b][/quote]
[h2][i]-[u]Gameplay[/u]-[/i][/h2]
[h3]Combat:[/h3]
Combat keeps the basic dark souls recipe, but tuned a little more toward hack-and-slash and with prominent ability use. The ichor (mana) system works well; you get ichor from damaging enemies and doing special attacks on them like backstabs or parry attacks and the abilities (of which there are many to choose from) are fun to use.

A large variety of offensive & defensive abilities become available throughout the game, which you can mix & match freely to suit your playstyle.
Weapons come in five classes each with fairly distinct differences and associated abilities, but variety within each class is pretty small. There's a big difference between a one handed-sword and a two-handed sword, but each one-handed sword will be pretty similar.

[h3]Enemies & Bosses:[/h3]
Enemy variety is decent with some enemies re-used, but still enough new ones throughout the game to mix things up as you progress. Personally, I enjoy fighting almost all of the mobs in this game, though a small few can get a little frustrating on new game+, usually because of some cheap-feeling mechanic, though such occurrences are rare enough not to be a real issue.

Bosses are a major part of [i]Code Vein[/i], and in my opinion are not quite up to traditional Dark Souls quality. They keep the same basic boss recipes but the balancing often feels a little off, especially on new game+ where damn-near any significant hit from a boss will one-hit-kill you.
Often a boss's moves can feel cheap and just far too spammy. 

For example, sometimes you will dodge a boss's attack and attempt to perform an action; using an ability or healing for instance. In the time it takes you to perform the (often uninterruptible) animation, the boss can finish its attack, turn around, telegraph its next attack, launch it and crush your skull. This can be due to poor timing on the player's part, but many of the bosses just love their super-fast, short-telegraph attacks and use them constantly. This speed can also lead to the player spending more time chasing them around the arena than actually fighting them, which gets tiring.

Boss fights are still enjoyable despite the above, but I feel there was some missed potential. 

[h3]Level Design:[/h3]
Level design in [i]Code Vein[/i] has nice variety with most areas being distinct from their neighbours. One particular level feels like it was created by a criminally insane 3D-printer, but for the most part the areas are sensibly laid out and relatively easy to navigate while still requiring exploration.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2020324934
[h2][i]-[u]Interaction[/u]-[/i][/h2]
[h3]Customisation:[/h3]
The character creator is strong, though it could use some more variety in basic things like face shape and clothing. It makes up for it though with excellent customisation of accessories and markings (tattoos etc). You can stick glowing neon top hats on your knees if you want to. 

[h3]Story:[/h3]
[i]Code Vein[/i] replaces traditional cutscenes or text walls for non-essential lore with small, linear levels called vestiges for the player to walk through as the story plays out via audio cues and static displays. It's far more atmospheric than simple text, though can feel a little long-winded as you cannot skip individual lines of dialogue. 

Main story and characters are sometimes a little plain but generally likeable and perhaps a bit deeper than one might expect. It's no Mass Effect, but not bad by any means. It's an anime game with anime characters, more lighthearted than Dark Souls, but still has its dark moments. 

[i]Code Vein[/i] also indirectly ties into the God Eater series, so may be of extra interest to fans looking for more lore from that world.

[h2][i]-[u]Technical[/u]-[/i][/h2]
[h3]A.I:[/h3]
Friendly AI is surprisingly good in [i]Code Vein[/i]. You can bring one AI companion with you at a time and they are competent. They can kill enemies by themselves, revive you from death, and take a boss's full attention while you take a breather.

Enemy mob AI isn't revolutionary but neither is it noticeably dumb. It's adequate for its purpose and makes for a fun combat experience.

[h3]Multiplayer:[/h3]
Co-op consists of basically the same system as Dark Souls; the host summons another player into their world, who can kill enemies, collect loot and fight the boss. The limitations are the same as well; you cannot summon players into a zone you've already completed or they cannot access, summoned players will not progress their story and they will be automatically booted after the area boss is defeated.
In my experience the co-op system has been fairly reliable. I've experienced occasional hiccups in the networking performance but for the most part it's been fine.

[h3]Audio/Visuals:[/h3]
[quote]This game was played with the following PC specs:
[list]
[*]Intel i5-4440 3.10 GHz
[*]16Gb DDR3 RAM
[*]Geforce GTX 750 ti SC 2Gb
[*]HDD [/list][/quote]

Visually the game looks very nice and I was impressed with its optimisation. When I played through the game I was using a graphics card on par with or slightly below the listed minimum requirement, but I was still able to get a stable 60fps with the game looking pretty nice. 

The soundtrack is decent, though nothing really stood out to me save for one particular area that has a very nice track which I won't spoil in this review as the package of visuals, story and plot at that particular moment are what make it special.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2020322566
[h3]Mod Support:[/h3]
[i]Code Vein[/i] has a variety of mostly visual modifications available on the [i]Code Vein Nexus[/i] website. Typically things like making an NPC's hair/outfit available for the player, or swapping out the model of a weapon or piece of clothing.

[h3]Issues:[/h3]
I feel there were a couple of minor design oversights that could be streamlined, mainly involving the UI. Unnecessary loading in and out when skipping vestiges, for example. Minor annoyances like this do not detract significantly from the overall game experience, but can be a little frustrating at times. 

[h2][i]-[u]Conclusion[/u]-[/i][/h2]
Overall I think this is an excellent game, fun solo and with a friend. Bosses feel like they're balanced a bit weirdly, especially on new game+, but for the most part are still enjoyable. The aesthetic variety in the levels is nice, and the gameplay feels very rewarding once you're familiar.

[b]I would recommend to anyone who enjoys Dark Souls and/or a rewarding but challenging game experience.[/b]

However, my friends told me there was a somewhat anime style game that is similar but easier to play than Dark Souls and I should really give it a try. Well I did and I did not hate it...    :-)

So the game starts off with you waking up having no idea what is going on or where you are. Go figure, another game with amnesia as the plot. Fortunately, amnesia is a common issue with everyone and is a side effect of death in this world. Early on you find out you are special and can purify and regrow these dead trees that give off blood beads that are used as food and prevent people from turning into monsters. You meet up with a group who is investigating where the trees are coming from in an effort to get them flowing again. And thus your story begins.

Graphics wise, the game does not sport anything special and is your typical anime style artwork. The main characters are done well and very distinctive. The rest of the characters (Well lack of other people in the game) and monsters are extremely generic and used over and over.

The vocals are decent but lack any real emotion for the situations presented. They are not annoying and are good at setting certain scenes. The music is nice but get super repetitive quickly with very little change in style. Additionally, many of the scores are reused in multiple locations making the songs even more annoying after hearing them for hours on end.
Controls in the game are good. Not much fighting with the controller except for the shear slowness of EVERY attack (Think this a one of those Dark Souls traits).

I must admit, the game was kinda fun and I definitely love that it bridges another game that I play with this one. The combat was not as super difficult as DS and I was in a grove. All was good and was even thinking of trying to go back into the dreaded Dark Souls after I finished the game. Well, that is until I finished the game. This game has multiple endings and I got the center ending. Apparently I did not understand how important doing a certain optional piece was to the game and ended up with a super short ending. I went online to see the other endings and found out that the bad and good ending were super long and pretty awesome, while what I got looked more like a cut scene leading into another chapter. That royally ticked me off to no end. I spent 50+ hours running around and missed doing 1 thing giving me a tiny and lackluster ending. I was not about to go and play again to try and get one of the other endings.

So all in all, the total game I would give at 4 out of 10,definitely below average. Something I was extremely happy I purchased on sale. If you are a DS fan and are happy with this type of play style and are a completionist who will do everything to get all the endings. You might enjoy this much more than I did.

1) enemies can just attack right through your attacks no matter how strong they are or how big your weapon is and I mean every enemy and boss can do this which makes it feel very cheap and unfair. also backstabbing is broken, to pull it off you have to be behind just slightly to the right of the enemy which more than 50% of them won't even work so ya there is also that.

2) some bosses and mini bosses are just over the top ridiculous with overpower attacks and just really never stop attacking so you try to dodge till you get an opening only to run out of stamina so you cant attack or dodge leaving you open to a bullshit combo

3) don't bother healing or relaying on your npc partner both are dumb and when it comes to healing you barely have openings to do so in combat 

I swear they made this game for you to hate it and soul like games, again i wanted to like this game but I'm finding it hard nearing the end of it to even finish it anymore.

Graphics: 7/10
Graphics are good enough for high end pc users to enjoy and just low enough so that low-end/ mid-end pc users to have a smooth experience.

Gameplay: 9/10
The gameplay feels smooth and satisfying, attacking has a lot of weight and feedback, so attacking also is really satisfying, although i do think the dodge-rolls feel too light, but that's really just a small problem.

Story: 6/10
The story feels bleak, bland, forgettable. The individual character stories, however, are really interesting; it's a shame they made the main story feel bland. The character stories are really good, although most of them aren't animated, so if you don't like those types of storytelling, it's not for you.

Other Feedback:
-Unnecessary Fanservice:
Too much fanservice, if you like that kind of stuff, this game's for you. For me, just takes away from the dark fantasy-esque feel from the game.

-Enemy Types:
I'm fine with the amount of enemy types in code vein, there are a lot. But they reuse the same assets so much you feel like you're only fighting a handful of the enemies; this isn't too much of the problem though, since the gameplay / combat just feels so good.

-Boss Fights:
The boss fights are well made; each boss is different and difficult enough for souls-like players to enjoy it, but first time souls-like players can enjoy the difficulty. The bosses have a variety of movesets, and they have predictable but difficult attack patterns. Some bosses, i'd say are really annoying to fight, but if you can get through them, you'll have a good time.

I would say that code vein is a decent one, gameplay is very enjoyable and versatile, you can switch playstyle or even classes whenever you like, that was such a nice feature that I never got bored fighting enemies, yes there are builds more broken than others and some classes are rather weak i would say, but it is okay very balanced for a singleplayer game imo.
The boring thing about code vein is that it is so cutscene heavy, and some of them are spread so long without sense, the reason is that during the cutscenes everything looks slowmotion. I can say the story is ok a very simple plot.
Another bad thing of this game is some bosses design, some of them enter in their last phase when they are so low hp that does not make sense, literally becoming super sayan and getting killed after 3 seconds, they really should balance that up because it felt hella awkward.

Pros:
- Bug free. Most Japanese games are bug free on launch.
- It has its fun moments. It does have cool visuals and animation. Like an anime, it wowed me in the first few hours of the game.
- Good sound and amazing voice over
- Visuals are awesome. Very neat and artistic.

These can be considered neutral since some will like it some will not:
- You can change class any time. It will change your STR, DEX, VIT, MND, etc. And those stats are only determined by the class. ""So it's good right? Just change it according to your playstyle"" wellll no. There are better class and there are worse class. Classes that you find later in the game are generally better than the first. There's no improving stats, only changing class. All these render leveling useless.

And of course... a lot of shortcomings:
- Story is very anime that fucks logic. Other gamers that loves anime will say this is their strong point, but no, not me, and I like anime too.
- Gameplay is so so. It's fun in the beginning. But once you get the grip, the fun factor quickly diminish.
- Idk if the developer wants this to be soulslike or not, but it's definitely NOT soulslike outside of bonefire and blood dropped on death.
- Level design is horrible. Souls games have this well-thought level that interconnect and rewards the player. Code Vein level is like a labyrinth, yet very linear. So it's very confusing although it has a map. It has a lot level to open the door, but where is the door? Exactly in front of the lever. I was like wtf Bandai?
- Combat is not satisfying. It's just hitting and evading hitbox + counter and backstab. It doesn't have good moveset, strong and weak attacks only connect with their own so there's no combo.
- RPG element is weak. I mentioned that leveling is useless. Not only that, you don't put point in the stats and there's almost no armor/weapon choice. You just choose from a few that they have.
- There's no ""openness"" in solving problem. In Souls you can snipe dragon having 50k HP with arrow damaging 10 HP 5000 times. You can go around an area getting item that you like without fighting. You can choose how you want to solve certain problem. The customization of how you attempt to do something is endless not too mention fun. Code Vein? Just go here, fight everything, bonefire, continue, until boss fight. Repeat.
- Which bring us to the last point. Since it's very linear and doesn't offer choices in anything, there's no worthy replay value. The only replay value that it has, is getting other endings, which can be done via Youtube.

Also I just want to point out that after 2.5 years, they still haven't fixed this one bug: When you play with controller, mouse pointer will pop up every time there's a menu opening. Can't hide it, can't push away to the side. It's just very annoying. It's not just my problem. Just search it on the Internet, Steam discussion, and Reddit.

It's not a good game, but it is not bad either. It's Bloodborne x God Eater. Story is alright; character's backstories are sad/touching; graphics are alright; sound/ost are meh, I found myself opening a playlist while crawling the dungeons, the credits bgm are nice tho so eh; it's a Bandai Namco Game so expect a small roster of mob enemies with recolors, bosses are all unique tho.. but majority have female torsos.

I played it entirely with mouse/keyboard but I heavily suggest to have a controller if you plan to play this game.

It brings over the good and adds great twists while also importing the bad and making their own mistakes. It's a hard title to rate. I'd call it a 7/10 overall, as objectively and unbiased as I possibly can but in truth I was a little angry when I finished the terrible last boss and lost interest in any immediate replays even though I enjoyed the ride overall. The highs are very high and the lows are in the center of the planet. Although I recommend this title I strongly urge you to get it on sale. 

In Melon Farmer you can be an edgy chuuni boy or gal courtesy of an in depth character maker. You enter a post-apocalyptic world where everybody is an edgy anime vampire by necessity, fighting to survive in a world of edgier zombie vampires in the wake of disaster. Vampire Erotica has a strong unique setting and surprisingly enjoyable story. Despite the imminent talent of the female half of the cast the entire game is completely serious. The main story was engaging, I applaud knowing how to start, hold and resolve mysteries. By the second half of the game I was even enjoying the glorious large ham of a main villain. There are multiple endings and each hits pretty hard with narrative payoffs.

Orbs Adventures follows Soulsbourne combat closely. What innovates here is that you can swap your code, or class, at will. You equip a code, level the skills to untether them from the code and mix and match. Codes affect your base stats and what weapons/armors you'll lean towards and there's about 20+ codes. There's emphasis on armor choice as it doubles as a weapon, adding Drain to the Light, Heavy and Skills mix. You can charge up a bloody stylistic attack, activate it through back stabs or focus attacks and there are four varieties. This ties into the magic system where hitting enemies restores mana, draining restores more and expands how much you can hold and lets you weave magic into any build. With five weapon types and many unique move sets you can layer buffs, nukes or zwee dashes into a build(4 passives, 8 actives) for loads of customization.

For the most part the enemies get the job done. A lot of the boss fights are entertaining and tightly knit duels, exploration has the trademark atmosphere of danger where every individual enemy can destroy an unwitting adventurer, there's a reasonable variety of monsters to combat, at least at first. As you progress through Path of Bosoms you'll realize that there are ten enemy types at most, if we're being generous. They repeat quickly and by mid game everything is the same. Although they're sound combatants most enemies fall victim to the mechanics of the game. Many stagger from any two hits from any weapon, making them individually harmless if you use a fast one. And you can have a co-op partner at all times, trivializing most stand-up encounters. Of course, most encounters aren't stand-up...

By itself Jugs Journeys combat, setting and visually strong graphics would carry it into being a great alternative in the Soulsbourne genre. A modern setting and cyberpunk body horror enemies help set it apart but things falter quickly. The levels may look technically good but after going through a few you realize there are only three tile sets in the entire game: ruined city, cliff/cave and Anor Londo. The early levels actually offer the most exploration at first, including a choice of two areas/bosses to investigate first, then restricts itself tighter than a bodice to mostly linear design in the same ruined cities and caves, sometimes with snow, sometimes fire and a red filter. To shake it up are two mega-dungeon style areas which I credit for actually being impressive mazes. Unfortunately the first is one where the assets are repeated ad nauseam. Few landmarks, repeating textures, identical rooms and halls, only one proper way forward mixed in among branching paths. Later crimes include environmental traps you learn about by falling through them the first time and what I can only describe as the level designer giving up and recycling Anime Londo assets again in a merciful but lazy straight line level including locked doors with their linked switches placed in front of them instead of anywhere meaningful, like guarding your front door by hanging the key on the knob. There's an entire optional dungeon section of regurgitated cave-cities that lets you fight enemies with poorer placement than usual. I'm not a big fan of The Depths.

Ah, but loads of games have plain levels. Isn't the combat grand? Usually. But tied into the level design is the encounter design and by God, do the lads at Bandai Namco love one thing more than girlie globes. Ambushes. This game is absolutely riddled with enemy ambushes. Nothing gets the map designers more aroused than the idea of an enemy getting in a cheap shot. Enemies hidden behind corners, around debris and props, activated by item pick ups, shooting at you from raised walkways, teleporting in behind you as you pick up an item in a dead end hallway, falling from the ceiling en masse, sometimes hidden from sight in case you did look up. Enemies that are activated by other enemies noticing you, though some are tied to raising an alarm and you can interrupt that. But many aren't and you just have to grin and bear it. Many, many, many times in this game will something appear outside of your camera and hit you.

The polish is lacking. The fine-tuning isn't tuned to begin with. You will get sick of rolling through an enemy thrust attack to be hit by the hit box of the halberd haft uh, moving away from you. Big enemies and bosses have huge area of effect attacks that cover the current city block. Your character is able to move quickly and do loads of fast anime slashes, dashes and jumps so of course all your serious enemies have to be fast too. There are enemies with .5 second wind-ups for 100-foot-in-.5-seconds dashes that will deal 40-60% of your health every time. Many react to healing by using their fastest, lowest wind up distance closer. It's more practical in many cases to just die so your partner will revive you. All of this is compounded by invasions, where waves of enemies will teleport in to rush and charge attack you, helpfully overlapping their attacks and hit boxes so that you can really feel it, Mr Krabs. Mammaries Mission is so faithful to imitating Dark Souls it copied the worst parts of DS 2 without hesitation. Some of the bosses are obnoxious to the extreme for all these same reasons. The Depths features hands down the worst of this, doubling up on enemies that are criminally bad solo. When this game is bad it is really bad.

I don't want to gripe that ""game hard, game bad."" I feel that truthfully a lot of it is a matter of testing that might have slipped by. Many enemies could be flipped to good by adding a handful of frames to their attacks. The game was delayed after all and it makes me guffaw to imagine what almost shipped by the first deadline. I did enjoy it enough to complete it, there are many bosses I'm happy to fight, the last five bosses of the game were good, my favorite, good, good and terrible respectively. Overall Code Vein is a good game and we've all got different tastes, for some of you it may be your favorite game. Some will not have the endurance I did and rightfully drop it at the first wall of tedium.

TL;DR: Get it on sale, it is a long game and the quality improves as you get further in due to letting your character customize further and become more efficient, so it can take awhile to feel it out. A shaky 7/10 for me, it may fare better for you. Do not get the DLC at full price and do not consider it unless you fall in love with CV and have cleared about 85% of it, the maps are in the penultimate dungeon.

Vampire/blood themed anime game in future where something went wrong...

There are some things that are not quite working as well as in for example DS3 or Nioh2 to compare, but overall it is a fun game.
Some frustrating things happen, like getting ""double-punished"" for getting hit, through stagger, or worse, you can get killed while you are downed. No I don't mean executed or anything like that. I have taken a hit that takes 60-80% of my hp, and knocked backwards and down, and then before being able to get up and/or roll away, a boss does an aoe or strike and kills me where I would expect to have some iframes.
I generally try to see why it was my fault I died and in DS3 I learned that the hard way and I accepted it was mostly ""yeah my timing was wrong"". A good amount of the times I died in this times it just felt like poor design. I would also say that the game expects you to run with an npc helper and not solo, and is balanced around that, I wish it was not, but you get used to it. A couple of the earlier bosses gave me more trouble than all the later ones combined, where I had lots of death to *without spoilers*: some water boss things and some poison boss things. 
Whereas later in the game I took out lots of the bosses on the first try, and most on 2-3 tries. 
The later bosses seemed better designed to me, at least.

It tries to do some things that Dark Souls does well and imitates some of them to a degree, but does other things poorly. There are ""Bonfires"" along the way, that works as they should. Another thing that you may be familiar with is ""the door does not open from this side"" and ladders that you can kick down, occasionally. In many levels this works quite fine, and ladder and level design is ok, such as in ""Crypt Spire"", a good example of a couple well placed ladders. There are at least a couple levels which are just a bit of a mess though, and the worst, way above all, is ""Cathedral of the Sacred Blood"". This map has an interesting look at first, but it has a big problem, not that it is a maze, but that it is a 3d maze in which most rooms look almost exactly the same, and there are ladders and stairs everywhere and you have to go up and down 2-3 levels and it is just a horrible mess. That said the other maps are mostly fine, it's just whoever made this map wanted you to suffer. Horribly.

You have a unique levelup/class system where you level up your character instead of your stats, and swap to different ""blood codes"" that gives you various different stats distribution, though I usually like to choose stats to level up when I do, this one is quite interesting, and makes this part something else than just a copy of dark souls, I like the idea. It was fun to try a few different ones.

That said it's just a thing you have to get used to I think, that the game is different from soulslikes to some degree. Once you kind of ""accept"" that and move past it the game is a lot of fun. The story is interesting, and you get like some other games small bits of *lore* you can find along the way and small pieces of information and even powers from finding them. 

There are multiple endings and you need to do various things (or not) to get them for achievements, but playing NG+ is not bad. You can choose if you like to not increase difficulty when you start NG+ as well, to just play it again for story/achievements.

Overall I would recommend it but only if you are a bit extra patient against mechanics and things ingame that may feel a bit wrong or frustrating, you have to get used to that.

The whole team who created this should be proud of themselves. There are three minor things that I believe should of been added to the game. First is in the Character Creation which is great but I believe two additional sliders should have been added one being the breasts and the other hips or waist. The second is the outfits are wonderful and then once in the game you have the Blood Veils which cover up half or most of your outfit. I love the looks of them other than not being able to change the colors to match the rest of your outfit. Same goes for the gas masks. I also think collecting a few more outfit sets should be added from one of the tougher enemies or even bosses. As I love all the outfits but wished for a few more. Now for the last is finding friends or anyone to come help you. There should be a way to add someone even if the limit might only be at ten max. Once adding someone you can message them and if someone is rude or has not been on for a while. You are able to remove them so you can add another to replace them. Now with that said the game is brilliantly done but with those three changes I know the game would be perfect. Now I am not sure how other players feel but I figured to give you my thoughts. You have made a wonderful game and I am honored to be playing it. As an Anime and Manga fan it makes the game better.

as much as i hate saying this ""anime dark souls"" is a pretty good abridged descriptor of the game. i don't much care for the over sexualised nonsense; call me a prude if you want idrc but besides that i enjoy it. enough to play it again clearly haha. it's an alright to good souls-like. 

one thing that sucks though is the level design. like it's ""okay neat"" at best and ""i've been lost for hours"" at worst. the cathedral is by far the worst offender in stupid maze-like maps i've ever seen. i mean besides that... i had fun at least. still recommend it. again there's more i like about the game than dislike.

My score would be a 6.5/10



To go into detail a bit more.

The character creator is one of the best ive seen in a souls/ souls like game ever. There is so much you can do to really create your anime character in the game. 

Regarding Combat in this game. You will definitely find similarities to the combat you find in Dark Souls, but it feels a lot different. For one you have a system called gifts in this game that act like special powers you can use by building up your Ichor gauge. There are many different kinds of Gifts. Some of the Gifts increase damage, some can make your defenses better, and some are special moves to devastate your foes on the battle field. Regarding hit boxes in the game. Sometimes the hit boxes are really generous for you, and sometimes they are really generous for your foes. You can really notice this in the boss battles. Regarding boss battles some of them are really fun and enjoyable while others i just wanted them to end the moment i realized what type of fight it was gonna be. Sometimes the boss battles are really annoying just because the enemy is able to hit you so easily, and not really telegraphed all that well. Some of this is off set with the permanent companion that is with you throughout the whole game. You can choose one of side characters that joins you on your travels to solve the problems of the world. They can help you fight enemies, and revive you when your lose all your health.

When it comes to graphics and level design this is definitely one of code veins lows. The Graphics arnt awful especially when it comes to character designs, but some of the areas bland, and make different areas look like the same zone a bit too much. The level design also isn't awful its very similar to how dark souls level design works, but its the same issue with graphics where a lot of the areas just look similar to each other that its sometimes hard to tell the 2 apart.

To move to a positive note of the game i will mention the music. I LOVE THIS MUSIC IN THIS GAME. i would buy the OST of this game easily. It has such a great collection of rock music mixed in with a small amount of sad music for when the story goes that direction.
 
Now to mention the story. In comparison to dark souls a story that is arguably not in for face pretty much at all. Code Vein has a story that is very much in your face, and you for the most part will be able to understand whats happening from beginning to end without doing a lot optional story things. I do recommend collecting as much of the ""vestiges"" as possible while you are progressing thorough the game though, so when you reach the emotional moments of the game you will have a much more emotional experience. The story has its flaws, but for the most part it accomplishes what its set out to do.

Overall i enjoyed my time in the game, and thought it was a fun one time experience of what a Anime Dark souls could really be like. I just hope if they do another one that it feels a bit better to play then the current iteration, and looks a bit better. I would recommend this as a 1 time playthrough to anyone interested in these types of games.

Side Note - If you decide to play this game on a controller you will find another thing that is a bit jaring coming from playing dark souls. Instead of Light and heavy attack being on the right bumpers they are instead on X, and Y. You can change this in the controller keybindings to solve this, but its still jaring.",1644325350,1644325350,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you're into branching or deep stories or maybe even into environmental storytelling, you won't find anything that impresses.

The DLC isn't terrible as people would lead to believe, but the amount of effort that was put into them is on the low side. I only really recommend them if you A) Love the game and its combat  B) You found the DLC or the Deluxe/Season Pass version for sale.

Gameplay-wise, the combat system seems to be quite simple, it is anything but due to some mechanics not being explained and it is up to the player to discover what works and what doesn't. You can play the game by ""bonking"" everything in your path, but it will only get one so far by doing so. I would like to note that there is a lot of customisation, so one may start looking into ""builds"", either made by yourself by being creative, or simply try the existing ones which serve their intended purposes. It is here that the game shines even if there is obvious jank here and there. Just like with anything else, it takes getting used to.

Another thing to note on the customisation side of things, is the character creator. It is decent although has a few limits in place, it is enough for the majority of players, but some may find very creative uses for it.

This game is challenging enough and may frustrate some players, but it is just all the more rewarding this way. It is just a shame there is no ""real"" incentive to play the game by handicapping your character. (Other than the unexplained mechanic of gaining more ""Gift Mastery"" via enemy dispersal)

Co-op features are very welcome, albeit lacking in several departments. Such as no ability to accompany the player in more than just combat areas as a standout example. Due to slower loading times, having either player ""disperse"" means going through a lot of them. The biggest issue is there is no Cross-play with console users due to use of separate ""handshake"" servers, even though the game's networking feature is P2P based (Peer-to-peer) for connectivity. There are some exceptions for MS/Xbox Game Pass players.

Music is okay, but is nowhere close to Nier: Automata or FFXIV levels of goodness. It simply works for the tone of the game and that's it I suppose. The regular combat tune will get annoying, fast. Your personal enjoyment may widely vary. (If you feel like playing an even harder game, do what I did, just play your own favourite music and disable game SFX)

Game has a photo mode, which includes shaders. Very welcome for people who like making screenshots. It's just a shame you cannot play with the shaders/effects real-time.

Modding... It exists, granted, it is still limited, though visual replacements are all over if you prefer eye-candy over what the game gives you.

The game has a semi-hidden community of avid players (myself included), both on console and PC, finding them was probably the best thing going into this game if you're into discussing many aspects of the game.

Truth be told. I personally found more enjoyment out of this game than the Dark Souls series in one aspect and that is due to how the entire combat system gives you a lot of freedom to play around. But for everything else, there are games that did things much better.

So here's how it works:
You change your class on the fly, it remembers your skills you selected for each so that's nice.
You need to change classes to learn cross class skills, or spend items on them to max out your experience with those skills instead of using the class (blood code).
All basic enemies act like they have cheat codes.  Even the biggest sword will rarely stun them.  Most of them move really slow and usually telegraph an attack if you are paying attention.  But since they spawn all around you, it's a bit harder.
When you start the game, you will probably be using up your healing often.  If you take any hits before the boss from regular enemies, your not ready for the boss.
Bosses are super speed unflinchable one hit kill monsters that can spam AoE.  They are really hard.
The levels are all giant puzzles with enemies that respawn every time you save your game. 

The character creator is excellent.  Especially the accessories section which lets you do pretty much anything.

The good:
- Amazing character creation!
- Great build diversity and easy to change builds quickly.
- Visuals are 10/10 
- The elemental weakness triangle is allright.
- Great mana system in the ichor.
- The hellknight dlc is one of the most fun souls type game fight i have ever experienced and redeems some of the bad fights. 

The bad:
- the 10/10 visuals cover the whole screen, its like they dont have LOD for FX's so they are less present the closer they are to the camera.
-the enemies are repetitive and a little boring at times.
- No gear set systems or favorite marks to put on gear you want ro quickly swap to, always have to look in the list of gifts and passives to find what you want.
- I wish the weapons and veils transforming would be more meaningful.
- The companions the game is built around either die all the time and are useless or just destroy the whole level for you, no inbetween.
- The range of most spell abilities are pathetic at best.

The Ugly:
- The level design is to put it nicely, dogshit. When compared to other souls games it is filled to the brim with cheap deaths that mixed with the bad enemy design creates a gameplay experience so predictable and yet unavoidable that I want to tear my eyes out. Every single level of this game has tiny ledges with no railing, enemy hidden in the corner or in a snow pile that has launch move to send you flying or some. Its like the devs played through Sen's forteress and only took out the worse elements to craft the environment of the entire game.
- The directional inputs. Dodging in this game is garbage, most of the time the boss will dash backwards and suddenly your character is dodging in all the wrong directions and spamming dodge just makes him fly in every direction when you are keeping the thumbstick on the same side the whole time. 
- On the note of bosses jumping. I don't know who thought it was a good idea to make sure the enemies would take of in the air fucking up all the camera angles and dodge inputs every 5 seconds but goddamn. I feel like I was coming up on a seizure with so many abrupt camera turns.
- There is no exposition on missed rewards. I get that its to promote more play time in new game+ to get the different blood codes but I unknowingly blocked myself out of the blood code i wanted while playing blind and now have to do ng+ to get it and to be honest i don't think i will for all the reasons mentioned in this review.

Solid 3/10 for a game that could do so much better so easily. Thank god i got it on sale.

Mixed bag:
Bosses: it feels like the bosses are either super easy or fuck me difficult and unlike a souls game it's not in a linear sense, the 1st boss is laughably easy but the 2nd easily demolishes you while you get used to the game, 3rd is easy so on and so forth also poison and slow on boss attacks with minimal tells is god awful

Pros:
art style (weapons, characters ;))
much more instant response time to inputs compared to dark souls or games like it
music
2nd half level design
story
2nd half bosses
endings

cons:
1st half level design, no getting around this, it's god awful
enemies, they're bland and it's frequently recycling them 
class system, I really like the idea but the execution falls soooo flat, leveling only really seems to increase enemy difficulty, it gives health and damage increases for you but for them too, also having to go back to base to level up classes is dumb

###################
Update #1 -- This game is garbage in design. The stat scaling and attributes do not make any sense nor do they appear to work. The game functions in 4 core aspects: Weapon, Parry Costume, Spells, Stat Presets.

Weapon: 
Weapons in this game function in their own unique way.  They all reduce a certain number of damage before it penetrates through to your Health.  This block is independent of your "" Parry Costume"" (armor).

Parry Costume:
In the game this is called a blood veil, but it really just serves as a costume. Although there are descriptions that describe these items as armor, all it does is affect the damage amount of your parry.  You can't discard this item nor do you need it if you plan to never parry. This item changes character's visual with an annoying cowl or coat. 

Spells:
The spells are nearly all the same with a different visual flash.  It requires ""ichor"" (mana) that can only be regenerated by taking damage or dealing damage.  Yes, pew pew then you are forced to melee combat when you have no mana-- why have projectile spells in the first place? It is clear the Buffs are more robust making magic spells a optional preference. A caster will be forced to fight up close anyway.

Stat Presets
The game calls them Blood Codes. A player CANNOT allocate their own stat points because there are none. Instead you find presets during your campaign, and 99% of these presets appear to be made out of someone's @$$ because they didnt want to work their job correctly. Spoiler: the second  ""Blood Code"" (preset) you obtain is THE BEST IN EVERY POSSIBLE STAT. Forget about armor, the great sword is the SHIELD. 

Update 1 Summary:
Due to its lack of Design, all the features this game offers contradict or bash each other into deprecation. If one plans to use a Great Sword which has the BEST block value, who needs ""Armor"". Blocking gives you mana, so why go magic?? Melee attacks and Parrying are the primary way to gain mana so why use projectiles?  Melee Skills also use mana, again why be far away? These circumstances leaves no purpose to use any form of projectile based damage because there is ZERO sustain, forcing a player to fight Close Comabt anyway. The stat presets are the laziest idea I have ever witnessed.  

Let me Rant and ridicule this game for a bit to depict what i mean:

Mage Preset how cool!  30 Mana doesnt sound bad, uh.. my fire ball is 5 mana. I can only Fireball 6 times and Im out of mana. Oh Wait, I have to go and swing a melee weapon to get my mana back... well F@#%, my melee damage is disgraceful.  Oooo a range preset,  nvm rifle bullets take mana. Im going to fight up close again.  Dude, a tank PRESET! Hell yea...  wtf,  any preset can wield a great sword and tank with it?!  Forget about swinging a Single Sword as a warrior, I can go Mage for the high mana pool, block forever and use my great mana pool to use Melee Skills, Vanish, buff the F)($ ton and when im out of stamina, I can parry then block again and repeat.  Another mage preset with a different name. 16 mana? No thanks.

16 hours later...  still using the same preset, same weapon, I dont get why i even have to parry, why isnt there a naked option? Time to fight a boss again,  ill try it solo,  this fucking boss is spamming the same move!!! i''m Dead.  Back to summoning the companion.

THAT IS CODE VEIN in a nut shell.

I’m not the type at all, but there is some earnestness to the characters. I don’t hate them, and they may not be super fleshed out, but the do a serviceable job of being ‘people’ in a crazy world.

The game play is mostly good, early it’s really good because it pushes you in interesting ways. You feel weak and low on recourses. Later on, enemies become predictable and bosses quite easy.

Then late and post-game, bosses and many enemies become sponges for damage. If you do the DLC-bosses get ready for some tanky and cheesy bosses with insta-gib-mechanics that rarely feels interesting or fair.
The end game kind of needs to throw away the stamina bar to be enjoyable. Way too much dodging hit three times and then wait for that bar. In most early and mid-game fights this feels more natural, but the end game has some tonky ass bosses and enemies. (Maybe my build sucked?)Duller, than interesting stamina management. I think there is a gigantic difference between when stamina management becomes a chore, like the end game, and when it’s done masterfully and becomes a fantastic mechanic: Monster Hunter.

Seriously though, I enjoyed this soulsian a lot. It's a more character and story driven game with a very interesting memory mechanic to delve deeper into the characters past. The gameplay is tight and the graphics are pretty good. I do have many problems with it tho which I will list below, but overall 7/10.

The lore and worldbuilding is a core part of this game. The way its delivered in the beginning is awful. You will be told the lore and your current objective at least 3 times, without interacting with optional npcs. The characters names are strange, with unamed revenants having an adjective assigned to them. This is really weird because the adjectives will not match with the overall characters personality / mood. 

As well as characters with actual names only appearing when their name is introduced in the dialogue, unless you have their name from the start. These weird decisions can be seen throughout the game, just hinders the experience in general. A good mechanic is the hot spring where you can look back on lore, both character and world wise.

The level and enemy design are good, grew on me after a while. The mechanics of combat and equipment are also great, although the responsiveness of the doge roll can be iffy. My biggest problem is that after giving you all of the stats like dex, str, mnd and such the leveling system helps with none of it. Like if you're combining exp and currency into one, that should have a meaningful purpose. It feels like they put it in there because sous-likes have it without understanding the meaning and worth it carries.

Why have a combined exp and currency system? If blood codes give you the stats and leveling only upgrades stamina, health and damage why have it there? Upgrading the weapons and veils already exists, with classes giving gifts along with different resistances and stat levels. Why not just have a currency, with upgrades to health and stamina being like the regeneration upgrades: ones you pick up as you progress.

Why have a level up feature? The grinding mechanic is already there with the mastery of certain class gifts, the farming for materials to upgrade your veils and weapons is there. What is the point of leveling up? One of my fav games which is also a souls-like is Hollow Knight; here there's no exp because leveling up that way makes no sense. You have your stat upgrades with items you acquire throughout the map, only being able to get some of them with abilities gotten later. 

The sense of progression is not created by an experience system and I think Code Vein would be much better off that way as well. You can choose which stats to upgrade in Dark Souls giving you a different build, while Code Vein is more about the gear and gifts. You need to level up certain stats in Dark Souls to equip something, while Code Vein just needs a compatible class. Maybe its just me but I don't see the worth of having Haze, when better more compatible systems of progression are out there.",1643646493,1643646493,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's cool you get to use such a long and diverse list of abilities, but the idea that if you are fighting an enemy that you can't seem to beat at all, you feel locked there, not able to move forward at all. You COULD grind, but a forced grind to even stand a chance is cringe entirely.
---------------------
TLDR: If you wanna try this game, go ahead. I couldn't come to terms with how many attacks are thrown at you in sequence even at the 2nd boss. THE SECOND BOSS??? This is more a rant than a review, but if you genuinely enjoy the game, thats cool, I just can't bc I suck ass probs. Happy sukin blood.",1643513239,1643513239,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm not gonna lie, my first play-through I loved the customization but not only had I never played a dark souls type game before, but its learning curve was a bit too much for me. But I picked it up again, stayed through it, and can say I'm very grateful I did. 

Some things the game could have improved on could be: its map design; some maps layouts were sometimes a chore to go through. The PC port was also a bit of adjustment to get used to (but since I new to the dark souls genre that could just be my bias)

Overall, despite a few shortcomings, I really enjoyed the story (which has 3 different endings), even though its simple, it had me tear up numerous times, the OST is pretty banger (Vamps - in this hell is basically the theme song for me haha) and the character customization is great.

Graphics are great with very few visual glitches, and the soundtrack is appropriately epic for bosses. Unfortunately there isn't typically any BGM playing while you roam, so the world does feel stale and lifeless, which I imagine is the point.

The worldbuilding in this game is decent and, in true Soulslike fashion, frustratingly vague. Yet you will be able to understand just enough of the story to know which way is forward... Most of the time.

Level design is a nightmare for some stages, and while it is certainly intentional and it can be rewarding to explore, there's no denying that at some point you'll probably have to look up a guide on how to progress. And that's a bummer.

Character creation is fairly detailed and you can certainly customize your avatar to your heart's content. There are characters here with massive boobs, sure, but there are also characters with normal chests, hunky bois, and fem bois too. No need to be turned away by a little boob jiggle physics, there is definitely variety here.

Finally: Combat. This is, of course, the highlight of the game and what we came here for. It is Soulslike with a heavy emphasis on positioning and dodging, while blocking and parrying are also defensive tools at your disposal, though they require a lot more skill to utilize. Unfortunately, unlike Dark Souls you do not have full autonomy over your character's combat style and stats.

Stats are determined by the Blood Code you equip, which then determine the passive and active skills at your disposal. Leveling up only increasing your HP and scales the difficulty of the enemies up. In theory, this would mean a ""Level 1 Run"" might actually result in the easiest version of the game, but I haven't had the guts to test that theory.

You may carry only up to 2 weapons at any time, and you may not dual wield them. This, coupled with the fact that there are no shields in this game, pigeon hole you into an all-out-offensive playstyle with the only choice being your flavor of carnage.

No spoilers.

I accidentally delete my other review due to me being stupid and clicking allow comments before saving the changes first. Im writing the things i remember.

So the gameplay is all about dialogues i guess, I bought the game because ive thought this game was ds3 with more magic and anime boobs!
(ive only saw the anime boobs part.)

I played lots of rogue-likes and souls-likes myself but this one is the most boring one ive experienced so far (worse than god eater 3)

So let me talk about my experience.

The game is boring as f*ck i saw more cutscenes than my gameplay itself, the monsters and bosses were too easy that required literally 0 skill even some weabo with no gaming experience could beat the game while just pressing w and spamming left click. I started playing the game after the first cutscene and after a while again, saw some talking boobs and ass ive immediately smashed my head to the table to atleast keep playing the game. The map design is so cruel that my friend with claustrophobia jumped out of the window because he could only move 1 step right/left in the maps we've played in. In the first map there's some insane weabo's that turned into demons i guess? and you can literally just kill them even though you get 10 hits by each one of them because the game is made for whose just wants to be anime protagonists.(Well i like being the strongest in some games but after a while you'll prob just get bored like saitama.) yeah, what a coincidence i like anime too? but still dont like the game.

Lets talk about in-game experience of mine.

Ive started the game, created my character then immediately saw some anime boobs played i mean uh, thats cool and all but im actually talking about real talking butts, while some npcs were talking i was only seeing their butts or boobs (or prob ive just focused on these- hopefully.) And ive got into the game there was the city map with no exploration at all made and some non-strong enemies to make me uh what, ready for the boss or learn the game mechanics? No, i mean thats what i thought but boss was literally the same level with those monsters. The first city map was only some car junks and some boring buildings/enemies. Thats all, yeah. After ive got to Firelink Shrine (Whoops wrong game) I thought game would finally start but get this! Ive had lots and lots more dialogues/cutscenes the only good thing was the Rock music that ive found in the jukebox. Then the guy said oh lets go back to the first map! And it literally got painful after that. (mentally, because i was bored haha get it?) Then i accidentally pressed alt+f4 and uninstalled the game thats why i cant play anymore nor cant refund the game because ive played this boring as game for 5 hours because i thought it would get ""Better"".

Oh and lets talk about good things on my experience. uhhh-
Anime Boobs
Rock music on the jukebox
Soundtrack
Epic intro on getting into the game every time you start
(Notice how im only talked about the music for 3 lines? because i couldn't find any good things that i remember from the game.)

The story is boring with two or three interesting concepts that aren't very well fleshed out. The dialogue is boring and characters feel like empty shells that talk to you. All characters are very bland and hard to connect to. Gameplay is very meh, you can tell they tried to achieve a combat system equal to that of FromSoft games, but it just doesn't flow or work together very well.

Ultimately, CODE VEIN is a huge uninspired let down that only thrives off of quite a nice art style and soundtrack.

~[i]Shashō, Ressha Sentai ToQger[/i][/h1]

Imagination. Kinda hard not to notice that at this point, the world desperately needs more of it. I mean, seriously, think 'bout it. In theaters it's either remakes or another [b]Fast & Furious[/b], in video games it's either another [b]Call of Duty[/b] or [b]Assassin's Creed[/b] and even when it's about Japan, it's hard not to notice lack of the imagination. Instead of creative new stuff, we're getting more and more generic shōnen manga from [b]JUMP[/b] and tons of flying lolis in anime. I don't know about you, but personally, I'm [i]so-o-o[/i] tired of all that copy / pasted content. It's like marketing destroyed all the creativity. Like, there's no art anymore, only products. And consuming those feels like eating those cheap hot dogs from [b]Costco[/b] instead of a proper homemade meal. Kinda helps you to keep going, but doesn't have much taste and is also bad for your health. Why am I telling you all that? Well, because that's the thing about [b]CODE VEIN[/b]. It lacks the imagination.

Don't get me wrong, though. The presentation here? It's absolutely beautiful. You enjoy watching anime? You'll love the presentation here. The visuals combine Gothic elements with post-apocalyptic stuff and our usual anime-like approach, and the result looks very impressive. Of course, we've also got great voice acting (don't know about English one, but honestly, if you play Japanese games with English dub, there's something seriously wrong with you) and some awesome songs. Talking about songs. Aside from very touching original tracks, we've got licensed tracks from [b]VAMPS[/b]. Yes, [i]the[/i] [b]VAMPS[/b]. That stylish Japanese duo that includes [b]K.A.Z[/b] and [b]HYDE[/b] from [b]L'Arc~en~Ciel[/b]. And it's really, [i]really[/i] cool. For two reasons. First – you can rarely hear [b]HYDE[/b]'s awesome voice in video games. [b]L'Arc[/b]'s [b]Drink it Down[/b] was used for [b]Devil May Cry 4[/b] (in [b]Japanese[/b] version of the game you can hear it during the installation process), [b]Don't be Afraid[/b] was used as a theme song for [b]Resident Evil VII[/b] ([b]BIOHAZARD VII[/b]), while [b]Mirai[/b] (the first single in many years) was licensed for [b]BANDAI NAMCO[/b]'s [b]MMO[/b] called [b]Blue Protocol[/b]. That's pretty much it about [b]HYDE[/b] and video games. So, having a new game with his voice? It's cool.

The second reason is, of course, the fact that it's [b]VAMPS[/b] we're talking about. And, unlike [b]L'Arc~en~Ciel[/b], [b]VAMPS[/b] never aimed for true art and creativity. [b]VAMPS[/b] were always about the show. About two “bad” boys showing off. With tons of vampiric costumes, lyrics and motifs. And guess what? [b]CODE VEIN[/b] is a game about vampires. Well, technically, those are called [b]Revenants[/b] and there's somewhat complicated story about how things work about them, but long story short – those are just post-apocalyptic vampires (vampiric abilities included). And naturally, it's a perfect match for [b]VAMPS[/b] and their songs. Especially since, unlike [b]Devil May Cry 4[/b], this game would actually use those songs in the process. And seeing your guys fighting while listening to [b]VAMPS[/b] in the cutscene? It's just awesome. Even if you're not really a fan (again, what's wrong with you? Everybody should love [b]HYDE[/b], [i]everybody![/i]). Like I said, presentation in [b]CODE VEIN[/b] is great. The game has a deep atmosphere of infinite sadness, it has a lot of tragedy, it has a lot of emotions, etc, etc, etc. So... it's a great game, right? Well... not... really, no. Because that's where creativity ends and our usual copy / pasted stuff begins.

First of all – all the vampiric stuff aside (because yes, it's cool and comes with a lot of style and symbolism), it's our usual [b]BANDAI NAMCO[/b] stuff. You know. The old world lies in ruins, there are monsters running around, and, of course, there's a group of young people to do something 'bout it. Reminds you of certain something, right? Yep. It's a bloody [b]GOD EATER[/b] all over again. Everything's here. The ruined city, the home base, the silent girl with white hair, tsundere with a huge weapon... It's all here and it feels [i]exactly[/i] the same. So much for creativity, huh? And you know what? When it's about the gameplay, the approach is exactly the same. I'm not trying to say that this game has the same gameplay with [b]GOD EATER[/b] games, of course, but yes, it's a copy / pasted bull too. Except this time [b]BANDAI NAMCO[/b] copy / pasted things from [b]Demon Souls[/b] / [b]Dark Souls[/b] series. In other words, it's like this - take [b]Dark Souls[/b], replace setting and characters with what we had in [b]GOD EATER[/b] and [i]voilà![/i] Here's a new game from [b]BANDAI NAMCO[/b]. That would be [b]$59.99[/b], thank you very much.

But OK, creativity or no creativity, maybe gameplay here is very polished and satisfying? Nope. The battles come with a clunky and cheap aftertaste (you've played [b]GOD EATER[/b] – you know what I'm talking about), while level design... well... I can't say it's bad. Actually, I enjoyed it quite a lot. Just because I do like complicated levels. I like looking for keys and trying to figure out how the current map works way, [i]way[/i] more than just running forward through corridor-like levels (like in [b]Nioh[/b], for example). The problem is – level designer here is an ass. The maps in [b]CODE VEIN[/b] are full of “ha-ha! You're dead!” traps (technically, those are not even traps, you'll just fall a lot because maps are designed in a way that prevents you from seeing pits before falling), the game will change the rules quite often (again and again you'll be stuck because the game will introduce the new kinds of level design without even trying to properly introduce them to you) and so on. In other words, the levels here are just... unfair. And not in a good [b]Souls[/b]-like way, but in a cheap death one. Let's just admit it, everybody hates cheap deaths. And this game? It sure has 'em. Cheap deaths, being stuck for hours just because nobody told you that you can do certain tricks... That's [b]CODE VEIN[/b] for you. And there's nothing special in all that. This game? It's just that. A low budget [b]Dark Souls[/b] in [b]GOD EATER[/b]-like setting with clunky battle mechanics. The end.

So, how to feel about all that? Naturally, it's up to you. There's sure a lot of good in this game. Dramatic story, awesome presentation, licensed tracks from one of the most badass Japanese duos out there, complicated level design, [b]Souls[/b]-like mechanics (online included) with some unique twists and vampiric motif, and so on. But on the other hand? On the other hand we've got a low budget aftertaste, clunky mechanics, cheap deaths and, of course, copy / pasted setting and characters. Personally, I have no idea how to rate all this. Did I have my share of fun with this game? Kinda. Especially since, as you've already noticed, I'm a big fan of [b]HYDE[/b]. But do I consider it to be a worthy product? I... don't think so, no. And since there are way, [i]way[/i] too many [b]Souls[/b]-like games on market... I can't say I recommend this one in particular. Just because there are [i]way[/i] better alternatives. Then again, it doesn't mean that it's a bad game. You like both [b]Dark Souls[/b] and [b]GOD EATER[/b]? You don't mind copy / pasted content and low budget aftertaste? You may as well go for it. But personally, I don't think I can give this one a thumb up.

This game isn't good. It isn't terrible. It's mediocre with good elements and glaring flaws. Where the character creator, combat and systems are relatively good, that's kinda where it ends. 

The story is kinda meh. It's just kinda there. There's nothing interesting about it. Characters decide to have random backstory dumps at odd times, which can be very jarring at points. Where the game seems to somewhat care about the characters, it cares very little about the world itself, giving a paper thin backstories as to why the events that we've seen have happened, but completely neglecting to explain why you're running around an apocalyptic metropolis that looks like it has been hit by every natural disaster known to man, at least once each.

There's very little in terms of outfits for your character in comparison to other character elements (to begin with at least), which is pretty disappointing given the many options for other aspects of your character. The game gives you the ability to toggle individual elements or an outfit on or off. This at least allows you to make all the overly extravagant outfits into something a bit more minimal. This doesn't really solve the lack of options for outfits.

A lot of the enemies have weapon swings that reach significantly behind them on both sides, meaning you practically have to roll for every attack and there are no reliable ""safe spots"". Some enemies have stupid long attack ranged with melee attacks that you expect from a boss, not an early game mob. Each level has a small pool of enemies, maybe with a couple of different weapons if they use them. which are copy-pasted everywhere in those levels, which results in very little variety and pretty boring gameplay. The game gives you NPC follower to help you throughout levels, but I often found that where I played cautiously, the NPC would jump in and kill everything. Backstab angles are far more forgiving than DS. A lot of the issues with the combat result in either feelings of ""wat"" or ""well that was so easy it was boring"". 

All the feelings of excitement and adrenaline you get from playing DS just aren't here. If that's what you're looking for, look for something else. You won't find it here. If you're just looking for another action RPG, then this exists I guess, but there are better options. If you're looking for a co-op game, then you should know that this game functions similarly to DS. It's a bearable co-op system on top of a mediocre, yet very flawed game. No matter what angle you're coming from, my recommendation is still to look somewhere else (unless you're just looking for anime dark souls, in which case, guess this fits the bill on an aesthetic level).",1639614368,1642717240,False,2,0,0.522049248218536377,0,True,False,False

However...... The Vestige Memory System is a hell of a drag, Literally spent an hour just going through memories to fix class abilities, if you go to heal and restore supplies the enemy re-spawns immediately leaving to choose to press forward till you find a new checkpoint or master combat without using many needed supplies, most things in this game are fairly cheap or over priced, the trade system for points seems like a possible drag as well seeing as you never know when you will find an object meant for a certain character.

Achievement Hunting Difficulty – 6/10, all achievements can be done solo and would require more then one play through.

Game Difficulty – 7/10 if this is your first “souls-like” game and you even get a companion, which makes the game not as difficult. If you really wanted to make it more difficult. You’d have to get rid of your companion and play at level 1 with the starting weapon. Otherwise, it’s like a 4/10 for veterans of this game type.

Story – 6/10 – I don’t really play games for story and this one especially is fairly predictable, especially if you’re familiar with anime/mangas.

Level Design – 6/10 – Some maps are well designed and some are just headaches that just break immersion. Some transition points between maps just seem unnecessary… such as climbing down a 20ft ladder, walk 6 steps just to climb up a 30ft ladder. Some parts of the map are just there for appeal with no functionality.

Character Design – 7/10 – Could do with more character customization, but otherwise it’s acceptable. Also, if you’re familiar with anime/manga… you can get a rough estimate of predictable support characters.

AI – 6/10 – Enemies are pretty predictable with their attacks and can’t do much about your companion’s AI. You’re not really supposed to depend on them. The only thing that makes them difficult is that some have an “activation” animation where you can’t hurt them, or when they just spot you.

Joking aside, I would describe this game as not great, not terrible. It certainly has its moments and if you're an anime + dark souls fan, I think you'll like it. Ultimately, it wasn't for me. 

The positives:

[list]
    [*]Art and design: beautiful character models, weapons, character customization
    [*]Good idea to show your footsteps in the mini-map, I wish more games did this
[/list]

The negatives:

[list]
    [*]The level design is ultimately boring. Without spoilers, you have ruined cities, deserts, fire and ice. That's pretty much it. You have a limited colour palette through the entire game, I imagine this was a conscious choice by the level designers to create a certain ambience, but I didn't care for it. It was depressing and boring.

    [*]The blood code AKA class system. You unlock blood codes throughout the game. Some are not obvious, you have to talk to NPCs without any indication you should talk to them. You then unlock skills within these blood codes. It's unclear when you will find certain items to unlock these skills. Then you have to level the skills themselves inside the blood codes to 'master' them so you can use the skills whenever you want, given you meet the weapon requirements. 
This all felt very convoluted - there are repeating codes (like Power Up), useless codes that I can't imagine anyone using. Navigating through these different codes and seeing which ones you have levelled up was incredibly annoying. What stats do what is also unclear unless you do some googling. 

[*]Ichor, the ""Mana"" of the game. This resource feels severely limited unless you optimise your build for it or use the drain attacks of the game. The drain attacks restore Ichor instead of your Hit Points... A game where you're a VAMPIRE. Ok, I guess. 

[*]The story. Rather, how it's told. Unlocking skills from blood codes requires gathering memory stones. Each memory stone is you being teleported to a colourless level and being spoon fed dialogue from a character you don't really care about. One. Sentence. At. A. Time. You can skip the entire cut scene, but there is no option for being teleported to the level in the first place. Just let me get my skill, please.
The main story was pretty boring. I didn't find any of the characters memorable or wanting to root for them. Just meh.

[*]The PC port. As console ports go, this wasn't too bad. But you can instantly tell this game was made for playing with a controller. As I'm used to playing with M&KB, the gameplay was frustrating. The keyboard layout is not great, also navigating through menus is not intuitive at all. Again, this was clearly made for console.

[*]The expansions. For their price, they're not worth it. If you buy this, wait for deep discount or skip them altogether. They are basically one small level (called Depth), you can get some items from them and a new boss, that's it.

It does have some bugs that rank from annoying to potentially life-threatening, examples of those both extremes are some relationship items being deleted when changing menus for the former and the game not recognising mouse input at random during fights for the later.

The big 3 DLCs have basically next to no story/lore and are more of a post-ending challenge arena of sorts. Most of the stuff isn't meta defining or anything, but there is one unlockable special attack that has nigh-infinite poise which is pretty nice.

Good gameplay overall.
Storyline: 4/10
Gameplay: 7/10
Visual appealing: 7/10 - 2/10 (described ahead)
Difficult: 5/10

The game is an average game, that I'd recommend if you do like games with 'anime' aesthetics.
The gameplay is not bad. The customization, both of character appearence or the character ""class"" are great. At the end of the game you can make based in anything you like; magics, elements, weapon type, movement, range or melee etc.

The Story could be much better. Tbh I tell my friends this is a flashback simulator. Tho it may be boring, the world itself is interesting. I hope they make a sequel of this just to explore more this world.

The visual are awesome if you like anime/cartoon like things. This is an action game with cartoonized character. BUT, as a RPG player if really felt it missed the visual appealing of classes, which does not change ANYTHING. The only changes in visual you have in the game are: Changing character model, Changing Weapons, Changing the Cloak you wea (which you can just turn off and see the character original clothes all the time). Where the cloacks kinda are 'linked' to a type of character build, you pretty much will only use like, 3 cloacks, all the game (when you have all of them). One if you want to have quick movements if you're with light weapon, one based on your strength (most of time) because strength scalling weapons are heavier, and one based on magic damage, if you want to play mage. That really disappointed me, but made me create a different character for each playthrough.

The musics are just... Ok.

The difficult on high levels (new game +) are the type of flawless or death. Not really based on the machanics.
The game is a good hack'n'slash, but tbh, a very bad souls-like.

The DLCs are a bit more difficult. Not because it's new mechanics or whathever, but because their bosses have ""trials"" which may be tiring if you try to complete all of them.",1641695801,1641695801,True,0,0,0.492957741022109985,0,True,False,False

The downside is that the level design seems to be aimless mazes rather than having any sort of direction, like Dark Souls has. This results in you running around lost for hours before you just so happen to stumble upon where to go. This is not fun.. it's not fun to look at, it's not fun to wade through. Maybe I'll change my mind as I keep progressing, but so far the level design is is so lackluster it's dragging the rest of the game down with it. You'll be seeing glowy veins for quite a while before finally arriving at the Anor Londo clone.. Except that this Anor Londo clone is terrible compared to actual Anor Londo. While in Anor Londo, the path was set for you, and you only had to figure out how to get there, This game literally just twists and turns with the same fucking set of stairs as the last set of stairs.. Fall off here and.. aren't I just back where I started? Let me check the map... WHAT? 10% This level is HUGE.. and not in a good way.. It's huge, but it all looks the exact same with washed out color and endless staircases EVERYWHERE. The enemies aren't even difficult compared to what I gotta look at while fighting them. If you can get over this, or use a guide, the rest of the game has many mechanics and features that I really do enjoy. Combat is fun, if not a little weird.. Hits don't really feel like they connect unless you're using a heavy weapon, but dancing around enemies smacking them with a hammer is so fun I kinda just wanna keep doing it. So why do I recommend this game if I have so many bad things to say? It feels like Dark Souls, but you can go really far with the character customization.. And I'm into that. It was one of the few things I wish Dark Souls did better. The game is definitely worth a shot, ESPECIALLY if you can get it on sale. I don't think I could justify spending $60 on this, but the 8$ I spent made this buy pretty spectacular.

Now, over 2 years later, a friend asked if we would coop if he bought it, I said sure, and man I'm glad I picked it back up.

First, the obvious. I'm a huge souls game fan and if you are too, you will feel right at home. The game also has great QoL features both in and out of coop, and due to the way the leveling works, you are free to switch up your builds on the fly as well, which is awesome.

Story is honestly really good in my opinion, the game has multiple different endings and the characters in the story are honestly likable and fun to be around. Story even got me emotional in some parts. It took me and my friend 25 hours to beat the game, 100%:ing each area and playing through them twice so the game is decently lenghty as well. Haven't touched DLC yet though, and only done half of Depths (kinda like simpler Bloodborne Chalice Dungeons).

In case you care about character customization (like I do), the game's got you covered there as well. Honestly it's MMO tier, and having spent literally 50% of my 12 hrs on BDO in just character customization, this game's is honestly really close to being on par with BDO's, which in my experience has been the best char customization in any game I have played.

TLDR to those of ya'll who just want the clear verdict: It's anime dark souls. The combat feels similar, map design is similar, and overall it just really is *best non-souls, souls-like game* in my opinion. The game's bosses felt REALLY EASY apart from like 2, but the overall progression in the game is around souls -levels of challenging.

The game is honestly very good, and definitely worth picking up on sale, or even when it's not on sale, if you just want a good souls experience.",1641507345,1641507345,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Its a fun ""souls-like"" for someone like me who doesn't generally like those kinds of games. I love anime girls, and this game provides. So, if you love anime girls, you might just enjoy the rest of the game since you have a badass/cute character to keep slashing through the game with.

Some parts feel rushed, but its totally worth getting on sale. Its $15 as I write this.. It was worth it for me, and the demo is a decent example of what the overall game is like.

What gripes me is the terrible level design, like, I haven't seen a game this linear since Final Fantasy XIII-1, and it might possibly be worse. Especially the cathedral area.
The music is nice, although that one violin tune gets very repetitive and tiring after some hours.
Replayability for this title is also not that great, since all the endings require you to do minor things usually in the same place / around the same point in the game.

Get it with a discount. Didn't get the DLC but for what I've seen they add literally nothing except some new codes, so I'll pass.

When I say that, I mean artificially inflated difficulty (IE monsters and boss hit very hard, HP sponges, clunky control mechanics), but also with that comes the ability to stack this into your advantage as well by exploiting collected blood codes once mastered to create nearly one hit wonders against boss fights. 

I haven't played since the last couple fixes, but there were some very annoying bugs that could cause one DLC to break entirely and become unbeatable as well as other bugs that would occasionally cause very annoying setbacks. One such is that I have completed all blood codes and story lines, but a bug keeps me from getting the achievements for such without replaying the game from the very start....and I don't like the game enough to do all of that again just for two achievements not working.

The over all style is very anime, so if that isn't your thing then player beware. The character creator is very well done for an anime style, and you'll probably spend a good deal of time making the right kind of look for your character and again later as you unlock other options. The one downside to the character creator is that it has assignment points (IE you can only wear so many combinations due to engine limitation), but this shouldn't hinder the creation process too much.

Biggest learning curve will be your parry system and understanding just which blood codes best suite each other to include weapon types to use with them and proper armor. You will only get so much stat gain from leveling up, the main of your damage, defense, and survivability will come from your weapon, armor, and blood codes you use. Just cause you earn a new blood code, does not mean you get to use everything from it right away. They must be unlocked and mastered before you can combine some of the passives using a different blood code. You will not get all blood codes with only one playthrough either. Some of them are very dependant on choices you make during the game and some choices don't become available until after at least one or more playthroughs.

I'll recommend the game if souls style game is your thing, and simply because I like how the story ties into the God Eater universe/lore. However, if you think this game looks cool and will be fun just to play I would highly suggest trying the demo first. This game can be very punishing if you don't learn how to adapt to the mechanics of the game and try to rely on slow/clunky dodge mechanics instead. Knowing how to parry is very crucial in this game for various reasons, not just to avoid damage but also to increase the pool for using blood codes.",1569715346,1641031979,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's soulslike, but I don't think it should be compared to Dark Souls. It wants to empower the player, give you worth, and enjoy some absolutely cringe tier dumb anime content like:
A, a female sidekick wearing next to nothing at all times
B, childishly angsty questions identity
C, ridiculously over the top combat moves that somehow don't insta-gib enemies

It's also all about the combat, while 'Souls has an element of navigation and problem solving. Which is why I think it's fairer to compare it to Remnant. Sure there's no guns, but the core loop is about going to a map, enjoying some tense but empowering combat, then returning to a home base through fast travel to level up and talk to NPC's.

3: The vast expense of antivenom items because of course this boss inflicts poison that's basically guaranteed death.
