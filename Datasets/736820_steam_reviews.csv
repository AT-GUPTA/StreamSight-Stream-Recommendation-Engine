For example
Fighting on an enemy city I have 5000 men, the enemy has 3000 as garrison.
I have an additional 2000 men sitting in an army outside that are completely unable to participate, neither able to help auto resolve odds or compete in the battle itself
Lame but okay
Enemy sails an army directly onto the city as auto resolve is going
Now it's 5000-5000 men
Super lame, but I have good troops so I'm starting to win
Enemy sales another 2500 troops PAST MY OTHER ARMY SITTING OUTSIDE
Directly into battle they go, now its 6500 vs 4500 or something at this point and I have to reload
That's so fucking lame, I can't believe they still have this in the game even this far after initial release
Also the battles suck :(
The end game objective of ""Declaring yourself emperor of the world""
Also completely sucks and just forces you to reload or enjoy warring 8 different random ass countries
The limitation on knights is logical to an extent, but limits you profusely as a player as you will neeeeed to spam ""Marshals"" to get as many armies up as you can, so you'll have 1 trader (maybe) 1 priest and 1 spy

Oh and whoever thought, it was a great design idea.., To have a system where you have a King leading an army, he dies from natural causes and instead of getting a pop up to add in a new knight or force your prince to take his place, nah.. You know what happens?

The kings army turns into a neutral mercenary army and you (Or the ai) can buy the troops for increased costs... DRRRRR WHAT?!?!!?

That's the dumbest fking shit I've ever seen in an rts in a long, long fcking time.. Ya'll out did yourself with the army limit krap with that genius garbage

It is a blend of Crusader Kings and Total War as many are saying, with the world map happening in real time while battles and sieges can be fought on rts style maps, though it falls short on both ends. The family tree and management of your lords or in this case knights isnt nearly as in depth as CK is. Your knights will always be loyal to you unless you abandon them to rot in an enemy dungeon or you exile them to hire a different class of knight. Which ends up feeling like you have a bunch of tools that you can discard whenever you're done with them rather than people you'd want to keep because they're useful or you cant discard without triggering some backlash. 

In the TW aspect it falls prey to the same issues, with the A.I. having no clue as to how to be a good general. They do the tried and true tactic of charging you down the center and hope to break through with all their units massed together. Such a thing has always been easy to counter and they do this on the harder difficulties as well. During sieges they'll abandon their cities and sally out to fight as soon as even a single wall section or gate is breached, which would make some sense if they didnt charge right into the face of artillery (which have infinite ammo btw) that will demolish most of the defenders before you have to worry about saving your stuff from the enemy attack.

There isnt much difference between kingdoms beyond whatever religion you're following dictates and even then the differences are minor. Everyone plays the same and starts off with the same path to progression with very little in way of variation. Some units are determined by your religion with major religions like Christianity and Islam (along with their various branches) having access to late game units like Teutonic Knights and Janissaries respectively though you still need to control the region where they can be recruited to get them. Other special units come from their respective regions as well and can be recruited regardless of religion (slavic bowman come from the balkans while desert archers come from, well the desert, though this is just flavor as there is no difference in stats). Which makes some sense with history in mind and if you know where to look can lead to some nasty army comps, but at the same time having those units region locked takes away from the identity of the kingdom that starts off with their recruitment region. All in all no matter who you choose, its the same game everytime as the goal isnt to take the world by force (though you certainly can), its to convince the world you deserve to rule. 

The over arching goal is to build up a score based of numerous factors (i.e. having the most wars won, the most friends via diplomacy, the most trade routes etc.) to eventually have a vote between everyone who has the most points and is considered a great power on who wins. This is the most fleshed out part of the relationships between kingdoms as many things will determine if someone votes for or against you, in addition to how much weight their votes carry. One kingdom might be great friends with you as you have a royal marriage with them and several treaties which adds weight to their vote and makes them want to vote for you. But maybe they're bigger than you with more territory and a larger army, which makes them think you don't stand a chance against them in battle so they want to vote against you and adds weight to their negative vote. A neat system though once the voting is done and if you win, there's no reason to continue playing. You can customize the victory conditions before a game ( i.e. win by being the first to reach X amount of money)  but the voting system will always be the big win. 

As it stands right now, its a great time burner if you have nothing better to do but if you're looking for something to stimulate the brain, this isn't it.",1703088159,1707682699,False,45,1,0.747547030448913574,0,True,False,False

It will keep you occupied and serene while playing.
You will spend a lot of time in it always getting a new province.

And then there is Multiplayer in which people constantly leave during the game.

Like KoH 1, once you gather 15+ provinces and collect all Kingdom Advantages you don't really have anything else to be afraid off since it's making you invincible and the only thing to do is to conquer the whole map which is time consuming work with nothing new and interested happening.

Graphic and audio are good for this type of game, UI sort of good. 
Servers for Multiplayer are not always working properly which even worse since not many people are interested in MP thus the experience is ruined even more.

I probably could have started as a bigger nation, but I don't really like using well established nations unless I'm going for a specific achievement, and like using the minor nations to build them up. 

In this game, starting as a minor nation seemed pretty much impossible. At least I thought it was, until I found that I could change the number of starting provinces for each nation in the game settings. Starting each nation with two provinces has made this game a completely different, and quite enjoyable experience.

Decisions of how to allocate resources - in long term upgrades (traditions) of the kingdom, recruiting soldiers to deal with current rebellion (but do you have enough levies?), real time growth of population and what to use them for, appeasing all various social groups of your kingdom and things like joining a war of the friendly kingdom that you’re not really ready for  or risking falling out with that neighbor - those dilemmas keep you occupy, without overwhelming you.

Bought this sequel because I liked the first game. I got tricked! This sequel is not an improvement over KoH1! This game tries to be Crusader Kings 3 lite, and in the attempt ends up being a pale imitation which lost its own unique character. 

Lets start-
1] This game was balanced around players choosing large kingdoms like France. Please!! Whatever you do, dont play a small kingdom! You either play as a large kingdom or dont play at all. I started as Leinster in Southern Ireland and had a rough time. Large kingdoms have lots of cities so you have resources to do things and don't have to wait as much. In KoH1 I always played small kingdoms like Leinster and had fun, but in this game everything costs so much gold, that you will just sit there waiting for your treasury to fill up so you can play the game. A tedious slog, not because it's difficult, but due to artificially difficulty. You will bore yourself to death. Wait to have more gold, more books, more manpower. You will stare at the treasury icon, and you will like it, or maybe you will uninstall the game.

2] Everything is expensive. Buildings are expensive compared to the first game, unlocking building slots themselves for the buildings to go in are expensive. Hiring knights is expensive, knight operations and upkeep operations are expensive, often 100 upkeep. This is alot when you are a small kingdom. 

3] City building slot costs are insane. For the first 6 or 7 buildings slots that are locked, you can pay to have them unlocked, the prices are, 2,000, 4k, 6k, 8k, 10k, 12k. Again, if you are a small kingdom, prepare to play the game called waiting and staring lmao. You are going to sit there and stare at the treasury icon and look at the numbers go up little by little to you have enough gold to unlock maybe 1 or 2 extra slots in your capital. Don't try to upgrade any other cities, you will die of boredom. These costs have been HYPER inflated compared to KoH1. Another attempt to make the game hard through artificial difficulty.

4] Marshall skills can no longer be selected from a long list like in KoH1. Wtf is this BULL? This is evil design. If you want to specialize a marshal in siege, you must pray and hope it gets offered to you when he levels up. In KoH1 I could pick which skills I want a general to have from A BIG LIST when he levels. I used to like picking the Iron fist for fighting rebels and the fortify skill to build forts in the field. Aren't sequels supposed to improve on the first game? Take the best features and quality of life mechanics and port them over to the newest game? 

5] Absolutely, ridiculously, perplexing, gargantuan, leviathan, infathomably long siege times. My GGOOOD!!11!!! It takes forever to siege a city! Another attempt to make the game harder through artificial difficulty. It definitely didn't take this long to siege in KoH1, and it is much simpler in CK3 as well, which is a superior game. They did this to stop players from blobbing the map, meaning they do not want people to have fun, in a SINGLE PLAYER game. Ok, I will go play something else that will allow me to blob. 

7] Province disorder system has been ramped up 100000000x in the sequel. I was playing as Ireland and finishing mopping up England with France as my ally. I don't like to be at war for a long time, so I was conscious of how much time I spend on wars. The number of rebels that kept spawning in the provinces I conquered was absolutely game breaking. Even after my kingdom and France finished England, there were still an insane amount of rebels spawning! You defeat one rebel, 1 mintue later, there is another. And another, another, another, another, and another. FFS. How many times do I have to teach you this lesson, peasant man. Shouldn't the province be depopulated of fighting age males from that rebel spam? Where is the realism here? They turned the rebel spawns ALL THE WAY up to make the game seem harder. I was running back and forth defeating them and trying to finish England, that was not fun. After I united all of Britannia, I quit the game. I realized this is not fun. It took me 17 hours and the refund option is gone. Dang, I hate this obsession with finishing things I start. 

8] AI army spam. Enemy kingdoms will throw what seems like unlimited amount of armies at you with max level 15 generals. How many people can they levy? And why is it when I kill or capture an enemy general another spawns with max level? Why aren't they facing rebel spam for continuously losing armies in battle? How is it that rebel spam happens when I take the province where manpower is completely depleted? Where's the realism? 

9] You can only have 2 generals fighting in a battle like the first game. This is supposed to be the sequel, try something new. Mount and Blade Warband lets near infinite number of generals and their warbands fight in a single war party, but the leader who called the war party must have influence to keep them together. I prefer that system. Also, Crusader Kings 3 allows unlimited number of generals to join battles.

10] To recruit peasants, the absolute worst unit, takes 3 population away form your village. In KoH1, recruiting peasants takes 1 population away form your city.

12] Spy operations are much harder than the first game, even with max spies and appropriate perks. This is very boring and limits playstyles, I want to cause chaos.

13] Prisoners never die in your jail, in KoH1 there is a chance they will die. In the sequel they just stay there forever. I usually just make them become rebels in whichever country I go to war with.

16] Papal idiocy and cheating. As soon as you hit ~1k, 1.2k gold, here comes the papacy like clockwork demanding you send gold. Of all the catholic kingdoms, they target little ol me. Leinster, with 3 provinces, trying to unite all of Ireland.  It cheats because it knows exactly when I have that much gold stored. It takes me forever to generate that much gold as a small kingdom. I have been angrily staring at the treasury icon watching it fill up to 2k I can unlock a building slot in my capital finally, then wait on some more gold to actually build a building in the slot. GO ask the large kingdoms For Christ sake!

18] Princess marriage system need rework. Every time I marry a princess off and when I die, the other country demands half my kingdom, and wages war if I say no. They don't want just a single province, or two, but half of the kingdom! It is better to not marry your daughters off at all. Just ignore them. By contrast, In Crusader Kings 3, if I marry my daughters off and die, the other nation doesn't get to claim half my country. It is actually useful to marry daughters off in that game to form alliances.

19] Marriage system needs rework. You can only marry from the main royal households from another kingdom. You can't marry your son to the daughter of the Baron, Duke, Count of random province in Spain or France. You can't marry nobles from your own kingdom or other kingdoms either like in Ck3. You can't marry commoners or lowborn like in Ck3. The system should have been upgraded for the sequel. 

21] Still 9 special characters for your royal court. It was fine in KoH1, this is your sequel, improve upon the old system. There are crippling income and manpower penalties for provinces without a governor, may as well not even waste gold on buildings in that province. That penalty system wasn't in the first game, it just gave bonuses to provinces that had a governor. This is an attempt to make the game harder, just makes it less appealing.

22] AI request spam in general is too much. It's about random crap too. Leave me alone! You just asked that request 20 times in the last 2 minutes. STOP cluttering my screen! Have a cooldown timer set for the AI so they know when they are allowed to ask again.",1706222496,1706262301,False,57,1,0.699820399284362793,0,True,False,False

Greatest thing about it was that this is not a completely new game but is built based on the original game. Many windows buttons, sounds and game mechanics exactly match with the original version which makes it familiar yet fresh with new, better working features.

Game is much more balanced than KOH where you could pick archers and scoprions, then cut through easily in all battles in detailed mode. In this version battles are tougher, sieges much more tougher where defender always has a huge advantage. This makes progress more challenging and realistic.

First hours when I started playing it seemed very easy but then due to constant wars rebellions sparked everywhere which became unbearable. Had to restart the game from an earlier phase. Make sure to check the kingdom happiness where ongoing wars play a huge role. This can be a deal breaker.

In any case the original game and the new one still lack a proper mid and endgame. After conquering 10-15% of the map you can win the game by getting all types of resources and kingdom advantages. After conquering 20-30% of the map you can get elected as emperor and after that moving forward is a slow and meaningless grind. Having a quest for country was a pleasant addition to the game.

That being said the game is very simplistic for a 2022 game compared to how M2TW -WAS- back when it came out.  Likewise the economy is as streamlined as the paradox games where every regions basically plays exactly the same with the possible exception of a tiny production difference compared to the overall faction bonus it supplies.

Basically what I am saying is that each faction plays almost exactly the same, and all the regions also feel almost exactly the same.

-There is no navy, which is a plus to some and a minus to others.
-The game is stable and doesn't lock and crash like Empire TW.
-The Pope dies too fast.
-You only get a few armies with tiny artificial size limits.
-It plays a lot like a board game, so it is well balanced, easy to pick up, and isn't completely full of itself.
-Expansion is effectively pointless since outside of the max 9 governed regions production in regions doesn't really surpass the cost to develop/defend it (90% production penalty). This effectively nullifies what people would assume a ""Corruption"" mechanic would do (think Civilization 3).  Instead Corruption is a penalty that never really comes into play.

I dunno, I played Civilization, M2:TW (and all the others), and all the Paradox games A LOT.  When I say a lot, I mean I do this literally all day.

I still REALLY liked the game.  It was fun, it was playable, it was stable, and it might get an expansion that gives it more replayability.

This is what Total War could have been. Played TW  on and off since Medieval 2 and this game is far more refined, balanced, thought out, and fun in my opinion. I think the learning curve is a bit harder than TW, but that's not saying much as total War is fairly childish in most gameplay respects and fairly primitive in regards to programming and development.

Think of Total War with every single aspect greatly improved and aimed at a more mature audience, there's more strategy and less nonsense, without being stifling and dry like other grand strategies.  I would place this in between the TW series and the Crusader Kings series, but using the best of both worlds.

How refreshing it is to be an onlooker , deciding whether it's in your best interests to jump into many of the simultaneous battles between kingdoms. Your choices and strategies really make all the difference in this game, unlike Total War where the game just adjusts the math in real time to defeat you.

I am in my second campaign, I can see how the system works, and I must be honest here and say that after KOH, I could never go back to the TW series, it's simply that much better.

You have a limited amount of leader slots and have to distribute them between generals, clerics, diplomats and spies. That means no matter how big your kingdom is, you're limited to 2-3 armies at most. 
The kingdom-wide upgrades are tedious because it doesn't communicate which ones can be upgraded now. Something like event notifications in Total War would help.
There's a complex system of strategic resources that doesn't add to gameplay because you're stuck with those that your provinces provide. Just keep to gold and scrap that system. It just drags down game speed.

Crusader kings but shit.

The ""leading battle"" aspect of this game is finicky and plays terribly. Imagine the gankiness of the old total war games, without any of the good aspects. Flanking does little, nor does attacking from behind. Cavalry is only useful for chasing down archers, which are able to run infinitely and fire on you (and your enemies if you have them) infinitely in a game set during the height of cavalry dominance in the field of combat.

Combat feels unimpactful and the easiest way to do it is to never ""lead"" at all, and instead stack up modifiers and then let the game autoresolve. There is no unit variety across nations, but rather religions and cultures. And by ""unit variety"" i mean that Orthodox kingdoms can hire ""Roman infantry"" Yes, it means the stereotypical Roman Legionnaire, yes this is a game set in 1300 AD, no it does not make any sense.

So really combat in this game is about rushing to the most OP, high tier units you can get so you can lure the enemy into your territory (you will have double the morale no matter what) and then just wipe out the entire army. Or, vice versa, you walk into the enemy territory and are stuck perpetually at half morale. Morale goes down just by being in combat. No, some units do not lose morale slower than others. Now for the political/management side of things.

The view you see in the screenshots is only in the ""close-up"" view of the map. Y'know, like how CK3 has a dynamic map. Solid borders from afar, clear from within. Except unlike in CK3, this change isn't remotely smooth. It is janky and I wold almost use the word ""laggy"". And also unlike CK3, this is not something you can just ignore: you HAVE to scroll in to manage provinces (aside from some other asinine method which may exist)

There is no difference between religions except that they give slightly different bonuses. The economy consists of money, plus EU4 style mana/resource management. 

Diplomacy is garbage and isn't even on par with total war's (Which already has a barren diplomacy system in 99% of its games--which is fine, because it is not the focus) and simply includes making offers or making demands. Except you can only make one offer and demand at a time, so you can't say ""I'll give you 200 gold in exchange for a trade agreement"". Funnily enough, the AI actually CAN give these offers. You just can't.

There is no, and i mean ZERO aspect of actual feudalism in this game. No counts, no duchies, no barons, nothing. It's just you and your ""royal court"" that's it. Family is, hilariously, capped. There are no different kinds of inheritance like Crusader Kings, which also means none of the heirs matter. They don't matter because whoever inherits the throne will just spam out more kids. No, your kids do not have any soul or life or anything of their own. They exist as puppet pawns, and are simply better versions of the advisors you can just hire with money anyway.

The consequence of all this is that the world presented in this game is terrible. There's a """"""Kingdom of Germany"""" which owns schizophrenic patches of land. There was a kingdom of Germany in real life--it did not have random blots of land and it was not around in 1300 when instead these lands were known as the Holy Roman Empire. Which is likely because it is impossible to represent the HRE in this game. In CK3 it's done by simply having everyone be vassals of the Emperor - In this that is not possible aside from entirely separate kingdoms being vassals. So it's the ""kingdom of Germany"" owning a bunch of random isolated lands with vassals in between. Bulgaria is so, insanely disproportionately massive that it makes me think half the dev team might've been from Bulgaria. 

This game is design to be played by blobbing out. There's no flavour to any nation, no real distinctive factors, no in depth diplomacy and definitely not any in depth family aspects. The game is all the worst aspects of CK3 and Total War combined. It does not redeem itself in any regard: not historical accuracy, not flavour, not gameplay, not music nor anything else. This game is bad.

That being said, there is, somewhere, buried deep inside this game, an actual good idea. If this was Early Access I might've given this review a second thought, but apparently some moron decided that this was a full-fledged game.

1. The Map:
   The map should be bigger, especially in Europe and the Middle East. I get it; those spots are the hotspots of medieval times, but why not go big? Expand into the entire Asian continent, bring in Indian kingdoms, China, Mongols in their turf, not just in Persia. Add ancient cities like Samarkand, Bukhara, Varanasi, and throw in the mix Ghana Empire, Kingdom of Siam, Kingdom of Benin, Abyssinia in Africa.
   Sure, Europe's the star in this game, but imagine the thrill of playing as the Kingdom of Poland, deciding to launch a campaign to India or way down south in the African Savannah. It's not always about map painting; sometimes, it's just about soaking in the diverse cultures and landscapes, interacting with different cultures, having merchabt caravanes travellingalong the silk road, wonders like the great wall of China. So, let's roll out the entire Asian continent and more of Africa a d northern europe. And hey, can we finally get those war elephants, Samurais, and Chinese firelancers?
   Of course, expanding the map needs to come with a package deal—more goods, unique province features, the whole shebang.
   And hey, toss in more cities like Malaga, Cadiz, Algesiras, Valladolid, Carmona, Braga, Ceuta, Meknes, Mazagan, Timbuktu, Jericho, Beirut, and Memphis (Egypt).
 Let's talk rivers. Pump up their size—Nile, Euphrates, Volga river. And add Lake Tiberias and the Jordan River.


2. Buildings:
   - Cities shouldn't be cookie-cutter; spice it up! Throw in unique architecture for Constantinople, Jerusalem, Rome, Baghdad, Cordoba, Mecca, and Medina.
   - Let players get their city planning hats on. Kings build new cities, garrisons, strongholds—let's make that part of their legacy. And hey, make  buildings like ports and garrisons 
 visible.

3. Provinces:
   - Flexibility is key. Province size shouldn't be a one-size-fits-all deal. Time to give players some room to Sykes-Picot the thing.

4. Natural Events:
   - Shake things up with sickness, diseases, droughts, and famine. Let the medieval world throw some curveballs.

5. Royal Family:
   - Male royal members should roll up their sleeves based on their class, governing cities without hogging a Royal Court slot. Sure, the production might not spike, but stability matters. Ungoverned provinces? Nah.
   - Family ties shouldn't vanish once the heir takes the throne. Let them stick around, age with the king, and pop out a couple of kids with randomly assigned classes. Expand that royal family screen, add a large family tree, and a history of the house—complete with each king's achievements.
   - Characters need their own traits. No more one-size-fits-all.
   - Education matters. Toss in more options. Shape those sons into the leaders they're meant to be.
   - Kings should pick their heir. If the firstborn's not up for the job, time to shuffle the deck and name a worthy successor.
   - Expanding the royal family saga opens up new challenges and scenarios. Time to make the throne a bit more lively!

6. Seas:
   - Let's see life on the seas! Visible fishing ships, merchant ships, and even ships carrying pilgrims or diplomats.
   - Introduce a Royal Fleet, make ports and fishing villages visible, and bring in coastal guards to keep things interesting.
   - Ships shouldn't be a dime a dozen, especially warships. Make building them a hefty expense, not an easy-access privilege.
   - No more armies magically converting into ships and landing wherever. It's port or having enough small boats on the ship to land the troops.
   - Ports become strategic war hotspots. Capturing them becomes a game-changer.
   - Make pirate ships visible, and tie them into the mechanics of mercenaries, crusaders, and rebels. Kingdoms with pirate havens can strike deals with them, attacking only ships from kingdoms that have no agreement or kinship with them.

   - Bring in an admiral skill—like, a Marshal who knows his way around warships. This beefs up not just land battles but also naval encounters.

7. Leisure Time:
   - Kings need some downtime too. Add options for feasts, hunting trips, and tournaments—expensive but a solid boost to crown authority and happiness.
   - Inviting kings to weddings. You can decline, accept, or send someone in your stead. The lower the position of your envoy, the more it stings as an insult.

8. Army:
   - Adaptability to Environments:
     - Troops should be ready for different terrains—desert, snow, sea, mountains. Kingdom armies should excel where their lands are, suffering losses and morale drops if they march into unfamiliar territory. Adapting takes time.

   - Provision and Natural Resources:
     - Desert troops need water; there's no free pass. Oases, freshwater sources, wells, and villages become vital stopping points.
     - Add an action for armies to get food from the closest city or stronghold. Line of supply matters—enemies could disrupt it by attacking supply caravans. Keep that supply line open during war for a smooth operation.

9. Royal Court:
   - Marshals should have let's say three lieutenants. Marshals can send these lieutenants to besiege or attack with a simple  drag and drop lf the troops available in the marshal army. Plus, they can earn promotions to become Marshals themselves.
   - Give kings the power to call all the Marshals to arms, allowing the king to lead the entire army.
   - Kings can't just ditch the capital without consequences. A penalty and serious stability and happiness drop ensue. Cue the second in command—the Hand of the King, Grand Vizier, or Lord Chancellor. Any Royal Court or family member can be promoted to this crucial role.
- Enable the king to enact reforms, such as granting royal pardons for a specific number of imprisoned criminals.
- Implement an action for governors akin to a witch-hunt but targeting criminals, rebel leaders, and foreign preachers.
- Introduce another action for spies to gather information on other members of the Royal court and Royal family.
- Generate messages regarding individuals who might complain about the sole governor's unjust actions.
- Incorporate religious holidays like the Day of the Lord and Friday prayers. Failure to attend or celebrate should result in a substantial penalty and a drop in crown authority.

- The king's second in command must ensure compensation to the families of soldiers who died in battle.
- Introduce an option to request debts, allowing negotiation of the period and method of payment. Refusal to pay debts can serve as a justifiable reason to declare war.

10. Battles:
   - Let's rethink the capturing point in tactical battles. It's like a game of catch me if you can, and that's not everyone's cup of tea. How about making it a fight till the last man, or someone surrenders or flees?
   - Spice up battles with duels. Challenge the enemy for a one-on-one showdown where the winner takes it all. Pick your commander, whether it's the king or prince, with a list of fighting skills, attack/defend commands, and no guaranteed outcomes. Killing the enemy army leader might not end the battle if they have a charismatic lieutenant.
   - Trench warfare should be a thing. Build trenches strategically and try to lure the enemy into unfavorable terrain.
   - Siege battles should be a classic affair, with the challenge depending on geography, strategy, manpower, weapons, and leadership. Attack with catapults, trebuchets, battering rams, ladders, and siege towers, which is another cool siege weapon that must be included. Defenders use arrows, catapults, trenches—the works. It's a fight until one side prevails.
   - Introduce a ""surrender"" option, adding another layer to the dynamics of warfare.

The reasons I mentioned for my dissatisfaction were the continuous game crashes in multiplayer, ridiculous bugs, and hours wasted due to the game crashing. The reason for this seems to be the upcoming release of Knights of Honor III, which has resulted in no support or updates for the current game. The updates that do come seem to be pre-planned and only meant to give the illusion of support. I strongly advise against purchasing this game, as you will likely end up disappointed. It's sad to see such a potentially great game end up in this state!

Furthermore, the admins have the ability to interfere with the game by shutting down or crashing the servers. There's also a cheat bug in the game that allows players to get unlimited gold. The admins are completely disrupting our peace and gaming enjoyment for their own interests. In the game, when you're in the country of Napoli, the FPS drops to 10, and after playing for a while, the game consistently crashes.

I shared these issues on the official Discord server, and for a year they have been stalling me. They asked me to open a ticket and wanted everyone to report the same issue collectively, which we did. Then they claimed the problem was on our end. When everyone playing the game experienced crashes, they blamed it on general Steam servers, which was a complete lie. They provide truly terrible support, built on falsehoods. We are just throwing our money away, and they are mocking us. Please, I urge you not to buy this game. Companies like THQ Nordic and Black Sea Games, with such awful support, will never earn our trust.

Battles are straight forward and the world is open enough, with enough diplomatic options, to manipulate which is highly satisfying; for example, getting land through diplomacy and marriage is as just as rewarding as conquest.

It's already 1 year out i never knew about it till I came across it here on Steam with luck. Why they never made a banner or a trailer is well a shame. This game is also a gem in this version. It's well-optimized and has a better UI than its predecessor. It has also more depth in it than nr 1. Yes, even the added more. I skip the tut and ignore the tips and reading. And I can play it if it's the original Nr 1 version. So in short if you are looking for an upgrade and work with bigger and better monitors this it is. 

I have so far not found any bugs. Or crashing or glitching or unfair nonsense from AI. It's rich and deep and love the lore of the old medieval Europa. However, keep in mind this game is not for beginners you NEED to learn stuff here. It's also not full action (unless you want to conquer Europe) then it pauses play pause because it's a lot of stuff you need to manage. Still a great game. I will play it again later. The upgrade this game needed. 

O what this game is. Well, it's a conflict game that you need to (fix it?) it's a strategy game that can be resolved in very many deep ways. War is the easy one (well for the beginners) Politics/faith/conquering/war/alliance/marketing/spy/protector/economics. You name it. This game can do everything. The war is the easy one. And many people will start with. Later on, you will try to do other things that have more effect than war. But you need to learn it. If you hate learning and a slow start (yes this is that kind of game) stay away. Later in the game (mid/end game) you have you stay awake and do a lot of things moments and the best part is if the hell break loses in Europe. 

Bonus it's the real medieval accurate version of Europa I have ever seen of many countries and flags on a small continent. Feel the heat and the small space you have to move around you.

Good:

- Really intuitive in-game help and tool tips
- Good amount of mechanics, but not too many
- Addictive upgrade trees for buildings and heroes.
- Feels grand scale but not too overwhelming and almost no micro management

Bad:

- A bit taxing on the GPU.

The game combines aspects of crusader kings (family development, claims from marriage, choosing how to guide your ruler's skill development) and elements of total war (play as the country no matter what happens to the ruler's family, more in-depth trade system, real time tactical battles), but the issue is that both really feel half-baked.

The real-time tactical battles feel very same-y, as every country has basically the same units. There are only 3 variations in units that I saw. For example, instead of a normal ""peasant"" unit, countries in the steppes got ""steppe militia"", and there was a similar change for countries in subsaharan africa and the middle east (desert tribal peasants or whatever). But practically, all the units play the same.

Besides these functional reskins, the only really unique units are few and far between. Off the top of my head, there were horse archers for the steppes (and probably the middle east), halberdiers for france, caballeros for some spanish provinces, and around 4 different unique units specific to crusades (2 different templar foot soldiers, 2 different templar cavalry units).

There are probably some that I missed, but frankly it doesn't make up for it when all the other units making up the army sound the same between Ireland, Perm, Russia, and France, etc. 

That's another thing: the the phoned-in voice acting. It's good for a while, but then you start playing other countries and realize that everyone is just a generic vaguely british-sounding dude with minor variations (if any) between countries, it stales quickly.

The game's resource system sounds interesting at first: Every province can have access to resources that can be upgraded and used to trade with other countries. However, don't think that there's a way to have ""economic"" victory. No no, other countries almost NEVER upgrade these resources. I was 7 hours into a game as Ireland, and absolutely NOBODY was making Spices. Despite my intentions to be a peaceful merchant state, my hand was forced by the idiotic AI to invade Mallorca to make spices myself, and then subsequently invade subsaharan Africa in order to get my hands on IRON, which apparently NOBODY thought was important to make use of IN 1200 A.D. I GUESS THAT EVERYONE WAS STILL IN THE BRONZE AGE EXCEPT FOR IRELAND.IN THE 1200s.

Overall, Knights of Honor 2 is a game that you'll likely play for 20 or so hours, realize that there's no real variation between countries that makes replaying worthwhile, remember that there's no real alternative way to play the game besides conquest, then you'll uninstall the game and never play it again.

Fr no one is playing Pharaoh xD. The more grand strategy games the better since it incentivizes better games in the long run.
Definitely an 8.4/10. The only reason its not a 9 or better is because this game needs a bit more variety in the units and graphics. (I just find it hilarious if you conquer Dublin in game as England you basically have Viking units. 
So, why KoH2?

Pros:

This game gives you a full package at launch which you cannot say with other strategy games.
All factions are playable.
Player choice is emphasized from the get-go for the play-style you want from the moment you pick a nation to play.
There is a charm to this formula that makes this game very underrated and incredible to mess around with. 
The five different choices for how your characters progress are pretty entertaining for those who love an rng element to playing against AI nations.
Rome II TW is such a joke compared to this game in that regard.
The settlement building system is really fun for if you want to min max each region to your kingdoms needs. 

Cons: 
(Its going to be a lot longer because I think the package is so close from being the best it could be.)

Battles are a bit on the rough side. I really really hate not being able to turn the camera in the battles it pisses me off no one thought to add this when they were making the game.
I also, dislike having to spam press the g key to make units run toward positions I want them to. 
This game feels like its 2 steps away from being a ten and it drives me crazy. 
The family tree needed/s to be expanded to include traits for each character in the family.
Merchant expedition events should show where they establish colonies. It would be super interesting to see where my merchants traveled to set up shop. 
Diplomacy needs to be fleshed about a bit more than it is. I love the idea of a diplomat having to individually try to improve relations with neighbors. However, the options for ending war needs to be expanded. If I capture an enemy marshal for example I should be able to trade the enemy for mine in return. For some reason I can't and I have to bankrupt my realm to basically save one guy. 
I want way more options for diplomacy too. If they expand this in the next game along with family trees and unit variety there would easily be something there. 
I would also love more start dates for the settings given. (Having only three is big sad.)
Would love scenarios centered around the Aztecs, Ancient China, and India I feel like it would add to the fun of it. You don't have to make the map one giant world but adding things like different regions to mess around with would be so cool.
More councilor slots are needed the 9 should've been 12 or even 11. I wish I had the ability to upgrade my kingdoms rank to include more advisor slots.
More unit variety for each nation in the future please. 
No naval battles. (Honestly, I'm okay with this since it streamlines the game a lot more efficiently.)
The current slots for the army should be expanded a lot more. I want to recruit at least 14-15 units if possible. Maybe the next game can have a game mode where it gives me the ability to play the original experience and have the new expanded slots in a different game mode.
Would love more victory conditions in the future. The two are a lot of fun to achieve but I feel like adding a science victory would be pretty cool. Or maybe a theology victory would be cool.
Add the protestant revolution in the future please.
Crusades are really lame. I want to control the guy I send to retake the holy land. Not make him AI controlled. Would've been cool to see and play around with the unique unit models. 
Have custom character/kingdom creation in the future.
Have custom events and decisions for each nation. 
Restoring the Roman Empire as Byzantium. 
Restoring the Angevin Empire as England. 
Making the HRE as Germany I think you get my point here.
They all kind of feel the same rn which is a bummer.

So, let's dive into this game. It's not the worst thing ever, but I'm not about to recommend it to anyone. The real deal-breaker here is the endgame – it's just atrocious.

At first, the game throws a bit of a steep learning curve at you. It's a bit of a grind, but you'll get the hang of it after a few hours. The early and mid-game sections are decent enough, but then you hit the war phase, and it turns into a complete hassle.

The game's got some redeeming qualities, though. The graphics and sound are pretty solid. The overall presentation is top-notch, and the audio has its unique charm, despite a somewhat limited range of voices. The music's decent, too. I usually mute game music, but this one kept me listening a bit longer.

But here's where things go south: the battle mechanics. If you're thinking about those intense, strategic battles in games like the Total War series, lower your expectations. This game doesn't quite match up. The larger campaign strategy elements are okay, but the lack of engaging ground combat is a bit of a letdown.

Now, let's talk about the real frustration: the gameplay dynamics as you progress. Past the 30-hour mark, you find yourself in this endless cycle of wars. It feels like you become the universe's punching bag. The game fails to clarify why every AI leader seems to have a vendetta against you. You see the negative scores in leader opinions, but there's no explanation for the mechanics behind it.

Here's my theory, and it's a bit of a loop. Late in the game, to survive, you have to hire mercenaries because, for some reason, the game thinks a few knights can manage global security (I mean, really?). But these mercenaries are a problem—they go on a rampage, destroying villages left and right. I'm pretty sure this is why the world leaders get so ticked off at you.

I tried to play it smart, used diplomats instead of spies (who are practically useless, by the way), but even that strategy falls flat. It takes just one leader to declare war, and then it's like dominoes—all hell breaks loose with multiple wars.

In summary, this game feels half-baked. It's as if they released it prematurely and are now relying on player feedback to patch it up. Maybe if they fix these issues or at least make the AI mechanics transparent, it could be worth a look. But as it stands, I'd say hold off on spending your cash on this one.

The spy mechanic can at least be toned down in the campaign options, which can make enemy spies basically a non-issue.

Awesome game. I was initially shocked by the price and the reviews but after getting the game I can say, it is worth it.

If you care for Grand Strategy games but you don't want to see chess pieces jumping from province to province and instead you want to see armies move and you can stop or change direction within the province this game is a must have. This is the best mixture of RTS and TBS Grand Strategies out there. Sovereign is better and more challenging compared with the first game.

Now we realize why they didn't let people in the beta, only a few special people, they said on discord, and now we have the results of those beta testers.

Then another important point was the fact that they didn't show much about pitched battles and castle towns in detail, that's why they always partially hid that from the community either in streams or videos, because they knew that their quality was very poor even if it's not the most important part of the game, but this for me is just an excuse, because if the battles are not the focus, why promote the game with this feature.

The performance in battles are not the best and its caused from an option in game, so,  for a better experience and possible lag fix, turn this option off completely (The SSRT option), if the setting it on “high” causes severe frame rate drops, especially on 4K monitors.

But as for the quality of the graphics they are not immersive, captivating, the detail simply does not exist, even on the full map I think that although acceptable, it does not have the detail that it should have for a 2022 game. Just to give you an idea, even the arrow trail is bad, and it hasn't even improved since it was shown in one of the streams.

Just look at how excellent KOH1's 2D graphics are, whether on the battle ground or on the general map, compared to this 3D that doesn't even offer us detail, whether in the detail of cities\castles\villages\mines\churches etc on the general map, already not to mention the bad graphics of the units in battle and the territory where the battle takes place, it's a disaster in all directions and not satisfying for the player at all.

When it comes to the general map, the mechanics are interesting and well implemented. As for the number of people in the court, it should have at least an expansion adequate to the size of the kingdom, being able to have at least more nobles, I think that the system of construction\development of the province is positive, having to specialize\improve to the resources that are placed there to better obtain wealth.

One thing that intrigues me is that in 2022 we don't have an interface that is possible to adjust the scale, font size, among other things, as for the battle interface, it's horrible and not at all intuitive like the one in the 1st knights of honor. Once again, as far as battles are concerned, little or nothing has been improved as it should have been. Give players options to move, change the scale\size of the windows, and we will thank you in the end.

The music is not as striking as the first, but it is still positive. When it comes to the different cultures, the army region units and even the buildings, there don't seem to be big differences, which makes playing again a little boring, because the more unique they were, the more we liked them.

There is no day\night cycle, we don't have seasons, more events, catastrophic events in the world. The scale of cities\castles is not well suited to the size of armies we have, because with units so small to emphasize the size of the city\castle, which does not make defending or attacking them and other things immersive and fun. As for the price of the game, it is excessive for what it offers us at the moment, and on top of that with poor performance and little depth in some sectors of the game.

As for multiplayer, you must have realized that even co-op is not possible with RTS battles, as this should at least be a possibility. I would like to be more positive about this game because it is one of my favorites and above all it combines what many of us have wanted for years and that until today has not been done with dignity, because it addresses everything in a simple way what can be expected from a medieval game, but everything will now depend on the reaction of the developers, if they want the game to be a really great successor to the 1st Knights Of Honor or not.

Here are some ideas that can improve the game:
- Improved textures (Free dlc) (or as an option for those with a better system), better animations, better effects, detailed units, buildings, and even noble avatars.
- More variety of units for all nations\kingdoms, or by region. (Here is an example, Templars of the Order of Santiago in Compostella, Spain, in this case, if we had a very positive relationship with the church\religion or even the construction of a building that would allow us to recruit this unit in this region.
- More events related to famine, pests\diseases, world catastrophes and so on.
- Incorporate day/night cycle, seasons, create a living world, even more immersive.
- More events related to the different classes of nobles and court.
- More possibilities to increase the number of nobles depending on the size of the kingdom.
- Completely remove capture points (freedom is everything).
- Increase a bit more the number of squads, either in the creation of an army whether by a nobleman, marshal, king, or even city\castle garrison, or at least more options to increase them through other features.
- Interface (UI) has to improve alot especially in RTS battles, enable UI configuration on the battlefield, such as adjusting size, hiding certain information, basically improving the visual aspect of the battle, as the objective is to have a small UI with as much information as possible, so that there is a better focus on the battle.
- Pitched battle terrains, more realistic, tactical, taking into account elevations\weather\forests\mud\rain\snow, all aspects that can change the outcome of a battle.
- Cities\Castles more adapted to the number of squads, as a big city\castle ""full of nothing"" does not bring immersion.
- Possibility of creating defenses when on battlefields.
- When 2 marshals of the same army are already in battle, find a way to put the 3rd, 4th army in a position of reinforcement.
- Add banner for units, (officers and sergeants and others).
- Add blood in battles, or at least make it possible in the settings to enable/disable this feature for anyone who wants to use it.
- Improve the Battlegrounds in all aspects, even the soldiers' camps\tents.
- Hard to believe, but it would be fantastic to see more unique castles\cities, the best they can be.
- Regarding Castles in a province, why not really make them a garrison and have the chance to build defenses there and even defend them in battle, as they are important points in a kingdom, otherwise they would not be built, being able to build 4 types of defenses in them, like a wall, ditch, or other things related with the province or region they are, thus making them a 2nd defense barrier.
- Maybe I'm wrong, but I think that regarding the design\size of the castle itself they are not that good, in the 1st KOH, placing units in the castle itself was strategically very interesting, fun, and even in a difficult situation, where you have to retreat for him as being the last defense barrier, the castle itself, here in KOH2 this seems almost non-existent, and very bad.

In the end, the big reality is that right now we don't have much choice for medieval games, and many of us expected it to be the game we all hoped for since the state of the total war series is where it is. It's a shame, because this was a great opportunity for this studio. 
- 
After all this time and the patches are insignificant, without any content, just solving some existing problems and making very few adjustments, improvements, when it comes to real-time battles they weren't even interested in improving them, and they continue to be very bad , the future of this game could be really bright but something prevents it from truly being the Knights Of Honor that we all wanted.

1) The Knights. There are 8 of them, and some people don't like that. It takes some getting used to but I'm on board now. Knights of Honor 2 isn't really a map painter. And having a small number of armies makes the engagements more meaningful, there's a real sense of attrition when you lose a battle or a city. It also makes econ matter more - it's still worth conquering cities to get levy income, because when there are limited armies whoever can recruit or replenish fastest wins.

2) Build system. There's a good number of generic buildings for each city, and then random resource based buildings as well. Most buildings can then be upgraded, the upgrades giving various incomes and bonuses. There are enough building types to somewhat specialise your cities and plenty to build into the late game. 

3) Economics. The way trade interacts with Merchants is really cool. Over time they can become insanely profitable. But you don't need them to establish trade agreements for a little passive income. Otherwise, goods are produced from resources - to build a building upgrade that needs iron, for example, your kingdom needs to have the iron resource somewhere. It's an interesting system and does add a strategic element to the map, and city building.

4) Real time campaign, free movement. Now that I've actually experienced it, real time campaign with free movement is definitely the best for grand strategy. That with the added element of limited armies really makes position and timing important. 

Overall it's a great game, I think I'll get a lot of hours out of it. It's a unique take, deeper than you think. The battles are also probably better than you think, so far the AI is not braindead, that also goes for the campaign. 

Devs seem active, I hope we get more content, systems, etc. Would be worth testing the waters with a moderately priced DLC.",1700378877,1700492915,True,1,0,0.309178769588470459,0,True,False,False

- these events called ""popular rebellions"" can really mess up your game. even if it happens for your faction, it still takes a very long time for it to complete.
- leading battles has clunky animations. I don't know if I'm not doing it right, but controlling units manually is always inferior to just letting it complete via the auto battle.

This game is so close to being a great game. It's just the little things that need changing/updating.
First the economy system is good. There are a lot of resources in the game but to make it a great game, the resources need to play a bigger factor. Again, it's a simple fix. Add major bonuses to certain production resources and make sure the AI focuses on attaining these resources either through production or trade. Things like metal/iron. A country which produces its own iron vs a country that doesn't is the difference between fighting with swords and sticks. But if I remember rightly, having iron decreases building costs by 10% in that province.. What? Having iron and not having iron? 10%? This should be a MAJOR buff. And the player and the AI should be desperate to attain these resources. Either though trade, production or conquest. But when I started producing iron, I didn't even remember I had.
A lot of people have already commented on the warfare AI. But I feel this is something which can be improved over time. A lot of big title strategy games have poor AI and take a few updates to get right. Also I really hate that I can replay battles. It's game breaking immersion for me. But this might just be me. But i'd like to see an ironman mode where I can't replay battles.
There's diplomacy which seems pretty good. It can be hard to keep positive relations and countries which hate you can mercilessly gang up on you which is great. The clergy and spies, I haven't really done much with yet, but they seem ok.
Finally the game is beautiful. The graphics are great, yet FPS is a constant high. Some people have moaned about the royal family like marriages etc not being as good as CKIII. But as a player of CKIII, I really don't know what they're complaining about considering all of the other variants you get in this game which you don't in CK. 
Overall, of course I recommend this game. But I read one comment which said this is a good game to play for a few hours, stop, and then come back to it after a while. And I get it. However this game easily has the potential to be one of those games which you play day after day after day. It's just those small fixes where the player cares about and thinks the economy, relations, trade and warfare more than is currently offered to turn it into one of those landmark games. And I really hope it gets there. Because if it does, this will turn into the ultimate, historical strategy game.

People who are familiar with original KoH might find this game kinda nostalgic.. or not. There are some aspects which are faithful to the original game, but some are changed/tweaked, for the best or the worst.

User interface aspect
Many icons are too small to identify. Building and natural landscape icons lack the contrast like what they got in the original KoH. The UI is overall too small for me and there's no option to make them bigger. Considering this is not a fast paced game (with pauses etc), it should have an option for a bigger UI. Kingdoms coat of arms blurred in some places for unknown reason. The kingdom advantages isn't as wonderful as it was in the predecessor game (now it feels like just another screen). Nobility icons are more diverse, but lacks the expression of the original game. The UI feels more grim and darker compared to the soothing, parchment styled, bright original UI.

Graphic aspect
I run the game on a potato so I have to downgrade the setting. Personally a fan of orthographic 2 dimensional art of the original game, so this one doesn't really entice me.

Program aspect
Lag a lot, crash a lot just like its predecessor. Always activate the autosave for safety reasons.

Musical aspect
I am personally a big fan of the original/predecessor game music, which I find timeless and soothing. This one.. not so. The music is overall quite bland. Some are good, but not as catchy as the original game's music. Should have a mod changing it for the original soundtrack.

Cinematic aspect
No cinematic in KoH2, unlike in KoH1.

Gameplay aspect
Fundamental gameplay is similar to original KoH, but with some tweaks/changes which players need to learn by doing. There are now only 5 knight classes. Marshall, cleric, merchant, and spy are basically the same. No more builder and landowner, but now there is a diplomat. 
The royal family changed a lot. Especially now player can't assign a king/prince to be any kind of knight class, but they are predefined when they are born. 
The espionage system is very different. In the original game, you wait your spy to be assigned as a marshall/cleric/spy/etc in your target then do the action (rebel, gives the city, gives the throne, change religion, assassin the king etc). Now, the espionage is indirect. 
Clerics is now more useful and fun to use with pilgrimage mechanism.
There are much more newsletters akin to EU series due to such changes.
There are more religions in the game but I'll need to play more to understand each of them. So far as I know Islam is now divided into Sunni and Shia. Instead of being able to call for Jihad directly, a Sunni kingdom should claim for caliphate first. The Jihad seems changed but I haven't explored further.
The Papacy is now a real papacy with cardinals instead of a normal kingdom ""royal family"" mechanism. Sadly the game devs are yet to apply different ""royal family"" mechanism for some nations: i.e. Venetian and Genoese republican system (maybe no royal family but any knights can succeed the ruler), Teutonic Order and Livonian Order monastic system, etc.
There's certainly no heresy mechanism or Antipapal mechanism for Catholic kingdoms and that's such a missed opportunity to tweak Catholic gameplay. Because both heresy and antipapacy are big issues/things in the medieval age.
Crusades work just like the original game with weird ""bugs"" of crusading a province producing a non Catholic nation or producing a non Catholic ruler. There are instances that a crusader kingdom retains being Islam, or being Catholic with a ruler titled Emir NNN. 
Town building is different than the original game with some changes I find likeable and unlikeable. Now upgrading a building in one town will apply the effect to the whole kingdom. Defensive structure is now relinquished to just a button, which is a shame because I liked original game's castle imaginative building.

Direct battle gameplay aspect
Haven't played direct battle due to potato.

Conclusion so far:
Worth trying for new players or nostalgic players. It's kinda expensive if bought without promo. Is it really great? I doubt it, but it is quite an experience.",1698954657,1698954925,True,12,1,0.633586585521697998,0,True,False,False

The three ways I think this game could be better:
1) Make it easier to have royal marriages - it's really annoying when your King dies without heirs / you only have daughters who are unable to take the throne. I'd like to be able to have a daughter as heir, it could pair well with a stability hit to the Kingdom.
2) Knights don't age. You have the same knights from the start to the end of the game.
3) I want to be able to drop skill sets and take new ones up for knights and rulers. If I miss click then I'm locked in on a skill that might be useless.",1698928863,1698928863,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

BUT you can`t tell me, that from all the developers in Black Sea or THQ Nordic, or the QA, or the game testers  NO ONE saw the multiplayer crashes! Maybe they were pushed by deadlines and they hoped for the best? (equivalent to Cyberpunk 2077?)

Man just install the game and try to play one multiplayer game and tell me if you got dropped out on the 5th or 15 min.
At this stage, the game is UNPLAYABLE in multiplayer and until the crashes are fixed I just can`t recommend the game to single soul (as much, as I would love to).",1679948815,1698883142,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Overall: It's promising, as long as it receive some big updates. There are some glaring weak points that need to be fleshed out.

1) Vassals. This needs a re-work. It's very weak. No military vision or control, poor diplomatic options. It should be worked into the Diplomacy and Trade knights with actions to improve and dominate. There should be ways to assimilate as well. Not to mention more political  opportunities with spys

2) Trade of resources doesn't work properly. Importing in goods does not fill that good's need for building purposes. defeats the whoe purpose of trade and forces the player to take large land to fill ""goods"" gap. 

3) Economy doesn't really exist, there is no supply/demand for goods, there is no real impact. It's simple like Civ games. Which is fine, but I feel it's a missed opportunity and a great way to build out the game.

4) Tactical wars: could use some User interface updates. I recommend playing total war and R&D it. Simple things like, seeing formation destinations on the map, this is key to knowing where troops are going. Otherwise its fun.",1698848882,1698848882,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The short answer is no...but to be honest that wasn't unexpected.

But after trying a new run and still not understanding certain mechanics because of said mechanics being poorly explained or not explained at all, i'm just not having fun any more.

I really tried to like this game. and on the surface it is a fun game. I actually did enjoy my first very failed run and thought id give it a second try and see what i did wrong. But its incredibly hard to know what youre doing wrong when the game lacks information on what that wrong is.

In my case for example, im very frustrated and irritated and the stability and loyalty mechanics in this game. They just really dont make sense in comparison to something like CK3. In CK3 if a province has instability issues i have plenty of tools to tell me exactly why thats the case and how i can fix it. In this game, if i have stability issues i get one place to look at it, and that place tells me literally like 2 reasons for why my stability is low but then doesnt give me tool tips on how im supposed to fix those things causing my low stability.

Which leads into my next example which is incredibly frustrating which is loyalty. One reason for stability issues, and a rather large portion of it is loyalty. And when you look up the key word loyalty in the games version of encyclopedia it literally just says something to the effect that theres not much you can do to influence it. Like why? why even throw it in as a mechanic if theres not a thing you can do about it. At that point its just a major incovenience. 

Im literally there in my first game completely stumped as to why both my provinces suddenly flipped to loyal to castile and what caused the disloyalty in the first place. So i play another game and im just sitting there watching as my 2 provinces by 12 minutes in are at 82% and 90% loyal to me with absolutely zero explanation anywhere as to why and continues to fall. 

I'm sorry but thats just a poor game design having a mechanic that is barely explained. Loyalty is a huge issue that affects your stability, i feel like if thats the case there should be detailed explanation somewhere to tell you why its just randomly falling and how the hell youre even supposed raise it back up.

I really did try and wanted to like and enjoy this game but when you have important mechanics like this and theyre just vaugely explained, or not explained at all, its just not fun. Its not fun to try and understand a game and its mechanics but the devs dont even give you the tools to understand the most important ones.

Perhaps if someone one day does a youtube video on how loyalty works id give this game a positive review again. But id honestly rather just play CK3 where everything is explained correctly if im gonna play a medival grand strategy game.

If this kind of stuff doesnt bother you its a good game honestly but i personally just dont find it fun to play a game where im not taught important mechanics that i feel i need to understand. And until they implement something in game to explain loyalty better i dont see myself coming back to this game. Maybe this is a huge nit pick but it just seems important stuff to know and when i have nothing telling me about it and its negatively impacting my gameplay i dont see how thats supposed to be entertaining or fun.

Original review:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Played 2 hours of my first game. 

I started out as the kingdom of aragon in whats now spain. Had a few people neighboring me that i guess i had some tension with but my kinsmen in Castile were pretty happy with me. Some duche to my north was also happy with me while his neighbor hated my guts. I had barcelona to my east who didnt trust me and some arabs to my south who my brother in law started at war with but they seemed to like me just fine for some reason.

So there i was minding my own business. Just building buildings and establishing trade routes. And all of a sudden my brother in law says ""hey bro, we'll give you a non agression pact if you attack the arabs we are at war with"". Even being friends with them i thought this sounded like a great plan. A defensive pact plus i could grab the land just south of me if i was lucky.

And then it all went to shit. After i agree to join my brother in laws war against the arabs he instantly sends me a message telling me how pissed he was i declared war on people i was freinds with, even though he literally just made a deal with me to go to war with them. and all my immediate neighbors also got pissed at me for this. So i think to myself ""oh well ill just grab the land i want and sue for peace"".

Didnt work that way at all. Before i knew it one of my provinces changed its loyalty to my brother in law for seemingly no reason and my other province did the same shortly after. Game never tells me why but for some reason my cities just decide to become disloyal, their stability goes from positive to right down the shitter, so i have no choice but to end the war almost as soon as it started. 

And even then my stability and loyalty was just decreasing for seemingly no good reason at a rapid rate. And i have no way to improve it as far as i can tell. 

Next thing i know the guys i literally just called for peace with break the truce and i also get declared war on by 3 other people. Stability is still falling along with my peoples loyalty.

Pretty much gg. And to top it off my wife is ugly af.

10/10 will play this game again just to get boned by my neighbors and friends and mechanics that arent well explained lol",1697502929,1697515554,False,1,1,0.516129076480865479,2,True,False,False

It starts out well; you expand territory, appoint knights, build armies... the grand strategy layer is about a 5/10 vs Crusader Kings, but it does have real time battles. And those battles are maybe 5-6/10 vs Total War.  The problem is over time that means you're left with 2 rather unsatisfying experiences.  The campaign map really stalls out as you acquire more territory, the hard cap of 9 'governors' and crippling income penalties for non-governed provinces, means that your income and manpower is barely impacted by holding 10 vs 110 territories - so why bother. The 'goods and resources' system is interesting to start with, but quickly just becomes 'press button to get +2 gold' - building a marble sculptor feels identical to an artisan raisin press, with about the same outcome. The battles meanwhile just feel dated - closer to a mobile game than a real PC RTS. 

Overall, if you want a grand strategy experience, stick with CK3. If you want real time battles, stick with TW.  This tries to straddle both and ends up falling down the gap.",1697300066,1697300066,False,171,1,0.829322099685668945,0,True,False,False

KoH is a game that is partially real-time and partially turn-based. What I mean by this is that the real-time economics is a slow build. When entering battle, the real-time strategy takes place like the Total War games, but a bit more simpler while the economic side pauses. Where the game really shines is the diplomacy actions where you can purely take over nations with diplomacy alone, if you're smart enough. The maps are absolutely massive and there are many ways to go about conquering. You really feel like you have think through which countries to ally with, and which ones to focus on attacking.

With its vibrant descriptions and features list, I anticipated diving into a rich, immersive world echoing the brilliance of grand strategy giants like the Total War series, Crusader Kings, or even Civilization. Alas, the reality was somewhat different.

Pros:

1) [b] Accessible: [/b] As promised, this game truly is a gateway to the grand strategy genre. For newcomers, it's a great introduction without the usual overwhelming mechanics.
2) [b] Royal Court: [/b] The idea of appointing various officials to exert your will is quite engaging.
3) [b] RTS Battles:  [/b] For those who love to lead armies directly, this game offers some satisfying moments of combat.

Cons:

1) [b] Lack of Depth:  [/b] One of the game's major downsides. While it begins fun, it quickly becomes evident that the game lacks the intricacies found in other RTS games. Your royal family feels somewhat bland, lacking unique personalities and depth in skills.
2) [b] Pacing Issues:  [/b] After the initial hours, I found myself amassing wealth too easily, which made victory more about buying success rather than strategic brilliance.
3) [b] Gameplay Speed:  [/b] Waiting several minutes for a campaign map battle to resolve feels like a lifetime. While I appreciate the intent to reflect the passage of time, the implementation seems to drag the experience. 
4) [b] Unruly Mercenaries:  [/b] The inability to control mercenaries feels like a missed opportunity, leading to unintended diplomatic issues and sometimes frustrating gameplay.
5) [b] Notification Overload:  [/b] Receiving a barrage of notifications is overwhelming. A filtering system akin to Outlook would be a game-changer.
6) [b] Uniform Kingdoms:  [/b] The kingdoms lack unique traits, making the choice of your starting kingdom feel inconsequential.

While the concept is brilliant and the game offers some entertaining moments, Knights of Honor II: Sovereign feels like it's still in its embryonic stage, especially when compared to its competitors. It might've been more suitable as a mobile game rather than a PC title.

Final Verdict: At its current price point, I feel it doesn't offer enough value. My recommendation? Hold off until it drops to around $14.99. If you're looking for depth and complexity, you might want to set your sights elsewhere.",1694543138,1694543138,False,4,0,0.536423861980438232,0,True,False,False

The game's straightforward mechanics make it easy to pick up, and the blend of simplicity and depth keeps it engaging. While the grand campaign and 4X gameplay shine, RTS-style battles can feel clunky.

Early/mid/late starting points may seem odd, with underdeveloped cities in 1360 and early access to advanced units. Troop options need further refinement and localization.

Random resource generation can be frustrating; a more historically accurate approach would be preferable. Additional knight and building slots, along with upgrades, would enhance the experience.

The game isn't perfect or stunning, but it is a very solid strategy offering lots of fun and some interesting mechanics. If you cannot manage Medieval 3 craving, the Knights of Honor 2 will definitely sooth your pain. I hope the developers would continue this series further - through later eras.

Pros:
1. The Game really feels like a big vibrant world.
2. Global mechanics are very decent - diplomacy, espionage, warfare, trade, finance, culture, religion - all are there, make sense and work fine.
3. The game is not a story of some imba units killing everything quickly and conquering all the provinces using one game hack or exploit. You will have to rule your kingdom, find your balance and watch all those minor details while keeping a big goal in mind.
4. Global diplomacy has some flaws, but it is very logical and well-balanced and certainly superior to many other 4x strategies. You will have to think much about the consequences and check the relations among your neighbors quite a lot. 
5. The game offers you choices and tools to shape the world as you wish.
6. AI doesn't cheat - you can calculate the outcome of global events, you can drive hostile AI kingdoms into crisis through religion, espionage, warfare, finance, food stocks sabotage and etc. Here you can plan and strategize. 
7. The game conventions might seem a bit irritating, but they hold all the mechanics well together and make the game a bit chess-like. 

Cons:
1. Graphics leaves much to be desired. Don`t get me wrong - it`s Ok, but really needs to be improved.
2. Tactical battles are mediocre. I think the devs should have abandoned those at all. The global part of the game is so engaging that tactics is not necessary at all. Probably it would be a good idea to just improve the general battle window (make it a bit more spectacular) and that would be it.
3. User Interface needs some improvements. UI is not too irritating, but it really needs to be made more ergonomic.",1693950756,1693950756,True,6,0,0.579003334045410156,0,True,False,False

I played first one for many hours and one thing that annoyed me the most was that I could have only 7-8 marshals.
That didn't change. :D

So if you want to conquer whole Europe, you will have to do it steadily, cuz you will need marshals all over the map, but you simply can't have many marshals.

Once you have built all buildings that could be built in a game, and when you have all slots filled with marshals, game starts repeating itself.
You just go around, declaring wars, taking new territories, healing armies and that's it.

But you will have fun exploring the game, all of it's possibilities, until you get to that point.
I needed like 15h to conquer whole Balkan and central Europe.
Have every building built (except one for camels, I need some territory in Africa).

Now you only take care of successor, so your Kingdom doesn't go berserk and watch out for spies.
The rest is, heal army, send it to conquer new province, heal them and send them again.

If you like strategy, medieval times, honor, diplomacy, this is a MUST game.

Furthermore, this game has some countries that are rare to find in games.
And they did a good thing exploring different cultures, lord names and stuff like that.

So for example, I took Serbia and one time I had a Priest that had a name like my real name. And I had a lord one time with my brothers name. So that was awesome as well.",1693390783,1693390783,True,2,0,0.522033929824829102,0,True,False,False

What was fresh in early 2000s now feels very stale, and the 3D art style feels dated and isn't particularly flattering.

The tactical battles are a pain to play, from awkward unit pathing and bad AI to slow/un-maneuverable camera. I want to emphasize the AI is particularly brain dead and will happily suicide its generals into your units, even if it's winning or defending a castle. The only interesting mechanic is the confidence modifiers.

The overworld map is oddly random and generic. I don't think it even shows what year it is? Navigating the building trees and all the resource tiers is tedious, and I say this as someone who likes spreadsheet traders like Patrician 3. My faction's king characters were blank and unremarkable. Diplomacy with neighbors is ""whack-a-mole"" style where they'll attack you even though they're weaker. Then you capture cities and make peace. Then they attack you again, you capture cities and make peace. Etc.

So you'll find yourself many times scrambling to send your army across your land only to have another country (That you weren't aware was even a threat) declare war, and is now sieging your castle, on the other side of your land!

KOH1 is a game I really do love and so is this one.  But, it is more of a modern updating and less of a true sequel.   Although, the devs did make a ton of improvements.  Prisoners not taking up knight slots was HUGE.   Improved modding also makes it worth it.  The simplicity in mechanics make the game easy to pickup and easy to restart again.   The subtle weirdness and surprising complication makes the game fun.  I do find my enjoyment in the grand campaign and 4X game play.  Being able to play top-down RTS style battles is nice but the system has always been clunky, and I usually only play battles when they need the attention, an interesting scenario arises, or just to change the pace on occasion.  

The early/middle/late starts seem almost more bizarre then the first game.   To start late (1360) and have these big cities with nothing and developing simple bowmen and light spearmen seem a bit silly.    At the same time, having Halberdiers early felt wrong too.  I am glad to see they have made some updates to the special units and their time periods.   I think the troop options could use some further improving, localizing and expanding still.    In some ways the first game was better.   The random resource generation can drive me insane as well.  I wish there was a setting to have some fixed historical resources in certain regions that were well known for them.  (Glass in Venice,  sheep pastures thru most of England, Limestone in Caen, Gold in Slovakia  etc) as well as more basic resources that do not have strict requirements being more widely spread (salt on any coast,  herbs almost anywhere you can grow, minerals more common).  It makes sense for things like gold, silver, lodestone, warm water ports, and good pastures for sheep, etc to be the limiting factors.  Having mountainous areas almost seems like a curse the way its configured now.    Similarly, famous castles could be fixed on the map ensuring certain regions have atleast one.    More knight slots and more building slots would make the game better for me too, but mods can do these things.  While they took a few steps forward with the building management with upgrades, they might have also took a step back with some of the choices.  

I cannot really fault this game for what it is.   Reviving and correcting KOH1 was a great idea.   

----------------

So as more of a note to devs and less a critique....
I would like to see the devs take the game and make a 3rd version with more.  More of everything.   More historical accuracy.   Some areas divided into more regions.  Some famous buildings.  A bit of a sense of time and technology advancement would be nice for this style of game while you might play for many generations.    A bit more advanced diplomacy and family management.   A bit of realism about the royal court and perhaps a division between a marshal and a general.   A bit more realism about the requirements it takes to make simple troops.    6-10K gold cost buildings to make longbowmen to have advanced heavy armors kinda takes away part of what made them great and prevelent.    But an advanced bowyer tech would make sense.   While a heavy retinue troop version requiring more buildings and researches would give you something to strive for.    Possibly having some customization or building limitations based on the settlements and the ability to add 1 or 2 to a province  would give the late game more value.   Possibly some recruitment mechanics like levy systems and city militias. The concepts are here, but they almost hidden.  I am not suggesting CK3 level of realm management, but borrowing some of the modern elements and developments that games like CK3 and TW have could make this game feel less like a 2005 game with semi modern graphics.   I think there is room in this genre for a game with some of those advanced kingdom management elements but more focus on the military.  The troops, armies and battles is a place CK3 is weaker in many ways in my mind but with certainty if only for their lack of RTS style battle control.     I would look forward to and buy KOH3 if it grew into something more modern with advanced game play while also working its way toward more realism and historical accuracy.   But I would still recommend KOH2 for what it is, especially to fans of the original game.

As others have pointed out, it blends a bit of Crusader Kings flavor with lineage management and diplomacy/spying, Total War for the RTS battles, on top of a nice trade and economic simulation. All of it is on the 'lite' side but the mix makes for a easy to play game, but with some depths to it.

However, after 2 completed campaigns (one for Emperor of the world and another one aimed at economic victory) and multiple tests in different location, I have no real incentive to try it again due to the sameyness of the playthroughs.

It doesn't matter if you play Ireland, Spain or a random Middle East Kingdom, all of them play somewhat the same, which is really a bummer. Buildings, diplomatic choices and events are almost identical, except for the religion related stuff (crusades, Califates and so on) but it doesn't bring enough variety from one playthrough to the other.

Still, I give a positive review as I loved the experience and the basis is fantastic, very polished (no bugs or crash in 25 hours), with a really great UI, good enoughs graphics and excellent sound design. 

However, it screams for DLC/gameplay variety and I really hope the game sold enough to allow the devs to expand on it (Diplomacy, regional/cultural buildings and troops, additional mechanics, mission trees... there's a lot to explore).

This is the game that I and many other RTS/Grand Strategy fans have been dreaming of for years. It looks like a mobile game in the trailers, but KoHII is the real deal. Think Medieval Total War mixed with Crusader Kings.

It's easy enough to play casually without getting frustrated, but still offers more than enough challenge for those who want it. The tactical battles may be a bit less detailed than Total War players are used to, but the AI does seem to provide a consistent challenge without feeling unfair. Occasionally it will even surprise you with its tactical genius. 

Perhaps most importantly, the game has a strong soundtrack and powerful voice acting, which combine to make a comfortable and invigorating atmosphere. This game has the ability to tell grand strategy stories in a way that avoids the sometimes exhausting slog and complexity of Paradox games, while offering much more dynamic diplomatic and political systems compared to the total war games.

In a way, it's an in-between, capturing the best of both worlds. At the same time, it's neither a Paradox game nor a Total War title. Knights of Honor is its own thing, and makes some radically different choices to those games, not all of which pan out. 

All in all, this is the game I have spent years looking for. 10/10 at time of writing, and it's not likely to change.",1690214390,1690214390,True,1,0,0.499862253665924072,0,True,False,False

After a while it does turn into a grind, and overly simple for taking over cities.  But it was still a fun game that kept me coming back.

So when KOH2 came out, I asked in the forums ""how different is this from KOH1?"" and I learned it was very similar.  So for many months I did not bother.  Why should I risk being disappointed when I was already quite happy with the first game?  Also the first game has Peter Marinker doing the voice acting, who is impossible to beat.

But I finally risked it.  Maybe it was on sale (and only a tiny sale if any) - I really don't remember.  Something drove me to finally take the plunge and try this out.

It was well worth it.  The game is still just as weird.  I still have not wrapped my head around all of it.  But what stands out after 3 hours of playing - it is similar enough to KOH1 to be familiar and to provide a good sense of direction, and the places where it differs remove some of the confusion the old game provided.  There are supply chains that buildings provide their components for which lead to access of buildings and units, and they will be color coded whether or not you have created access to those components yet or not.

So far I have only started to play 1 game, and it was with maybe the most difficult country: the island of Sardinia.  Rather than just forming a rudimentary army out of the gate, I built up my economy first, worried that I wouldn't have enough backbone to support a campaign.  Next I targeted creating an army of heavy archers, which for KOH1 has worked very well for me (although technically they are crossbowmen in KOH1).  This turned out to be a dismal strategy and I find myself back at square one, wondering how to pull off this challenge.  Now if you know the answer, please don't spoil it for me!  I'd like to figure it out myself.

Even though I haven't won, or even come close, this exercise provided me with enough of an introduction to the game's mechanisms to convince me I will prefer playing it over KOH1.  The game-play has deepened in the right places.  There are still mysteries I need to get to the bottom of, such as ""how do I increase my kingdom power""?  Well I've seen my kingdom power go down, so I have some ideas, and it's not nearly as simple as it was for KOH1.  These kinds of details keep me coming back for more.

I tend to imagine this might not be for everyone.  KOH1 might be a better entry-point into the genre, but I can only speak for myself, and others seems to have done fine never having played KOH1.  I don't think 2 hours will (unfortunately) be enough to get a very deep dive into the game if you are worried about getting a refund.  If that's a concern, try playing an easier country to start with, or doing the tutorial - but I imagine the full tutorial will easily take longer than 2 hours.

As someone who has put 1000s of hours into the Paradox games, this is a breath of fresh air kind of strategy game. It incorporates things from CK3, total war, even stellaris and eu4, and it works really well, and there are a bunch of fun looking achievements to get. 

Is it a perfect game? No. It is quite a steep learning curve initially, there's a lot you aren't told about. In some areas it would be nice to have more info about what is going on. The real time battles aren't amazing to play like the level the modern total war games are, however i'd say its on par with Medieval 2 total war's real time battles, maybe slightly better. The real time battles are still good, just not great, but tbh that's fine by me as a lot of the time I let my knights do the battles themselves, and from what I've found the auto-resolve for battles is good.
Only other minor criticism I have is that when I first got the game, I had issues changing my resolution, as the game would repeatedly ignore what I'd said and would revert back to default. I did manage to solve the issue by forcing the resolution on steam before launching.

All in all I'd say a 7 or 8 out of 10, and the game is getting new content, so I believe it'll get better still.",1690018394,1690018394,True,1,0,0.496223241090774536,0,True,False,False

I have only played for 30 hours, but these have been the best hours I had in a game in years. I cannot stress how good every mechanic is in this game and how it plays into the game to make your game the best experience you can have on the market, so I gonna talk about my only campaign so far.

I have picked the Templar Order since I really like their armor on white cloth with steel and a dark cross in the chest area, but that is beside the point. In the early game, I used the peasant armies to fight as many enemies as possible, since I had many, Denmark, Sweden for the most part in the early game but soon my eastern allies backstabbed me when a third coalition between five Scandinavian factions attacked me for genociding their people. I think this was the hardest part of my game as I had to make due with two front lines and almost constant war, losing my trade partners and having to rebuild trade networks to full export. I was having to time it accordingly so I may finish at times four separate wars in order to remove some war attrition, needless to say, my war attrition was bad, -86 stability at one point and the game forced me to use all the mechanics to the fullest at that time. I had to make sure that I optimize my army pool and recruitment to the maximum extent, use peasant militia once my professional was wiped when a third front was open, hire mercenaries to quell the rebellion but at long last I had won, expanded my borders in each side and freeing some rebels to please my peasant population. 

Now I do believe that having a diplomat could have helped me get rid of one of those fronts, but I was just starting the game and didnt know better, that and being at war constantly in the early game can be very lucrative by raiding your enemies and having so many fronts open meant that my Marshals were more profitable than my merchants in that period, which allowed me to develop many of my provinces and maintain a professional army all the time.

The province mechanic is the best I had in any RTS of this type ever, you re limited to 8 Knights that will govern your provinces, or 9 if you count the king too and this limit is obviously present to anyone with a shred of brain in their head and that is balance, so you or any nation does not snowball too much and in the name of balance too, no more than two armies will fight in an engagement so you or the AI wont overstack four of five armies in order to win. This is especially helpful if you play as small nation that cannot muster more two armies due to having a bad economy. Provinces have resources and those resources will help your trade by exporting more, unlocking other tech if combined with other resources and at times make even more resources. If you prioritize on the map with who you make war in order to get specific tech related resources such as, needing gold, silver and rubies to make jewels means that you might want to wage a war for a province that has the resources that you lack to make those goods. Gathering certain types of resources or unlocking them by crafting them in your domain or by importing them from another kingdom will unlock you some bonuses as to reward your expansion and not make it completely useless in response to the limited knight limit.

I would go further into detail with the game, and depth of every structure and how it impacts the game. But overall, the gameplay is so well polished that I feel sorry for buying this game on sale as it deserves a full price purchase.",1689835142,1690007137,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Many things i loved were:
1.the culture management and loyalty mechanics ,
2.the indepentence of new nations (rather than just rebels faction like in TW)
3.many things like diplomacy is as they should be..there is no backstabing senselsessly like TW
4.the map view is awesome
5.finally you can have some abilities in knights and characters, no just traits
6. the depth is nice but sometimes just makes you dont know what to do next no upkeep no anything
7. the problem solving and the management of many resources

why i still like Medieval 2TW better:
1. the real time on the campaign map is stupid because you wait the army to go to where you point to nonetheless so better stay in turn based in the main map, also it confuses the AI if you maneuvering your army here and there and the battle is never fought because of trolling your enemy
2. why you dont created ships and suddenly the army is turned to ship in the 1st place...this is removing many potentials in the whole strategy you would have created,also animations of naval trade was great and ports give you many wealth in TW
3. the real time battle is not even near the battles in TW
4. i would like to have total management of the town defenders and generaly of the town as whole
5. no tax management and happiness drops due to them and you cant do anything about that
6. no more than 9 knights ....why you cant hire more where is the logic in that???
7. the idea of the siege mechanics are ok , the supplies drop make sense but there is no creation of siege equipment like in TW per turn(s) in order to can get into battle ...you have to drop the resilience of the defender below 50%....aaaaand??? if they are behind walls you cant crosss where is the logic???why should you wait when you have siege equipment
8. only 2 generals and their armies can join forces.......WHYYYY????? also why only 4 slots in generals for siege equipment, supply carts etc...???
9. the Pope mechanics is better in TW, the voting , if your cardinals are good enough to become pope, the excommunication etc...
10. no historical Events ,no plague, no mongols, no timurids and no america
11. the expansion of town/castle has more sense in TW first you upgrade the whole to the next level and then you can build more
12. the economy management is stupid(because you cant deploy more merchants, no trade agreement has meaning)...everything is waaaaay too expensive
13. why you cannot find a queen in your ENTIRE  kingdom and the king must marry a foreign one?there are no girls anywhere????

Almost 20 years since the original, they have only managed to cobble together a re-creation of a unique RTS from the early 2000's. 
I love what this game tries to do just as much as I did when they released it 20 years ago. Truly, with the lack of changes or new mechanics they would have been better off just doing an HD release of the original.
I see they are still making updates to the game, but so much of this game is just a worse interpretation than the original game and if you played the 1st it can feel jarring. 
Why can the AI counter-offer, but I can't? 
Why do 2 stacks of peasants beat 1 stack of forces that take 3x the resources to maintain? 
Why are there fewer siege defense options than the original?

Send him to different countries to see if he gets a bribe spy mission. That lets you know who a sneaky little worm is.

The game could use a little more depth. There are a lot of secret mechanics you figure out along the way that arent explained anywhere that makes the game that much better. using a Wikipedia and watching youtube videos only show you the basics of the depth of what is going on in the game. Only a veteran would understand what i mean here.

There is about 20 different ways you can play the game. So after 6-7 games I'm guessing the game loses its playability. 

i've played about 400 games and this one may be lacking in some elements. But, on the bright side the things it does right. It outshines the others on a scale that has made it well worth the money invested. 20$ unlike everything else out right now that wants you to pin your wallet open.

7/10 is what i'd give knights of honor 2. Most games like Cod, Battle field, Eve online, warzone, path of exile, forge of empires, and most anything out that i've played recently. Have little to no depth or replayability. Diablo 4 was a complete fail for me as well. The game had no real endgame and was just a walk in and spam 1 skill to get 1 percent better gear after 30 hours feel.  I'd give them a solid 4-5/10 rating. you can play those game for about 10-60 hours and they just become a funless grind. It's surely no runescape which a person can sink 1000 hours into and still have fun.

It's somewhat of a hybrid between Crusader Kings 3 (one of if not the most played game in my library) & Total War (with the total war: warhammer franchise combined probably topping CK3 on my hours played). It's certainly not as good at either of those two games in their respective fields - I mean come on, this game was released 3-4 months ago (at time of writing) total war: warhammer counting all three games has had like 10 years of continuous development & CK3 counting just CK2 has had even longer (12 years I think?). So no, this game isn't nearly as good at realm simulation & management as CK3 is, nor is it as good at battle simulation as the total war franchise is. What it does do is it takes those two games and combines them without focusing entirely on one aspect or another.

Also, on top of both some of the intrigue and realm management of CK3, and a more clunky version of total war's battles, this game has a much more interesting economy than either of those other two games. Both CK3 and total war have very simple economies; You get a new settlement and you always built the exact same buildings unless either: (In total war) there is some in-game circumstance that forces you to do otherwise, such as you needing siege weapons yesterday or something, and after that you generally swap back to the norm; Or (In CK3) you got a province in an area with a different terrain in which case you have a slightly different template of the exact same thing to build.

In Knights of Honor 2, you have provinces & settlements, your provinces are where you do all of your development, but they have settlements in them. These settlements can be farms, villages, monasteries (or mosques or whatever), or castles, they can also be coastal or not (which is important). Different buildings give different bonuses to different settlements - for instance a mill will cause your farm settlements to produce more food, so logically you'd build that in a province with a couple farms rather than one surrounded by castles (opportunity costs and all that). Also, these settlements are randomized at the start of every game, adding quite a bit of replayability.

All that to say, the economy & what to build is much more interesting than either of the two games it's generally compared to, and I haven't even touched on the much more rare resources tied to features within provinces, some of which are necessary for certain high-tier buildings, and once you collect a bunch that are tied together (such as ropes, masons, limestone, marble, and work oxen (I think)) you get powerful bonuses (that one specifically was the masonry bonus, causing buildings to cost less & be built faster & whatnot). There are eight of these bonuses with 64 rare resources & if you collect them all, you win the game (there are three victory conditions, the other two are getting elected emperor of the world (by the other great powers), and getting 'elected' emperor of the world (no one can argue with you electing yourself Napoleon style if they're all dead)). 

Then there is also the RPG-esque skills your knights and king can learn, which help out with various tasks depending on the skill & class of the person being given it. Once you hit max level (3) with one of these skills, you can adopt it as a tradition (which is quite expensive). This means you get a kingdom-wide bonus, everyone with the skill maxed out gets a specific bonus, and you can choose to learn that skill with any knight as long as they have capacity (rather than having to choose from skills in a randomly generated pool).

All in all, KoH2 is much more than CK3 & Total war put together in a blender and despite being worse that those games in the aspects they've perfected for a decade or more, KoH2 has more to offer, and is the only game thus far to offer both of those aspects simultaneously, and more.

[strike] (Edit) After playing multiplayer, there are some flaws; My first game I was playing as a single province start then conquering my way to becoming a great power, so I knew where all of my provinces were because I had to conquer them. My second game I played as a random nation and it was so incredibly disorienting as I had ~8-9 provinces that I just started with. The ability to widen your FOV (normal FOV, not diplomatic FOV) I feel would've fixed this instantly and I think should've been in from the beginning.

Also, the multiplayer system is annoying. First off, you cannot play out battles in multiplayer. This caused me to lose important battles in the early game that I could've definitely won if I could control my troops. I understand that this pauses the game for everyone else, but it should still be an option. Then there's the fact that I stopped the game to look for settings to see if I could widen the FOV and when we started back up again, my friend and I could not sync up. We tried over and over but that 2 and a half hour save is just lost to the game jank, never to return.

I still recommend this game in spite of these flaws, but they still need remedying by the devs. [/strike]


(Edit 2) The devs have listened to the community and widened the FOV and if you zoom out farther than the FOV allows the map transitions to the diplomatic map. They also fixed the multiplayer system so you can now continue a save.",1677837279,1689289195,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

-start building up my economic infrastructure and recruiting my royal court
-the abbasids ask me to attack Georgia
-I accept
-start building my military infrastructure
-recruit light swordsmen unit
-have 2 separate armies (from 2 separate conflicts probably) in my kingdom; one which is campign( last time I checked) and one which needs to be dealt with quickly
-recruit 4 more units of light swordsmen( which is almost the only unit I can recruit and the best one) because that's all I can afford

-fight the battle manually
-my swordsmen get defeated while my commander can't deal with a unit of peasants
-resign

Edit review:

There are things to enjoy about this game:
+This game has many cool features that Medieval 2 doesn't have such as
+a royal court and better character system
+traditions
+better economy system, not just money
+better goods system
+more realistic campaign: you're not just blobbing you have to think, maneuver and you're not simply conquering until you win
+better campaign overall

The problem that really lowers the value of this game is the battles:  They are inferior to Medieval 2 battles on almost any level you can imagine.
-There is also the issue that the characters you hire for your royal court do not age.  There is a mod to fix this but it may interfere with the achievements.:/

My verdict: If you're looking to satisfy that history and/or strategy itch that has been left woefully underscratched for about a decade now, then get this game on sale.",1670433096,1689039723,True,0,0,0.471311450004577637,0,True,False,False

It is also comforting to know that there are no DLCs (yet) and the game is fully playable and receiving regular updates, which is far better than what can be expected from Paradox, their descent into madness and depravity is clear for all to see.

With all the autosaves, I didn't loose much progress. It's a solid 7.5/10. 

Pros:
- Economy and trade goods are pretty exciting to gain, and each good provides bonuses.
- Everything about characters. The different skills, missions, and features each class can do is awesome. 
- AI is better at kingdom management than OG. It's not the best, game is still a bit easy, but you can't just murder everyone because the AI is constantly at war. 
- The game's economy works. Seriously an underrated Pro. I felt like I always needed money, books, piety, soldiers, etc. Nothing felt useless.

Cons:
- Field battles are weird. AI runs at full speed to your capture points, making them really easy to win. I'm guessing the AI is instructed to do that when they are projected to get annihilated, but it's a weird behavior. 
- I still wish non-royal characters aged

There's a lot here that I like about the game, mainly the political and economic systems, but there are a lot of things that leave much to be desired. Mainly I am talking about the battles, the military units variety and balancing, UI/details for your units that do not provide all the details and stats that you would find very useful, and some other things that you'll find throughout the campaign. Also, as I am writing up this review I'm seeing the preview videos of battles and the like and I gotta say that they look far better than any of the battles I've played on max settings. There just seems to be a lot more variety in the videos' maps than what I've seen personally, and I've fought battles all over the place. Not sure what's up with that but just putting it out there. One of the biggest disappointments though is that the best units in the game for the player's starting culture seem to be over in England with Man-at-Arms, Longbows, and Feudal Knights. Other than these, the better units for all the different types and tiers are the generic types. If you have any culture replacements (such as Slavic Bowmen, Slavic Light Infantry, Desert Infantry, etc.) more likely than not they will be worse overall than the generic types offered from most European countries. I have no idea if this was intentional, but it makes things kinda lame if you're trying to spice things up with a different nation/culture but don't necessarily want a more difficult game.

All-in-all, the game can still be pretty fun but I'd wait for a sale/price-drop (not worth $45), or just buy a different game that's in a similar vein.

Full:

I've been a long time player of the original Knights of Honor, almost since it came out. I loved that game to death, despite its occasional flaws. I followed development of KOH2 from the time it was first announced, and I did so with a cautious optimism that bordered on skeptical at times. I've seen so many series sequels, especially in recent years, that completely lost the spirit of the earlier versions and ended up being more of a disappointment than anything. I was naturally afraid that the same might happen here.

Let me tell you: it didn't. KOH2 is not perfect (what game is?), but it delivered on the majority of its promises, and it improved on the original in almost every way. Overall, I give it a 7/10. Why 7/10? Well, first off, almost nothing would merit a 10/10, as that would be a practically perfect game. So, starting with 9/10 as the general maximum, what drops it two points? The only two ways I feel it does not live up to the original.

First, the soundtrack. KOH1 had one of the most exciting, gripping, unforgettable soundtracks of any video game I've ever played.  KOH2, by comparison, has a mediocre soundtrack. It's not bad, but it's not great, and it certainly can't hold a candle to the original's.

Second, the building system. This has been simplified and streamlined compared to the original, but in ways that I feel are far less fun. It feels like there's less of an opportunity cost, as 3/4 of the things you ""build"" are just ""upgrades"" that apply to all copies of a building once built once. In other words: while I have to build a ""Barracks"" in every settlement that I want one in, once I upgrade any one Barracks with a Stable, ALL of them will have a Stable automatically, both existing Barracks and any new ones I build. I miss the expansive building system of the original.

Well, now that my complaints are out of the way, everything else is improved. Royal Family and Court management are better, diplomacy is more sensible, and provides a little more feedback. Battles are better, and less buggy. It's hard to describe, but overall, the game still feels like KOH1, only better in most respects.

So, there you have it. 7/10. If you're a fan of KOH like I am, I think you'll enjoy it, unless the soundtrack or building system are MUST HAVES for you. For my part, if the game is going to fall short somewhere, I'm glad it did so in secondary concerns, rather than things that would directly ruin or weaken the overall gameplay. In the primary regards, it improves upon the predecessor. I know this review focused more on the negatives than the positives, but I hope I've made it clear that this is because the positives far outnumber the negatives. So, it's easier to focus on what few things aren't as good, rather then on what all is better, because almost everything is better.",1686177029,1686177029,True,15,0,0.611428678035736084,0,True,False,False

Where Knights of Honor 1 was way ahead of its time, this sequel is a bit behind with the times.
While I definitely appreciate the developers keeping it real and sticking to the original formula where it works, such as buildings, settlements, knights, etc. and taking a great deal of inspiration from Crusader Kings to push it even further, I'd still rather just play Crusader Kings 3.

The reason for that is that what this game had that CK3 doesn't have is a real-time strategy component to it, but where the original KoH game, with its beautiful 2D sprite-art shined in that regard, the sequel falls short. Units move sluggishly and it is very hard to determine what is happening on the battlefield. The graphics are a bit cartoony and unoptimized, although turning off grass helps a lot.

Though it will quickly draw comparison with Paradox (e.g. Crusader Kings) and, specially, Total War games, playing it makes apparent that it does its own (quite fun) thing.

Note that the game doesn't telegraph its systems and looks deceptively simple, hiding a lot of subtlety and interesting mechanics underneath. Uncovering those mechanics has been quite satisfying, and I'm finding the formula much more to my taste than the increasingly combat-focused and arcadey nu-Total War series and whatever Paradox is doing now (not a big fan).

The game system revolves about managing the activities of the nine ""knights"" or nobles in your Court (including the King), who belong to one of several classes (Marshal, Merchant, Diplomat, Spy or Scholar/Cleric) and do the dirty work for your kingdom, including but not limited to: governing towns, stablishing trade routes, bribing your opponents, improving diplomatic relations, leading armies, and so on. This simple foundation offers surprising flexibility on how you run your nation. From warmongering, combat focused playtroughs to ones where you don't raise a single army, from honorable kings to devious spymasters, more approaches are viable than is usual in the genre. The ""peace"" game, in particular, is very entertaining, with the game providing a lot of tools to befriend, cajole, manipulate, assist or sabotage your many neighbors. As mentioned above, the formula is quite addictive and fun.

Some more thoughts, in bullet form:

[b]Pros:[/b]
[list]
    [*]Well designed systems, with a simple core hiding flexible and deep mechanics.
    [*]Diplomacy and peacetime relations feel very satisfying for the genre. Other nations are not just there to declare war on you when you reach ""Power Level X"".
    [*]A particularly outstanding spy system that lets you conduct a myriad of underhanded operations on your rivals. Just an example of the twisted, byzantine operations you can conduct: bribe a Pope aspirant, murder the other aspirant Cardinals, have your puppet become Pope, have him declare your rivals Excommunicated and then launch a Crusade against them.
    [*]Different religions (Catholic, Orthodox, Muslim, Pagan) bring their own unique mechanics to the table, which makes playtroughs more varied (Catholics will have to deal with the Papal States and their intrigues, may be excommunicated or asked to launch Crusades, Muslims may try to claim the title of Caliph or launch Jihads against their enemies, etc.).
    [*]The tactical real-time battles may seem rudimentary compared to TW, but they serve their function as a fun diversion and have a strong tactical component (morale, positioning) that reminds me of classic TW. They also have a clever incentive (you save campaign time by fighting battles manually instead of using autoresolve).
    [*]Good ""flavor"" text (i.e. that used in events, reports and such). Understated, relevant and fun. A simple thing that goes a long way in games likes this...
    [*]Graphical presentation is nice, clean and for lack of a better word, ""comfy"". Also, and this is important, no mobile/spreadsheet interface styling.
    [*]Excellent soundtrack (great melodies, real instruments).
[/list]
[b]Cons:[/b]
[list]
    [*]Some aspects of the game are too abstracted (board-game like) for my taste, since I almost always favor a ""simulationist"" approach. For instance, you court knights (unlike your king) never age, battles can be won by taking over abstract ""control points"", etc. I have to admit, however, that those system work from a gameplay perspective.
    [*]While it’s good that the game “does its own thing”, there’s at least one point where it could take notes from Paradox/CA games, and that is having character Traits on nobles. Currently, there is no great difference between characters of the same level (technically skills can be different, but that’s not enough). This game would greatly benefit from adding personality and distinctiveness to the Court.

 Not worth the price. Its underdeveloped
- Lack of flavour. Currently there are three religion flavours (pagan, 2 christian and muslim) and 6 unit flavours (slavic, byzantine, mongol, turkic and arab). Many nations have no flavour unfortunately. 
- Lack of reference work (such as a wiki)
- Easy to min-max
- Unbalanced mana, resources and economy mechanics. Lastly there is the unit balance. Let's go through each of these.
 1) Province economy: The province economy, consisting of resources and villages (except for coastal villages) are completely randomized every game. This makes most provinces garbage tier, except for provinces with coastal villages which are always guaranteed cash-cows. 
2) Too wide variety in mana stocks. Only mana stock that is relevant is money. Manpower is somewhat relevant, but not really. Others are not even worth mentioning. 
3) Resources and trade goods. Resources are or are used to create trade goods. Recall the randomization at step 1. Their distribution makes a few of them unreasonably difficult to obtain. Sometimes cutting you off early in the development tree. It feels off. 
4) Huge differences exist between the units of different cultures. Seems unbalanced, feels like playing with cheats vs handicap. Stat-wise some cultures are very mediocre, e.g. lacking decent infantry, and not that spectacular cavalry to compensate. Byzantine cultures get OP varangians without them having any drawbacks. These design choices are not clearly communicated or obvious why they were made.

All in all I would say it's not worth 45 Euros for me. There is a lack of flavour and game mechanics are not ok. It is not even the major part of the development phase. It could easily be solved by giving some units different stats and name. Fix the mechanics by running some simulations and tweaking the parameters accordingly. I quickly get bored.

Quick and really enjoyable strategy on the edge of grand strategy genre.
This game has everything I wanted from the first installment when I played it again and again year after year. Finally someone who remakes the old without changing the core of it. I really appreciate this approach.

capture points turn the game into capture the flag and its totally unrealistic, whats worse, because of the capture points there is no sense in any tactical strategy because, all you have to do is bait the computer on any difficulty and then ride for its capture points. Worse because you need to defend your own capture points at all times you really cant leave them unguarded and make use of favorable terrain. 

Here is a small amount of history for this time frame: Often in medieval battles, especially during the crusades Western armies would often loose their disciple and break for the enemy camp to loot it, this would often cause them to let their guard down only to be destroyed a day later by regrouping Islamic forces who were far better disciplined. There are some quite famous battles where this happens. 

In summary the tactical is just a disaster because the caputre (the flag) points make the battle pointless. Your army shouldnt be just defeated because someone captures your camp, at least give the player the option to turn this feature off. Even the instant retreat when a commander dies is a bit silly, yes medieval armies often did tend to route when a commander was killed, but this was not always the case and there are famous historical instances where armies often rallied after the death of the commander, sometimes just to get revenge. 

This game would be amazingly better by getting rid of capture points and leaving fallen commander situations to morale.",1681549811,1681549811,False,2,0,0.476190477609634399,1,True,False,False

I really love games like EU4 or the Total War series, and this game feels like a great marriage of these two.
However, unlike those games, this game has no substance. You could play any nation and feel like the only relevant goal is to expand, with the same unit types, buildings and ultimate win condition as any other nation. And this is because there are three major issues this game has that puts it apart from other similar grand strategy games.

Firstly, the diplomacy is lacking and at parts unexplained. There is little interaction you can have with other nations in terms of forming agreements, alliances, vassalage, etc. Sure, you can do these things but its not meaningful or it requires espionage rather than diplomacy. There is also a push and pull between states trying to gain war allies (and this is as far as the alliance system goes) that dissolve after the war is over. If there were a 'favour' system where if you agreed to the demands of a kingdom, or vice versa, there would be favour gained that could be be spent as a kind of diplomatic capital to advance your goals.

Speaking of goals, there are none, with the three ultimate win conditions being conquer the map, gain all trade goods, and become emperor of the world (basically a diplomatic victory). If no matter what nation you play the end goals are the same, then it does not incentive players to come back after completing one campaign. Essentially, everything is the same, from unit types to the buildings. There are some unique units for some nations that are only available in certain provinces or at certain point of the game, but the game does not tell you any of this. I think they tried using EU4 'Ideas Groups' or in this case 'Traditions' to better your nation and army rather than technologies themselves, of which this game has none. 
There is ONE 'mission' that the game doesn't tell the player. You can form some nations from some other minor nations, but you have no way of knowing which nations are formable, which nations can be used to form them, or which provinces you need. And some of these formable nations are time sensitive. If you miss out, you miss out.

Finally, I think any historian will agree that a lack of appropriate administration has brought down empires. And to that end, having only 9 'knights' to administer your empire, especially as it gets bigger, is ridiculous. This is especially since your knights directly govern provinces, meaning that you get 100% of their production. Ungoverned provinces give 10%, so then what is the point of developing lands that reap so little?  If you could buy more cabinet positions as your empire grows this would not be an issue, not to be able to govern all provinces but to expand the amount of resources available to you across your empire. 
Now, let's talk about the knights you can hire, because they are arguably very varied in their usefulness.
The Merchant is important early game to bring in extra and much needed revenue, but can be phased out once you've built up enough.
The Diplomat keep relations amongst your Estates high and manages foreign relations. But other than that you can get rid of them once you have built up enough. I say this because most of the diplomatic plays you can make come from...
The Spy, who carries out most of the diplomacy in this game, from lowering relations, to creating vassals and all the espionage actions you would expect. However, in the late game, when nations have become stronger, it is harder to get things done with the spy meaning your only source of aggressive diplomacy is rendered useless.
The only two knights you NEED are the Cleric who maintains order within your nation, and the Generals. The General is by far the most important knight class. This game is about expansion so you will be at war with enemies and hostile neighbours constantly. But if you only have a limited number of armies to protect a vast empire it can be very challenging, if historically accurate. Mercenaries are available, but you have no guarantee of finding any, or even being able to afford them. Honestly, you end up with so much food production and population towards the end of the game that not having the ability to hire generals SEPARATE to your governing knights is such a roundabout implementation of this concept, and in all, the usefulness of the knights are very limited. The diplomacy of this game really needs to become more in-depth to even come close to other grand strategy games.

So this is a game with no unique goals relevant to your nation, with limited diplomacy, where expansion is the key focus, and the administration of your empire is restricted.
Please, correct me if any of this is wrong, because I wouldn't complain as much if it was an early access game which was being worked on, but I paid FULL PRICE for this game and quite frankly got a shell of a game that could be so great.",1677055454,1681282877,False,14,0,0.61553877592086792,0,True,False,False

There are a lot of of fun that could be made from this game and some small rebalancing and more features could make it great, but right now it is frustrating and not worth it.
  
The UI is awful, the map both campaign and battle are way to zoomed in.  The colors are too similar so I can't tell if someone is at war or disliked.  Trying to find a marriage  partner is impossible because they use similar shades of pink lines to denote whether they have a spare prince or princess.  Change the color! Im colorblind and cant see!  Hell you can even keep the color just make the cross lines go a different direction diagonally, who the hell thought it would be a good idea to keep them parallel to each other.  

Speaking of marriage, what an awful mechanic.  Its impossible to marry your princes off.  Hell I had Castile as my trade partner, non aggression pact,  royal ties already married to my daughter, 500 positive relation, and he still came at me saying he wont marry to a lowborn peasant.  My kingdom has way better prestige and I am marrying my heir, what the hell are you talking about!  Also princesses need something to do with them.  This game is not historical so give them some proper gameplay element. 
This problem digs deeper into what is wrong with diplomacy in this game.  Mainly that you cant negotiate terms.  You just make a single suggestion, and its a yes or no answer.  I cant offer money or troops or land or anything to help sweeten terms in trade deals.  What the hell, I thought this was supposed to be a strategy game.  That is the most basic of gameplay elements you need in a strategy game.  

I havn't played very much so I can't go to into if the game is well balanced or not but from what I have seen so far I have my doubts.  Mainly that it is too easy to buff a marshal king.  Marshals get levels through only books, not experience and you can easily have a gigachad king early game with amazing buffs for almost no resources or time investment.  Theres this bizarre building mechanic where an upgrade applies to the entire empire for no reason that makes sense.  

These are all easy fixes so hopefully the developer can work on tweaking the game to make it more balanced.  But as of right now, the game is not worth it.",1680998658,1680998658,False,8,0,0.513494372367858887,0,True,False,False

I'm not saying I'm great but I'm not terrible either. As I usually do, I started this game on the easiest settings and intended to work my way up in difficulty. In many games I will get to and play at the highest difficulty eventually.

I now realize that I will probably never even get to normal difficulty in this game. I don't fight manual battles and since you can only have two armies per battle, autoresolve will always lose for me as I cannot hope to match the army strength numbers. Last game I started as Sweden. Denmark and Norway attacked almost immediately as they always do. I barely had time to build four full armies when Norway sent five armies and Denmark two. My best army was my King with about 3500 strength while Noway's best army was 4800. Two of my normal armies would probably lose to that one.

I'm sure with more time and practice I could find a way to win but trying to learn the game on easy and just losing immediately again and again is so unfun for me that I cannot find the will to continue right now. I will probably play this again at some point but for now I'm cutting my losses at 50 hours.

As for deciding to press yes or no on the ""do you recommend this game"" button I'm torn. I'm sure I would like this game if I could make it past the first 10 minutes. I did like the first version of the game so I guess I'll chose yes.

Update: I have now played another 50 hours and here is what I found. I have played exclusively Sweden so far and when Norway and Denmark are unfriendly they will attack early and often. I don't think there is a way to win without fighting manual battles. It's not that you win easier with manual battles, although you do, it's that the battle gets resolved immediately so you can get your armies back to control again.

I lost the last game on normal difficulty. I had a bad start resource-wise and stats-wise on my council. Norway declared war and I took two provinces. Then Denmark + Norway declared war and I took one province. Then Denmark + Norway + Saxony declared war and because I had a few minutes of peace before each war I was overwhelmed in the end. I had 5 full armies of second tier units but faced at least 10 enemy armies. I just ran out of Kingdom levies to keep fighting.

I have no doubt I can win with better RNG but I feel very frustrated by now. Other Kingdoms or a start with Denmark and Norway friendly would be much easier but I don't want to restart until that happens.

I was also excommunicated last game. Apparently being attacked 6 times within 20-30 minutes by other catholic nations are something the Pope cannot tolerate. How dare I defend myself? I had a positive relation with the Pope and my clergy was +6 happy. No provinces with any other religion either. I don't know what exactly being excommunicated does, maybe it's no big deal but it's just another thing that annoyed me.

In another game Poland attacked me and I took some provinces from them. My King died and then before I could do anything they all rebelled back to Poland again. It's not that I couldn't take them back again but I was just so annoyed I quit that game.

The core gameplay is not unfun but there is so much that annoy me that I'm unsure if I want to keep playing. I will still recommend the game as I'm sure my experience is not the norm and I did like the first game.",1680130042,1680947231,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b][i] Description of the game: [/i][/b]

Knights of Honor 2 is a grand-strategy and a real-time strategy at the same time. So, on the one side, if you are looking for something like Total War, this is not the right place to get it – the level of battles is simply on a lower scale and detail. On the other side, it will also not be the same in terms of grand-strategy like Crusader Kings for example, because the level of branches, realms, hierarchy, etc. is also not as wide. So, we can say with confidence that more-or-less KoH2 is unique in its own way and stands in its own genre. 

[b][i]Opinion:[/i][/b]

You either love or you hate the game. There is no middle ground. Just like KoH1, it is one of the games that even after a while, you come back to it, and you re-enjoy it once again. Now, I am not going to speak about the positives of the game. What I want to concentrate on are small bits and pieces that if perhaps touched, will make the game even better and more enjoyable. For instance:
-	[b]Historical Engagement[/b] -> the weight of the historical facts from my point are not enough. The pyramids and Mt Etna are a pretty nice touch, but I want to see a bit more. Rome with a non-touchable building (the Colosseum), Constantinople with Hague Sophia, Paris with Notre Dame... That will make those symbolic cities different from the rest. It‘s quite sad to start with Constantinople, which is completely empty in terms of building slots and they are no different than the rest. 
-	[b]The Capital[/b] -> The capital is the center of your empire, the cradle of culture and civilization. Yet again, the importance of your capital is somehow missing because you are not getting it noted or shown in any way. You don’t get benefits such as additional building or army slots. The only sign will be your king if you assign it to it, but this somehow remains unnoticed or without any value at all.
-	[b]Cultural Buildings[/b] -> those are actually missing as a whole, and I am not referring to the Cathedral and the University. What I am talking about are other buildings like Libraries, Arena, Podium, Actors’ Guild, etc. There are no parks, gardens or fountains, which were also part of the cultural society and development of a city. 
-	Speaking about Building Districts -> Selez has created an extremely interesting mod where [b]Farming District[/b] is changed. He had added a totally new building called Watermill – simply genius, as this was highly used building in the Medieval Ages. What I would like to see is even further improvement. Maybe something like Cultivation, Water Lifting cranes, maybe Wells or perhaps shadoofs or qanats.
-	[b] Military Building Districts[/b] -> I miss the fortifications from KoH1 :( It will be spectacular if we have [b]Fortifications[/b] as an additional separate Building District as well. Towers, Gates, Moat, Drawbridge, Murder-Holes (if I am correct with the naming), Catapults on Towers, Balistas… a Citadel… all those that were available in KoH1. It was nice seeing them changing your entire castle’s look.
-	[b]Learning[/b] -> all members from the royal court can reach only to level 15. How about afterwards? There should be some additional incentive as well. For example, a marshal after (I don’t know) 5-10 battles can get relationship status with his troops or survive in a relatively good shape. Imagine you have a cleric that converted 3 or more provinces to your religion – then he should be a prime candidate for a Pope maybe? Or what if you have a Merchant with several expeditions? Then why not have the possibility to add an estate, a villa or something that adds additional bonuses to the province.
-	[b]Weather and Region changes[/b] -> I don’t feel there is an accurate region balance. Having multiple resources or farms in certain regions like Sahara or Scandinavia is simply unrealistic. There should be boundaries to certain goods and consequently, higher probability of getting them in others. This is a historical incentive that makes you conquer new lands, just like the Vikings raided the south and the Arabs Europe. Fortunately, I haven’t seen camels in Scandinavia :D
-	[b]Military Units[/b] -> this is a broad topic… Well, it might be beneficial if there are changes to the military structures. On the one hand, units that are already purchased and are Light, would be nice if they can be upgraded to Heavy. By that way you will not be losing. On the other hand, adding more military types will also make the game more interesting and engaging. For example, if there were village militia with bows and arrows, village militia with small axes. This will bring variety to battles at early stages. Some additional military units would also be valued, like soldiers with a mace, a flail, war hammer, etc. But most of all – a clear separation between nations’ and regions’ unique units, and the normal units. At the moment, the unique units and the normal units are mixed and not clearly visible from one another.
-	[b]Family Utilisation[/b] -> all the princesses have skills (stars), but those are not usable. There should be a better application for them, not marriages only. For example, an option to appoint your daughter as a queen? It may result in revolt or discontent, but there are exceptions like Elisabeth I or Catherine the Great. What about using them in the other’s court as well? Like promoting our religion or a son that is educated in your culture. For Muslim religion perhaps multiple marriages?...
-	[b]Crusades, Jihad and Mercenaries[/b] -> I believe it will be more historically accurate if multiple factions and marshals join a crusade. Same for a Jihad. For mercenaries, it will be beneficial to have an additional option to support a revolt. Additionally, this can be a beneficial point for rebels as well, because I had a situation in which I am going into war towards a besieged castle from my supporters. When I attack, I am attacking the rebels instead of supporting them to conquer the castle…
-	[b]Peace offerings[/b] -> it will be nice if it is given an option to make certain negotiations or demands when the opponent is asking for peace. Not just from my side, when I am asking for peace and demanding from the other side (i.e.) vassalage. 
-	[b]Summarised news[/b] -> worsen or improved relationship as an effect from a certain action… Wow, if you try to win the game through diplomacy manoeuvres, the amount of coming separate messages for positive/negative relations, is simply too much. It will be far much better, if they are all summed up in 1 single message as a list.
-	[b]Formable nations[/b] -> this is the last one, I promise. Those special quests, for forming/uniting a nation, are piece of art. We are all trying them and it is (maybe) one of the most beloved actions from KoH1. I am delighted to have them in KoH2, but I would suggest a tiny change: adding the entire title, like “Empire” or “Union”, or “Commonwealth”, or “Khaganate”, etc. at the end. Not just Spain, Ireland, Armenia, Bulgaria or Serbia. It looks different, especially on the map, when you have fulfilled this sort of special quest and see the entire name written😊 It brings this small measure of satisfaction and also acknowledgement. 
[i][b]p.s. Please add more! [/b]😊 We miss Unite Germany, Scotland, France, etc. 😉 [/i]

 
[b][i]Summary:[/i][/b]

Don’t get me wrong, I highly recommend the game. I love this game and for every true KoH1 fan, owning the 2nd one is simply a no brainer. However, if you do like those suggestions: please comment, like, let’s get a discussion going and hopefully some visibility from the dev team, so that we can get a KoH2 dlc that will make the game even better. :)",1680870642,1680870916,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

1)  Why, oh why can't I zoom out further so that I can see more than 2-3 provinces at a time???  You can zoom the minimap, but not the gameplay window, so if you have an empire more than 2 provinces, it gets really difficult to see your empire in relation to your neighbours.

2)  There isn't an obvious way to turn off any notification classes, so you'll hear about all the trade centres from all across the world, and every time you gain (and lose) the top standing in a certain area, you'll get a notification about it that you can't turn off.  But it won't give you a notification that your immediate neighbour is in a war, which is something you may want to know about, since you can only see 2-3 provinces at a time.

2a)  All notifications don't automatically pop up, you have to click them to open it.  If there are keyboard shortcuts to open/close these notification windows, that wasn't obvious to me, so I ended up clicking twice just to clear away stuff I didn't want to know about.  You pick up the ones that maybe you can ignore and you can right click then away without looking at them, but they'll always be there, taunting you to open them.

3) The diplomacy is really poorly done, it seems like it's really important in this game, but the diplomacy interactions are not immediately accessible for any nation other than your own - you have to click one of their cities, and then click to have an audience, in order to get access to the diplomatic options, and the available, limited options are really poor.  I had a vassal, but I couldn't figure out how to see how much income they were providing me.  I'm pretty sure I could have declared war on them without any warning windows.

4)  Maybe I missed something, but your leader will age and die, but the game time is not based on years (instead hours & minutes) so you have no way to know how young or old your leader is, or do any succession planning.  There is a big interaction window for your family relations, but other than setting up traditions, I didn't see what I could do to make sure I wouldn't be hosed when my leader dies.  You can marry off kids, but not from this window, that's done through the clunky diplomatic options, going nation by nation to pimp your kids out.  The death of your leader just happens, you can't do anything about it, and there's no warning or way to know that it's coming up.

5)  When one of my leaders died, his offspring I'd assigned as knights, including a marshal leading an army, disappeared.  The entire army stack disappeared with that marshal, and in one moment half of all my forces completely disappeared.  There was no explanation about what happened or why, my leader, offspring & army were just gone.",1680778665,1680778665,False,36,0,0.628432691097259521,0,True,False,False

The game seems like a solid title with own ideas for a change and unique gameplay. I for one wish the economy, buildings, tecnology and progression in CK where as complex as in this title.I really really wanted to like this game but... at its current state is not worth the 30 euros I payed for it on discount.  IT IS A SHAME THAT THE AI IS BROKEN ON AN EMPIRE TOTAL WAR LEVEL.

The Bad

The in game narrator can become annoying really fast like the pawns in Dragons Dogma, luckily and for the sake of the players sanity he can be told to go for a walk. Repetitive notifications and events that are hard to click on are aplenty. 
The units are unbalanced. Higher tier units are way to expensive and you can easily steamroll everyone with light infantry and archers. Seriously, that is all you need.
Archers have very limited ammo... but artillery which is much more OP does not?(Might seem like a small issue but catapults will reck the enemy army before they even come close) 
Victory conditions are dumb. Why do I win an offensive siege if I kill the leader of a reinforcing army? Why does the army inside of the city get out and attack me?
Why can only two armies engage at a time?

The Broken

Not really a fan of the capture points in the battle but that is besides the point. The AI IS BROKEN. It  just runs past you and rushes towards your control points and seems to not care if you do the same. It has no regard for which units are good against your army, it just moves foward and goes around your army. After that it goes for your capture points completly ignoring that you massacred their army in the meanwhile. 
To compensate for this the devs thought it be relly cleaver to make the AI spawn armies out of nowhere. Now this happens in other games as well. But the difference is in those games it occurs on higher difficulty settings acompanied by an AI that actually knows what it is doing.
Playing as a OPM seems impossible unless you manage to storm the enemy at game start and take a very calculated province with an important trade good. This is because the game is hard and it is not hard because you need 200 IQ to play this. It is hard because of clunkiness combined witth the hability of the AI to produce endless hordes of armies without suffering any consequence. It is a lot like playing Shogun 2 Total War in legendary difficulty, except the enemies have the strategic hability of a bivalve. The AI in its backwardness will glady melt against your castle walls and more armies will just keep comming. Yes, they will try to breach your city with less troops and a wall in between...  
Problem is every faction has the potential to do this, even tiny countries. Every faction has access to a set number of ""knights"", the agents of the game, and through them they can muster an offensive army. 
Since these AI armies materialize out of the Ether with no conection to ressources in game(AI seems to ignore population or levies) there is actually no point in raiding enemy villages in an attempt to curteil this. It is more useful to seak out ways to distract these set armies by for example starting rebelions or having allies involved. The only path to vitory for a long time seems to be to make 2 or 3 armies, declare war, take one city, peace out, get positive stability, repeat. This goes on untill you can pay out a enough armies just from the tax of your cities at which point you can just snowball.

In my opinion adding a difficulty setting where this magickal armies behaviour is not produced and fixing the silly AI in the actual battles and on the campaing map would carry this game a long way allowing for a wider variety of play styles to be employed thus enhancing replayability.

I started maybe 5 different rounds now with several nations and every game was different about the random world generator. For example I start one game with Saxony, where all my neighbors (except of Denmark) like me, while in the second game all distrust me or at best where negativ neutral to me. So every campaign may or may not a new challange. 

Where I find the game a little bit too much random is the choosing of skills for the people in your court. Esspecially at the beginning, where you only produce a small amount of books, it's very annoying, if your trader only get warfare skills. 

Another point is the AI. It seems a little bit confused from time to time and have a questionable decision making.

- an allied army passes a battle between me and the enemy without helping me
- my one province neighbor who is currently under siege and is about to die, declares ware on me. The war is over some minues later, after he has conquered
- a defeated army with less then a quarter of troops then my following army has turned around and tries to plunder a villiage so I can attack it again with the next decisive victory

While I see merit in the idea of merging these two worlds, the actual implementation feels lackluster: instead of bringing added value of combining both worlds, it feels lacking the advantages of/joys from both.

Strategic aspects of the game (economy, diplomacy, cultures/traditions/religion, etc) would be quite satisfactory and nice but the AI makes absolutely stupid diplomatic choices seriously damaging immersion and realism, or your ability to build up a diplomatic strategy. E.g.: my ally whom I have perfect and long time relations with creates an invasion coalition against me while my adversaries dont bother to enter a war even when their vassals attack me (their combined strength would be greater than mine). The mechanics are there but the choices the AI makes needs to be worked on. There could be some UI improvements - scrolling out further on strategic view (not the various overlays but the vanilla map) - but otherwise its kinda ok.

Tactical battles are too shallow, feels more like a feature creep than a well implemented game loop. Its Total War on budget with a really poor UI/UX. I mean cmon, I cant scroll out enough and/or tilt the view to see my tightly packed army on one screen (in a larger 2 allied army battle), not to mention seeing the enemy army and their movements. The mechanic of hard counters is there (e.g. swordsman > spears > horseman > archers > swordsman ...) and some terrain based bonuses (e.g. archers are not effective against enemies in woods) but its very shallow besides that. Also, the AI is exceptionally dumb when it comes to tactical battles, way too easy to pull tricks against it.

Battles? Yeah, they suck. Neither arcady fun like any of the AOE games nor tactical like TW games. I'd go as far as saying the battle system is incomplete and not even serviceable in its current state. It doesn't let you zoom in properly nor can you even rotate the camera. I'm sorry but in 2023 with so many TW games I could play, heck any RTS game, I would have a much more enjoyable and engaging experience. For the RTS battles, this game gets a big fat F for failure. Or -F for not fun? I'm sorry but the devs have not properly demonstrated to me the consumer that they are even capable of creating an RTS game at all.

So what does that leave you in terms of gameplay? We'll basically you have a TW campaign map where all the pieces move in real-time. Sounds cool right? Yeah but it's poorly executed. I hated the idea of pausing the campaign map as it was clearly intended to be played in real-time. It just felt cheaty. But that's the thing, the game cheated me and rob me of my time. I'll give credit where credit is due. The game does have some cool and fun diplomatic mechanics that will see you struggling to form defensive alliances, secure trade deals, and even stage rebellions in foreign lands. That's cool and all but the UI is lacking. Things like, why your population is rebellious, are obfuscated, forcing the player to pause the game just to try to figure out what's happening. This happened to me multiple times.

Another glaring issue I see is a need to rework and balance the economic system. I really struggled to make any economic gains, even when solely focusing on this instead of military expansion.

One thing that is cool is this game forces you to play politically to achieve your strategic objectives. The problem is the game hides this fact from you by not properly explaining the mechanics. I was eventually able to expand my little Irish kingdom by laying claim to lands. The mechanic is you have to negotiate a deal to have one of your sons or daughters marry into a neighboring kingdom. Once the king of said kingdom dies, you can then make this claim. Here's the issue. The game literally doesn't tell you this. I happened to stumble upon this by trial and error. The second issue with this major mechanic is the notification on the far left will pop up and depending on how fast you set the game speed, you might literally have a second or two to take advantage of this and lay in the claim before it becomes completely dismissed by the new reigning king. I'm sorry but that's just plain bad game design.

I'm sorry but although I'm having fun playing this game as it is something new for me, the design decisions are so poorly executed that I cannot recommend this game.

1) Battles suck! This is the worst RTS I have ever played. Seriously? Can't zoom out far enough. It's got stupid capture points on an open-field battle. What? Why? Who told you that was fun?

2) That leaves me with half of a game. The other half of the game is the campaign map. So right off the bat, the game is at 50%. That right there is a fail in anyone's grading scale. That wouldn't be so bad if the campaign was flawless, but it's not. It's got major game-breaking issues.

So let me get this straight. I paid $30 dollars for a 40% finished game. Is that right Mr/Mrs devs? Do you think you deserve to be paid for an unfinished product? Why? Try going to Star Bucks. Order yourself a caramel macchiato. How would you feel if they just filled the cup up with whipped cream and caramel and didn't give you the coffee? Would you pay them? So why should we as gamers? You guys are just plain lazy. The RTS battles, seriously you didn't put any effort into it. Shame on you guys.

Update: Was my review too harsh? I went back and played a bunch of different strategy games to double check my opinion. Yeah this game has a long way to go. The devs sold this game as a finish product but its Early Access at best. RTS battles are a joke and you can literally play way more games even for free that do a better job. No possible way the devs actually believe the battle system is finished. Its like they never even really started or tried. Very lazy. My original opinion of this stands. Battle system is a joke.

This is a gem of a game, but only for a particular kind of player. Contrary to what you might hear, this is not automatically a game for you when you like Crusader Kings and Total War. 

Do you enjoy CK's roleplay and its fealty to history & the intricacies of the time the most? Then this game is probably not for you. 

Do you enjoy Total War because you can field huge armies in tactical battles and stomp your rivals on the campaign map with sheer numbers? Then this game is probably not for you. 

On the other hand: 

Do you enjoy CK's setting & beautiful map but wish there was a lot more to its economy and development than only pushing numbers up? Do you dislike the often slow gameplay of a grand campaign?

Do you have fond memories of Empire: Total War for its elaborate province development and trade good system, and did you autoresolve most battles because they felt repetitive?

Then very much yes, this game might be the perfect game for you. I am one of those players that falls in this last category and I am happy I did not pass on this game. Because then I would never have found out that I enjoy KoH2 actually more - quite a lot more - than CK and Total War. 

KoH2 is a carefully crafted, coherent and complete strategy-game with impressive solid gameplay. It's a lot more complex than some reviewers make you believe, but its complexity is subtle and somewhat hidden. The developers have the audacity to put limitations on the player in order to enhance the gameplay - and they stick to that design sacrificing some historical accuracy or horizontal scope. But don’t be fooled, this is not an easy game. Even on Normal it can be challenging, especially if you haven’t grasped its myriad modifiers and potential yet and you play it with either a CK or Total War mindset.

The core of this game is in its Knight management, of which you can only have 8 + 1 King. These Knights are separated into classes: Marshall, Merchant, Cleric, Diplomat and Spy. Choosing the right balance of classes and which provinces they govern, is the crux of the game because they have the powers to make the difference - much more than simply fielding large armies for example. 

Knights can be upgraded with different skill levels that can become very powerful. Interestingly, all actions go through these characters. There is no general diplomacy or trade screen here. This means that to expand trade or do any diplomatic action you sent your Merchant or Diplomat to an actual Kingdom - when you recall him you lose that function. Marshals alone can field full 8 stack armies, although other classes can lead smaller armies to if they have the right skills. 

Some people reflexively dislike limitations without appreciating they provide interesting and challenging gameplay. It is your choices that count, not simple numbers. Also, it does not mean dumbed down gameplay. AI Diplomacy is surprisingly good, with other kingdoms often putting up an adequate retort if you are being too opportunistic, and they almost always will look for added personal interest as well. The Spy system is relatively easy, but one of the most rewarding and fun I have encountered in a long time. A good Spy can do a lot.

The second aspect where this game really shines is in its relatively simple but silky smooth provincial development system. It has captured perfectly the feeling of building your kingdom without making it tedious because of complicated number spreadsheets or waiting for 70 years for a technology to finish because its ""historically accurate"". 

There are 64 goods in this game, of which two dozen are tied to provincial features, like forests, coasts, having ores or cattle, randomly generated each game. They can be refined through buildings into other goods - which are requisites to go up the building chain. These goods function like a clever technology tree without being one. There's no waiting for points/mana to collect and spend. It happens organically, and it costs gold only, and a building slot - which are limited too - so again, choices. 
 
You won’t find all goods in your territory and so you will need to trade. Importing goods are limited to 3 per merchant. This is one of the places though where the limits do feel a bit restrictive, but mainly because resource spawning and AI behavior could use some balancing here. In more than one game I have experienced sausages to become a true luxury, as there were few cattle spawns on the map and the AI does seem to have trouble upgrading into more advanced goods (although sometimes it just takes more time). 

The goods can also illustrate the way in which all these systems can work together. I’ve seen people complain about the long siege times for instance. And yes, with base Marshals and armies sieges take a lot of time. If you want fast sieges you have to invest. When you train one of your Marshals with Siegecraft, build out the siege workshop, buy catapults - that helps some. But some goods, like rope or iron, give powerful siege bonuses too. And when you add the Siegecraft Tradition - another neat progression system - you can equip your Marshals with 4 trebuchets and Towns will fall swiftly and satisfyingly before you.

This is a pretty tight - and addictive - game, where every little choice and modifier can matter, because it either leads to a significant bonus, a new building upgrade or better troops. Next to Traditions there is one more final progression system called Kingdom Advantages. These are realm-wide bonuses you can unlock, based on what kind of goods you have available in your realms. You can trigger Masonry for building benefits or Age of War, to buff your army with a whopping 3000 extra manpower to prepare for the actual endgoal of this game: being  crowned Emperor of the World. 

This depends not simply on painting the map but on a voting system that includes all pillars, economy, culture, religion, where the 8 Great Powers in play will vote for or against, depending on your relations and power. Although it is not that hard to gain some support relatively early, convincing other mighty Empires, especially those with different religions can take a while. If that’s not your fancy, you can also end the game by collecting all Kingdom Advantages and press claim Victory whenever you feel like. 

Does all this mean this is a 10/10 game? No. But with 1 or 2 more free patches it sure comes close to a 9. When they fix the flow between the - beautifully crafted - map and the minimap overviews (the criticized limited zoom), tweak the resource spawning and AI behavior a bit, then perhaps add some more customized map settings, and this is one of the most fun & replayable games I've experienced. 

When it comes to the price, I feel KoH2 is absolutely worth that money. Yes, the game has a more limited scope than CK but it is also a lot - a lot - more polished and complete. Getting it in a sale however for the 30 euro’s I did is a sweet bargain that would make your Merchants proud. 

As for the future, afaik the devs have not been outspoken about dlc’s. Seeing how they crafted and balanced this game, I don’t see them releasing small dlc’s just to add “content”. It’s a finished game, it can end here. 

But I do hope they will continue development and give us at least one or two expansions in the true sense of the word. You know, by actually adding onto the base game and expanding features. An obvious one would be map expansion, either to Asia/India or the New World. The game already has Expeditions and Colony mechanics in the late-game, but very rudimentary. The role of naval warfare is very minor too.

Either way, if they decide to polish this gem even more with the care and art and sophistication they put in this sequel, I’d be very surprised if this did not become a sovereign 10/10 in my book.",1679843005,1679863067,True,2,1,0,1,True,False,False

Some people that I'm seeing are complaining that, ""it's too simple"" or ""it's too hard"" or ""it's too bland"" while simultaneously comparing it to much more complicated games like Crusader Kings. 

The game has a good spot in between Total War Series and EU4. The real-time strategy is really interesting, and all the different avenues of winning and gaining power isn't just raw war & conquest. It's like EU4 in this prospective, where you can gain vast amounts of power by barely engaging in war. But it isn't trying to be EU4 or Total War, remember that.

Unfortunately this is so poorly implemented, and I don't say anyway that it will improve. Terrible unit controls, UI, map controls, pre-battle set up etc. There is no redeeming quality to the actual fighting of the individual battles and it's better to just auto resolve, which leads to a boring game that relies on the aforementioned bland empire management.

-the politics and intrigue aren't as deep as CK, no interesting RNG mechanics, no newly wedded lady pestering you to buy her a new horse or else she'll threaten you with a higher chance of adulterous relationship with the neighbouring Duke or mayor and ruin your prestige; 

-The castle building and town improving is on a grand strategy map, saves you from having to manage your settlement as well as having to direct real time battles at the same time, which is forgiving, the hi fidelity up to date graphics is also appreciated, if aren't as lively as something CA could make;

-The entire game feels like you are doing everything but to grow your Battle army and go out to engage in Real Time battles, there aren't much stories or histories being illustrated, but the mechanics feels REALLY OLD SCHOOL, it would seem to me that the devs has retained all the design philosophies of the previous game and just made it 3D for people who long for something from a simpler time but with newer graphics.

In conclusion, as some one who has not played the first game I regret purchasing it, the battles turned out way too slow and mechanically old fashioned, the grand strategy is system wise serviceable and ok when it comes to graphical standards  of the times but its overall stoic and lacking in the magic that makes games like CK, TW shines in comparison, I mean there is nothing wrong with Keeping it old school from time to time and you can't ask too much of a smaller studio that is simply not trying to fix what is not broken to revive a game that worked (Paradox being a much worse offender with Imperator  Rome in this case), maybe some new content for the DLC would help me appreciate this game more, I mean I feel like I could learn more about the culture of medieval europe through Medieval Total War and forgive the terrible battle AI.

I can't recommend this game, because ultimately it will leave you quite frustrated. I'm not even going to cover the real-time combat portion of the game (which was also frustrating). 

Some of my main pain points: 

1) Building improvements (upgrades) are kingdom-wide. The more upgrades you have on a SINGLE building, the more expensive and costly it will be to build elsewhere. Creating housing, and giving it huge upgrades in your capital means that yes, when you want to build housing in the middle of nowhere you *have* to pay for all the upgrades effectively making it into a huge city. The works the other way around, so if you have lots of 1 type of building then the cost of upgrading goes way up. Frustrating, because maybe I don't want to have tax collectors in a town where everyone hates me! Why was this design choice made? Why not let the player just upgrade each building in each city ... there aren't that many. Very dumb, and frustrating.

2) Combat/Armies cannot join battles that already have 2 generals (per side) in them. That's right, when your 200 size general gets attacked by 2 5000 sized armies you can only send ONE army to reinforce the combat. ???? This leads to some very weird situations. Enemies will line up to attack you, because they can't all just attack at the same time. You will literally have a line of armies waiting to enter a siege.  Transferring troops is super annoying as well.

3) Some fun family tree style mechanics... except every nation just won't ever want to marry anyone from your dynasty.

4) Some things feel modern, and other things (like the special map types) feel like the design came straight from 1999. Like the choice to show you how much time you've wasted playing the  game but NOWHERE shows the current year... your monarch can die at any time but your other non-family nobles never ever die?


Overall, there is some really cool stuff in here. I feel like the resource management and basic/special settlements mechanics are very cool and executed pretty well. However lots of design choices I would expect in something from 1999 really make this a frustrating experience.

- Once you start with wars you never stop, they keep attacking you all the time. There is no feature such as truce in place, you might make piece with a nation and after a very short period of time they might attack you again for no reason.
- There is no casus beli, you just attack whoever you want without many consequences.
- Diplomacy seems to be useless, not many metrics to measure the relationship between nations, just an arbitrary relation improvement.
- Trading also does not have many features. You just have a few merchants that you send to other nations, not much you can do in terms of strategy there.

There some problems that need to be fixed
- AI Archer spams, half the countries spam archers and no other card. Archers in the game are overpowered, the can either fight in melee, much longer than other melee units or run away if charged, archers melee needs to be nerfed and speed reduced. 
-AI Factions are constantly asking to join war, this is the most diplomacy i get with factions, barely anybody asking for trade unless asking for a load of money. 
-We need the ability to craft our diplomacy request, the AI is rarely going to accept blank request if we are unable to craft our proposal
-AI vassals are useless and there is really no benefit than a small gold payment. Make AI vassals join your wars and assist you militarily 
-Rebellions are too many and need to have stability bonuses when defeated, it seam like every 5 minutes theres a new rebellion in the same region, when they are defeated the region and our nation needs to receive stability bonuses when defeated. 
-Defeated AI Lords should have an option to ransom, the only options we get for them is release, execute, or use as a rebel
-Crown Control is badly defined and hard to bring up to positive besides spending money and religion points. 
-Priest fail too much trying to convert regions, even with 62-70% chance of success, sometimes my priest take 4-5 times to pacify a region, forcing me to spend thousands of gold, books, and religion to be successful.

This game is a lesser version of CK3. The ONLY thing that helps this game stand out is the tactical battle that is all the rest of the game plays like lesser version of Ck3.
what I did not like:
1. the knights system 9 people can not run an empire and you cant hire vassals to run it for you
2. RARE surrender or capitulation. When lords do surrender you cant convert them to your faith.
3. The vassal system period it terrible. Your vassals will not fight for you or come to your aide even if the relationship is high. Vassals signing pact against you. the lord and fiefs are not automatically included a an ally so they can be attacked independently. You have to join their war that is insane to have to manage. Hostile action from your vassal on good terms
4. was NOT impressed with the build slots AT ALL too few.
5. Backward Progress indicator. YES I KNOW I BUILT a Farm I want to only be bothered when its completed and not until then. That is just so arse backwards to tell me what i know im constructing... tell me when it completed so i can start a new project.

In short... If you want battles, go play Total War.. If you want a campaign, go play Civilization or Paradox

In multiplayer, you can't play battles so its just a paradox level autoresolve.. At that point just go play CK3 with some friends, you can get more out of CK3 than this game.

Battles need a LOT of work.. Would like if units had more mass and were actually static; able to hold a line. Not a fan of how battles are won either... Capture points and killing the enemy general is how you win most battles...

I got 40 hrs clocked now, from which where about 10h to learn the game in its entirety - yes, you don't need more and I didn't play the predecessor - and 10 hrs because I accidently left my PC on over night. So basically, from total scratch to first (long) campaign win in ~30 hrs. Without significant content addition, I can't see any more adding up.
While I'm ok with supporting smaller studios, 45€ is just too much for this game. It disguises itself as A or even AAA title, also with the price, but the content and magnitude of it rather reflect a B title, as many mechanics and aspects of the game are rather trivial and shallow.
I'll keep an eye open for DLCs and mods to widen the content, as I don't see myself playing this game in it's current state again for... at least quite some time.
Recommended because I like strategy, empire building games, but that's it. Normally it should get a thumbs down for what it offers for its price.

Only buy when on sale for 30€ max. This would better reflect what you get for your money.

Just for you to compare: Total War: Warhammer 3, probably the biggest, nicest, refined, most replayable, hour eating, in general probably the best and biggest strategy empire building franchise of all time, setting standards in many aspects, costs 40€ on sale right now (don't let reviews deceive you, CA just fucked up their immortal empire campaign release so everybody was pissed off but the game is ridicolously huge, fun and replayable, easily killing hundreds or even thousands of hours).

The kingdom advantages mechanics are really very cool and well thought out.

The battles are questionable, with archers being extremely powerful and the AI often sending units off to capture a point that could otherwise be winning the close battle in the center of the map, only to be picked off later on because the rest of their army is dead.

The game has events like CK3 but there's a tiny pool which makes them extremely repetitive.

I haven't played much grand strategy games in years. I enjoyed them when I was much younger and then I came across Crusader Kings III on Gamepass. While I found it extremely complicated and difficult to learn (which I still haven't really figured it out yet), I did enjoy playing it. Knights of Honor II: Sovereign is much the same as Crusader Kings III. Just a little less complicated I think. In the three or so hours playing Knights of Honor, I was able to learn far more about how to play the game than I ever did in Crusader Kings III 10+ hours I played that. 

The ""tutorial"" of Knights of Honor II: Sovereign could be a whole lot better though. It only consists of reading little snippets of what each panel contains. It doesn't really go into how to create an army, or the actions of war and fighting. Or even of the economy and making money. I swear, the first 3/4ths of the game I spent so broke because everyone kept me broke and unable to do much. It was a total crawl. The pope kept demanding money for this or that crusade (which I haven't yet figured out how to do). Other monarchs demanding money to open trade, or for peace. Spies wanting to conduct witch hunts. Clergy wanting to run off to Rome for some reason or another. When i finally said enough was enough, and started rejecting demands was I able to start gaining some cash to build buildings and doing upgrades. But that also immediately opened the floodgates to invasions. I lost sections of my kingdom without even knowing about it. Then gaining other sections of kingdoms on the other side of the map without knowing about that either. It took me what seemed like forever to figure out how to create an army, as pitiful as they were, to try and defend my towns and cities. It was then when I realized how important it is to also focus on trade because you can only go so far with the goods you need to meet the requirements to do necessary upgrades or build buildings. And you have to in order to even build a little army, which still doesn't have any real strength to it to do anything. You need to take over provinces or kingdoms or trade to get what you need. But you get little time to find or build trade routes you need before your neighbors come attacking.

It's definitely a learning curve, but I'm enjoying the game. I will definitely will be playing Knights of Honor II: Sovereign a lot more and trying to figure out all the ins and  outs of the game. I guess there's even possible mod's that you can import as there is a menu for mod's. I have no idea how to do that yet, but I look forward to figuring that out too. I don't know if this is strictly a solo game or not, I think it is, but it'd be totally cool if it were a multiplayer game with the ability to play against others. I'll find out soon enough.

I do recommend this game if you enjoy grand strategy type games. Just be prepared for a long drawn out learning curve.",1677913840,1677913840,True,1,0,0.517241418361663818,0,True,False,False

Now, Knights of Honor 2 - Sovereign is more of a remake than a new title. If you've played Knights of Honor, you'll feel right at home from the first second. That's good, but it's also bad. Good because there are some very nice improvements to the first game here, and bad because that's pretty much it what's new. 
It plays very much like the old 2004 title, and I don't mind the graphics, even if I find them worse in places than they were back then. 

I  miss the old music so much, as it was an absolute masterpiece, and I hope some modder will bring it back into the game. - I hereby humbly ask for it, in case a modder might read this. ;)

This game is not a mess, because it is what it was in 2004, with some small additions, but it surly is a huge disappointment. 

But the diplomacy, the battles, the interactions between characters and much more have not improved and that makes me really sad. During sieges there is no sound, besides some pft, pft sounds. The fightings feel cheap for a modern game and are not the fun as in 2004. 

I know this game lives from a lot RNG, but most of the time you start a new game, you'll find yourself surrounded by enemies that are superior in armies and technology and that will trie to end your little reign within the first month. If you're unlucky and get a s*itty province, you're done. I had to restart a couple of times and I have the constant feeling that the AI is a lot more aggressive than at the original. And it cheats a lot. Minor provinces that have the same startings, can crush you with ease. Maybe to cover the flaws of the game, I don't know. 

This game could have been so much more as it is and I regret buying it simply because I have owned this game for many years and have not gained anything great new by buying the new title.
What this game does have done mods back then. - And they made it better! More buildings, more troop variations, more knights at court, and so on.

It's easy to get into, fun as hell and it still has a large amount of depth to keep you hooked for a while. Everything K&H 1 did right this game does better, which is exactly what a remake of this kind should be about.

The game really does not deserve the mixed reviews it currently has, check out the complaints and see for yourself (spoilers: they make no sense. 50 hours on record and its a bad game because it lacks depth?)

It's easy to learn and get into. Gone is the feeling of wanting to start a new save or re-learn everything from scratch because you haven't played for two weeks and don't know what the fuck is happening anymore

Positives:

+Straight upgrade over K&H one (Although i loved that games art style)
+Unique units and locations based on time period and location
+Unique resources and building chains based on location
+A seemingly simple economy with a lot behind it. Trade is decently fleshed out and your kingdom can even be affected by inflation if you hoard money like joe biden
+Actual functional diplomacy in a strategy game? It's very feasible to inherit land through claims via marriage and culture & including bribing rebel supporters in neighboring countries. It's very refreshing for this to be an option instead of throwing money at the screen or simply conquering everything
+Fun victory condition
+Crusades that will branch off into crusader states if they are successful
+Great music
+Extremely mod friendly developer, i'm really excited about the possibilities this game has
+Fun and decently complex battles, like the original the combat system is a more fleshed out counter unit system with elite/sidegrade troops and commanders in the mix letting you play as you prefer
+A lot more but this review is getting too long

Negatives

-Only two armies can 'fight' or siege on one side at a time (4 total, + sometimes a surrounding garrison). I understand this would cause death blobs using autoresolve but it makes no sense to have a large army standing around doing nothing while four are fighting to the death

-Some bugs here and there, nothing gamebreaking that ive found so far

-The music is great but i do miss some of the bangers from 1

_____________________________
[b][u]TL;DR:[/u][/b]
Admittedly at the time of review I have barely poked around in this game.  But being a huge fan of the first game years ago, and putting hundreds of hours on it, I not only re-bought the first game here on Steam but I had to have the second one.  I'm not disappointed by it so far either.

Before I buy any game I almost always skim the negative reviews to see what the major quirks and/or problems with any title are.  I see a lot of negative reviews focusing on comparisons between this and Total War or Crusader Kings.  I don't feel that is being fair to this developer.  The game isn't a copy of those games.  It is similar to the old Lords of The Realm games [i](albeit a real time version and not turn based)[/i] from the 1990s more than anything.  [i](old favorites of mine)[/i]

This also isn't just a rebuild of the original KoH game.  While the general game play is identical there are several new features and some new depths added to this game compared to the first title.  I really do view this as a true sequel game as it retains core game play features and adds additional/new ones on top of it.

All in all I'm happy with my purchase and, if you enjoy the old Lords of The Realm games, you will be happy with it too.",1677783799,1677783799,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Good:
Real time campaign map is unique, and very interesting to see armies following around the campaign map.
The time delay for being able to siege a settlement or pillage a town using an army allows for a reasonable response time before it finishes.
Real time battles were relatively short, and fun, without too many units to make the battles overly complicated.
The supply chain management for building and upgrading buildings is clever, but good in that all buildings of the same type automatically gain the upgrades.
I like that different governors give different production upgrades when assigned to different towns.

Complaints:
AI seems to have an obsession with having archers in its armies, sometimes having only 1 melee unit and 7 archers.
Military unit variety or lack there of. Some factions have a total of 10 units they can recruit, a basic and 'elite' version of sword, spear, bow, melee cavalry, and peasant mob/militia, other factions I've played have a single unique, IE longbow for England. What might bring some more variety would having the 'elite' units only being the middle ground, and have true elite professional or royal guards type units, that might have a recruitment cap and hefty upkeep costs.

Resource caps for Books, Religion, and military manpower. While it is nice that when capped you earn a small amount of money, there is no way to boost the capacity for books or religion when both are valuable resources that can be used up sometimes one action. Part of me would like the option to forgo the gold income and instead just collect forever at a reduced rate.
While it is possible to boost military manpower by building a specific building in a governed city, it would be nice if every city added automatically gave at least a small increase.

Limited size of royal court/governors, Especially for large empires. At most, you can assign governors to 9 cities, afterwards they are not governed, and only produce 10% of the gold, books, and religion, making it very inefficient to try and upgrade them in a meaningful way beyond producing food/commerce. 
With 8 'knights' and your king in court, you are forced into an awkward position to balance needs, especially if you have a large or divided territory. Only Marshall class knights can lead armies beyond your King, but too many armies and you can't get enough merchants to make use of commerce, have a priest on hand to quell unrest in conquered settlements, plus a spy and diplomat. Depending on size, it would be nice to have a larger royal court the larger your kingdom got.

Awkwardness of late game balance.
With the only upkeep cost for military units being food, if you had the ability to recruit more generals outside of the basic royal court a large empire could have a stupid number of armies where the only expense being food and general salary, as food is only useful outside of unit upkeep for trade, and generating a 100+ surplus in a large empire isn't too difficult if you aren't also recruiting bonus garrisons for every city. Limited numbers of armies gets tricky when multiple enemy kingdoms attack you all at once as you only have a set number of armies to reply to possibly 2 or 3 times as many armies breaching your borders.
In order to acquire trade goods for the kingdom advantages, you'd be forced to strategically conquer a lot of awkwardly placed territories, or have enough merchants to have enough trade routes to trade for all of the goods, plus making use of the massive amounts of commerce gained through conquest (if that's your play style). 
I understand that a lot of my complaints to this point are probably balance choices designed to keep the player from gaining an advantage and snowballing out of control, but if I'm going to play to conquer the entire map, I'd like to do so without having at least one arm tied behind my back.

Battles:
It would be nice if when in a real-time battle the campaign map stopped, so an enemy can't land on the shore, and then march and join my battle before my troops can even close distance to engage.
I also feel that archers have maybe too short of a range.
A pre-battle deployment phase like in Total War games would be really nice, so that for instance, I don't have my catapult awkwardly sitting on the edge of my army formation when the battle starts.
Map variety is very limited to open terrain with limited clumps of trees, and like 2 slightly different city siege maps, one with wooden walls, a second with stone. A river map with a bridge would be cool, where the attacker has to either clump up crossing the bridge, or slowly wade through the water, burning stamina and being an easy target for archers.

There is one noticeable actual problem I've been having, and at the start of battles, it will hitch, throwing my camera across the screen, and burning like 10 seconds of the battle clock if I'm not paused.

Example? 

Play as one province Visby--- get declared on by Sweden to war. 

Fine--- scum-saved and gave Sweden as much gold as I can to avoid it. It worked!

Denmark declares war this time at around 30:00 mins ingame time.... just cause. 

Fine--- scum-saved and gave Denmark and Sweden a split of my treasury to avoid it. It worked!

Norway declares war this time at around 30 mins ingame time... just cause.

Fine--- scum-saved and gave them gold. It worked!

Now a fellow one province pagan declares war on me! A fair fight I'll play through! At around 32 mins ingame time, a Christian Poland joins them as an ally. . . 

Then Sweden declares war on me, so now its two seperate distinct wars--- but they may as well be allies because they do siege things down together as one army on the same side of the war. 

I'm like ""f--- it"" I'll play this death through at this point--- First I realize Sweden peaced out unprompted/unnotified. 

As I figure the only way I can win is attrition--- and the enemy army of 6K+ has spent years at this point supplied at ZERO without food, so that game mechanic may as well be useless. The AI has decided not to siege down my capital Visby and just parks his army outside it indefiently---- when my horse breeders rebuild the AI decides to ransack it and go pack to parking outside of Visby. He doesn't care for peace, and my army of 200 units can't do shit versus a ""starving army"" that's been malnourished and logistical f'd for a decade that supposeably has a chance for ""an army revolt."" The modifier for a stavered undersupplied army in the medieval ages is only ""-5,"" so I can just get f**ked.

Now look at my playtime, and that's all I needed to see how fundamentally frustrating this game was going to be.

This is a fun game. Someone else said it was a cross between Total war and Paradox and this is a good comparison. A little more complex than the former, a little simpler than the later. It's a great mix. The early game is nerve wracking, at any minute you could be ganged up on and eliminated, especially if you are playing a smaller starting country, which I recommend. Started as Leon. got wiped in about 2 hours. Tried Aragon next, did better, but got ganged up on by 4 counties at once, wiped. Tried Leinster next and now have united Ireland, strangely buddied up with both Scotland and England and are carving up western Europe. I have conquered about 60% of France and am about to start a war with a beefed up Toulouse. Super fun.

Complaints and caveats: The historic value of this game is low, so if you are one of those paradox 'this isnt exactly how the court of Wurtemburg was in 1482, fix it!' people, this game is not for you. It takes place in a period, and it's a fun game, enjoy it for what it is. Each new game has the provinces populated with different types of settlements, and they often arent historic, but it makes the replayability spike up.

The only complaint, and it's minor, is the UI is a little clunky here and there but you get used to it fast, and it would be great if in the zoomed in view (the non-political map) you could actually zoom out a little farther. It's hard to get the big picture or watch your flank provinces during war. Not a huge deal, but every review should have one negative statement.

Fun game, already thinking about what country to try next while I spread Irish culture forcefully across Europe!

Edit:I feel I must respond to the most SMH negative review I've seen. You played .7 hours and you have it all figured out? LMAO. Yeah, in the very early game you ill be facing armies full of peasants and militia (you've ONLY seen the very early game) so you will win some battles with a bunch of archers. That doesnt last long. You never had a crusade full of knights and longbowman called against you. You try your tactic vs actual troops and not peasants and see what happens. You know how to win in the first 30 minutes? What took you so long? It's a genre game, you build cities and armies and take over other players cities, just like Civ or Total War or AoE. You havent played long enough to realize it's not as easy as you think. There are more ways to win than you realize, and conquoring the entire world is not a typical one, though doable. While you spent 30 minutes patting yourself on the back about how amazing you are, some country on t he other side of the world has already conquored double what you have, and another country is miles ahead of you is a different catagory of victory. Next thing you know the world is voting on who should be emperor of the world and your name is not on the list. The reason you were watching the money ticker and complaining is because you made mistakes. You spent all of your money on things that require gold upkeep. You dont buy 9 Heroes to start with, they have upkeep. You dont race to engage in diplo missions in the first 30 minutes, they have a 20 upkeep, something you cant afford in the first 30 minutes. You played it wrong, then complained about how you dont want to stare at the gold ticker. You dont have to if you dont make a bunch of mistakes in the start, which you clearly did. Did you play long enough to have a foreign country convince one of your Marshalls to take his army, and the city he governs, and claim independence? What did you do? After you took the province back, did you execute him? Or release him? Gee, how did your peasants take it? And the nobility? Were they angry? How did you appease them? How do you solve a province that just wont stop rebelling? And again, however did you deal with the 10000 man crusade army full of fuedal knights. Did you send out 1000 desert archers and think 'I got this, I figured everything out in 30 minutes'?

I pre ordered this and paid full price as a fan of the first game. Well it was a mistake to say the least. You'd think that 19 years later this would be amazing for such an incredible title. Yeah that's not the case. The game is basically a mediocre remake of the original at best. There's nothing good here sadly, it's boring, restrictive, repetitive, there's almost no difference between nations, the battles are awful, the pace feels weird and overall this was a disaster and huge disappointment. I was really excited to play this but sadly I just wasted my money.

The way you can create elite marshals, conquer countries, build alliances, just tends to my every need. 

KOH 2 delivered if you want to see it as a ""remastered"" version of KOH 1. As a new game, it's largely disappointing, I played this game for hours & I have no motivation to open it up again, I feel like I beat the game already. I'll provide my pros  & cons. 

Pros: 
1. Remastered feeling of KOH
2. Graphics are beautiful
3. More actions with Marshall/Merchants/Spies etc
4. I love the feature to hire rebels

Cons:
1. 100% not worth $49.99
2. Game is EXTREMELY grindy
3. Minimal variety across the map (different structures, fighters, weather,) JUST SOMETHING it all feels the same
4. The notification system is an adrenal fatigue : the game is way too slow so if you try to speed up you'll be nuked with notifications
5. Not much options if you're going for a small kingdom approach
6. Predictive AI : if you attack a kingdom, expect a different to be mad at you for it, you'll always be in an endless war 

Thankfully these can all be fixed with additional patches & I hope the developers go for it, Personally I am willing to purchase another DLC if they commit to making the game more interesting & adding variety

I cannot recommend it at the current price point, as is.  Various companies have been coming out with their Definitive Edition of older games that were updated with graphics.

Some interesting new features like the addition of levies to recruit armies, town garrisons and castles, more in depth royal court, a beautiful map, introduction of kingdom traditions and a quite well redone kingdom advantages. 

I also enjoyed the updates to the information that is available, like explanation what goods you are producing towards kingdom advantages, what you have in your territory, what you can produce, where and what is needed to produce certain goods. It really helps to keep track on town development and your conquer strategy. I also like an introduction of better siege mechanics and more information on when enemy armies will arrive to defend a castle/town/province.

I am not too sure how I feel about the new building system (in essence, you have 8 building slots per town, 4 by default, then need to buy with gold additional building slots that increase in price with every slot. Now you build a main building that can be updated based on available resources. 

I also miss the option to build a fortified camp with the army, a feature that I thought was quite good in the original. I am not entirely sure why marshals now need books to learn, in the original you needed battle experience to level your marshals, it made more sense that way to me. 

RTS battles will not challenge Total War anytime soon but can still be fun. I mostly enjoy focusing on the strategy map and auto solve battles. I also do not think it compares to CK3 in terms of court management and intrigue. 

I like customisation level to start the game (choose options in addition to difficulty like king ageing, spying, religion, all that can add additional level of difficulty. Some matches can be quite challenging, especially if the enemy start 'ganging' up on you. 

It is also important to build defensive/invasion pacts, so you have some support from AI otherwise you risk being run over from all fronts. 

I have not spent much time playing online, cannot say much on that front. It seems simple enough in terms of setup and I suspect it will be very close to offline play depending on settings and ability of other players. Not too many servers, however, suggesting not many play it online. 

Overall, quite happy with a more modern version of the game, and really enjoyed it so far. If you played original, there will be a small learning curve but once you get used to it, it can be a lot of fun.",1675621046,1675621046,True,21,0,0.673302829265594482,0,True,False,False

In not so short.. I'll tell you why.. 

I was not really a huge fan of CK, more of a total war (old titles) fan, but this did appeal to me, and i'm glad i purchased it, now.. I thought the battles were going to be more of a draw, but to be honest, they are not very enjoyable to me, they just a quick mash up of who has  more numbers.. at the start anyway.. units are generalised as well, you do get the odd faction trait unit but it's pretty main streamed.

Sooo.. it's the campaign for me, I love the selection of kingdoms, pretty much anywhere over the main scope of Asia, Europe & North Africa you can select any tribe of faction, like CK, but it doesn't feel as bogged down as CK, more simplified and it works great!

It does need more work but i'd be picking at minor things.

For me, there's not much of a game to play. By that I mean there's no reason to attack other regions or try to conquer more land other than being able to expand your cities. And just like in CKIII you can only manage a handfull of cities. I played with England without ever attacking anyone or being attacked. So boring. 

I find the character management system weird and finding someone to mary is also too difficult. There's no character development and it's really easy to skill up. You just spend books and buy traits.

I can say its a great game and a good mix of strategy styles, such as Age of Empires meets Total War and Crusader Kings within one game. It is a unique title in a sense of play with sandbox mechanics, allowing the player to adjust and do as they please. Even if you have an heir to the throne which would suit as a warrior but you need a diplomat, you can select them to be the diplomat and provide the appropriate growth bonuses to the character.

KoH II Sovereign is solid with addictive gameplay, no glitches in perfomance, pleasant graphics, great voice, sound effects and music.
I find it hard to compare it with any of the other before mentioned games, it is a gem of its own really. It is historically enough for history buffs, and it is complicated and immersive enought to make one keep playing and trying to master the games all fasets.

I find it hard to point out really weak spots,  the game looks and feels very solid and complete. The developers have done a thourough job.

I mastered the game, played around with mods in it for years to come, but lamented that there wasn't a sequel.

Well, after waiting 3 years after the sequel was announced (2019 teaser trailer released), the sequel finally came out and I've played 151 hours of it as of the time of this review. I can safely say that it is a genuine sequel to the original game, and with more official mod support being added soon, it will potentially become even better. I have heard some of the original developers, plus some modders who made some custom stuff for the first game, were hired on to develop this game, and this also shows.

That it has campaign multiplayer is a huge plus, as the first game only has multiplayer for the tactical battles. I do regret to inform people, however, that campaign multiplayer has all battles auto-calculated in order to avoid having to pause the game for other players or complicate the netcode. Other than that caveat, I strongly recommend this ""Grand Real-Time Strategy"" game to anyone who likes the ""Medieval"" time period of Europe + Middle East + North Africa.

- AI's diplomatic decision are random. They might attack you even they are not prepared for war and much weaker than you.
- AI keeps asking you every 10 seconds to attack another kingdom. It is really annoying.
- Having a vassal has no point. They just pay you tiny amount of gold. Other than that they are completely independent. They refuse to help you in war and even refuse to trade with you which i think they need to be obligated in these.
- RTS battle AI is terrible. AI either suicides its general by charging your front ranks or ignore your army and go for capture points. You can win any battle by just defending capture points or sniping enemy general.
- Kingdoms need more uniqueness.
- Game becomes too easy when you have around 5-6 fully developed settlements.

Reminds me of earlier, simpler Paradox games (e.g. EU3) in the best way: a fun sandbox with lots of flexibility.

My main complaints would be that factions don't have much unique flavour (with hurts replayability) and veteran strategy players will find the late game gets repetitive. If you've worked out how to build your economy efficiently you can develop ahead of the AI and reach a stage where you're generating more money than you can spend, but you're limited to how many armies you can build because of the fixed number of knights.

This game is really nice , the reworks you have done to many aspects from the first game are really good and i like them. 
Here are some ways the game needs to be changed in my opinion
1: Royal Court Members: I never got it why in the first game and in this one, everyone besides the king is immortal and when i say immortal i mean they never age, they stay young forever and its a bit dumb when 4 generations have passed since my first king and i still have the same merchants marshals and so on, they need to age so the 3 merchants i have that give me +1000 from expanding trade wont give me that for ever and also my 15 level marshals dying would force me to get new ones and actually spend my books at something because in the late game i don't have anything to spend them on, funny story once i had one of my spies become the king on a kingdom he was in and it was really a meme that he would never die because he was in my court so i was controlling that kingdom for ever, if you see your king not aging guys you better know he is not on your side xd 
2:Manpower: while i love the addition of manpower i think that it regenerates a little bit fast, it should be slower and halved when you are at war, so if you loose some armies it wont be as easy to replenish them with strong units or make garrisons for your cities, also units need to cost more manpower.
3:Late game: You should look forward to make the AI work together against the player in the late game, because soon the player becomes unstoppable and single wars are very easy, but! since your army is determined and limited by how many marshals you have, if your neighboring AI factions make a coalition and attack you from all sides all at the same time it would be very hard to respond to everything at the same time, and would make for a much more interesting late game
4:SEASONS!: This is the thing i think hurts the map the most, the lack of seasons really hurts this amazing campaign the game has , you can have winters be harsh and cold covering the map with snow and reducing the grain production on all towns, reduce army move speed ,make the armies loose men if they move in enemy territory during winter and loose men in their territories if they stay out of a city for some amount of time ,you can do many many things with seasons you get the idea of what i am saying.
5: A big thank you to the developers for bringing to life this masterpiece ! i know a lot of people whine! But this game is made with love and care and anyone not being a blind unsatisfied ape can see the developers actually cared  for the state of the game, and its not a broken release of 80 dollars that we bought from EA,UBISOFT,ACTIVISION that will need 1 year of patching just to be playable!

The issue is it has crashed twice after starting battles in person. I'm wondering if this has to do with the multiplayer aspect getting messed up in single player. It's a little clunky, but you get used to it. Potential improvements, one a better place to find provinces with specific soldiers. Part of the fun of the original was rushing to provinces with unique soldiers and kicking butt. When I can't look it up, that is difficult. The merchants have been heavily nerfed in most regards and were already weak after the early game. I suspect the issue here is you need them early game for money, and by late game they aren't providing as much value because you now have to have goods to back up the trade. That is fine I guess, but it makes it quite painful for early game. The fort/castle system is a little weird. Pillaging used to be an action that had to be answered with knights but now you randomly have some dudes defending and losing. Also, it is imperative to allow the attackers to choose to break the siege even if they don't at the beginning. Otherwise, the food running out kind of ruins the whole thing. I recommend in the future having a Beta on Steam. The die hard fans would have helped clear a lot of this up for you and still bought the game. For the record, I am happily open to improving my review as bugs and improvements are made.

Edit: After getting past crashes, I have updated my thoughts. The first bug fix slowed that down though I haven't tried using it yet. Merchants can be viable with opportunities, but are slow for the start. I would like a way to let important blood relatives withdraw back to the background. The feeling of ""did I hire a spy"" is less prevalent in this game as you can merely have spies in the background plaguing a country. The main map is not great. It is not clear what the colors are for religion, or relationships. Plus, clicking to get to a specific spot of the map or get it to follow a knight gets trapped very easily. I do like the ability to see the different kinds of coalitions for and against you. The powers are varied, but the random nature of having to select from a set of skills does make it a tad annoying. I really like the bribe people actions from spies. Plus, I love the ability to just pay someone in your dungeon to join your kingdom instead of rotting away.

Knights of Honor 2 feels very similar to the third type I listed. As a fan of the original game. This one feels very familiar. But with more.

The building system of the cities.

There are still bugs in this game, sometimes when entering combat the game freezes, sometimes the battle begins but you are still in the loading screen. 

Battles are not so good!
- Units are stupid, they charge for no reason even if you run away from the enemy, usually it's cavalry turning around 180 and charging pikemen.
- Auto-combat is terrible, fully upgraded knight and army loses 15% of army against 4 squad peasant rebels, but in manual combat they run away at first charge.
- Skills you can teach your knight are random, you can choose between 2-4 skills presented, often you get useless skills.

People who worked on historic part of the game have some knowledge about western European history, but have run-through wikipedia knowledge about eastern European countries.
- Names of nobility and knights are better than in previous game but still terrible.
- Regions held by nations are mostly incorrect and heavily influenced by modern geopolitics and political correctness than actual historic data, which is unacceptable for ""historic"" game.
- Regional units are too few and unbalanced, people creating this were visibly biased, western units are so much better in every way than muslim and eastern European units, even Mongolian horse archers are meh compared to them.

Diplomacy is unchanged, same options you had before but enemy kings are more stubborn and stupid. I had the largest and most powerful kingdom with powerful allies and smaller kingdoms that i dominated in war still didn't want to surrender, no vassalage, no marriage, no gold nor land only white peace, each time.

What i like about this game is mostly economy.
- In town buildings are fewer but multifunctional and with upgrades so in my opinion this is better.
- Traditions are cool addition, you basically get skill for whole kingdom and work together if knight has same skill.
- Skills that knights have work for several things not just one, but i would have preferred if there was more to choose from.
- Villages are more useful, not just waiting to be pillaged but when when town buildings are upgraded so are the villages, and some regions have forts which slow down enemies and rebels significantly.

KoH2 brings all the original charm and enjoyment that KoH1 had, but with a ton of improvements and avenues for enjoyment. There are also enough unique features to truly separate this game from the predecessor, all which I have really enjoyed. 

This game, like KoH1, has a huge learning curve for new players. There are also so many ways to play. I've been allowing fate to decide the traits of my heirs, and upon their crowning, attempt to tailor their reign to their traits. For example, a Marshal King will certainly be expansionist while a diplomat will look to grow through negotiations and marriages, and a clerical King will be entirely pacifist.

While persistent play without turns is great, the areas that had to suffer is very obvious... The combat... which isn't surprising, however I would have preferred this game take more elements from games like crusader kings if the only battles we would actually be able to to fight are basically still on the level of the first knights of sovereign. I love everything about what this game is trying to do, however too many elements come off as shallow. And its way too easy to hit a point where the AI is not a challenge. I would say this game is great for people who want an easy 4x game, but not for those who wanted a new challenge.
 
I only have two recommendations:
1 - The combat in itself needs work, it feels like playing mobile
2 - if combat cannot be improved, there needs to be much more quality of life than what is there currently. Diplomacy becomes click bait. There needs to at least be an element for events (like in stellaris) to add more meaningful interactions in a playthrough, and personally, i dont like the system in place fore administrators. I understand that there is always a limit, but the way this is implemented just isnt very immersive in my opinion. it basically forces players to use mercenaries as armies that cannot be directly controlled... it just leaves me wondering why?

Its greatest strength is its greatest weakness though. It's a lot like the original, and it's simple. Regarding the former, it's easy to pick up if you played the original, but from there, there's not a whole lot that has changed and that was hard to stomach for the price tag. (The one big change that I adore is that special resources are a lot easier to get, but on the flip side, the randomness with which the game assigns those resources to provinces is still baffling and obnoxious. IE putting three lodestone deposits right next to each other on the other side of the map.) Regarding the latter, it's nice that it's no overly complex, but there are times that the game cries out for more. More unique units, more actions, more complex interactions between your kingdom's populations, etc. 

Overall, it's a good game. It's fun and simple that does exactly what it sets out to do, and while I don't think 44.99 is a fair price for the average gamer and I can't quite recommend it at full price, whatever price you pay for it, I have no doubt you'll enjoy it.",1672677322,1672677322,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

-If you are fine with KoH1 issues and structure because basically it is pretty much the same foundation which is the reason why i love the first one. Except that this time, it has more depths to it.
-The difficulty has improved vastly, even at normal mode had me scratching my head on my first playthrough.
-This game stays right in between Total War and Crusader kings, it's not overly too complicated yet got you thinking your resource structure for each provinces carefully. 
-The extra jobs and function for scholars, diplomats, merchants etc have given the game much depths compared to the 1st game. Finally, some use for other types of knights.

CONS:
-like i said, some KoH1 issue is still there as a feature, for example, you king is basically mortal while your knights will live till the end of the world. But i won't mind that much as Kings as knights has their extra perks if you use them as governors or active personnel. Kinda balance things out.
-if you looking for a Total War experience, this may not reach that expectations. It is it's own game.
-I think the devs should really rework that auto battle simulations, I got my teutonics and crusader knights beaten by an average middle east units AI which has a bigger number of troops.

I can understand the comparisons to other popular grand strategy titles such as Total War and Crusader Kings but please understand that KoH2 is uniquely it's own. Instead of giving a comprehensive review, I'll simply go over a few features that I like and than rant about a few things that I believe could be improved. There are a lot of great YouTube videos that go over the basics so I would simply watch those if you're not familiar with KoH.

Things I like:
[list]
[*]I do like how alliances are more complex and multiple kingdoms can join in on one big war. This can make wars more interesting, dynamic, and make you less reliant on having lots of Marshals with armies to defend yourself since having lots of allies or a few big ones can tip the balance of power in your favor. It's a little strange how a war can abruptly end and all sieges and battles come to a sudden stop if the lead kingdom of the alliance makes peace but that's just how it works.
[*]Rebellions are much more interesting this time around. In the previous KoH the player had to handle each and every rebellion on his own and it could get very tedious. Now, you can ask a neighboring friendly kingdom to assist with a rebellion within your own kingdom or even have a spy or hired mercenaries put an end to it. Captured rebel leaders can also be hired to cause chaos in other kingdoms. Be careful though because those rebel scum leaders may also just take the gold and disappear. 
[*]I mentioned mercenaries - if you feel like you are short on Marshals and armies you can not only recruit troops from local mercenary camps within your kingdom but also hire the entire mercenary army to do your bidding. This because quite hilarious later in the game when you have more gold since you can literally hire every mercenary army that pops up and have them marauder throughout Europe causing chaos to your enemies and significantly increasing your military power and ability to fight multiple kingdoms at once. 
[*]I have put in almost 80 hours and the game in it's current state seems to be very stable. I have encountered no bugs that I can think of or crashes. RTS battles can stutter a bit but that's the only issue I've seen
[*]I like the traditions system and the way army size can be influenced by a combination of knight skills and building upgrades, and the traditions that were adopted.
[/list]

Neutral opinions:
[list]
    [*]The current unit roster is decent enough though I think it would not hurt at all to implement more unique military units. Perhaps future DLC's could expand the game further in this regard. 
    [*]On higher difficulties I think that other kingdoms, especially major powers, should be able to field top tier armies to provide more of a challenge. Later in the game I still see most armies consisting of light infantry/cavalry/bowmen, etc. Maybe there should be a better chance for the those armies to have higher veterancy as well. Unit experience in this game is a big deal. A squad at max experience (3 stars) is like night and day compared to that same unit with no experience. 
[/list]

Things that need work:
[list]
    [*]After almost 80 hours of play I have come to the conclusion that sieges are bit trivial as the attacker, especially with catapults and/or trebuchets. Besieging settlements, even settlements with lords castles, palaces, and upgraded fortifications, are simply not imposing enough. Destroy one of the main gates and surrounding towers and that's all you need to do to march in and claim victory. The AI does not utilize walls at all and town guards (even the royal ones from the palace upgrade) and very weak troops. 
    [*]KoH1 had better castle upgrades such as larger towers that could be occupied better by archers and ranged troops. There were even catapult towers, ballista towers, and boiling oil at the gates. The citadel in the center of town could even be occupied by troops. In KoH2, the citadel is just a decoration. I think that max level castles and fortifications should be more imposing and even able to counter attacking siege engines - just my own personal thought.
    [*]There are supposedly large keeps, cannon artillery, and watch tower upgrades for lords castle but they do not show up on the battle map and only seem to be stat upgrades for better siege defense, levy production, etc. The cannon upgrade only seems to be a ""good"" and not a weapon that can be used on the battlefield. 
[/list]

My main gripes are AI things that could be easily tweaked with mods or updates and also the way sieges work, specifically for the defenders side. Overall I think KoH2 is a very solid game and very welcome addition. I congradulate the devs for bringing KoH back to life and I'm looking forward to future content!",1672619393,1672619393,True,1,0,0.504310309886932373,0,True,False,False

There are a few neat mechanics that could provide an enhanced immersion compared to the original, but everything else is clunky and straight punishing without any of the original joy. This feels like they tried to meet KoH 1 and CK3 in the middle and fell short on both ends. 

The Positives first:
1) The knights skills have been revamped to offer ""legacy"" bonuses to your royal line, and non-marshalls benefit from the the new ""leveling"" system.
2) The tech tree for each building has a lot of neat addons and synergizes with goods in immersive ways.
3) More options were opened up to modify local villages/farms/monasteries, and castles have been added as an additional quirk.
4) KOH 2 fixed the auto-fight feature where you lost 1 unit at a time. you now have the opportunity to lose all units equally at the same time.

The Negatives:
1) The UI absolutely sucks and The Diplomatic View is worse than worthless (Edit: it isn't great. Poor first impression, not as bad after a brief hiatus, still not an improvement) The icons are tiny, Portraits somehow have less detail than before (but they age finally), You can't find an available wife to literally save your kingdom (no icon for prince/princess), no icon for war, or other diplomatic status, and The Diplomatic color scheme and lettering are horrid (Edit: again, not great). Text boxes overwhelm you window with useless info and semi-critical decision options are 
right-clickable. 
2) The tactical graphics take away from the experience in every situation. The marshall sprites are clunky with poor troop detail and the cities absolutely look worse than the original by a mile. There's next to 0 graphic representation for fortification level or development. (EDIT: In the world-tactical view, not the combat-tactical view)
3) There are no ports, you literally click on the water with your marshall and they just hop on a boat in the middle of nowhere after a brief pause.
4) There are no special/faction units, just a few different versions of peasants, light archers/swordsmen/spearmen, and heavy versions of the same.
(Correction) There are definitely special units in the game, they are simply tied directly to the province where their developed. I'm not seeing any ""kingdom specials"" that can be produced just anywhere, but i suppose that could be a reasonable trade off.

5) The available building slots per town is DRASTICALLY reduced (4 per city with an additional 4 that can be purchased for 2k, 4k, 6k, and 8k). No town is anywhere near functional without having to buy slots. Absolutely kills the immersion vibe compared to unlocking additional slots via any other method.
6) You actually lose available children slots, 6 to 4, and girls and boys share them. You get a halfhearted development card gimmick to tailor the kids' career path, but you just end up pigeon-holing yourself by picking a profession for them that they can't leave. You decide that they're going to be a merchant class a baby? they will be a merchant for the rest of their lives. Lack of male heirs still reigns supreme as your biggest bottleneck. Don't miss their birthday parties!
7) Your king gets old FAST on normal mode. Even when he has all 4 kids ""young"", he's ""old"" before the last 2 reach adulthood. maybe that's more realistic? honestly though, it just feels rushed and like a complete waste of 1,000 books.
8) The pacing is off. It cranked the dog-eat-dog easy war factor to 11, but introduced diplomatic functions that slogs everything down to a what feels like a x2 CK3 speed. The world doesn't have a start fresh early-medieval period with lots of loose provinces and it feels like the computer doesn't have same resource constraints for raising armies or dealing with fickle faction opinions.
9) (NEW) The marshall's lack of combat experience leveling is just lame. I really love the idea of being able to custom tailor the non-combat knights with books, but for marshalls it doesn't feel right.

Questions:

9) why does the game have a world wide, non-province specific army supply cap AND a rapidly deteriorating ""tactical"" army supply? Makes NO sense.
10) (NEW) Why have peasants take away 3 town population with a total squad size of 400, but every other unit, so far, only takes away 1 population with squad sizes of 300? Taking away building capacity due to low population could be a thing, but that isn't one of the mechanics in KOH 2, so I'm a little confused. Lesson, don't waste time with peasants if you can help it at all. the -3 population takes WAY more capacity from you compared to the 150-250 gold and 1 pop that each normal unit takes.
11) (NEW) Why is the Levy pop even a thing? you aren't calling your vassals to fight for you, you're already taking from the provinces overall population, but heavily de-populating a town doesn't lower the peasants' attitudes towards you... Just like the non-province specific food limit plus army supply, why even have it?

In all, KoH 2 technically ""works"" as its supposed to, but they really didn't fix any of the minor issues that the first one had, introduced a myriad of new ""quirks"" into the mix, added a couple ""well that could have been neat"" moments, and ended up trying to borrow too many elements of CK3 for it to really feel like KoH anymore. graphics are worse, everything feels bland, the UI isn't great, The male heir issue is somehow worse than before, unit stats still only kinda line up with what's required to build them (CORRECTION: Unit stats are quite a bit better), none of the UI is as good as the original (CORRECTION: some of the UI is beneficial, some of it is worse, overall its a mixed bag), city build slots are going to simultaneously intrigue you and piss you off, knight leveling is going to be both cooler and completely retarded since there's no experience required, The lack of harbors or paying for boats is completely at odds with the rest of the games' direction, and you aren't going to understand why you're receiving a text box every time a province changes hands or someone breaks a trade agreement. cities are slower to build, but rural areas come back before you're done pillaging a province, the new factions are fickle franks, you'll lose kingdom power for everything but can only buy it back, there's still no pause button in single player (CORRECTION: ok, yeah, that one's on me. there's definitely a pause button), and you won't be able to find a wife, convince the other nation to marry her to your king, have kids before he's adult/old, and is dead before the kids are grown. there are no easy-view province goods' windows (Edit: there are, but like the rest of the UI buttons they're tiny and the click boxes muddle up at times), kingdom conflict status icon, province quick-glance, or local/special units (CORRECTION: There definitely are local units, but no Kingdom-specific special units that can be produced out of province).

And there's no way to try and ""reform"" England, France, or Scotland by starting in a fractured Western Europe or Britannia... WHERE ARE MY DAD GUM PRINCESS AND CROSSED SWORDS ICONS!?

Edit as of 12/12/2022: The comments got me on a couple of key points, Namely the pause button (Yeah, that's my bad), Special units, and Marriageable bachelorettes icons (the crossed hashes for princesses, princes, and marriage links make sense once you dig into the map a bit, but a ready-view option isn't there for a quick glance. Like everything else, you have to dig a bit to find anything with tiny icons and poor contrast. The eye strain is real.)

- The gameplay still same, a little bit hard in the beginning then it become easy once everything maxed out
- the task somehow become repetitive and boring once all the buildings tech tree has been built
- it’s feels just like a remastered from the predecessor, but it’s fine for me tho
- is there a kingdom quest just like the predecessor? It’s when you unite certain of provinces then will trigger to change the kingdom name 
- Tried the real battle, but it doesn’t give much impressions, army movements feels a bit clunky , so mostly I used automatic battle
- The battle will likely always win when you have more number of troops than the enemy
-  I found that using spearmen vs cavalry seems fair, spearmen have bigger chance to win against cavalry, cavalry has bigger chance to win against other foot soldiers other than spearmen
- Although we can only have 9 marshal (-1 for the king slot) may limit our army size, Hiring mercenaries came in handy when fighting a rebels or when in a war with other kingdoms, of course as long as you have enough money and the mercenary spawned in your territories. Hire them as many as you can to spam the enemies, but be mindful your mercenary may incites anger from neighboring kingdoms since they just walk as they please thru other kingdoms to go to their designation locations.
- For a merchant, I like the colonization idea, profitable deals, imports & exports goods
- For a scholar, the cultural boost decrease the stability of neighbors kingdom where rebel may spawn anytime
- Hopefully the devs will improve the game & add more features to make this game more enjoyable in the future.",1672330379,1672330379,True,2,0,0.514256954193115234,0,True,False,False

1)you can't zoom far enough out to survey to map.
2) I think the members of court should age like your Royal family so as to have to change them over time.. otherwise they only tend to rarely die.
3) The diplomacy is brilliant but I'd definitely make, making alliances easier, I can get my neighbours to be full friendly with me (trade, etc), but not to ally unless partners in war for a short time..

Skill tree and trade have been expanded. I like the new mini actions that marshals now have.
UI and graphics are great. Not too many visual effects and it is easy to figure out what is happening on the map and in a battle.
Royal court has been improved and now the queen and princesses have more uses.
AI is more intelligent. 
The battle felt a bit clunky. Understanding why my units claim that they are being flanked is hard. I find my units routing when the battle should be even. There might be some hidden modifies based on difficulty. 
You can't chase down the enemy marshal anymore as easily because you need to be somewhat aware of the capture points.
I think the initiative timer is a bit low. I know it prevents slowly girding down the castle defenses but if the starting position chosen for my army was bad, it takes most of the timer to maneuver to the other side.",1672083464,1672083464,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I came in hoping it's going to be similar to KOH1 and the spirit is there. I must mention at time there are a bit of ""jankiness"" on the map view, little bit of lag at rare times you see units jumping not moving smoothly, should be fixed with a patch or two. 
Game on it's own is great, having my first learning run trial by fire I guess, you can learn game quite easily without tooltips which are just annoying atleast for me. Diplomacy has issues like first one did, it's a bit better tho. 
Once you get a hang of it, it gets a lot easier. But it is harder than KOH1 which I like, 1 was quite easy to win, here it's a bit harder..

good point : 

A. Vivid details of the strategic map, you can feel everything moving on the map

B. detailed internal affairs system

C. detailed urban development planning and construction details

D. interesting military recruitment system

E. Vivid diplomatic details

F. Intuitive data

G. good game strategy design with full of addicted game depth , this is better than total war games strategy play 

H. Siege rts battle , you can see a vivid city , those people are scared and running home , the every building has a good sense of material 

【this game need many patch and keep patch up it ，it will be batter than now ，the very biggest problem is rts battle ，its super terrible ，they really need take care of it as soon as possible】

===================================================================

bad thing ：【i told you ：grassland nomadism is not Islam. Grassland is not only light infantry，your studio like idiot 】

【reason A】 : More than half of the national cultures and styles are almost the same , More than half of the military units are almost identical in equipment ，not too much cultural differences .

i think this game is good than AOE2 , just like that ... 【 i mean soldier unit equipments and unit model 】

you may have question : ""why dont you blame the Crusader Kings III"" ? because that game dont have manually battle , its only a big campaign map , this is the reason

【by the odin ：please , northern europe should have its own unique military unit , no just copy and paste , theyre not just central Europe 】

french and england , come on , there are different , and its a clear thing that most people knows 

Venice , Germany , Poland , its different units equipments , hmmm .... well

===================================================================

【reason B】：this game dont make good performances optimization 

【this games Manual Battlefield graphics and performance is very very very and very super worst than the game under the list】 : 【if you have the performances problem just turn off the SSRT】

AOE4 , They Are Billions , Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3 , AOE2-DE , AOE3-DE , Act Of Aggression , Warhammer 40,000: Dawn Of War III , Stronghold: Warlords , total war games and more ....

===================================================================

【reason C】：RTS battlefield ：its very Stiff units fight and movements ，camera angle almost perpendicular to 90 degrees , this is terrible , its uncomfortable , and there is no any tactical actions can be selected , all your units in the battlefield are just like a stupid wood stand there and do nothing , they will never rise their shield do defend the arrow attack , and you cant choose any tactical to improve your army , you cavalry like idiot to follow the archers and running around with the archers , for what ???? the cavalry even cant kill the archer apace

===================================================================

【reason D】：The number of lords and the number of troops are too limited ，the studio has never considered what to do when you have huge territory in the later stage

===================================================================

【reason E】：the rebel system is purely designed to embarrass players

===================================================================

SSRT graphics option : such a fuuuking stupid idiot thing , you told me this is your ray-tracing  ? ray-tracing what ? there is nothing special to change okay ?????????????????? its just fuuking a Bloom , the map doesnt even have any specular reflections , the rts battle map is like a big nothing !! , there is nothing on there , but this SSRT , its truly damned thing to waste too many resources and performances , just turn this fuuker off .

There is not really any commonality beyond that. 

Playing on normal mode as England the AI decisions didn't make a whole bunch of sense. I would be winning wars and the enemy would refuse to surrender or even accept a white peace.

Compared to the other games on the market, looking at Crusader Kings 3 it a dumbed down version but i liked it since it has less politics and menu swapping and puts you in the action.

Tactical battle renderings aren't as good as KoH I, despite 15 years on to get it right.  Campaign dynamics aren't appreciable better, the graphics not much of an improvement over the original.  Despite the hype, the game is not much of an improvement in implementation either.  The game puts heavy emphasis on stability but makes growing it virtually impossible and, even on an easy setting, ensures it will tank at the slightest event.  The ratio of being able to make money versus the cost of buying anything is completely screwed up, meaning the economy model is unbalanced.  While there seems to be a steep learning curve in mastering the game's dynamics, it's really not that challenging, while the algorithms governing game play are clumsy.  One example: you need a male heir to succeed your king (historically accurate) who can die without warning but the game can make it so your family only has daughters.  You'd be better off buying or playing the original.

Further game play doesn't improve the recommendation.  There are a whole range of imbalances: the cost of acquiring anything--troops, buildings, etc.--far exceeds the ability to build facilities or trade connections that pay anything like a useful sum.  Build a supposed income-generating building for 400 and it might generate 1 or 2 in return.  Trade agreements return paltry amounts.  There's an imbalance in trying to maintain stability.  You start in the negative and how to improve it is unclear.  Then you king dies and stability drops to -20 and everyone declares war on you; and you can't afford an army to fight back.

This game has small aspects of both games plus its own original approach(I haven't played KoH1). However, it definitely is an acquired taste. Played for about 2+ hours after purchase, went for a refund immediately(not possible after 2+ hours haha), it wasn't what I expected at first; so I went back to the game to at least get my money's worth, and before I knew it, slowly but surely, as I learned the game mechanics and other small details, I started liking it more and more. Is it WORTH $45?! At first you'd deny it, but it is an investment! I'm sure there are tons of much needed updates from the devs on the way!
 
1. My main concern tho is the combat system needs tons of attention. AI is simply not bright haha. You can be outnumbered 2to1 and still win by solely aiming for the enemy army leader/s(as soon as they die, you win no matter the odds). Fun exploit early game but gets old real quick mid to late game. 

2. Need to be able to zoom out further in combat; major setback. Plus camera rotation(big plus!!!)

3. Troop morale collapses way too fast; leaving little to no time for proper strategizing. (also if enough soldiers retreat, they should be allowed to regroup or reinforce nearby town garrison{retreat system is just lacking})

4. Also I think court-members/knights should ONLY level up through books AFTER having met an experience quota(by actually doing the job); else it just breaks immersion by generating max tier knights right after being hired. Kinda cheesy.

5. Final point, small details here and there like scribes needing wine to develop ink(taboo in Muslim kingdoms) or certain culture classes lacking elite units just breaks immersion for me.

Otherwise fun grand strategy game that needs lots of polishing, so purchase if you see potential like I do!!!",1671742182,1671742182,True,20,1,0.665123462677001953,0,True,False,False

Let me preface that I have KoH1 and have had it since 2004 when it released.  So I'm not going in blind.

I'll start a list of Pros/Cons

Pros:
+Graphics are better than 2004, one would hope
+Plenty of starting options. Unlike Total War where only a dozen kingdoms are playable, EVERY kingdom is playable.
+Interesting change to buildings (partial con listed below)
+Sound/Voiceovers stay true to the original
+Nobles are more powerful as a whole but I think every noble should be able to lead an army regardless of type. Maybe they can and I missed it. Only 2 hours in.
+Plenty of goods to acquire
+Traditions seem powerful/new
+Beloved Kingdom Advantages still in game
+Plenty of QoL improvements

Con:
-You only get 10% of your gold from Ungoverned Provinces - I kinda don't mind but maybe jump it up to 25%.
-Still only 9 Royal Court Slots.
-Zoom isn't great. It's fine on minimap.
-Some resolution/fidelity issues with text/icons.",1670357709,1671722055,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Cons:
- AI countries have armies stupidly fast. I am talking steve harvey, making a whole audience laugh based on an inappropiate joke, type of fast
- Declaring war on a country leads to the rest of the world declaring war on you after 2 minutes of the initial war declaration
- Spies (even with 5% detection rate (2.5% on successful attempt)) get caught lackin every 5 actions or so
- Diplomats are either broken asf or really underpowered. I genuinely have no clue. Sometimes they do absolutely nothing and sometimes the defensive/invasion pacts carry you through whole war.
- The UI definitely needs some quality of life updates.
- The Clergy, Merchants and peasantry will beat the everliving shit out of you if you breathe too much oxygen at once (although the peasantry is mad easy to get good with again by just popping a couple of feasts)
- Your kings inability to marry and reproduce hurts my feelings to the core
- Very hard difficulty is just unfair. I understand you have to be smart about your decisions but it doesn't feel fair at any point of the playthrough
- Game has the same problem as it's predecessor, if you survive the first 1-2 hours of the game you'll just snowball for the rest of it. It's just conquering the map piece by piece after that
- Countries give up their land stupidly easy. I deadass bought every single town of france (except the last one) in under 5 minutes
- I know I touched it in the previous sentences but this game is genuinely unfair in regards to the start of the game. Either you take your first 2-3 towns or you restart the run due to being in war with the rest of the world somehow
- You have to pay to fill the food reserves of your marshals even though you own the town, idk bout that one
- 

Pros:
- I really like the new building upgrade system. It's simple, it's easy, my dementia can handle it, and even ben shapiro couldn't tie it to a race discussion (yet)
- Mercenaries can fight for you now by paying them
- Improved diplomatic options (although imo they're still lacking considering the first KoH is 14 years old)

deadass couldn't think of anything else

""Meh's"":
- Apparently the pope is only interested in your marshals and nobody else's for his crusades
- Game doesn't really feel like a huge improvement over it's predecessor
- Overpriced in my opinion
- There's simply better alternatives for this genre of games (although none can really come close to the feeling of the original knights of honor)
- I don't like the control points in tactical battles. I don't know why they're a thing. Who doesn't know the major battles of the early 1300's, when an army stood in a certain position for a couple minutes and the enemy went ""ah shit, yall won I guess"", however I would kinda understand it in sieges.
- The 1 Hour grace period feels so cheap for this game. I understand the player shouldn't be attacked in the first 5 seconds of the game, but why do I have to feel like a toddler whose hand is being held at the start of the game?

Well, for the last couple of years, following the development cycle, I gotta say, this has been a tiny bit of a disappointment. The previous game is 14 years old and what we got is a graphically updated game with slight mechanic tweaks and ai improvements.

I guess the real knights of honor II: Sovereign were the friendships we made along the journey

+ Large sandbox map with many kingdoms and provinces doing their thing. Any kingdom or province can be played from 3 different starting dates
+ Loads of character portraits all done in line with the art style of the game. Aging and culture are all taken into account and even female characters have portraits (not always the case even from the largest studios)
+ AI is no pushover but also doesnt seem like its cheating it just plays the game decently
+ Tactical battles with terrain, unit and morale effects. Even sieges are in here is a very rudimentary form
+ Good music and voice -over for almost every action and event
+ The game is stacked with minor features related to various religions, trade and a decently fleshed out espionage system
+ Strategic map overview has tons of layers and most of them are done in a really thematic way

Is the game perfect? No, no game is perfect some negatives I can say:
- Graphics:  some banners and army units are low res that is striking on 4K and large monitor
- AI still tends to throw away its army leader a bit too easily

I hate how Content Creators and others have hated on the game so much this isn't setting out to give us a Total War or Crusader King experience it is a different one entirely. I understand the game is lacking however its new. 

For all the old heads out there saying it sucks its the same as the first one I mean you'd 100% be correct it is the same. However it doesn't suck. I hope to see this developing team truly run with content in this game and it appears to me as though they given it a mod heavy approach possibly shooting for something kind of like Bannerlord where the community mods makes the game. 

I personally would love to see many changes come like more customization I need to be sucked in more. We 100% need more diplomacy options and events the game is lacking heavy on events. I would like to see thew addition of a weather system. Battles although slightly enjoyable need revamp to a modern day style it doesn't need to be like TTW just find your nitch. 

There is alot that could and should be added the game is very very new and I hope to see these broad ideas listed above explored by developers. However give the game 5 out 5.

Novelty board game vibes where things feel deep and interesting at first, but ultimately playing well is about exploits more than immersion. I like that the building/resource system is something taken seriously where aquiring an important resource can be a serious goal/gamechanger for your nation and you're fighting over more than just ""more land,"" but the fact that the AI is wildly incompetent at producing these resources means they end up being just another flavor of blobbing.  


They also kill the ""historical"" vibe of the game with some weird decisions and RNG.  Like it's cool to have 3 different start dates for a variety of start positions, but due to RNG they hardly matter.  The only thing ""set"" about a nation is the number of provinces it starts with.  Resources are randomly distributed across the world as are province types, so it's not like different nations represent meaningfully different start positions/strategic situations.  No matter what nation you pick you start with no army, no buildings, a random selection of resources and random settlement types in your provinces.  It makes starts feel like dice throws as opposed to specific nations/start dates having a unique feel.


Also, don't be sold on ""real time battles.""  They're a complete joke.  If you want to exploit them it's instant win because the AI is beyond awful.  If you want to play them straight, they're mobile game tier.


Overall feels like good bones that could be great with mods, so I'll cross my fingers for workshop support.

I am still a bit unsure what to make of this game, but I acknowledge that the issue with new players being steamrolled by aggressive AI on 'Easy' mode has been fixed.

So the positives in this game are some of the audio work - I liked the voice actors, they give the game character. I also think the music, while a bit sparse at times, is in general quite good and seems to fit the time period depicted. The art style is worth some praise too, I liked the style of the illustrations and the building cards in this game. These are much better than what was available in older games like 'Medieval 2 Total War'. 

Diplomacy seems to more or less make sense, from what I can see. Other kingdoms will sign trade deals if it is reasonable to do so. Kingdoms that are natural rivals will be more hesitant. Allies even offer to help you in war, which I thought was great. I also liked the royal marriages. 

The building tech tree seems to make sense, pretty much. At first you don't have much money, but as you invest in merchants and gradually build up your trade and economy, you can eventually become quite rich. 

Battles are a bit oversimplified in my opinion - killing the enemy leader instantly ends the battle, which I think is a mistake - I tried fighting a battle and the enemy leader just charged right out the gate into my army and got himself killed, ending the battle before it had barely even begun. 

Animations for combat are... okay. Not amazing, but OK I guess. This isn't 'Total War', but most users will know that already. To be honest I need to spend more time in the battles to really form an opinion about it. I haven't played enough to know. My first attempts at battle (on release day) involved getting absolutely stomped by enemy archers, which seemed a bit OP - but it's possible that may have been addressed by the recent patch. 

In my first England campaign since the patch, I managed to send an army to Bordeaux and retake it with some help from an allied force. I also managed to not get attacked by Scotland, which was a relief. This is game is playable now for beginners, which is an improvement on the situation compared with release day. 

I still don't know how to rate this overall - I'd say my impression is it's okay now, maybe not groundbreaking, but I'll probably have to give it some more time and play as some other factions to get more of a sense of whether I like it or not. 

Tentative rating - 6 or maybe 7 out of 10?  

If my opinion changes (again), I'll update this further.",1670456899,1671466953,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Disclaimer: I don't know the predecessor and write this after a single won game on 'hard' out of two games played, maybe some of the game mechanics only become meaningful on higher difficulties

What I didn't like
* The whole seafaring aspect seems kinda pointless, I had exactly one fight on the water as sweden, and only because i wanted to see it
* Fame, culture, happiness? None of this mattered for me, I don't even know where to look culture and happiness up
* Until the very end it was unclear what 'Elite' units are, and I still don't know which regions has which unit.
* None of the unit stats mattered to me, I just created a blob of units and made sure I had more then the enemy (by having a second army nearby). Just avoid peasants
* Crusades seem more like a gimmick. I rejected sending money or leading it and nobody cared
* Why would I even bother with religion, except for the small stability buff?
* Trade zones or whatever its called - totally unclear what province goes into which trade zone. Had some north african provinces in my Kalmar trade zone at the end, but poland chose to have their own
* Castles are pointless, everyone can just walk around them, and the enemy of course does. Why would I even bother with traits that improve them?
* Espionage (or whatever its called) is too expensive in the beginning and in the end I am winning anyways
* Expeditions and profitable trades are kind of the same thing. Invest some money for a chance of more money
* Food - I never ran out of it, traded some away and didn't built exactly one farm/granary/whatever
* Terrain features. Didn't notice an impact
* By midgame it appears that many opponents where walking around with 3 'light archer'-only armies that got trampled by the two or so heavy cavalry I had in my single blob
* My king / heir have stats for areas (and so have wifes) and I have no clue what they do

What I liked
* Map looks nice
* Choosing the right character for a province requires a bit of thinking
* Choosing the right wars / battles
* 64 resources that all have a small impact are also have dependencies on each other
* kingdom traits
Ultimately, I won with only
* automatically resolved fights
* merchants and marshalls
* conquering spree to aquire 30 regions covering almost all resources
* trading the rest - victory.

So far it has very limited replayability, maybe going for a different victory type or trying smaller countries that inevitebly have it harder to expand and get their economy going, but the game loop itself feels very shallow. Still, if you are a fan of these type of games I would still recommend it.

If you've played the old Knights of Honor, this is an improvement in almost all areas. I've never played the real-time battles in old-school KoH, but here they are clunky as hell ( due to the framerate ). Other than that, though, this one is an upgrade, especially when it comes to buildings in the cities. Due to the fact that you can have upgrades for each buildling, you don't encounter the old problem with having to demolish something in order to make way for other stuff. 

If you're not familiar with KoH but have found Crusader Kings to be too hard to get into, this one is the perfect solution. There is a learning curve, but it's nowehere near as steep and you can get into the action ( of warfare and conquer ) much easier.

I payed full price and don't regret it but I have a HEAVY nostalgia attachment to it, and it is fun, but I'd advise get it with a discount this is worth at most 25€, no offense to the dev team but its what I feel like it is.

- It retains basically the same gameplay with its predecessor, with some tweaks on QoL features
- Learning curve is good, still simple enough for new player to learn compared to other Grand-Strategy games
- Nice representational graphics, which is fairly uncommon for a grand-strategy game
- Hint of mod support

Cons:
- It lost a bit of the medieval atmosphere compared to the its predecessor
- Compared to the first game, manual battle is the MAJOR issue here. The first game already nerfed archers into a historically balanced class, but this game had chosen to take a step further which made tactical cavalry vs pikemen vs archer vs swordsmen battle progress really weird.

Conclusion:
Knights of Honor II really maintains its identity as a sequel of Knights of Honor: a semi-idle medieval grand strategy game. Old players may see this game as a weird reskin, a feeling similar to everyone who played Age of Empires series beyond its second installment. However, deep into the gameplay there are hints of nice changes here and there.

- This game has its own identity, mixing the elements of grand strategy and real-time battle strategy, managing your kingdoms, trade, diplomacy, warfare and espionage etc.

- This sequel also adds extra options before you start game like minor victory types (if you don't want to conquer whole map) and minor adjustment along with classic selecting starting date too.

- Apart from various knight types, opportunity also play a big role here for each knight assign to marshal, spy,diplomat, cleric and merchant, bringing new aspect events that play along during peace or war time.

- There is also a few glaring issue as well such as cannot naming your own knights, and cheesing battle by rushing victory point (this cheesing is already have a patched by more troop you have, slower capturing point is).

Overall, this game is worthy successor to KoH 1 for me despite someone else say it is KoH 1.5 and please do not compare or match this game to other genre (I am not going to say the game name as you already know it), like i said in the first place this game has it's own identity.

You can play long campaigns or focus on fast victory. Each start of the game has a fixed province and kingdom position based on the year chosen from 3 possible. Each province has several /up to 7/ villages and one main town in which you can build structures. Some of the structures give goods, some resources, and some additional bonuses. Many of the structures require specific prerequisites to be fulfilled /goods to produce or import, or previous buildings to be build/. Each start of the game from the beginning shuffles the mineral deposits, resources and type of villages in each province, so every new game is unique.

You have up to 8 people in your royal court plus your king. They age and may die or get captured by another kingdom /Your king is the one that may die of old age too and in this case if you have a heir, then he takes the throne/. Armies can be led only by a court member or your king if he has military training. Each of your court members and your king have 5 slots for skills, and each skill can be upgraded to level 3. Those skills give you additional perks in the game. Each type of court member has specific primary and secondary skills from which you may choose. Also when you upgrade a skill to level 3 you can pick it as an advantage for your kingdom and unlock additional bonuses for the kingdom itself and a governor of a town. Your court members and you king may be governors giving additional bonuses to the province they govern.

You can pause or speed up the time anytime in the game. Battles are either manual in a specific terrain setting, or automatic if you don't want to control the units yourself. The recruitment of units depends on the buildings you have built and the resources you have. You can also hire troops from constantly moving mercenaries camps. They gain experience and become stronger if they survive battles. They also get bonuses from terrain and commander skills. The number of armies you can levy depend on the number of marshals you have in your court. You can have marshal, merchant, cleric, diplomat, and spy in your court in a total of 8 slots /plus one for your king and his specialization/. You can have more than one of each, but each new one takes one more slot and the upkeep increases more than it would for a unique type. 

In a nutshell you have a huge set of possibilities that you can choose from in a very pleasantly built world with nice soundtrack. The game is not in the huge scope of Total War or similar, but it offers a simpler and more casual game play that varies on every game start. You win the game in the standard mode by either conquering the whole map, unlocking all fields of kingdom development /produce, import all goods for the world/, or by winning an election for Emperor of the world. I have not tried the multiplayer yet, but it should be fun too.

Diplomacy is a bit limited and you don't have many options in it. The AI will attack you almost every time you have royal marriage and your king dies, even in ridiculous cases. 

The positive sides of this game outweigh the negatives. For me this is a fun game to play that is not so demanding on time and offers a pleasant experience. I would recommend this game to people who like RTS and don't want the game to get way too complicated, but want to still have many options and each game to have a different start conditions.",1671283288,1671283687,True,3,0,0.529230713844299316,0,True,False,False

1. It's isn't historically accurate enough to be considered a sim or grand strategy
  a. aging only applies to kings and princes, other leaders are ageless
  b. maritime regions have low in-game maritime strength
  c. No in-game year display
  d. resource locations are random
  e. diplomacy options are very limited (some seem to have been forgotten such as transferring or aiding vassals despite in-game references)

2. No contest between tall vs wide. You have to go wide. 
  a. You don't start hitting any growth penalties until you get to 9 territories due to how governors work, by which point you're stronger than 90% of the AI nations. 
  b. Meanwhile you hit growth penalties after your 4th building. This means if you're a one-province state you have 1 building for basic units, 1 building for food to support a bare-minimum army, and 2 buildings left over to produce maybe 2-5 of the ~50 resources you need to claim victory.

3. It's arcadey but not in a fun way
  a. AI spawns with 4K mid-game armies while you get nothing so have fun if AI zerg rushes you, meanwhile the mid/late game ai is zero threat.
  b. 4-8 building slots per city, but ~50 unique resources means a lot of micromanaging the economy to progress through your tech. 
To build advanced units you need advanced materials, each of which requires prerequisite materials, but all of these are each locked behind a building requiring cash and a building slot. It leads to weird situations like forcing you to recruit units in regions that don't have iron, horses, etc. because harvesting those materials uses up your very limited building slots.
  c. low initial income means sitting around idle for long periods of time.
  d. Random skill availability means you can't build leaders how you'd like to.
  e. Limited # of armies based on limited total leader slots + the fact that you really need to move armies in pairs to be effective at fighting/sieging = 1 - 2 blob armies all game long.
  f. Many key mechanics are outside of your direct control. This may work for sim games, but not for arcadey games.
  g. Real-time battles are inferior to Total War and Lords of the Realm 2. 
      Graphics on par with 15-year old games.
      Very limited camera control.
      No lockable formations.
      Bad terrain interactions with formations and pathfinding.
      Max 8 units per army.
      Unit strengths are imbalanced - rock-paper-scissor formula is off plus just bring 2 catapults with your army if you want to auto-win.

4. This thing crashes on it's main menu 50% of the time.

Recommendations to the devs:
Balance the AI by giving them more buffs late game, but reduce the early-game boost.
Remove building slot limitations or dramatically increase it.
Nerf catapults. They are the best archers in the game at present.
Increase early game income and normalize early-game building costs to increase build diversity.",1671215300,1671215300,False,8,0,0.483677506446838379,0,True,False,False

First, I have to say, as a player who already played Crusader King & Total War series, this is a disappointment. But it's still have some silver lining, and I will try to summarize it for you.

[b] Cons: [/b]
If you already played Crusader King, you will find this game is just too simple in every way:
- For diplomatic, you have very few options to interact with other Kingdoms (Provinces): 
-- Offer <something>
-- Demand <something>
-- Trade Agreement (and you have no way to cancel it unless you declare war & suffer penalty lol)
--  Non-aggressive pact
-- Declare war
-- (Basically the end)

- For Military/Warfare: they have limit troop types: light & heavy troop with 4 types sword, spear, cavalry, bow, and some special troops. The thing here is, if there's only simulation battle, I will have no issue with it, but you can directly take control & lead your troop into battle like Total War, so that I must set higher expectation for it, and it's a huge disappointment: Limit troops & also limit battlefield scenes made the feature quickly turn to boring stuff. After a few battle, I got bored & just auto-resolved them all the time.
- I also see there's a elite unit (Royal Armory building) but I don't know what it is. Maybe I didn't reach the endgame yet.

- Siege simulation is also ridiculous, for example:
 -- Let's say I have 4k troops with 4 bow squads, defended against enemy troop with also 4k troops & 5 bow squad (no siege equipment, their commander is also a lv1 trash). 
 -- The siege drag on and the enemy ran out of supply first, but they only got some debuff like -speed, -def... At that time, they have 3k troops remained, and I only got 1k6 (they only have 1 more bow squad than me, and I stay behind the wall dude, why's a big difference???). 
 -- The siege still drag on and eventually I lost, although I didn't run out of supply, and they have nothing to eat halfway. What a godly army! 

- AI seem too focus on warfare & neglected their economy. In my gameplay, I hardly see a Kingdom (Province) in peace & develop their economy, there's always war and they just spend all their man & money into war. I found few places that have the resource I need, but they was just abandoned their province and charge into war everytime. I waited a very long time with the hope that they will build something to make the resource available for import, but nothing happen (lol). And then I found out that I'm the richest kingdom in the world, even I only have 3 province (???)
- And AI also look stupid to me, they will always charge straight to your army for a fight, even they have less troops than you, and their commander also not better than yours. You can also easily bait them to get into your territory to suffer a heavy morale penalty, then attack them with you full morale army and easily beat them.

- The QoL is not so good, for example, I want to build a building, it required some resources, and I have a very hard time to find out how to produce them (I know there's a Royal Library, but to find the thing I need take a lot of time), and then a very hard time to find the resources on the map.

- Inheritance are less interesting to me (as a Crusader King player).

[b] Some mixed feeling: [/b]
- Spy, Clergy functionality also had very limit options. Why I didn't put them into Negative? Because IMO, when it come to grand strategy games, the most important thing beside Warfare is Diplomacy, or interaction between Players (you & AI), so I have much higher expectation for Diplomacy, other is just a ""good to have"". And there's people will think: limit functionalities => simple => easy to approach.
- Limit events compare to Crusader King. But how can you compare the amount of events with Crusader King? It's just unfair for this game. So I won't say it's a negative thing.

[b] Pros: [/b]
- The resources & building chain functionalities made the game very interesting in Economy way. To build high tier building, get your powerful buff you must have required resources first. And it will affect the path your kingdom will take, either battle for it if it's near, or try to get it by trading and importing if it's too far from your kingdom, or you're just too weak to take it by force... But like I said in Cons, the trading path is currently ruined by the AI behavior, too much aggressive... 
- Skill, abilities for characters are also interesting, there's not much skills in game, but it's enough for you to build a King/Knight with the set of skills you want them to have for their specific roles. The fact that the King can age and die, while the knights are immortal also look funny to me.

[b] Conclusions: [/b]
Despite many negative feedback I gave above, I'm still find this game worth my money, because it's still have some interesting things to play. If I haven't played Crusader King before, I think I will love this game. And who know, maybe in the future, they will make some update, or dlc to improve the gameplay.
- If you're a fan of Crusader King, and hope for the same experience, I would say you shouldn't buy it. Because you may find it's very disappoint in many ways of the gameplay.
- But if you didn't play Crusader King before, or you just can't bear with the complexity Crusader King gave you, and want a more approachable gameplay. You should try this one. This can be a good start for you.",1671210220,1671212351,True,2,0,0.502583980560302734,0,True,False,False

The Cons first , 

1) battle system can be a bit simplified if you play real time format , however for the """"auto resolve"""" ver is way more sensible than total war series and easier to understand and use well by players 

2) alright i know they said they will fix it so im just gonna lightly put it here that zoom level can be improved

3) for those expecting super macro management might disappoint (there are only 8 main """"characters"""" you can really control in your faction) 

4) might wanna add a bit more unit types 


Pros :

1) HOLY SHIT, because it really brings out the effort to let player know how realistically hard it is for a faction to build up from the beginning and build your provinces up and nice army , so when you LOSE THEM THE PAIN IS ULTRA REAL , which does keep you on your toes as WAR is very often in this game

2) speaking of war , if you think its gonna be like total war where you can easily blitz through 10 provinces , yeah not gonna happen here buddy , the time you need to stabilize the newly conquered  province is very realistic, and DEAR GOD REBELLIONS ARE ABSOLUTELY  SCARY AS F 

3) AI so far is pretty good , like i said above its pretty hard to blitz through multiple provinces let alone factions , they will BULLY YOU if you make the wrong choices in game (or let your daughter marry the wrong man lol) , and yeah crusades and Jihads are well represented (well mostly)

4) fun chain building idea so you dont have to grind the same set up over and over again , many combos and neat little build options in different provinces 


note : at of this time of the review steam workshop isnt open to support this game yet , but in game there are mod options , so if later steam workshop is included in the support then this game is worth 8 / 10 , right now as it sits on first launch ill give it a 7/10",1671201520,1671201520,True,3,0,0.526153862476348877,0,True,False,False

I don't often(ever?) write reviews, but I was moved to do so by the number of people criticising the game on release who clearly didn't know what to expect ( This is not Total War, it's not CK3 , it is KNIGHTS OF HONOR! )

Knight of Honor is a real-time strategy game but played on a grand strategy map.  It has some real time battle elements (which are poor in terms of AI and unit variety in battle currently) but most of the game is kingdom managements and realtime decision making and positions. 

Everything happens in the world at the same time. There's no turns, dates or waiting around for everyone else to make decisions. 

The main aim of the game is to dominate the map and manage your kingdom effectively with limited resources.  You are limited to a certain number of Knights and your royal family, who all specialise in a set role (General,Trader,Spy,Diplomat,Priest). Whilst this may not suit everyone, it is a USP in my book and sticks to the Ethos of KOH1.

All of these roles can provide crucial benefits and need to be used and trained wisely to suit the current state of your kingdom. Unlike many games these roles are capped, regardless of your size and power, so a good start doesn't mean you snowball away from your opponents. If someone chooses to field 8 generals, you will have a hard time stopping them militarily(at least until their economy collapses) but before you know it diplomats are forming massive defensive alliances.  
Equally the larger you get, the more tactical you have to be with where and how you deploy your Knights, as you are managing larger kingdomes with the same roles and people.

The game looks like a revamped version of the original, but has brought in a number of new features, trade power/centres, invasion and defence pacts, and a much wider variety of skills and character managements. Some of these are good, some may be less so, and some I am still getting to grips with, but overall this is a good thing as it keeps the game interesting. 

However, the price point does make me wince for those who are new to the franchise, even as a big fan I think £38 is steep for what you get. 
I'm hoping that the Devs will continue to work on this game and improve the AI in battle, introduce more unique units and strategies, and  SIRE, PLEASE GIVE US A PROPER ZOOM OUT!




TLDR: 
Pros-True to the original, graphics and quality of life improvements. Plenty of replayability
Cons- Poor RTS battles, the UI and view window takes some getting used to, The cost (£38) is a little high.

I love the game having played the original, and would highly recommend, but if you are unfamiliar with the franchise perhaps wait for a sale or watch some gameplay before shelling out the full price",1671184756,1671184756,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

When I am learning the game on easy, I do not expect the entire world to pile on me, the worst thing about it, made no sense, since I kept good relations with everybody...

One other problem is HOW COSTLY everything is, don't get me wrong I like the province specialization, and the fact that you will have to be strategic with your spending, that is fun and feels fresh in KOH 2 in comparison to the original, but the price of upgrades, troop upkeep, price of buildings in town or fortification of your main province town, those things is INSANELY costly, and imagine that, I was playing with Bulgaria, because I am Bulgarian, and that is a fairly large and wealthy state for the period I chose to play in. I was still having massive difficulty affording things, with 4 merchants as well.

Another problem is how randomly the respect of nobles/merchants/military generals/etc is modified due to events. Speaking of events and messages, you get overwhelmed so quickly by those, and you get informed frequently too..

Preparations in terms of gathering support for invasions prior to attacking, embedding spies, securing non aggression pacts and improving your military and economy are all absolutely vital.

In addition the UI is clear and tooltips are excellent so I was able to pick up and play with very little problem but you learn more and more of the nuances of the game as you play.

I played the first game a lot. It was my first love. And for the second one I can tell that it's wonderful again. 

Didn't encounter any bug so far. Also love the new system about the trading;
- You can not make trade agreements if other kingdom is far away
- You have limited trade power so even if you have agreement with 10 kingdom you need to choose wisely who you'll trade with.
- Sometimes you'll see there is a trade-center in some towns. And it's giving a lot of gold according to your products.
- Trades'll start as small-trade and can scale up to medium and large if you have enough trade powers.
- Sometimes your merchants'll ask you that another kingdom's asking your food/gold for gold/food. And other stuff.
- Your merchants can do some tricks to change relation between two different kingdom with some events.
- some more thing that I forget or didn't see yet.

They change building system as well. Now you don't need to give too much attention about every town's building a lot. I remember when I was playing first game it was always bothering me to manage every buildings in every town that I conquer. It's too many multi tasking for me I can clearly say that. 

But now they just put 8 slots for buildings and every building have different number of sub-buildings. After you finish any sub-building you don't need to do it again for another town. They're something like upgrades for that buildings. For ex: If you put Inn to your market place, and build another market place one of your towns. It'll automatically build Inn as well.

You just need to worry about what kind of town it'll be there; military, books-religion, gold-trade goods etc.

I'm still exploring the game and they actually did a good job. It feels like old times but a bit more modern way. More hardcore in someways. More slow maybe? But definitively more comfortable to manage.

PS: I don't control the fights. Never did in first game and 'll not do in this game as well. It's just not for me.

Review will cover pros & cons, as well as comparisons to similar games.

Played one campaign on historical mode. Won campaign through Advantages Victory.

Summary :  8.5/10(buy), Excellent title, with some polish it could rival Civ V, Anno 1800, with the innovation and scale it has. Steep learning curve but not impossible/too daunting to pick up. Satisfying grand strategy gameplay.

*I have not played enough CK to compare it so I will refrain.

=============

CONS:

This is NOT a Total war/Bannerlord title. If you are looking for massive combat on an epic scale, and that's what you want, KOH II is not a game for you.

The RTS battlefield AI is quite stupid in comparison to both Total War & Bannerlord. And I mean it's really dumb, like dumber than Rome Total War AI, and yes, its the 2005(?) Rome Total War I'm referring to.

[b]When the enemy general(s) die, you win the battle, regardless of how many enemy forces are on the field.[/b]

I have won multiple battles with way less casualties than I should have taken simply because the enemy general suicide charged my army.

After that, the entire enemy army just..vanishes. Whatever units, elite or not, will just.. disappear. While this makes for some easy/fast way to kill off your enemy by cheesing, it takes away the challenge of battlefield combat.

It kind of compensates for how hard/sneaky the AI is on the grand strategy map however.

The enemy general AI seems to scale with their level but even then it isn't capable of more complex flanking/mixed arms tactics.

Mercenary armies are available for hire as whole for large sums and are great as a distraction for your enemy, but you can't control them on the grand strategy map or in battle, which doesn't make sense since.. you paid them?

On the army composition map, there are hard to find tooltips/tips to increase the strength(manpower) of your army, which I find is a major pain point for new players as its a major disadvantage if you don't know/can't find it.

Army manpower is also not reflected graphically in terms of the size of units on the RTS battlefield. E.g a cavalry unit with an upgraded 55 manpower will look similar to one with 36 manpower(or whatever the original size is) on the battlefield.

It is also not explained very clearly on how army replenishment works and how much it will cost. It would be good if there was a slow auto-replenishment feature instead of a one-click/buy for replenishment of manpower in your army.

Another gripe I have is that military related products such as gunpowder and cannons, are not available on the battlefield to your armies.

UI -

[b]The UI is fine, but needs a bit of work to make it a bit more intuitive.[/b]

My biggest gripe is the inability to rotate your view on the RTS battlefield map, and zoom out further.

The grand strategy map takes some getting used to. The icons on it are a bit small and some disappear/reappear strangely, especially when selecting your knights for options.

The font for the subtext and text is a bit small too which might make it harder to read.

While there is a short pop-up text tutorial on how to use the map, it uses icons mainly, and doesn't list them very clearly, so you gotta remember/get familiarized with the grand strategy map.


=============

PROS:

SCALE -

Grand Strategy Map is quite detailed and HUGE. Not as huge as 3 Kingdoms Total war, but large enough that you can be a major power of Northern Europe and still not feel like you're invincible. 

Often, crusades being called let you see how far and how long it takes for Western European crusaders to reach North Africa and the Middle East.

DIPLOMACY -

Diplomacy is quite straightforward in terms of UI but complex and nuanced through marriage pacts, defensive pacts, alliances, provocations to war, and inheritances. 

Diplomacy and alliances play a major part to winning, as no nation that has stood alone has found itself winning, versus 3 or 4 others of similar size (in my playthrough).

You can influence diplomacy directly, but can affect relations via your Knights. I have not done this a lot as I preferred to go for the economic + military might style of play.

Perhaps this is where people with experience playing CK 2 might have more to say. 

In my playthrough, making a royal marriage without understanding what it entailed led to a war between me and my former allies when they were entitled to a province of mine upon someone's death. I refused and then we went to war.

There was also an instance where a war was instigated between my faction and another (I suspect) due to the war notification flavour text. Such small details really help make it feel very intriguing.

The devs definitely put a lot of effort into this part.

WAR -

When war breaks out, expect no mercy. The enemy or enemies will do all they can to kneecap your country, and you can and are expected to do the same.

They will raid and pillage your most valuable villages and towns to prevent you from raising more troops, and then attempt to crush you with overwhelming force on the battlefield before taking your towns. 

Sieges take forever, and you best be sure you've smashed your enemies armies on the battlefield lest they overwhelm your armies while they are besieging a town.

Losing a high level knight and/or army on the battlefield is also a major blow, as it will take a lot of time and resources to build up another. 

The enemy tends to spam low quality armies, as most factions aren't rich enough to field professional armies. But the number of armies can quickly overwhelm you, especially if your territory is spread out.

Mercenary armies are available for hire as whole for large sums and are great as a distraction for your enemy, but you can't control them - that said, they occasionally help in sieges and battles. 

You can also hire individual units from them to make up any tactical weaknesses in your army, which I found a neat feature.

Sieges take forever when you are starving out an enemy, but during a SIEGE ASSAULT, the attackers are at a severe disadvantage, and siege fortifications(castle towers etc) do dish out considerable damage.

As there are no siege towers(?why?) your soldiers either have to ram down the gates with a ram(special upgrade), use a catapult(special upgrade) or just use ladders to climb up the walls. 

After climbing the walls, expect fierce resistance if the defenders have a soldier garrison(not peasants, which auto spawn).

The siege defense AI is actually quite solid, unless you get attacked by a relieving force, in which case you can probably expect a quick victory once you kill the enemy general.

ECONOMY -

The economy is quite complex, and upgrades take time and are slow when you first start.

Knights really help with this, and provide major boosts to income and trade capacity once leveled up.

If you put effort into the economy and your knights, the dividends that return can be massive.

I was literally swimming in gold, so much so that inflation hit my treasury, which was another interesting feature. Inflation when you stockpile too much gold causes your costs to build and expand go up, as well as for your income to drop.

Goods needed to upgrade your economic buildings are mostly linked and you can probably produce 80% of them if you're lucky. The other 20% can be acquired through trade imports with other countries, or through conquest.

Access to these goods and the acquisition of Kingdom Advantages do grant massive bonuses to your faction, which is why you want to pay attention to trade.

KNIGHTS -

The Knights system is quite interesting and functions similar to the Total War Series, except that you have a limited number of knights no matter how powerful your faction is.

They are the cornerstone of your kingdom, and the traditions, as well as skills that they have reflect it.

[i] Do you know that Knights of Honor II is a Historical Grand Strategy Game where once you enter the game you can get to immerse yourself inside the Medieval World.

Once you hear the tune of the In game Music,it is Catchy and Immersive enough to Grip your Heart and take you to a Deep Dive inside this Beautiful and Alive World Map,shockingly it makes you feel like a denizen of a Medieval City taking a stroll through the paved road!

So Beautifully Detailed and Immersive the World Map is made that in a way it almost makes you feel the warm breeze of the wind brushing your face while sitting at the beach and looking at the emerald color of the ocean and the distant lands with mountains and green forest.

[b]Now About the Game play:[/b]

Everyone on the map from You to the AI is busy with their own work which makes you feel like you are part of a neighborhood but everyone is working towards this goal of having the most Money, Influence and Power whether through Diplomacy, Espionage, Trade, Marriage and Military.You choose your own!!

You get to select any faction present on the world map.[u]NO LIMITATIONS!![/u]

Now,once you select your faction you play as the King of the Faction where you have to get 5 types of Knights working for you.Each of these knights have their own specialty,which if used properly will get you Power and Wealth.

Just like any Grand Strategy here also you get to build your kingdom from the ground up and Enjoy seeing it Prosper!

Not only you get to enjoy the world map but you can enjoy the tactical battle map where you command your troops while wondering how to win the battle and crush your enemies.And 
add their name to your [u]Personal Conquest List[/u] as you wipe them out!

[b][u] Warning: Not For Players who expect it to be a Total War Game or Crusaders Game [/u][/b] 

If you are looking for a  game which is too complex and hard to learn then this game is not for you.

Knights of Honor II is a type of game which has its complexities but easier for you to learn and enjoy this game.

[u]This is game is very new player friendly but has it depths to keep you engaged for hours and hours.[/u]

But It has taken both the aspect of the battles of Total War Games and the interaction of Crusader Kings!

[u]Just enough for you to say ""Fun and Relaxing is what it is!""[/u]

The UI sits perfectly within the game like the Jawbone of GIGA Chad!!

Even though this game is very fun and immersive it happens to deal with some serious issues of optimization in the tactical battle.

More In-depth Diplomacy and Conspiracy is what I am looking for this game but these are for another time!

Otherwise the game is [u]Fun and Relaxing[/u] enough for me to rate it 7.5/10!

Hope I did justice to this Game of my Childhood!

Ah Sweet Sweet Memories! 

Hope this helps you in making a decision!
Ciao!

Pro's:

I feel they did a better job with the AI and makes them actually do smart moves then the previous game.  Allows for more intense fighting and diplomatic situations.

Graphics have been extremely updated and looks really great.  

Map is more alive with citizens traveling including caravans.  

Freedom on what your kingdom can be.  You can change religions, be pacifist or be a war monger. 

Traditions is a great add on to give not only your kingdom buffs but the ability to have the immediate options on skills for characters without random dice roll.

Multiplayer is not a disappointment at all.  Played my first FFA today and it was a blast.

Con's:  

Combat I will say that should add hold and select for all troops.  Also allowing us to zoom out more from the battle field would be nice too.

- Diplomacy mechanic too old for a modern game : no quick deals, too many clicks to get what you want, it lacks information.
- Only 9 positions in court
- Royal family tree is oversimplified. Can't pay gold to marry your prince/king with a noble lady
- When you king dies without an heir. The next king is picked randomly from your court.
- Event notifications are a bit cancer after a few hours.
- No objectives, quests
- No real difference between all the kingdoms

- The UI is really terrible.
- No free camera again...
- Can't position your units before the battle starts and siege equipments are automatically placed at the front line.
- Units are moving and attacking without orders.
- Kill the enemy general and the battle is won. Don't bother the enemy units

Pillage economy wins games.

You can win most battles in the game by using 4 spearmen 4 archers, it beats most compositions the AI will throw at you until the very late stages of the game.

 Its important to keep the ideal troop comp in mind as the AI will declare war on you nonstop and very suicidally at that. Vassals with good relations, friends with non aggression pacts and trade agreements, it doesn't matter. Eventually the AI will declare war on you. Its because the AI spams requests to its neighbors to declare war on people that this happens.

 It just leads to really dumb scenarios, like on my Eesti game where I've got 6 army leaders filled with high level commanders. Kyiv decides its a smart idea to declare war on me while already at war with 5 other nations, and not even sending a single dude over to stop me from devouring most of his territories.

I don't like the province disorder system, as it stops being a thing you genuinely care about after 9 cities as that's your cap on governors. It will eventually go away on its own, and there's no reason NOT to just farm out the rebellions that pop up. Taking down rebels gives you prisoners that are free +1 crown authority goodie bags for minimal effort.

This game makes me wish yet again that steam has a neutral review option. It has good parts to it, but most of the military aspects of the game feel bad. Too many troops, at least when it comes to the auto resolving, feel insanely weak while others are so much stronger you're hurting yourself not taking them. I primarily play multiplayer so I have limited experience with field battles, but from the bits of it I tried, it was pretty bland.

I'd give it a wait for more patches/10. Has the potential to be pretty fun at times, but certain aspects of the game drag down an otherwise fun experience. Its a good in between of Paradox games and Total War games.

I went in having heard from all these commenters and content creators that this was a mix between Total War and a Paradox title like EU/CK. Having played this game a fair bit, I feel like this comparison can be understood, but needs to be taken with a grain of salt, making that game its own thing.
In short, I'd qualify this game of trying to get the ''best of both worlds'', taking elements you'd see in different Grand Strategy games and putting them together into a special mix, while keeping the whole thing simpler, easier to access than other titles of that genre.

First, the game relies heavily upon characters for actions to be taken (hence the CK comparison), be they diplomats, spies, marshalls, traders and clerics, the player being unable to take part into certain parts of the game without at least one ''Knight'' (councilors) of this type in their court. You won't be able to better relations with other kingdoms without a diplomat, or raise armies without a marshall personally commanding it.

However, comparing it to Total War is a mistake some have made, that has cost this game some pretty bad reviews. The battles are acarde-y at best (whatever complexity there is, the game doesn't bother explaining to you unless in the loading screen, with random tips), and I've stopped doing them. Don't come playing that game for the battles, at least not before they've been improved somehow.
Being a big Venice stan, most of my time on EU4 spent playing as it, my trade-boner really got going when I saw there were actual goods being produced, and traded between nations.

This system has its limits in that you can only have a maximum of 8 councilors at a times, plus your ruler (who will be either of these jobs as well). Which means, if you rely heavily upon your traders for income, you will have to choose to lessen your ability in another domain.

Let me give you an example. I play as Provence, and by now, I'm pretty much the incontested superpower in Europe, at least in the East, and most of northern Africa, having just vassailized Germany as well.
I now have a massive territory, producing large amounts of food, money and goods. However, the actual size of my armies hasn't changed in a long time. For at least the latter half of the game, I've always been playing with 3 merchants, 1 cleric, 1 diplomat and 4 marshalls.
This means I can only field 4 armies at a time which funnily enough, against a large nation like Germany works, but if I come at a smaller one that relies on several vassal, I now find myself facing at least double that amount of armies. I can beat these armies with ease, but I can't be everywhere at once, resulting in pillaging I am unable to stop.
Now, I could go, try and free a slot, maybe 2, and get more marshalls in. But if I get rid of a merchant, I lose not just the income from their trade. I also lose their colony income, their food export/inport, and the good they import (which they don't do anymore since I produce every good possible except gold).
So, I'd need to cut my income, while increasing my expenses by building a whole army. Not great. For obvious reasons, I can't really get rid of my diplomat, or cleric, because I still want to make friends and adopt newly conquered cities without murdering half their population. It's just not cool to do, you know ?

So, I'm at a point in the game where all that's left for me to do is conquer, but my means of achieving said conquests find themselves severely stretched, all the way from Genoa to Western Africa, including central France, most of Spain and Algeria.
I've heard the game will be moddable, so I'm hoping for an ability to up the Knights limit, as well as all the fun stuff modders typically come up with.
I'd need to play the game some more but so far, I feel like the early game can be a bit of a slog where you're at great danger of being destroyed by an AI at any point (if you start as anything else than a great power, like Provence, Venice or Cyprus), but then it suddenly becomes a walk in the part. In the span of a short time, you'll suddenly start gathering a lot of Advantages (special boni from procuding certain goods) and money, making it all rather easy.

Still, at the end of this long, confused review, I'll still say, I like the game. I hope it will keep growing in content. Though I'll say that for now, I wouldn't pay that much money (40€ here) for it, yet.",1670858922,1670858922,True,30,0,0.708588957786560059,0,True,False,False

- The Knights (read advisors) system is interesting bug it may lack some depth (cf: Cons: Game is limiting/Game is too random).

Cons:
- Tactical battles lack a lot of polish:
Troup movement are very clanky. 
AI is pretty bad and will try to kill your ram before anything else and rams are super tanky. It makes battle trivial.
Units do not have a lot of options to aid you battles.
Morale mechanics are very janky and low level units, especially early game, almost instantly flee when they come into contact with enemies.
- Game is very repetitive.
It's mostly a waiting game. I wait to have more gold, more books and more manpower. Every other ressources (especially faith) is useless. Gold and Manpower are what's needed almost 90% of the time and it's just a matter of waiting for more.
- No tech tree. Though some people will say that the Advantages and building upgrades mechanics are the tech tree; I disagree. The game would benefit a lot from having a proper tech tree with small benefits. It's not as if the medieval era was completely stale in terms of technological advancement. It would be nice to have a way to sink your books and faith points in something else.
- Lack of some options when starting the game. You can start as 1 Province if you wish but there's no way to force everyone to start on 1 Province. Give me a true sandbox experience. 
- Game is limiting:
You can only have 1k Manpower, Faith or Books in the bank. Extra is converted to gold. No way to increase this limit (that I found so far).
You can only have X Knights (read councillors). That X (8 people I think?) is impossible to upgrade notwithstanding with the size of your kingdom.
- Game is too random:
It's impossible to change the type of a village of one's province. If you're swimming in Faith and Books you would want to remove some monasteries from your other provinces but you can't. 
Some Knights missions are random. Sometimes they will ask you to pay them to perform certain missions and you can accept or refuse. These missions are usually quite expensive for what they do with low benefits (such as bribing enemy Knights). Sometimes you really need a mission in particular to pop but you will need to wait and it might never come. When it does you might not have enough gold to do it...
- Game is sometimes too obscure:
How does culture work? What are the benefits of having high influence? What does this or that stat do? Sometimes information is not as readily avalaible as it should. 
Some mechanics are obscure for no reason in particular. Sure you can look at how one mechanic works in the Royal Library (read the Game Manual) but having mechanics be explained through a manual is lazy game design for a 2022 game. 

TLDR: Game can be fun but lacks a lot of polish. It's not a complex grand strategy game and whatever complexity it has is because of obscure and soulless (read unfun) game mechanics.",1670841884,1670841884,False,43,1,0.606343328952789307,5,True,False,False

General remarks:
Original game was one of the best sandbox RTS games out there (I'm KoH1 veteran with around 5k hours of play time), but I always found a bit boring always to have only 3 possibilities to win: by world domination, completing kingdom advantages or being voted as ruler of the Europe. But now with campaign victory rules I like the options where you can have old ways or add new minor victory possibilities like greedy kings, peasants rush, war for goods or destroy kingdoms (but with your own rules and modifiers). Also after playing original game for hundreds of hours, you get to a point where you are experienced enough that you don't want to play anymore with mid or big sized starting kingdoms, because it would be less challenging to start with multiple provinces, but now by adding possibility to actually choose the kingdom and number starting provinces is awesome, where you can play with favorite kingdoms, but having possibility to nerf own start and making start of campaign way more challenging! Really good joob THQ for making game even more sandboxed!

Mechanics:
I really love new mechanics of new diplomat class who can improve relations, plot invasion or create defensive pacts. 
This class was really something which was missing in original game, because sometimes decisions of friend or ally can be really random and sometimes unpredictable, which I found always strange. Sometimes it was frustrating in original game by being unable to stop the war if the enemy kingdom was refusing peace and not want to negotiate at all (not only white peace but also gold peace/territory as well). In that case would always use tactics to conquer a extra provinces and hand it over to enemy, to gain positive relationships and try negotiating again in order to stop the war. Now diplomat is exactly what you can use to politically end the wars and not go full scale all in, just because enemy don't want to negotiate. Also having spies integrating into other kingdoms without going directly to royal court of that kingdom is also pretty good. So if you don't like to be exposed too much with your spy, you don't need to and you can have low profile spies all the time looking only for defensive or invasion pacts that are being plotting against you. Transferring/Sync upgrades of buildings through whole kingdom is well thought mechanics and as you go more late game, town micromanagement is not drawing player's attention too much. New trading, with more complex system is very good and give you more sandbox experience, where you could play as full scale merchant oriented kingdom and win the game by completing greedy kings as victory objective and not focusing on army and domination.",1670840261,1670840953,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

They rise up randomly in your country the moment you conquer an enemy province forcing you to march all the way back just to deal with them. I spawned a loyalist rebellion in Valencia, and a crusade against the muslim power that has southern iberia at the start of 1100s, every time the crusade took a province, my loyalists would occupy the province and 10s of thousands of these guys kept spawning, as soon as they caught up with the crusaders they slaughtered them too. it took a half an hour as a completely occupied and huge valencia had all of its provinces tranfered to me for free and i quadroupled in size with +15000 ducats to my treasury causing 125% inflation!

- The AI is good even on normal, and it took several tries to survive beyond the early game.  I like the aggressiveness of the AI.  Just surviving felt fullfilling.
- Graphics are good, animation is smooth, and scrolling is smooth.  No detectable jerkiness.
- No bugs were encountered and it was crash free.
Cons:
- I think the game could be more transparent when it doesn't let you do something in that it could at least tell you what resource is missing or why you can't.
- Is there a manual?  I didn't find one and it was not found searching on the web.  I didn't have much trouble learning the game, but I played the first KOH and understand some of the core gameplay.

Game idea is great. It looking to be a mix of Crusader king 3 and Total War but there's just too many things that I just can't fathom to recommend this game.

1. Marriage does not work. Starting out as Mongols you cannot negotiate with other ruler to married your sons as other kingdom will only have 1 daughter. All of the kingdom combine the results of them having princesses are lower than 1%.
If you try to married your son they keep on spamming ""we can't marry our daughter to you""
2. After building relationship, I thought the kingdom would allow you to do a royal marriage but nope. Nothing you do will change their mindset.
3. In these cases...Why you can't married another mongol from within your court is beyond me. You do not have an option to ""find spouse"" and the system will automatically find a spouse who is also of the same belief or race like your kingdom. For some reason the game developer thinks that in this period there's no other human being to married your son to outside of the royalty court
4. So you're stuck with a King who is old and about to die...well he just died and now your son is not married. No offspring to continue after your son's death. When the last heir to the first royal family you play die the system automatically picks a random Mongol guy who you don't even know where that guy came from and if they're royal to even be able to be King.

This game idea is great but the mechanic is not properly implemented or thoroughly thought out.

At least on Crusaders King you can find a spouse regardless if the other kingdom will marry their daughter to you or not

Until the dev fix this and implement a way to marry your family member and keep the royal family tree going I can't recommend this game. there's penalty if a different royal family comes into office too that is out of the first royal family that you first started....so no...I just can't. 

I tried multiple play sessions to see if the game is just randomize and it's not giving me the right algorithm to continue my lineage but nope every play session is the same result.

Many people said this is like a mix between total war and paradox game, kind of? You have a big map with many kingdoms to make diplomacy trade and do wars. Except it feels more paradox like and it's worse than both a paradox game and a total war.
This is specially true for battles, Jesus Christ they feel bad I’ve only done one and don’t want to do another ever again. I guess if you know how to play them efficiently it’s a good way to get you out of a hard situation but it feels awful compared to the new total war games, I think they should simply have removed this part.

The grand strategy part so far is fine, I haven't even played 2 hours so it's still a bit too early to say anything since grand strategies are supposed to be deep and take hours to fully know them but it feels ok, pradox does it better though. For most things you need to have characters(knights) to perform certain actions, like exporting excess food or infiltrate territories but managing them can get a bit confusing/slow. Then you have building and resource systems, no much mystery there, and characters and kingdoms can get trait like bonuses called skills/traditions. There are other minor systems but those are the most important.

Oh and for some reason there is no zoom, like wtf why is there no zoom in nor zoom out? that makes battles even worse and if you end up having a big empire going from one place to another will be soo annoying, sure there's the minimap but that's just clunky.

If I could I would give this game a side thumbs but since I can't and I think if you like grand strategy and want to play something new this will be a good option I'll give it a thumbs up.

There have been a bunch of really awesome in-depth reviews lately for KOH2, let's have a ""bullet point"" review here.  I was a massive KOH1 fan years before I played Total War or CK2/3 so I'm going to go at this as a KOH fan first and foremost

PROS:
- Game is very faithful to the original KOH1.  There are cool improvements to the game that appeal to the longtime fan and are a nice surprise for the new player
The game's got style, especially in the beautiful campaign topical map and beautiful political view map
- Additional layers of depth not present in the original, such as some knights in your court having more frequent active roles like more easily spawning rebellions, loyalists, bribing enemy characters, growing trade routes, etc.
Governors of provinces have a greatly increased role in this game, providing buffs all the time.  Also, the knight becomes ""so and so of Tarsus"" for example, for flavor
-The building system has been totally revamped, more complicated, but lets you actually get into buildings MUCH faster than the original
-Far more layers for warfare, having to really pay attention to your army's supplies, siege equipment, unit composition.  Gone are the quick peasant blitzkriegs of KOH1 where you'd take over a kingdom within an hour of starting the game.  You really need to manage your military from the beginning to succeed in wars, especially early wars
-Trading is much more involved, and a bit more realistic (e.g. as Scotland, you don't just trade with Byzantium at the start since they offer the most gold.  They're way too freaking far)
-The map is bigger, with far more of Arabia and Persia to play in
-Small kingdoms can be prickly hedgehogs, they develop their one province well and put up a strong fight

CONS:
-Game is very faithful to the original KOH1.  Many people who played the original may be left wondering why they didn't improve it more.  New players may compare it more to CK3 or Total War and wonder why it doesn't improve on those formulas
-The game's style doesn't always hold up to the original.  The new soundtrack is good, but not as great.  Unit and character portraits are good, but similarly, not as great.  The 3D models of troops on the battlefield look somewhat plain and washed-out
-The way the systems work can be confusing, not well explained.  The tutorial mostly just teaches you the basics of the UI, but doesn't tell you about how you succeed and win at the game
-Battles feel more arcadey compared to Total War.  Battles are likely the game's weakest point, it can be counter-intuitive to figure out the tactics to succeed on the battle map better than autoresolving
-Diplomacy is far less involved than Paradox games
-Why is Germany still not the HRE?
-Archers seem OP in the early game, the game doesn't tell you ""yo, everything without armor will just die to archers in seconds""
-AI blobs well but often their empires fall apart like in KOH1

I had a big curve on this game.  It came out suddenly the same day as Dwarf Fortress, no ability to preorder and not a ton of hype.  Most ""influencers"" and critics never played the original.  I got this instead of DF, and for the first maybe 5-7 hours was wondering if I'd made a mistake.  The military, buildings, economy were all more confusing than the original.  Not to mention, ""how you succeed"" at the game is a lot more complicated.  It looks really simple on the surface, but the systems are actually quite complicated to figure them out.

But the game started to hook me after that.  I'd started as Scotland before and had an alright experience, but when I switched to playing the Ottomans, in a part of the map that was much busier, it got way more interesting.  3 different religious groups fighting over territory.  Empires rising and falling.  More interesting units.  Seriously, janissaries are amazing early game units.  Marshals are kind of self-explanatory, but I really learned how to use the clerics, spies, merchants and diplomats.  I discovered I could use these knights to break up neighboring scary kingdoms.  I got Athens to break off from Byzantium and form a vassal kingdom to me - and they have stayed alive!  I started fomenting other revolts in my eastern neighbors to weaken them, and spread my culture.  I finally mostly got the hang of the RTS battle system and won cool victories.

And while streaming this game, I found actually a lot of interest and positive comments on this game.  For me, this game was worth the almost $40 I paid for it, instead of getting Dwarf Fortress.  Maybe it is for you as well.  Maybe you should wait till it's on sale.

But either way, if you give the game a chance and play several hours, try out different kingdoms, play this as a KOH game, not a CK or TW game, I think you'll find something really unique and special, a worthy successor to KOH1.",1670793672,1670793861,True,2,0,0.503730952739715576,0,True,False,False

It absolutely does play more like Victoria 3 but in a medieval setting. The focus is on managing your towns and economy in support of expansion.

I haven't played the multiplayer yet, so I won't be giving a review on it yet. I'll update the review after I play it for around 15–20 hours.

| Good game, bad game? | In my opinion, this is a great game. It is a breath of fresh air from the usual garbage of the newer, modern games that only want profit. The developers kept true to the roots of their original game, succeeding in making it better in nearly every way. Most notably, in my opinion, are the changes in AI. The AI is now dynamic and will learn from the player. This makes the AI, even on normal, quite a force to be reckoned with (in a good way).

| Worth $40? | If you are a lover of the original, I think you'll be happy with the game enough to justify the price tag. If you are new to the franchise, and are looking for a blend between Crusader Kings, and Total War, look elsewhere. This game is an entirely separate genre and will not satisfy you. If you're new to RTS in general, I would recommend purchasing the first game and determining how you feel from there. The original is $10 on Steam and $2 on G.2.A.

| Refund Playability | If you're like me, you likely plan to buy the game, play it for the maximum Steam refund time of two hours, then decide whether to refund your purchase or not. For some games, this is a lot of time; for others, it barely scratches the surface. In this case, it's the latter, and in my opinion, two hours is not enough time to determine if you'll like this game or not. It starts quite slowly, especially compared to the original, and can be quite a shock to your system if you go in expecting to understand everything. 

| What it's not | This game, as I've mentioned before, is not Crusader Kings / Total War, Bastard Edition. Knights of Honor and Knights of Honor II: Sovereign are completely different experiences to play, as they were intended to be. Do not go in expecting to be able to follow your family tree to the fiftieth cousin who died of malaria four generations ago, nor expect a battle system that blows your mind into the next century. While this game does most things quite well, it does not have the want, need, or requirement to do everything it includes at the highest possible level. This is not to say it doesn't do nearly everything well; it does; just don't expect it to be some chopped-together version of all of your favorite games. 

| Issues | As for problems I have with the game, I haven't had many other thoughts except that the tutorial may not provide a clear goal to strive for. While this is not a problem for experienced RTS players, it is seen in many other RTS's as well, and I only bring it up because I believe newer players may struggle with this aspect of the tutorial. The most glaring issue I have been presented with is the sub-par player-controlled battle system. While it isn't terrible and will likely be refined in the coming updates, I feel that this battle system is a step down from the original game. That being said, the AI is much smarter in this aspect as well.

| UI | While the UI is slightly more complex than the original, once you get used to it, it's absolutely fine. Some improvements from the original are the ability to move all openable windows, like Super Power 2, better art, and a far clearer and more understandable expenses tab. A drawback currently is the inability to resize the UI; however, this will likely be added soon.

| AI | The current AI is quite smart and reminds me of real players; for example, if you are weak and at war, other countries may declare war on you so they can get a province or two while you're distracted with the others. The diplomacy also feels much more realistic and is a stark improvement on the original game. I don't currently have that much experience with the spy system, so I won't be commenting on it much. What I will say is that it appears to be quite well done.

| Replayability | To me, this game provides a lot of replayability. It has several ages (all medieval), numerous possible win conditions, numerous tweakable settings, and will soon be supported for Steam community mods. Adding to this, it also has a multiplayer mode with up to six players.

| Tips | This game can be quite difficult, and some things act as unintentional traps to snare new players. Some of these are the ""Scholar Journey"" and the ""Witch Hunt"" events that you can partake in. These almost always cost more than +700 gold, along with +300 piety (religion) or +300–500 books. While some of these can be worth it depending on your situation, they can be quite a resource sink at the beginning and will likely cause you way more harm than good. I suggest you leave most of those events alone until you are in a safe financial and militaristic situation before trying any of them out for yourselves. I would also suggest the same for any invasion or spy actions you want to take. This is not like the old game; you can't just kick off an invasion 15 minutes into your game; you've got to work for it. I would also suggest that you play your first game as a nation with a few provinces, and that isn't a vassal. While it may seem tempting to start off as a massive or tiny country, those come with their own problems. For new players, a large kingdom will be A LOT to manage, while a tiny kingdom will be too deep a hole for you to dig yourself out of. Save the hard stuff for a replay; don't burn yourself out trying to learn how to play the game while constantly trying not to be eliminated. Also, when you are finally ready to go to war, pick one of the smaller countries around you and work your way up as you learn. Work your way up to the big fish; don't start off by biting off more than you can chew. My final word of advice is to not go to war with too many countries. Sometimes you can't help it, because they won't accept peace. If that is the case, focus on the country you originally invaded and try to get them to capitulate. Once you sign a peace treaty with them, most, if not all, of the other countries will automatically sign for peace.

| Multiplayer | TBD

| Crashes / Bugs | I haven't had any issues with low FPS, crashes, or saves of any kind. At 1920 x 1080, I have a 2080 Super 8GB, a Ryzen 5 2600 six-core processor, and 32GB of RAM.

So far the game has been fun. it doesn't have the depth of a CK2 but it is fun. 
Overall grade 7.5/10

1. Knights - Your knights do everything, fight ward, trade, govern, if you think of your council from a CK game that is what your knights are. There is a hard limit of 9 knights. That means you can have a total of 9 Marshals, Merchants, Diplomats, Clerics, Spies. It also means a total of 9 Governors for for 9 provinces. For me this is the biggest drawback for the game. It wouldn't be so bad but 1 of any class can only do 1 task. Do 1 merchant = 1 trade route, 1 diplomat means increase relations with 1 nation, You see where this is going. Knights are a fun mechanic, you get to increase their skills with a resource called books and mold them the way you want them to be. Your family gets to be knights and you can hire knights for a fee. 7/10

2. Economics - The city building is fun. You can pick up to 4 building types for free and then unlock additional slots for a fee. Each building type can be upgraded and each upgrade provides a benefit such as manpower, gold, or learning. 9/10

3. Trading - Yes there is trading, unlike another well known modern medieval  GSG game which claims there wasn't trading during this time. You can establish trade agreements with other nations and then send merchants to setup trade routes. There are also trade goods specific to each region. 10/10

4. Diplomacy - You can make friends, trade partners, royal marriages and of course war. While this feature can use a bit of expansion it has all of the basics + some. The most annoying part is that your friends will constantly ask you to attack other nations. Refusing or just ignoring them doesn't have any real negative effects so it isn't that big of a deal. 8/10

5. War - The AI isn't brain dead dumb but it certainly isn't difficult, at least not on normal. Simulated battles happen as most other Grand Strategy games and you can ask friends not just allies to come help you during wars or rebellions which is refreshing. There needs to be more options for what can be done with prisoners but that isn't a show stopper. I do like that you get to keep the cities you capture. That means if you join another nations war and you capture a city you get to keep that city, even if you negotiate peace. 
5b. Tactical Battles - Tactical Battles are fun. If you already have a huge advantage you probably don't need to enter into tactical battle mode but if it is close or you are outnumbered, entering into a tactical battle can swing the tide of a war. The one thing to point out, at least from my perspective is that the tactical battles are more like a Warcraft battle than a total grand tactical battle.  7/10

6  Royal Family - I am not sure if it is intended or not but there are far more princes born than princesses. It is a little unbalanced and makes finding a queen more difficult than it should be. You can place your ruler and sons into knight positions. This can work out well if you are low on gold. You can increase the skills of your family, and add traditions which act as permanent skills for your future family. You can marry your kids off and if they are married to a large ruler, it is possible to earn land through an inheritance contest after that ruler dies. 6/10 - lower because of the lack of princesses.

7. Presentation - graphics are about what you expect from a Grand Strategy game. The zoom is a little weird but you get used to it. The music isn't bad. 6/10

With that said, diplomacy, province management, army management, knights management, family management all got a major boost. So, for example: I was playing as Ulster (1 province), and they way I unified Ireland was: Invested on harbors (money), Barracks and Farm (soldiers and food). Then I hired a Diplomat to create a defence pact against england which was joined by Scotland and the Kingdoms in Wales. I married my King to a princes of France and created a trade agreement with France. Then I hired a Spy and send him to Connaught. Here is where I got lucky - Leinster joined the crusades leaving his lands unprotected. Leinster's army were destroyed in the crusade and Connaught declared war against them. With the Spy I was able to tell a point in the war where Connaughts and Leinters army's were pretty beat and that's when I attacked both. I needed plenty of supplies and money but I finally conquered both and then Munster after. Now I am on par in strength with England as I am allied to France and have a defence pact with Scotland.

I planned on playing for an hour just to see if it met standard quality of my expectation. Didn't realized how much I enjoyed it and kept playing past two hours. It can be quite confusing on what to do, but that's normal for a RTS games. Every time you start a new game your province resources changes and you have no army and not buildings. The first 10 to 20 minutes you probably still wont have an army but most likely you're just building up your provinces on the type of resource RNG gives you. Sometimes you get really good RNG like iron, lumber, food, etc. other times you get castle which are useless but gives defense bonus against raid. There no Next Turn button, everything is running in real time! There is a PAUSE button which allows you to assess the situation and a FAST FORWARD button to speed up buildings and upgrades. ALSO A SIDE NOTE: Building don't upgrade, you have to build all the building chain to reach the higher tier! So you only have 8 slot, you might have to make in entire province work on one thing for example Merchant building or Religion Buildings. You can sometimes put them all together though but it doesn't give that much bonuses. There no technology, you have to upgrade your building with certain resources but there's basic buildings like military that don't require resources for upgrades. Army control is real time so you can actually micro you army kinda like total war Battles. You can also bug the AI by making his army chase you around to buy time which does come in handy. There are many more things such as agents that you can use plus diplomacy but you'll have to try it yourself. 

TLDR: I think the game was fun and worth it If you're a RTS or Total War or Crusaders Kings player, buy it and give it a try. You can always refund it before reaching two hours.

New building system feels worse. They just tried to change it, didn't think what was the best option. Kinda loses the meaning of upgrading your town. You could add all sorts of defenses and all kind of tools to counter that but now what they did is they reduced the complicated mechanics, you can easliy see that in the battle. Just go compare the old battles and the new ones. 

Auto Resovle is a cluster f*ck. Enemy had full archers and somehow i lose with cavalries. AND god darn PEASANTS caught up to my CAMEL RIDERS. How the hell is that even possible? 2+2 is not 4 in this game.
You pay fortunes on elite troops, lets say 2500 for 1 elite unit doesn't matter if its on horse or not. And you make an army with those. and one dude shows up with 2 armies of that each costs 2500 in total. He wins, not including the skills and yeah i had maxed that out. The point is that the battle aspect of the game is ded and since its a core mechanic you going to be unhappy.

Merchants, as i remember with each trade good you gained more coins. Now it's all about navigation son. PUMP THOSE SKILLS TO THE NAVIGATION AND MAKE IT YOUR TRADITION OH HELL YEAH GO GET 4-5 MERCHANTS AND GET TRADE AGREEMENTS WITH COASTAL FACTIONS LIKE BYZANTINE. USE THE CASH TO PUMP YOUR CITIES THEN HOARD THE CASH FINALLY FIRE THEM GET MARSHALLS AND RULE THE WORLD! 

Spies and Priests - only good thing that has been added to this trash. Better mechanics than the first game. Also governing mechanic is also good but since building mechanic sucks it feels emtpy.

You can't break agreements, so you can't just do complicated diplomacy to be honets you can't do complicated stuff in this game yeah it was also limited in the first game but you know it's been 18 years and now you could even play this game on your phone IF it was optimized even a little bit.

UI is much worse, lets say you want to get the trade goods victory and you are searching for the silver. Good luck checking every city if they have silver in it. Back in the day you could see which city has that good by just clicking on that good, Also worked for troops,

Book system is much better.

Opinion system is weird but not bad, it feels pushed down your throat like (""Hey, we wanna make things complicated so here's a basic mechanic that will make you feel caged so you can't do whatever you want"") 

Diplomacy - USING THE SAME MENU FROM 18 YEARS AGO! In Total War, if you want to support someone with their ongoing war, you could ask some money and stuff. In this you can't add up new offers or change the offer. 

If they would added the new skills, books, maybe the recruiting system (levies and food upkeep), new class skills and multiplayer as a MOD to the first game. It could have been much better. (Heard that multiplayer has issues in the second as well.)

DON'T BUY THE GAME, they have to make huge sales to sell this garbage of dreams.

It feels like a cash grab from people that had huge hopes and wanted to feel the nostalgia.

I played with the first game also, and it is just like that, with modern UI and graphics, and some improvements.

    [*]This game is not: [b]Crusader Kings[/b], where the graphics is not that user friendly yellowish colored, and where there is no chance to controll your army in the war (RTS). KOH2 is more interactive.
    [*]This game is not: [b]Total War: Rome 2 (TWR2)[/b], where the UI is also not that engaging with that black background color. However in KOH2 the RTS battles are not that detailed as in TWR2.

started playing as rome, SPQR and all that, and it turns out i was responsible for the papacy not existing because of that, and it made a LOT of people angry. even on lower difficulties i was usually getting 3-5 people declaring war on me very early on. i lost
started playing as a smaller kingdom in england on the west side of the country, had an irish county declare war on me, and expanded from there with help from scotland (who declared war on me and kindly gave me the rest of ireland after losing). steamrolled over scotland, and with the help of a timely crusade against the recently excommunicated england, my own king went to war and took over the rest of britain. unfortunately for france, england had already conquered much of western europe, and they had to deal with the english while i held on to the united region and eventually got emperor of the world

decent blend of crusader kings/lords of the realm with a bit of other classic medieval RTS and a touch of mount and blade, dancing around trying to get that perfect engagement in the overworld map
it definitely needs a few things, and ill suggest them in the hopes the developers might see it

1. a cooldown/longer time between neighbors begging for your help in wars/for you to attack people/asking for literally anything. ive been nearly driven to war several times because sweden kept asking me to help them in war every thirty seconds and i was getting real sick of it

2. stopping the bots from demanding you attack your own vassals. this is stupid.

3. a king creator, where i can make/name my ruler

4. no aging option for the player/all kings, ive noticed my court (almost?) never ages while i'll go through kings like bananas rotting on my counter, even when set to the slowest aging speed

5. the ability to rename kingdoms/rulers/cities. you better believe i was upset i couldnt be king arthur

6. some remastered tracks from the original knights of honor would be cool as hell too

7. honestly just give me a king arthur campaign in the 400-500AD's thanks

It's far from CK or Total War games and you should not expect any game to combine these two big franchises into one game (majority of negative reviews sadly wants the impossible).

The game delivers from the very start and it's deep enough to keep you planing and thinking about your next steps all the time. It's true that it can get a bit repetitive later on but I think the devs  can easily add more flavour to it, especially a bigger variety of missions that marshals can be send on and maybe expand a few mechanics.

I hesitate to use the word casual, but its the best summary of my experience. I have seen some other reviews say this isn't Total War, this isn't Crusader Kings. They are correct, and this is a good thing. There is usually something to occupy your attention, ranging from carefully planning city expansion, finding suitable matches for your heirs, to directing your council of knights. The random events do a pretty good job of flavoring what is going on in the world.

The real time combat is not as much of a highlight as I hoped it would be. If you build an army with decent composition and a suitably matched marshal, the autoresolve does a admirable job of awarding you victories (also, make sure every marshal has the Logistics skill). However, there is a key feature that makes the real time combat worth it: killing the enemy general. I was pleasantly surprised that my outnumbered (but superior quality) army pretty much took out two enemy formations+ city defenders when their foolish general charged my spearmen and caused his troops to rout.

A few areas I wish/hope they improve:
- Alternatives for arranging marriages for your children, right now it's a lottery if 1: a friendly nation nearby (this is not often the case) 2: has an eligible child that 3: hasn't already been married off to someone else.
- Allow better trades, you basically have the Offer or Demand options, but nothing really beyond the Non-Aggression Pacts and Trade agreements that allow for mutual exchanges. The closest you get to for example: trade some unruly territories you conquered for a vast sum of gold is during a peace negotiation. You couldn't propose something like that during peace time.

In short, if you see the Mixed rating, a fan of strategy games, and are on the fence, I'd say go ahead and give the game a buy. It has solid mechanics, the visuals are refreshing, and is unique enough in a genre that can use a good shakeup.",1670741590,1670741590,True,19,0,0.643975794315338135,0,True,False,False

-We have family palace like in CK2/CK3 but options to pick your wife or edit some laws of inheritance are almost immposible - you can only wait for random event of weding because nobody want to offer you your daugher die to political reasons. When your son is too young to rull - your family just disapper and some of councilors will take a lead (you never ever meet theses sons again which you had moment ago). 

-We have nice trade aspect and we have nice tree of resources and building which are needed to progress in tech and economy - I think this is great solution and works bettar than in EU4 - strong point of this game for sure

-Buildngs are also great and well design (especially when we add bonuses from clases of our council) - but here are another point - lack of immersion - in my croatia campaing 3 times my leaders died from old age but all councilors are still young (I supose this is some kind of bug but still) in the same time.

-Batles - Auto-resolve just works horrbile - you can have 2 tier troops vs 0 tier peasents and you still lost a large part of your solid units - in normal battle you could crush them with ease. And real-time battles are just soullesss - its just picking the good type of units - so with AI you must spam archers + cav - unfortunately main type of soldier in middle ages which was infantry with sword is practiaclly useless beacuse they only counter spearmans which are quite rare. Also graphics and movment of troops in real-time battles is bad - especially when we compare it to textures of grass and building and also global map. 

Summing up this is great road where these types of games should go in future. This is the first title which merge so many elemens in such good way. Its already pleasent to play but it needs some fininish. 

If we receive in future more content (more advanced family aspect, improved battles) it will be great game. For sure modders will also made a lot of great stuff. In 2 yaers this will great game for sure. For know its good

However, if you are wanting a game with good real time tactical battles like Total War then give this one a miss. They would have been better to cut this feature out completely because it's not well executed.

The first game in this series had terrible real time battles as well so I don't know why they bothered with it a second time.
The diplomacy system needs more work. They should have looked at Total War Three Kingdoms for new ideas here.

I like the town building, trading, and resource management. It certainty has me thinking about how to optimise the nine province’s that I directly manage via my different knights. There's a lot of strategy on offer here, depending on the win condition you are going for.

The AI puts up a good fight, not because it's all that smart, but because there's an interesting defensive pact system that means it's hard to isolate one kingdom on its own for military conquest. You will often find two or three nations defending each other. A similar system exists for invasion plans as well.

This allows you to build an alliance for attacking. These defensive and offensive pacts are only valid until the war is over, which is a feature I haven't seen before. In other games like this your alliance is longer term and far less dynamic.
War in this game remains a constant challenge right up to the end game.

I don't find myself getting bored in mid to late game because you don't really snowball like in other games. This is mainly because you are limited to nine court knights and so only nine settlements are directly controlled efficiently. This also means if you hire many marshals for  military dominance, you will trade off power elsewhere in your kingdom.

The original game and this game were never meant to be competitors to CK or Total War. It is it's own strategy game with a much smaller team. 

CK doesn't have real-time battles and I would argue warfare in KoH2 is better on the strategic level since there are way more options and you can defeat enemies in detail. If paradogs or total war faegs even played the original, they would know this a faithful sequel to the original unlike Victoria or the newest total wars where they completely butcher original mechanics into something that we do not want. Alot of the mechanics we loved in Knights of Honor 1 are here and in a more refined, balanced form.

The battles are good for this scale of a game. They are simple but enjoyable. But most battles I let the auto-resolve go to work unless its an important battle. Not much to say here. They aren't bad but still are engaging. Don't go in this expecting a 1:1 copy of total war.

Diplomacy is very dynamic and responsive. The AI is pretty good, I mainly play on normal difficult. Defensive pacts will form if you get too strong. Every nearby kingdom will respond to your diplomatic actions in the form of messages. So say if I invade someone, I will get responses applauding me for invading and others calling me out for being too aggressive. Some AI kingdoms will backstab or try to get you to attack other kingdoms so they don't have to do it themselves. Neither CK nor Total War have this sort of immersion where AI is actively responding to you.They mostly sit there and have little to no agency of their own.  I hope the dev doesn't nerf the AI because of some whiners calling it cheating. The only cheat they get on higher difficulties is a resource bonus and they are also more aggressive. 

The graphics and UI are good but could be improved. The UI and keybinds are abit messy in areas but you get used to it like any other game (default isn't space bar for pause). The zoom is alittle small and I hope they allow us to zoom out more to see more. 

Overall, its 8/10 for sequel to the original game. And I for one welcome, new 'grand strategy' games like this. They didn't push pre-orders nor do they sell a million dlcs to milk their customers dry. They released a well-polished game with very little bugs.

2. The AI are hilariously easy to defeat. Just send a couple cavalry units to the flanks and run around their army and capture the points behind them. If that fails, just kill the enemy leader(s). Easy victory every time.

However, people will of course be comparing this game to Crusader Kings and Total war warhammer and I think thats a fair line of logic.

The difference in my view is that this game gets MASSIVE credit in doing something pretty unique and immersive whereas both total war and paradox have spent the past 6 years doing nothing but copy pasting their old games with a fresh coat of paint and a mountain of overpriced DLC. 

So lets compare directly:
+++ Knights of honor 2 has a very good economic system that simulates things like trade routes, trade goods, buildings, cities, villages, etc. all way better than CK3 or any total war title. Yes I said that, fight me (CK3 doesn't have trade at all!!!!)
++ KOH2 has voice acting that is situational, I love hearing the ""forming a mighty army Sire"" or ""your royal family, sire"" when I open tabs in the UI. Paradox has made the weird decision of never having any voice acting in any of their games at all!??? So I'm playing CK3 and i have a beautifully 3d modelled character who stands there quitely not doing anything. Even if they get sick and are dying from the plague we don't hear a coughing sound. I miss the days of Medieval 2 total war when the enemy army would beg for you not to execute them (WHEN YOU HOVERED OVER THE BUTTON!!!) and if you did you heard slicing sounds and groans. Even the voice acting in those parts was culture specific. Its burned into my head: ""Dont be so hasty Sadiq!.... Noooo Grraahhh *slash*"" in an arabic accent. The point is that KOH2 is the first game thats come out in 14 years that does some of this with its situational voice acting. Fantastic!
++ Diplomacy in this game is much better and more interactive with the AI than CK3 or definitely total war. Even down to the UI its more immersive and engaging. Having actual diplomats to send on missions to help smooth things over is something that is sorely missing from both CK and TW which just have invisible diplomats who do whatever you ask them to and can't level up or anything cool like that.
+ Real time battles... Sure its simple, I mean I vomit every time I see a new total war battle from Warhammer 3. Doesn't matter how much ""unit diversity"" you have the battles are so repetitive and boring in total war now that I have to stop playing them. So in comparison to how much i can't stand modern total war battles, KOH is a great step in a new direction. It has less features sure, but that means its focusing on positioning, timing and manueveres. The biggest downsides to it are the graphics (why not just use sprites like ultimate general civil war?) and the controls which are a little clunky. I wish I could zoom out the camera more but I guess I can just pause the battle every few seconds :P
- Not as deep character mechanics as CK3 but like, how could they possibly do that? This is a small studio. So sure, if you want to have nudist, incestuous characters sporting giant moustaches and give them full 3d models that do any pose you want, go play CK3. Its definitely not the focus of this game BUT this game does have a political system and characters that is better than any Total war game (like Rome 2's awful politics window... pretty sure they just gave up on having politics systems after attila). 
+ Perhaps instead of character based mechanics, KOH2 has an opinions mechanic from 5 classes of people: priests, nobles, the army, the peasants, and the merchants. Actions you take in game add or remove opinion from each class and each has its own benefits and downsides! A high army opinion makes a mutiny of your army almost impossible to pull off for enemy spies. A high noble opinion makes it easier to become an authoritarian dictator and makes it less likely for your counselors to defect and backstab you. Its very engaging.


To be honest, the comparison between KOH2 to CK3 or TW shows that KOH2 is basically in the middle of these two extremes, but in no means does that mean that KOH2 does nothing ""well"". It exceeds these other two games in several areas while being serviceable in others. i'm pretty happy with that and its worth the price.",1670694196,1670694196,True,53,0,0.73177492618560791,0,True,False,False

PROS: 
Has a lot of depth, challenging and gives you satisfaction. Much better from this point of view than the shallow, grinding Paradox games. Lots of Re-play time for sure.
The apparent limitation to 9 active leaders for each realm is one of its strengths, it forces you to choose wisely and no one (including AI) can overwhelm other kingdoms only by huge disparity in size.
I don't play the tactical battles - I tried them and they're ok, but not a game's forte. The strategic level battles are satisfying as such and reinforcements & logistics are vital.
Sieges are well balanced, war attrition, occupation, cultural differences translate into quite clever rebellions, but not into an obsessive chase to squash them. 
Clever winning conditions which allow you to pick what flavor your game will have.
Trade system.
Religious system - much better than Paradox's spread sheets percentages.

ON THE FENCE:
Timeless flow - on one hand is strange not to see the years going by, on the other doesn't rush you to a time limited end.
Counsellors not ageing - they can be lost so high investment in their skills development would be also lost if they die of old age. The devs could come with something better though.
Diplomacy does its job, maybe it could benefit from a few more options.

CONS:
Zoom level in tactical battles.
Map modes info.
Some existing features - like the total war merging of depleted troops - which you need to discover by yourself.
Tactical battles could be improved.
A few interface improvements though, in all, its an efficient one.

Fully recommended.

We live in time where everything needs to be tagged with something else and I see a lot of comments trying to portray this game as failed CK and TW clone. No it is trying to revive a decades old original game Knights of Honor (1). This KoH2 is more of a remake with a lot of nice quality of life improvements over original. I loved original KoH and this sequel revives all those positive memories. 

Play Wide: this is the main way of playing the game where player is having a strong focus to conquer more provinces. This can be either super easy or difficult depending on a chosen difficulty and starting country (starting country can evolve by forming new countries). More provinces will bring more benefits but will also affect player's choices as player have limited amount of armies led by 9 knights (including the king) represented in the top of the screen at all times. These knights can be marshals to be a native army leaders, or merchants or spies or clerics or diplomats. Every knight has 3 main skills to choose (and level up) and 2 secondary skills. So if player had 9 marshals, player can have 9 armies but without traders, cleric and a spymaster it can be a more of a challenge to play like that.

Play tall: there is a way for a player to get kingdom advantages and win without spreading too much. However these advantages are not trivial and depend on the resources randomly generated in provinces. This means every new campaign will have a different distribution of resources and with it augment initial game experience. Coincidentally, my first victory in KoH2 was gaining all the advantages.

There are other ways to win like being proclaimed as the emperor of the world (which is Europe, parts of the Northern Africa and bit of the Middle East) by other super powers of that same world. This requires multiple factors to be fulfilled, hover, if vote fails, player will use kingdom stability, if it fails badly will get war declared from those voted against the player.

Diplomacy, religion, spying - it is all there but it is not too overwhelming and feels appropriately balanced for the setting. Game tries to be historical but to an extent. For example Germany wasn't there at the time but we can turn the blind eye as having that Holy Roman Empire border hell is a bit much for this game. Also, Malta is quite big. Dynasty is there and it is an important factor but never on the level of CK and instead it is quite relaxing way of playing. However, player can infiltrate enemy court, and make hell for the kingdom trough dynasty and vice versa.

Technically - this game is 2D of rendered 3D models. As such that is not an issue for this type of the game as the UI is really good and gives a good overview of what is going on. Music is nice and notification system is subtle but noticable, there for player to use them but never to annoy the player.

The bad: I haven't experienced any bugs and gameplay was quite flawless. The only thing that might have been a bug was when I was inspecting the culture on the map and the tooltip sticks to the first selected province and doesn't change no matter which other province I click. UI is really good, offers a really good overview, it's just I do mind few minor things. Those are: clicking on a province I would prefer to have in the lower section indicated which culture this province has in the main view and to whom are they loyal - always. Right now it shows only if enemy province has population with a different loyalty there will be this small shield in their hands otherwise there won't be any shield. Also I would like if I click a kingdom to see if they have any ongoing wars and with whom - not just ally/friend/threat/enemy... Vassals are pretty much useless as they only offer payment to the player in gold and fame but they can often reject whatever overlord demands of them. Annexing those vassals is not straightforward and instead it is a hidden mechanic which can be triggered occasionally. Additionally knights do actually vote on proposals given by a foreign diplomats and this voting icon is really small - I have noticed this icon really very late in my gameplay.",1670684211,1670684211,True,22,0,0.597394824028015137,0,True,False,False

I'm very intimately familiar with the mechanics of the last game. I can say that in absolutely no way is KoH2 ""just a remaster""- almost every single part of the game has been tweaked, if not significantly deepened, and for the most part, I would say those changes are improvements.

On the national level, we still retain coin, books and faith, and they do the same functions that they already did. But there's also a national level food resource, a national level goods resource and a national level levy resource, and all are important. The levy resource acts as a ""manpower"" pool in roughly the same way as the mechanic is present in EUIV, and if you drain it without finding the time to rebuild it, it'll significantly hamper your ability to fight wars. The national level food resource is required as all standing military units in both city garrisons and marshal armies need food available to be able to fight. You can go into the negatives for some time, but it will hurt morale and what the army thinks of you. The national level goods resource is capacity used when selecting merchants to trade; you can't just buy 4 merchants like in the last game and get them trading for crazy gold capacity; you need to build buildings to increase what is available.

The list of knight professionals is different. There's no longer any builders or farmers- those skills are actually rolled up into the powers of all the other knights, and more on that shortly. There is, instead, diplomats, and they have a series of actions unique to them Spies, Merchants and Priests are still present, on top of Marshals (of course), and between the five classes, the only one that I think I could do without needing at least one of in my court is the spy.

In addition to that, non combat knights can now multitask; my merchant, for example, can be governing a city, and trading with another kingdom for gold, and trading for individual resources from that kingdom, AND then be buying or selling national food capacity to another kingdom, AND then be doing a special mission i.e. attempting to make a lucrative deal to turn 2000 gold into 5000. Diplomats, spies and bishops are in the same boat, but Marshals are still only doing one thing on top of governing a city.

In addition to *that*, all of the different classes now have access to the marshal skills style improvement system; you're not just buying 5 starts on that merchant to make them more effective at trading, you're giving them individual bonuses to the resources they generate as governor of a province, their likelyhood to successfully make certain deals, the amount of money they make as a passive trader, etc. The same goes for all the other classes. There are some crossovers between these skills. The available next skill for each purchase is from a small randomly selected pool, but you can spend a fair chunk of gold and books to select a skill as a kingdom tradition if a knight has that skill at the maximum level, both giving bonuses to the kingdom, bonuses to knights with that skill, and the ability for any knight with access to that skill to pick it.

The prior city governor system is now not just a very rarely used quirk, but something you'll want to assign all of your knights to if possible, because cities without a knight don't contribute nearly as much. Even assigning marshals is useful, and you'll even want to care what provinces you assign those marshals to, because the right province will provide significant bonuses to the manpower of that marshal (we're talking 30% or more). The system of selecting the right province for the right governor is very important, and even when you have twenty provinces and all the kingdom advances and resources you'll still be eyeing neighbouring provinces to find ways to eke out an extra bonus here and there- for example, that province over there has 3 castles, and if I can take it and park my marshal as governor of that one, he'll get a manpower bonus. Or that province has 4 crop farms and 3 of them are coastal; a merchant with the right upgrades as governor would provide a larger food pool, leading to letting me keep a larger standing army.

Building slots are now limited to ""just eight"" instead of eighteen, but most buildings have several improvements you can also buy. You also no longer have to spend a third of those slots on walls, because there's a separate system for improving the city defences. Some buildings will still provide bonuses, but they aren't crucial. They're all still resource dependent in much the same way as the last game, with a slightly bigger pool of resources to collect. You don't need to individually import any secret special expensive goods through a top level port; everything is theoretically naturally gatherable on the map.

-
My favourite miscellaneous improvements;

The original game did not give you the ability to start with a custom nation- here, you can take any individual nation and change how many provinces it will start with, or even take any individual province as your nation identity and then choose to start with 0-4 surrounding provinces on top of that. I love this change- it'll make it that much more replayable for me down the line.

The map encompasses a larger area to the south east. The entire Arabian peninsula and a much larger chunk of Africa is present. A good portion of Iran is on there and the eastern boundary is now the Caspian sea, not the east coast of the Black sea. In addition, it's also way more detailed- it has roughly twice as many provinces.

Religion is definitely deeper. There is still Catholicism (including the papacy, crusades and excommunication) and Orthodoxy, but Islam is now split into Sunni and Shia. Paganism is also far more present, and it's probably the strongest belief of the lot- you'll have a book production reduction modifier and no access to universities or cathedrals and the top end trade goods there, but you'll instead have access to having a completely separate custom belief choice- I highly recommend families, as it provides a huge buff to city citizen capacity and national food generation. Give a pagan game a go, it's a hoot.

There's sneaky direct mod installation support, but no mods yet.

-
The things that need improvement or changes;

Mercenaries can now be hired as independent marshals on the map with their full army complement, not just individual squads into your army. However, you have no control over that marshal, and they'll usually go out and commit suicide pretty quickly. Taking direct control over them would be helpful.

Pathfinding of marshals is a little odd. They'll wander right through kingdoms you aren't at war with if you're not careful with routing, and give a diplomatic hit. Around coastal cities they may also leave directly into the water, and then require time to get out again. They'll also automatically leave the city if they get there and another marshal is also on the way to that same city, which is a pain if you want to resupply multiple armies in the same city, because they'll instantly jump out again to ""make way"" for a marshal that isn't there yet.

Spies have been nerfed. They won't randomly turn existing good knights of yours into spies because they aren't represented on your knights bar in the same way as the old one, which is a massive improvement, but they also don't really affect things as much. The main benefit is that they're less likely to be caught if you're not getting them to do specific tasks, and they let you see the entire kingdom at the same level of map detail as your own, not just one province. But the much bigger issue is that it makes the game map stagnant- they used to be responsible for enormous random shenanigans in KoH1 and now very little change happens other than your own map painting.

Remember when game studios used to do sequels to their own franchises that actually consisted of basically the original game, only better? This is what Knights of Honor II is; like a blast from the past, the developers chose to be as faithful as possible to the original, adding QOL elements and new things to do too (obviously, the new graphics are also very nice).

Some of KoH2 characteristics:

1.- Absolute freedom to run a kingdom however you choose, be it with guile, plots, assassinations, instigations of rebels in enemy lands, good old-fashioned brute force through arms, or diplomacy to arm a confederacy of allies against a common enemy. You can find the mix you find most pleasing to your playstyle at your leisure.

2.- Battles are simulated either Crusader Kings or Total War style. You can fight in person when you feel like it, and if you don't feel like it and enjoy the macro side of things, the simulation is also fun to watch unfold, specially since allied or enemy reinforcements can join the battle.

3.- Pretty much limitless possibilities: There are so many play styles and different decisions to make that you could sink hours and hours into this game and still have tons of things to do. There are loads of buildings, each with different upgrades, there's alliances, schemes, marriages, trade and economics, or war; you can never really run out of things to do.

Lastly, this game was made with mods in mind, so Steam Workshop should be available sometime in the future (expect updates). That means lots of features that someone could say are limiting (such as only 9 knights in total) could be potentially moded, not to mention anything else you could think of: new eras to fight on, more units, different stats for units, even fantasy worlds could be potentially modded in.

A fresh breath of air, totally recommended for fans of the original Knights of Honor and Medieval-era games. All in all, major kudos to the dev team.",1670675839,1670675839,True,229,1,0.919270515441894531,0,True,False,False

You can literally spend 100s of ticks of books on a king just to have him die 1 moment later.

Also, balance is super off, and I have no rational for how simulated combat works, as it doesn't provide a direct, physical medium. Having it be something like a ""map"" rather than a 2d painting would be more feedback intuitive, and provide a more in-depth analysis, sorta eu4 or imperator style.

And from there you upgrade it to allow you to build swordsman, now every town you build a barracks can build swordsman. Another thing they changed that I dont like, is the roll of the dice skills upgrades you get to choose from to upgrade your Advisors. Marshall for example you get to choose from 4 or 5 different skills I cant remember what it is. but then you choose 1 and it re rolls another 5 random skills.... how am I supposed to properly gear my marshal to be favouring archers or swordsman or make an army for sieges? Before you could choose from all skills. So this limit is really fustrating, As when you get late game and can afford it you try re rolling advisors to get the skills you want, wasting books and money. They added a few things to decisions with diplomacy, you can pause a decision by choosing let me think, And theres also random challenges your Advisors like your Merchants can do by expanding your trade with a country, or importing and exporting goods, they added commerce which contributes and limits you from exploiting this too much. And you now need to produce food to upkeep armies, 
Another nice touch is they added a button to upgrade your seiege defense by itself, building up the walls and manpower(another neat feature added) as well building a building that allows you to add siege defense upgrades to it, but isnt that powerful unless you start producing gunpowder. Another nice feat they added was appeasing your court, like peasants, merchants and shamans.

Is Knights of Honor 2 as good as Knights of Honor?[/b]

How does Knights of Honor 2 even play? It sucked me in like a swamp. It's less complex than the Crusader Kings series, making the game more immersive and easier to play. If you are a veteran of the series, you catch the mechanics of the game instantly, and then - at 3 am - you say to yourself, ""maybe I'll take this castle and go to sleep"". The most difficult issue in this game are decisions, especially at the beginning of the game - what to build, in what order, whom to conquer, etc. This must be carefully thought out, because without solid foundations, our country will fall prey to our neighbors. I didn't use the real-time battle option alone.

[b]What did I miss in KoH2?[/b]
Mainly the possibility of setting taxes for individual provinces, e.g. by lowering taxes to soothe the mood of the subjects.

It's been a long time since I had so much fun with any ""grand strategy"". It's a game that responds to the requests of those who find Crusader Kings too difficult and Medieval Total War too focused on battles rather than management. For me, this is the best PC game of the year, with which I will sit for long hours, trying to conquer all of Europe with different countries.
The game looks great, has a well-developed economic system, an interesting idea to limit the number of armies, computer opponents are cunning ...
And above all, this game forces us to think and make quick decisions on which the fate of Europe depends. Every strategy fan simply needs to play Knights of Honor 2.

The game was developed by THQ Nord studio.

It doesn't have the depth or complexity of a 4x game but, as I said, it doesn't advertise itself as such so anyone complaining about it should take a moment to rethink their stance.
Their RTS battles, while decent enough, aren't on par with TW games, but neither should they be nor is that comparison fair.
The game communicates to you your options and standing well so after the first few hours any feeling of being lost shouldn't persist, although you will still find some more options opening up as time goes by both cause of progression and experience.

So far I've played as Flanders, I've conquered Holland, Saxony and Luxembourg --> I plan to invade France soon. You always have something to do, I haven't had a moment that I was bored or thought to myself ... what to do next. 

The building / upgrade system is quite simplistic at the surface, as you advance you will need to have certain resources before you can upgrade. I do hope that more building options are added so we have a harder time making choices of what to build in each city.

My main complaint is the limit on the amount of knights you can have, I understand  the reasoning behind it but 8 is a bit low. Increasing it to 12 would be perfect even if it means that you unlock additional slots through a building upgrade.

Fighting system (doesnt concern the RTS live battle in solo). The movement of your army on the map and your decisions are very pertinent for win (delay attack, dodging enemy armies..)
AI : it will be challenging but you can discuss with some logic with him (if he declare war, u cannot obtain free peace until you kill some armies).
Goods and advantages : very hard to get them all
Building system : interesting and choice count
Tradition system : very interesting and gratefully (but in my opinion, bonus are balanced but the system is too strong just because you can choose 8 traditions. Less than 8 will be more balencing and strategic, especially since you can change them at any time)

Cons :
Voice and notification : I know dev love the voice, but some notification are really impertinent and repetitive, so the voice is spamming sentence. Some notifications need to be removed (changement commercial road, crusade begin/fail/win, kingdom disappears/formed, 
Political trade : some trade are impertinent and repetitive (same trade over and over). AI ask a lot for gold, it is funny and ironic because ine KoH1 you are te one who ask repetitive gold donation. But gold is really needed in this game, so asking for gold is annoying.
Multiplayer system : If the system is not peer-to-peer, we depends of THQ server for multiplayer. This solution is not persistent for long terme ?

So I've been a long time player of the original Knights of Honor. This definetly feels a step up to the previous title. You have more control over certain aspects of your kingdom.
For further context I always leave my battles with auto-resolve so I haven't touched the RTS battle aspect. Also spies are bullshit (personal preference, not the focus) so I always played with them in very limited. Keep also in mind that sadly all games launch in an unpolished state, but I have confidence in the devs that they will continue improving it. Therefore:

Positives
- Graphics are decent
- Gameplay was smooth in open world map
- I like the building and upgrade system, and that the upgrades are all over the kingdom, you don't have to research every town the same building upgrade, though it does increase the cost
- The Royal Court is more interactive, with each type of knight having different missions
- I like the Tradition system of passive buffs
- I like the King is always max stars in his skills
- The reworked alliances is nice, as in you're only allied with those countries if you are at war, or when you are attacked but have a defensive pact in place against the attacker.
- YOU KEEP YOUR CRUSADER ARMY after a successful crusade. Oh yeah!
- Town Defense upgrades are separate from the construction queue but can be bolstered by specific defense buildings
- You have castles alongside villages, which act like mini garrisons and can do attrition damage to the enemy.
- The clergy/nobility/army/merchants/peasantry definetly brings an extra layer in planning your actions to get nice buffs out of it.
- You can choose what training princes receive so that they are best matched to their highest stat.
- You can also choose or upgrade skills with more sensible book costs, the choosing is a measly 200 books! Do that on your heir and boom, max skills when he is king to be used in Traditions.
- Separate levy system, keeps you from massing up ridiculous armies, plus armies have a food upkeep, again, limiting the maximum size your army can have.

Negatives:
- I am sure it will be patched, but nation banners are pixelated in 1920x1080 in the political view
- Music is rather underwhelming compared to the original one.
- The menu image is..... not that good. Put a castle back please!
- Gold I found was a bit harder to mass up, as opposed to books and piety, and everything costs quite a bit of gold.
- Paying... for more construction slots. Each town starts with 4/8 and to unlock the rest you have to pay 2000/4000 etc gold. I can see why as a balancing mechanic for multiplayer purposes, but besides adding extra costs to buildings when upgrading and the fact that the original had all construction slots available it just feels unneeded in single player... does slow down city development, not a big fan of this one....
- The AI sometimes cheeses itself if the Pope makes the King a Crusader. I had Hungary in one game just conquer half of Muscovy because the king was always graciously giving himself land his crusade conquered.
- Why does the nobility constantly dissaprove of me dismissing a request to attack Crusader Hungary from friendly Transilvania? I'M JUST MOLDOVA WITH 2 PROVINCES. NOT COOL.
- 64 resources for kingdom advantages.... with the limiting build pool each town starts... just makes it so that you get all of them by the time you already conquered Europe
- Why do longbowmen require such a massive investment... Master armoreres? For men with big bows dressed in cloth/leather armor? That's way too much gold to invest. Just having a royal armory should have been enough. Not a big fan of this either.

All in all, it is a slower paced game as opposed to the original. That does not mean it's a bad game, the original had it's fair share of flaws, but I can confidently say it is a worthy successor as it brought quite a few good features to the original's formula. I cannot wait to see what the developers continue doing with it.

I rate this game a solid 7.5/10

- Bad direct battles. (Too fast combat flow, useless capture points, small squads(written squad of 300 in battle 50 units))

- Retarded royal family mechanic where king mostly dies without heir and almost no way to influence that, get constant noble opinion penalties because of that. Also if you have a son, but he is a child and your king dies, there is no REGENCY in a game about medieval, so throne goes just to a random dude and again penalty. You need to marry a person from another kingdom and it should be royal, you can not just take noble woman from your lands, so often there is nobody to marry, but if there are, in 90% AI decline or ask gold or join their war, which is not so bad.

- If your king dies while he is commanding an army, guess what, THE WHOLE ARMY becomes MERCENARY, army that you have hired, becames neutral and you have to hire them back for gold. Even by the logic, peasant gets in millitia, his king dies, well I go mercenary now, I don't have farm where I lived, I can just go away. In other games it is done normal not this madeness, just replace a leader, it is not so difficult. (I can understand that in real times, they might do not want to go back to their normal lives, but still this is nonsense, I faced this shaite in the middle of the WAR!!!)

- Camera always too close. (Let me out of this 600x800 box, I'm not in a tank! Let me see all around.)

-  Small unit roster.

- Diplomacy is absolytely random, you can't know is kingdom going to accept your offer or not, what they want and why, make it like in TW: warhammer 3, where is a barter screen and you can see deal and chance for succes, you want neutral pact, they refuse, you can not offer them gold to agree, your only chance is, if they ask you gold in return to agree, this is only way. So you mostly is affected by AI offers which you can accept, but rarely your offers have a result as AI mostly declines. (Ah yes, AI will always spam you with messages, give me your gold as present and if you decline, this do not affect your relationships with them, I understand if atleast they would blackmail you, like, give me 1700 gold, or I will declare war on you, but no.)

I going to update this list, if I find more problems or cross them off if they fixed.

In current state game is playable, but really feels like only a graphical update.

I can see a great potential in this game, like in many others games that never reached them, I hope they continue develop this game and one day game going to be great.

Current price of 40 euro is too much for this game, I would give it now max of 18 euro, 12% discount on release is a joke and a trap, just to try get as many buyers. But still I like to play in this game, it has great atmosphere.

Only a couple of minor suggested improvements.  The map zoom on the main map needs to be able to scroll out much further.  It's too close in even at max zoom out.  Also, siege weapons need to be more powerful.  Still takes ages to batter down the walls, even with advanced siege equipment.

Had this one been marketed as a remaster I think I would have reccommended it in it's current state. As it stands, the game is unfinished and I feel for the developers who might have been under tremendous pressure to produce the game in a certain time stamp. 

I love the updated map and I think with some patches it should smooth out. I love the building upgrade UI and i am half sold on the idea of book leveling up your leaders.

But I think the battle maps need variety. Since it's a game in 2022, I half expected weather effects like rain or mud. Both were common and in many medieval battles attributed to outcomes. (agincourt). 
I think ambush battles could be a unique skill added to certain generals. Cultures should have specific names for their units and not just a region specific unit. (norway has a viking unit, cool but why not make all light infantry bondi with axes, heavy infantry huskarls or hirdmen axes or swords with a shieldwall ability or arrow deflection modifier when stationary, and eliminate their cavalry or limit it.)

To stop unit spamming, perhaps a slowly refilling global cap on unit types could help. (12 archers, unlimited peasants, 4 heavy infantry)

I think its important to do away with the aging of the king from young, adult, old and just give him a numbered age. Death comes to us all but I know to expect it to be more likely from 88 year old monarch than 23 year old king.

Let us raid as a perk or tradition causing diplomatic penalties but not outright war.

Especially after viewing the papal states. You can almost sense it's future DLC playable faction. Just like what Paradox did with CK2 and CK3. I can't believe they didn't remove the 9 knights limit. And why is that idle members of the family cannot govern a town without being a knight in the court? I have all slots filled but my 4 sons who are safe at home with nothing to do cant even govern the extra towns without being part of the limited 9 slot knight court. Thats so absurd! And the family and relative tree is also very limited. It should of been extended more. More heirs and more relatives slots. The sandbox options could also use more ""options."" For example the aging. Why didn't they add an option to disable the aging feature completely? And the game doesn't even show you their age. It just says infant-old. It's a given but showing the exact age would be nice so we can make preparations ahead of time before they die of old age. Once they hit old its just a guessing game RNG before they keel over and die. The game doesnt even show you the time frame between years. Leaving you oblivious how long you have survived. Like how many years has passed since 1100, 1200, or 1300? There's also a lack of random events going on. They could of also made a creation mode so we can create and change the names to our own kind of kingdom. I know they delayed the game a bit but they should of delayed it even more because it feels like a remake. Nothing really new or inspiring was added to flesh out a brand new experience. Especially with the price tag. The map is beautiful but geez the actual models are dreadful. It's almost like a switch game ported over to PC. You also cant enter into RTS battles during raids/pillage/plunder when fighting off the village levie guards. Only armies vs armies and town battles are RTS.

Great game, for a reasonable price! Definetly worth a buy.
I dont get all those overwhelmingly negative reviews...

For all those that never played KoH:
Its not as deep and complicated as Crusader Kings, and not as simple as Total war...its somewhere in between. If you would like to get into more complex games, this might be a good starting point.


In Detail:
Knights of honor II perfectly captures the Knights of honor feeling i learned to love back in the days of winXP.
Music, Voiceover etc. is absolutely on point.

Yes the game needs a bit of love here and there, but except the quality of the realtime battles there have been no major problems so far. It is a solid game with a lot of smaller things that bugged me....but nothing to an extent where i had no fun playing anymore or had the feeling the game was unfinished.

Its not perfect (yet), but its not a bad game at all.

In Detail what bugged me so far:
[list]
    [*]Having Children and therefore heritage is 100% random and luck based. This had already bugged me in KoH1 though and therefore is nothing new...
    [*]I dont gain anything of substance by marrying away my daughters...except a war i dont want from time to time...
    [*]Resupplying troops in the territory of an ally is not possible.
[*]Why is there no button to break contracts? In KoH1 i was able to cancel my trade deal whenever i want.
[*]Marshalls no longer gain battle exp due to new skill system...id like to see it having at least some value.
[*]Why can i still not select multiple armies on the overmap to send them somewhere?
[*]Possible Zoom out distance should be at least doubled. (In battles AND the overmap)
[*]Where did the KoH1 army stances go? why cant i build fortified camps anymore?
[*]Some event explanations are missing. Even after triggering events multiple times i still dont know what some of them do.
[*]Why is there no search function in the ingame encyclopedia?
[*]Is there a window where i can see another countrys trade value or their relative troop strength? if yes, i havent found it yet.
[*]Late game needs some more complexity/new systems. Its okay for new players i guess, but KoH veterans might get a bit bored at one point.
[*]Realtime battles feel really unpolished performance wise as well as player controls/inputs wise.

I come from the EU4 crowd and this game was recommended to me by one of the YouTube channels I watch. Overall I am a fan of the game. It is a blend of Paradox and Total War games, but keep in mind that it did not set out to be a Paradox/TW clone. This game stands among the crowd as a hearkening back to its predecessor, KoH 1. Some other comments have called this a remastered version of 1. I think it is a little more nuanced than that but also not far off the target. There are many familiar elements of this game that you find present in other 4Xs, that is true. While this game does not feel as deep as any other particular game, it's wide array of mechanics give it the standing power to be its own thing. 

The in-game combat is pretty easy, the campaign map wars usually end up me getting dogpiled on. The court mechanics and royal family feel lack luster.

The game does not blow past TW or Paradox games, but by blending the two elements together, it makes a game worthy of your library. But i do hope we see expansions/DLC/reworks to flesh this game out even more.",1670508870,1670512836,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you are an older Knights of Honor player, you will like it (especially if you remember the original mods and you know something like that and more will come to this one too). 
If you are a new player to Knights of Honor, I would suggest checking a video gameplay first, see if it something that might appeal to you. The game is basically a mix of Paradox style games (EU/CK) and Age of Empires style battles (some may say Total War type, but I've always thought the battles feel more Age of Empires style.. might be just me).
In conclusion, it is a bit pricey for what we got, but with room to expand to make it worth the price... will continue to enjoy my time with the game and hoping for work on it to continue, from all the ""players involved"" :)

BUY BECAUSE:
- Complex enough but not too much (I’ve always wanted to try Paradox games, but I find them too difficult and time consuming, so KoH2 is perfect)
- Great real time campaign and MANY factions to play with
- the Knights and Opinions Systems are just great, really refreshing if one is used to Total War
- Battles are there and they can be nice, not at all as bad as some reviews say
- AI can be PAINFULLY DIFFICULT, so that’s a plus
- Completely personalised campaign: I played as Sicily, conquered half Italy, then just switched to Venice in the same game and conquered the Sicilian Empire I HAD FORMED MYSELF, that’s really cool

DON’T BUY BECAUSE:
- Battles are not comparable to Total War: if you are searching for a true mix between Paradox and Total War, this game is not entirely for you
- I enjoyed some field battles, but I found sieges to be boring, since city designs are the most outdated feature of the game

All in all the game is fun, but it should cost 25/30€
If paying 15€ more than you should is ok for you, then buy this, you’ll have fun. If that 15€ is too much for you, wait for a 50% discount. But in any case, I suggest you try it sooner or later: I’m glad I am.",1670510638,1670510638,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Things I would like to get added changed:

More dynamic decisions from AI. The only events I seem to ever get would be gold donations. I never get asked to turn over land, give troops to a crusade etc. 
More event variety would go a LONG way for replayability and variety from AI decisions.

The RTS portion could use a little more polish. Capture points are really easy to cheese. For land battles what is the point of a capture flag? I can understand more for sieges that makes sense, but for standard land battles it should be a kill/be killed or rout the enemy situation.

I'm not sure if shift click was working as intended? Trying to add units from town to an army felt clunky when you should be able to shift click to move over rapidly.

- no zoom option in a 2022 game.
- no in-game tool-tips that actually explain what anything means.
- extreamly 2004 DIPLOMACY way to basic, boaring and stupid, no change from 2004. ( this is targeting the UI and options given)
- i played as Ottomans and no one wants to Royal marry so i had 3 rulers just DIE with no sucession and took penalty for it.
- Unbalnced stability increase cost, Unit prices, lets not even talk about the Replenishment cost for units which should not exist as you already payed for the units once.(should be over time replenishment kind of thing)
- confusing building and upgrade system ( not too bad but KoH1 was better, here they are just giving focus on ART)
- the map filter is just so BAD its no good. take a look at EU4 and apply simmilar i want to see all info with ease not have to hover over buttons and stop the game etc.. religion, culture etc..
- no idea what Trade regions are or what thy do.
- Worst part of the Game is if your Marshall dies while on the road, YOU loose your whole army ?!?!?!?!?!?! you can ""rehire them at 30% cheaper but that is just wrong"".
- basic Agent actions cost money and that is wrong it should cost way less if at all.

ok so those were the bad parts. 

Here are the good ones :

- World map IS gorgeous.
- Game has serious potential for fixing and adjusting. (mods will help, hope workshop on steam is enabled)
- It just released so game features are not that bad as the game play in whole FUNCTIONS with no bugs, for me at least. 
- Diplomatic system is a good idea in that there are no ""Alliances"" but rather everything is based on Relationships and bartering ( they should add a Favor system).
- Game runs very smooth.
- FYI i do recommend the game because i love it and im just a old guy hating things i thought would be improved in 18 years but still glad that there is a Knights of Honor II.

The starting dates take place during a time period that I know a little but not everything about. This game really lacks polish. Like other people have mentioned, it is not intuitive to navigate around the map, in almost every other 4X when you scroll out with your mouse the map zooms out. There is no gradual zoom on this map in the default mode, you have to click the Kingdom map mode to zoom out. The tutorial is not very helpful, the game just starts and you're expected to click on each button to get the tutorial tooltips to show, but that is not made clear when you start the game. You're not guided in any way towards an objective in the tutorial, once you click on all the buttons that bring up tooltips you get thrown to the wolves and expected to play like you know all the game's features.

Another system that's not refined is the friendship/alliance system. It's not very clear who is at war with who on the map, there is no indication in the menus that two kingdoms are at war with each other. You just have to look at the maps and the troop movements, or catch it quickly when it flashes by in the event log. In regards to the friendship system, I played a game as the Serbian Empire where the Ottomans immediately became friends with the Byzantines. They're natural enemies around this time, and they each have provinces that the other kingdom should want from each other. Since they were friends, they never fought each other and I was not strong enough to declare war on the Ottomans (the only applicable Muslim nation near me to declare war on). The Byzantines were able to form a war pact against me with Wallachia, Vidin, Bulgaria, and Hungary. Needless to say, the rest of the game was extremely imbalanced and I got invaded and taken over easily. 

I cannot recommend this game until they update it and refine some of these things.",1670465878,1670465945,False,4,0,0.500709176063537598,0,True,False,False

So many negative reviews are people going into this game with the wrong expectations, so these are the expectations you should have: Knights of Honor 2 is a smaller, shorter/faster, more straightforward strategy game that has high replayability/restart-ability but low 'epic campaign' value. This is NOT the game to buy when you want to launch an epic, week-long (or longer) narrative campaign where you painstakingly plot the details of an empire.  

Knights of Honor II is about the rapid deployment of characters, soldiers, and economies towards simple goals. It takes [i]some[/i] inspiration from Crusader Kings (characters with stats/skills who you send on tick-over-time missions for various goals) and from Total War (lots of rapid conquest goals without needing War Goals or casus belli, and the inclusion of real-time battles), but it only deploys those mechanisms for their familiarity and superficial flavor. Ultimately they are simplified so that the player spends less time managing and more time executing. It would be nonsense business practice to try to compete with the massive incumbent strategy games while on a smaller budget, and so they've found a brilliant semi-casual space adjacent to them for people who don't want to burn extreme hours of their life (or who don't want to launch the deepest strategy games only to continually restart after just 40-60 starter turns).

This is not the epic long-play saga game, this is the 'I want a cozy, vintage feeling grand strategy where I can achieve my goals quickly while still facing some dynamic challenges from the AI'. No mechanic in this game has the depth of what you'll find in the aforementioned games, but that's the point. And you know what impresses me most about this game?  Where Total War and Crusader Kings have entire phases over the lifespan of a campaign that are boring (particularly how most TW/CK games become chore-fests and dull auto-win simulators past a certain degree of growth and success), KoH2 is incredibly rounded-out from the early game to the endgame. 

Finally there's a grand strategy game that starts rewarding the player in the first 10 minutes of gameplay, and it consistently continues to reward them through the final moments before campaign completion.  It's not the most complex, but many of us aren't [i]looking[/i] to play complexity for complexity's sake.  Most reviews I see are essentially arguing that complex games = better...and that tells me they're coming at this game with the wrong expectations.

I love the Original and I thought this one would take longer but it dropped much sooner than I had hoped. 

Its new - Improved with the most creative yet awesome build system I have ever seen. The battles are slicker and sharp and addicting as always. They even added weight to the armies by a few sly meters that expand your army composition size.  It also adds in a lot of Roll play over the Original but not enough to drive you insane like in CK2. 

HOWEVER even for me I find the lack of tutorial and systems a bit complex. It is a game that improves with time and this holds true that after about 3 deep hours you will be loving it. The Text is VERY small and no scaling but that seems like all RTS right now :( . I did hear they might have a mod page? ( hope so). Lastly it has a few glitches and map zooming is restricted... That said they fixed the  map mode zooming in a day so here's hoping battles and the main map get this feature too. ALMOST all glitches can be solved by saving then going to main menu- a bonus few games can boast. With the Alt-tab working (something that should not be bonus but few games get this right now) it makes the game smooth and low draw for such a beautiful game. 


TLDR: If you like strategy and medieval you will love this- if you loved the original you will love this. BUT be aware your first hour will be alot of reading OR a lot of trial and ERROR

TLDR: The game is a lovely revival from a classic and wonderful game, so I have been waiting for it sicne the very first announcement a good 4 years ago.

Grand Strategy aspect: -> Very good
The building system is really nice and ease to get into. You have limited building slots, but most building can be upgraded mutiple times, each upgrade being basicly a building of their own, giving buffs, ressources and sometimes kingdom wide boni. 
The provinces's traits (ressources, number of villages and their type) is random, so replayability is good.

Grand AI & Diplomacy: -> Decent
The AI is okay on the big board. I builts their towns in a proper fashion and makes use of all kind of knights (trader, spy, mashall, diplomat & cleric). Its diplomatic acting is sometimes a bit wonky, especially with asking the player to attack  partners or even allies. That could be improved.

Real Time Battles -> Good
The Battles are based on the terrain the armies fight on, which makes it really nice and you get almost unique battlefields every fight. The towns look quite nice, too and offer a good bit of tactic options for a defender.
With 9 Units per army (+ the marschall's body guard), one would think it is rather small scale tactics, but it can still get surprisingly hectic (and i play strategy games since 21 years now XD).

The Battle AI is decent. It utalized all parts of its army, tries to flank, get behind you, capture your camp if you  leave a gap and uses infantry, archers and cavalery appropriate. The enemy's commander is sometiems a bit reckless, and the AI could be a good bit smarter, but it is good enough to be a little change (when units are equal)

Graphic -> Good
I have a decent machine, but by far no monster rig. I Play on medium graphic settings and it looks all nice. Could be a bit better for 2022, but by grand strategy standards it is really lovely. A lot of details, nice gimmicks and overall a really cool atmosphere.

UI & accessability -> Very good
When you start the game, there is a tutorial, which explains you which button does what. Read it and you will have no problems at all. Information are easy to get, tool tips are appropriate and the UI doesn't pull you out of the immersion of being a medieval king. There is a good bit of depth to the game, which you get into layer by layer, something i love a lot, as Shallow games get boring quick for me.

Summary: Knights of Honor 2 is a quite good game for strategy fans, good for beginners and really nice for fans of the First Knights of Honor. It does not invent the wheel a new, and the claim, that it is rather a remake of the first part, than a second part, has a point. But then again THQ nordic are the Necromancers of Gaming. They take wonderful games from 10, 15, 20+ years ago and revive them, and they did an excellent job here.  Could they have done more? sure, if they had the same ressources as Creative assembly, they could make a game that stomp the total war garbage of the last 10 years into the ground.

I can't imagine you played KoH1.
Released 2005.
This is the same game?...
With a new skin.

A great game!

Would I recommend this over CK3?
Yes!
Don't need a degree in medieval politics for starters.
The map graphics are better than CK3 too.

But...

They've missed so many easy wins I can't quite believe it.

If you've played KoH1, you'll have so many UI complaints.
If not, you'll be blissfully ignorant.

TIPS:

Forget the RTS battles.
This is a strategy game.

CONTEXT:

2005 I bought, then abandoned, the game (bought on CD), after the first RTS battle.
2018-ish I bought the game again on Steam. £2.00? (new launcher lets it play on modern widescreen laptops)
Me: ""OMG, I played this back in the day!""
Played again with no RTS battles.
Worked out the game.
Fantastic game.
Started off with just York.
Ended up with whole of GB/UK, Scandinavia, France, Spain, Italy, North Africa.
An absolute roller-coaster, royal family and marshal wise...
Landed at Constantinople...

9/10 experience...

A lot of important info is also missing or hidden in places that are too hard to find - date/year, truces, etc.

The good:
1. The UI is really good. The city building UI is good, the game UI is good, every UI is really good. GJ to the devs
2. The dynasty tree additions compared to the old one. 
3. The [b]Knights leveling up system [/b] and how they work. 
4. The autoresolve mechanic. It's fair and balanced enough. This is essential for MP games. 
5. The [b] Kingdom advantages [/b] sytem
6. The [b] kingdom traditions system [/b] that is very well incorporated with the [b] Knights leveling up system [/b]
7. The building tree of the cities. I was worried it would suck but it's better than expected so it gets a ""Good"" from me. The way the city trees integrate with the villages and farms and other stuff you have in the province is really good.  
8. The MP lobby rules. It allows you to ""split"" nations if you wanna play them. Good idea. Thank you! 

The neutral:
1. [b] Kingdom power system [/b]. Basically the same as before but kinda stretched out and integrated with a  pop class mechanic that is underwhelming. It's just stat boosters. Boring. Disconnected from the rest of the mechanics in the game. 

2. The AI is serviceable and can kick your ass by sheer numbers on higher difficulty. It is also ""intelligent"" enough to recruit mercenaries and what have you when needed. Good AI overall, but nothing special. The reason it's in neutral is that the way the AI declares war on you is very piss poor and has a ""player bias"" even it damns them. I mean the game will literally tell you that this nation is your friend only to have it gang-bang you at the nearest convenience.
 
3. The shared upgrade for buildings system. So if you get a barracks and upgrade it to be able to produce swordsmen or spearmen, you upgrade ALL barracks everywhere. This has the unfortunate effect that the next barracks you build will cost you more. While I understand why it was done this way and I don't consider it bad or good, if you combine this mechanic with the first thing from ""bad"" that is about how many cities you can effectively govern means that you may end up ""dumping"" gold in upgrading a city only to dump it for another. However, this is not a problem of the shared upgrade system but rather of the governing system.  

The bad: 
1. The governing system. The fact that cities where you don't assign governors, which are one of your 9 Knights (king included) only gives you 10% of the income. This is a horrible mechanic and should be removed immediately. Keep it like it was in Koh1 where the knights just gave bonuses to the cities if they governed them but the cities gave you their full economic output regardless. 
2. No good counter mechanic to espionage. You just increase some ""stats"" called espionage defense and that's it. 
3. No way to release a province as an independent power as your vassal. In a game where the governorship mechanic strongly encourages you to limit your provinces, it would make sense to have a vassal swarm. But there was no way from what I found to ""create"" vassals like you can in EU4.

Do not get me wrong the grand strategy aspect is much better than the first game, and what they have gone for is really interesting and clever, though it does feel like every game start is the same, surely some places would already have buildings and armies at the start...

The main problem is battles. If they were made more tactical, armies were bigger and were not such low key affairs, this game would work. But instead it feels like a poor man's CK3 coupled with a poor man's Total War. I was expecting epic pitched battles between vast armies, instead it's point and click...

My graphics card is just above the recommended, and I've got a fairly robust CPU, and haven't experienced any performance issues whatsoever. Game runs smoothly. I'm sure the developers will provide patches to fix performance issues on any edge cases. (Can't really test on a wide variety of hardware configurations until release anyway). 

The new building system is also very clever. For example, if you build a barracks, you can later upgrade it with a swordsmith, spearmaker, fletcher, etc... And it only takes 1 slot. Now, if you want a province focused on military production, it's much easier to tap into the wide variety of unit types.",1670434232,1670434232,True,3,0,0.531986892223358154,0,True,False,False

The moment I gave up was when I made an army of heavy swordsman, feudal knights and heavy archers across 2 marshals (costing a literal ton of gold and food upkeep) and sent them to attack an army of light swordsmen, peasants and bowmen... I outnumbered them and had a much better trained army, I even had 2 Marshals vs 1 marshal... The gold value of my army was about 10x the amount...

These peasants, light swordsmen and bowmen absolutely wrecked my heavily armoured army. 

Just so you know how bad this is, here is the process to lose such an army:

1) You need to build a barracks, upgrade it 4x, this costs thousands of gold and takes a long time.
2) You need to build the royal armoury and then upgrade that a few times, this costs THOUSANDS of gold and takes a VERY long time. 
3) You then need to build the farming/food economy to feed such an army, this costs THOUSANDS of gold and takes a very long time. 
4) In total, as a rough minimum, you need to dedicate 5 building slots to make this work. Each settlement only has 4, with the additional 4 slots costing THOUSANDS to unlock as you expand your settlement. Dedicating this many slots, as a minimum, is a HUGE investment for smaller factions. Those slots could be used to generate gold, commerce or religion, defence, workers, tools or population for army.
5) In order to generate enough gold to buy all of this, you will need merchants and economy buildings. This means you then need to dedicate some of your court slots to generating gold via merchants. Another huge investment. Merchants also need time to build larger trade routes, so this also takes a very long time. Furthermore, the economy buildings required to make commerce also cost THOUSANDS and take a VERY long time. You need commerce to make merchants trade. So that's maybe another 20k of gold + a couple hours of time and planning + another 2-4 building slots. (total of 6-8 buildings lots, absolute minimum)
6) Once you have the literal tens of thousands of gold, the food economy and spent the hours of time to make all this, you then need to hire your marshals, who can only field 6 units...
7) That's another investment into your court, so this is maybe 2-4 court slots MINIMUM dedicated to this.
8) If you want siege equipment, you better hope you randomly get offered the siege craft skill. Yes, it's RANDOM chance you get the opportunity to build siege. Oh, don't forget the thousands of gold for this too. Oh, and if you want more than 2 siege slots, you better hope you RANDOMLY get offered the logistics skill!
9) Once you have fielded your army over the course of hours and invested probably close to 100k to make and feed this army, all while juggling the other demands of your kingdom and planning attack alliances, you are almost there.
10) Proceed to get destroyed by an army literally made up by a majority of peasants, even though you outnumber them.........

In total I had 6 heavy swordsmen, 3 heavy archers, 1 heavy spearmen, 2 feudal knights, 2 marshals, 2 catapults and a trebuchet. All fed. All high morale. My rankings were all good. My marshals were educated. Total cost ~16,000 gold + 30 food upkeep + 100 gold upkeep for siege. Total building cost, close to 60,000. Unit count was about 4800 from memory.

This got eaten up by 3 peasants, 1 light swordsmen, 2 bowmen, 1 marshal. Total cost ~1500 gold + 9 food upkeep + 0 gold upkeep. Total building cost, close to 10,000. Unit count was about 4200 from memory. 

THIS IS NOT BALANCED ONE F-N BIT.

I tried out the RTS mode... It's a cringe mess of unbalanced units, needlessly sped up combat and all tactics and strategy have been removed in favour of a design to increase the pace. The AI is terrible as well. Not to mention the RTS maps on the original knights of honour had a much larger scope, were thoughtfully made and allowed time to breath and use strategy and tactics. This feels inspired by total warhammer battles but without the strategy or tactics. 

Look, there is a lot this game has done well. It has expanded on a number of elements that made KoH1 a great game. And in that sense, it does capture the original's essence and improve on it greatly. 

But this has been rushed out. There has not been enough playtesting. The direction they took the RTS is shoddy and a devolution of the original. The interface has been completely butchered in favour of simplicity (where the hell is my kingdom rankings page?) The balance is laughable. 

A lot of this can get fixed with patches and mods. But there are some core design choices I can't vibe with.

Is the game worth buying? It really depends. It is a solid game and as a fan of Knights of Honor 1, i realy enjoy it. But the game is flawed.
- Technicaly, the game is just solid. The overworld is nice but nothing special. The UI is way to big / the camera is to close to the overworld map and , as far as i know, you can not zoom out. In the real time battles, the graphics are not pretty.
- There are a few new options regarding your knights. For example, your Diplomats can form invasion and defensive  alliances in advance. There are also certain events where your knights get time-critical decisions. For example your Merchants could ask you for a loan to make a potentialy huge investment. So you lose a certain amount of money for a few minutes to potentialy get way more later.
- Diplomacy is pretty much the same as before.
- Difficulty-vise i would say it is on the easier side of grand strategy. And the gameplay can be a bit slow.

After all its quite the Wonder we ever got a second Knights of Honor at all, so dunno what more people expected ? A Million Dollar Triple A Release ? 

Its not perfect however, the zoom on the map is a little lackluster and the realtime battles are more of a funny gimmick then a mechanic you should take super serious, even tho at times it can be beneficial to manually play the battles.

Other then that it really is pretty much like KoH1 but with better Graphics and despite what people say : Yes you can still go big with small kingdoms, but it requires lots of patience and yes, some luck.

Battles are around 30-40 fps sometimes and you cannot zoom out to gain a better understanding and control of your army position , On top of this the battles felt very arcade in that most units felt they had the same speed and little to no impact (ie cav just standing still and not charging) .( i have a 3070 , ryzen 5800 and 32gb ddr4 ram.)

Essentially the game has depth of mechanics , but does not execute well in the battle map layer , the campaign map mechanics are  great , but very overwhelming for a new player who are not used to games such as crusader kings. You literally have a huge info dump within 2 mins of playing the game , then its like ""up to you now"" , theres no tutorial island so to speak , such as ireland in crusader kings , as if youre playing a smaller kingdom you are easily crushed by bigger ones.  And a first time player does not want to manage 12+ provinces from the get go. it fees like a game that tried to deliver both rts battles of total war and the campaign map of crusader kings but only gets a 3/10 on the battle side , and a 6/10 on the campaign side. I will probably look to buy this game again , when its on sale for around 15 pound or less , that way i wont feel bad when i inevitably run up the time required to learn the game and not be able to refund, and by then hopefully they have fixed the fps issues in battles , and the lacklustre diplomacy.

Same mechanics, same UI, same AI, just with a few twists here and there. The RTS aspect is still atrocious, so I do what I did in the first game, and just ignore it and simulate all battles. The building mechanics with upgrades is welcome. 
This is a very relaxing game, not particularly deep. I find CK to be overwhelming and this offers a more light version of it. I like the Kingdom Advantages mechanic and resources specific to each region. 
One change I realized, is how much more difficult it is to siege and conquer cities in this version. Much more difficult than the first game, which I think is a change for good.
I'm not sure if the graphics overhaul and the sprinkles on top of the first game mechanics justify the price, but I'm still having fun, so I gotta give it a thumbs up, although I wish there was a neutral review option",1670424735,1670424735,True,2,0,0.520547926425933838,0,True,False,False

It was disappointing from the beginning. There is no optimalization, for me game is running fine for 90% of the time. But first 30 sec of battle is spiking like hell. If you don't have highend pc you'll suffer. So for me it is acceptable not great but still easily playable.
UI isn't great either, but I have seen worse. Some keybinds are hardcoded, which I hope will be fixed in some future.
Mechanics are still awesome like in KoH1. They are not overwhelming like in CK. But still you need some time to master it.
AI is little bit wonky and quite ofter is doing stupid things. For example you have just destroyed all of its armies and took almost all of its provinces you're offering peace without any demands and AI refuses your offer...
But the worst thing are battles. As I wrote earlier first 30sec of every battle it is unplayable you have to pause it and wait. It spikes like hell. But wait a second there is something ever worse. Fight itself. It is pretty much one unit rules them all. Archers are simply overpowered like hell. No matter what stats they have they will destroy anything. Cavalry? No problem arches on their own will kite and kill cavalry. When we are speaking about cavalry it is bugged as hell. Charge command on enemy unit? Well it will charge but few pixels before enemies it will come to stop. Wait probably few second and then just slowly walks into enemies... When cavalry is running away from enemies 4 out of 5 times it will get catch up by infantry and most likely dies. So manual battles is BIG NO.
And what about autoresolve? It could be fine right? Hell no. Balanced armies - same units, one army has a little bit more units i would say 55:45 it even has experienced marshall with maxed out perks and enemy has new marshall level 0. So you should easily win right? No. One time you overwhelmingly lose. Next time maybe you'll win by small margin. Next time it comes down to last unit. Just random. And unfortunately this applies even to battles when both armies have different types of units. You could win or lose (I have experienced it) with composed by peasants and light infantry vs cavalry with infantry and archers. Just because I had about 200 more soldiers at beginning I have won that autoresolve. It was about 3000 vs 2800. 
I would forgive that optimalization issues, not exactly friendly UI. And still I would recommend this game to everyone who loves this type of games.
But I can't because of battles. Battles are one of the main game mechanics in strategy style games. It is like you would go to buy car and doesn't care what engine it will have.
Those small issues can and probably will be fixed. But I don't think that they can fix AI/battle issues in patches. It would need to redo big chunk of code.

I was a fan of the original and was hoping for more of the same but, MORE.  There isn't really anything, well there are new fun little bits like you knights do tasks etc.

Unfortunately it looks worse in my opinion than the original and the UI is really really bad and the inability to zoom properly is tragic.
All in all it looks really old already, the map has some details but is just a flat expanse.  None of the mechanics are particularly engaging, there are the same mechanics as before except updated, the building stuff makes no sense, as does the changes to how population works.  

Diplomacy is exactly the same, which is really quite incredible.  
The real time battles are the crowning achievement in being pants however.  You are unable to zoom out enough to even see more than perhaps 3 units in front of you so you are constantly scrolling accross the screen.  The strange thing is the zoom level highlights the lack of detail, the units seem to float and have no character.

PRAISE THE PAUSE BUTTON
No seriously the mere fact you can stop or speed up time makes this a massive improvement over the predecessor, not even so you can keep up with things happening, but just to have a moment to look at the map, see what ai is up to, and make some plans for the future.
If you played and liked the predecessor my recommendation is to buy this, if you didn't play the predecessor either wait for a discount, check out a pirate version before buying or be mindful of refund timers.
Necessary immediate changes:
-option to zoom out the map more THIS MAKE IT HAPPEN, INVENT TIME TRAVEL AND PUT IT INTO THE RELEASE VERSION
-improve city goods ui (the icons showing what resources a town has are really small right now), also the goods in the kingdom advatage screen are too small as well but I appreciate the alphabetical ordering
-fix performance in battle (supposedly, I never actually cared about manual battles I'm here for the kingdom building)
Future changes:
-Something like missions, events or decisions would be nice, events can spice up the gameplay and liven up the the characters (random feast happens, different characters make different things happen, a high diplomacy king/queen make random neighbour like you more). Missions or decisions can give us something to work toward that is more country specific, uniformity is nice but so is variety.
-an improvement to diplomacy, if the lithuanians won't pay 1200 gold for peace, can I ask for 568 instead? Also if I can pick two provinces from a royal marriage at high relations penalty, could I instead pick one that I actually want for a smaller relations penalty (made even smaller by payment of gold from me?). Province claim so if kingdom B takes province 1 from kingdom A and then I take it, I can return it to kingdom A for a big relations boost.
-something to do with population opinion, specifically peasants, how about I decide to throw a kingdomwide feast, just because to improve opinions, rather than only having this option on specific randomly occuring occasions ( royalchild born)

1. Don't expect Total war battles here, but if you want a bit more than EU4 in terms of battle agency this does the job.
2. It is a little bare bones in terms of graphics, like in the diplomacy but focuses on the essentials.
3. Province building is interesting and the resource management overall is reasonably complex.

What I like: I started as Prussia and got myself into a war with Norway as Sweden attacked them. Meanwhile I was trading with Poland. I sadly tried hard to marry my king, but failed all over Europe although Kiev was willing to provide a bride for jointly attacking Lithuania, which I declined. I then got into a battle with Vytautas to the East as Lithuania and Poland ganged up on them. I pillaged for the money and after their capital Grodno was void of any troops sieged and conquered the province, thanks to Poland and Lithuania doing much of  the  heavy lifting. Consolidating my power there, I hired a spy to destabilise nearby Volhynia who then declared war on me. Sweden would be willing to help me out if I join a defensive pact against Poland and declare war on Lithuania. And that's just the first 30 minutes.

I personally spent thousands of hours playing KOH over the years, and I bought this sequel knowing more or less exactly what I expected. Hold your horses for a long one. 

Firstly, I will say this - Knights of Honor II plays like a dream. In my first 6 hours of intense game-time on very hard difficulty, I have not encountered a single bug/glitch/error or crash. KOH 2 has been built to a perfect, professional standard and to have a build as reliable as this on day 1 is rarity to say the least nowadays.

Having chosen to play as a province in Scotland for my first play-through, I found my first 2 hours very difficult - war was declared on me by every other kingdom in the British Isles. I found myself having to reload the game multiple times after 3 separate total defeats until I found a solution. When I was invaded by England, Scotland and Ulster all at once, I quickly sought peace with England and agreed to become their vassal. Meanwhile, a diplomat I had spent my last few gold coins on had successfully established a healthier relationship with Scotland and peace soon followed. As my protectors, England destroyed Ulster's invading forces, and my prince was married to the English King's only child - a daughter. Upon the English King's death, I assumed half of England's provinces. 

I went from a 1 province kingdom with a crippled economy to immediately having access to half the game's trading goods. After sustaining good diplomatic relations in the form of trade agreements and non-aggression pacts with all my neighbours, I spent the lifetime of 3 Kings doing nothing but building my economy up to maximum strength. Every province governed, every upgrade built, every knight was educated to max level, and every tradition slot filled. When the time finally came, I unleashed 3 marshals fully stacked with heavy knights onto all of my neighbours conquering Scotland, Wales and Ireland in 2 hours. In the meantime, I sowed rebellion in enemy lands through spies and unleashed imprisoned former rebels from my own lands into my enemies for a bribe they happily accepted - distracting all of their forces. 

My experience in KOH 2 in all but 6 hours has been incredibly varied, difficult and immersive. All of the original game's features that I loved have been built upon and most importantly, expanded. The new province/upgrade system is a brilliant design choice and makes for some interesting choices as you find yourself specialising certain provinces for economical/military needs. Kingdom managements in KOH 2 is incredibly satisfying, as is the pursuit of acquiring every trade good and kingdom advantage - you'll find yourself greedily eyeing up provinces far from your own simply for their raw materials. 

Diplomacy seems simplistic on the surface, but it is incredibly effective and offers the player an alternative to being steamrolled off the map in the early game. It could do with some fleshing out however - I'd like to see the return of alliance pacts for instance. Difficulty has been vastly improved upon - I haven't seen a single faction steamroll Europe yet and I've been through many Kings now. The power balance is delicate and huge empires can be unrivalled by domestic issues, weak rulers and poor diplomatic ties. It's also nice to see that weaker nations are keen to plot together and overcome stronger foes militarily. 

I'm looking forward to the future of KOH 2. There is definitely a need to flesh out diplomacy. What immediately comes to mind is:

- female rulers
- alliance pacts
- age of rulers and current year/date etc
- deepening of character traits - perhaps even dynastical/genetic traits
- ability to rename kingdom/characters and customise flag - bannerlord/warband do this perfectly
- seasonal weather changes/patterns which effect military campaigns and economic output
- random events such as plague, famine, freak weather storms
- a larger world map with access to the americas for a late-game purpose or access to Central Asia
- ability to zoom out until you reach the political view without having to click on a tiny icon

I have seen plenty of negative reviews based on the graphics alone. Whilst outdated, I still appreciate the visual appeal of the game and it's aesthetic, I would however like to see this improved upon in future. 

For now, I can only say that for a day 1 release, this game is looking very good. I'd encourage negative reviewers to give KOH 2 more time and not to compare it to your other favourite titles - this is not CK or TW and nor is it meant to be. The game is cleanly developed and has stacks of potential. Thank you Black Sea Games.",1670409063,1670409123,True,3,1,0.511811017990112305,0,True,False,False

Main issue is, what do you expect - if you want another grand 4k, like TW, Crusader Kings, then no, dont buy it. 
But if you prefer more easier, fun and more ""relaxed"" gameplay, then KoH is exactly what you want - games are supossed to be fun, and KoH is not boring you with tons of graphs, diplomatic options and so on, as many other does - so why to add same thing again as other ? It is there, but more simple, easy to understand. 

Graphic has nice touch and feel of ""old 2D strategies"". 

Music is perfect, nostalgic tones and tunes from previous game can be heard. 

However - battles suffer due the pathfinding, but that can be improved via updates in the future. But - battles can be solved as many players does in Total War in 99% - auto-resolve, so you can focus on other parts of the game which are very good.

So - do you wanna buy this game ?

The graphics in middle earth RTS are actually better. That isn't a joke.

The default hotkey for changing camera rotation is [ and ] ...What? 

The mechanics are incredibly simple to a fault:

To upgrade a building, you upgrade it once. And all the buildings in your entire kingdom will be upgraded. I spend 800 gold on an aqeduct in Rome, all my shit is upgraded. If im a small irish king, its the same cost. Its also permanent, all future houses will have aqeducts. It makes no sense.

The RTS combat is genuinely worse than middle earth. You also have max 8 units in a general's stack,  with non marshall generals only having 5. the men in the unit can increase (usually 25-50) based on skill levels of general, country ect, but you cannot split them. Have a 50 man swordsman stack and want to flank? Too bad. You can bring in 1 additional general for another 5-8 units.

The camera is locked in place. You cannot zoom out. Know how vanilla dawn of war has their camera zoomed in? Same thing here. I do not understand why.

You have 9 ""knights"" total, which are your king, spies, diplomats, marshalls (the guys who can have 8 units in an army, super important), monks and merchants. 

Regardless of country size. Only 9. Which is actually kinda cool, as theres a point where youre too big, which means a smaller country will be able to use merchants ect, but a big one is really only going to use marshalls. 

 This isn't better than CK3, or total war. It has very few mechanics from either. Oh, you have a family? You literally cannot even do anything regarding it besides whom to marry, and which knight class you want your kids to be. So the ck3 aspect is barebones, and the RTS is also barebones. The macro level is barebones as well.

TL;DR: If you want to play the macro world map of total war bannerlord but without any of the fun battles, play a MOBILE GAME level RTS instead, play this.",1670408632,1670408632,False,5,0,0.420697420835494995,0,True,False,False

- People commenting about battles are idiots. The battles are not meant to be total war, nor they said it will be TW ! It's not a total war game. More or less the battles are improved version of original. Although units could use a little balance (probably will be some patch) and more variety (lucky for us there'll be mods 😊) 

-UI is much better. Graphic improved but still managed to keep the feeling you play original KoH. 

-Map has been increased 🤩 Although it's hard to manage big empire, a real challenge 🥲

-Building system has been completely changed from original game. I find it interesting and better, but doesn't mean all will think the same 🥲 Nevertheless it's not failure 🫡

-Diplomacy has remained almost the same as in original 

-Mora attention has been given to the royal family (Still it's not CK III ). Maybe they could give as ability to name our successors 🤔

I expected mods to be extremely interesting and good, since they announced mod support 🤩 (In game menu there's already Mods section 🤞🏻)

Overall with some little patches and mods it will amazing 😍🤩

This game tries to be like a combination of crusader kings and total war and whilst I really wanted this not only for more competition in the genre but also because I wanted something fresh this just falls so flat its not funny, especially for the price.


This note I had to put in after I finished the rest of this that is something that MUST be stated. THE PERFORMANCE IS DISGUSTINGLY BAD in battles; my god. I literally get 20 frames with 5 total units in a battle running on a machine that allows me to play any total war on ultra with max unit sizes.... what in the actual hell.

Firstly the lack of polish is astounding, from no UI scaling, certain controls being permanently bound and cannot be changed (e.i. you cannot change the bindings for the number keys), no ability to open the map quickly without having to select some kind of filter for it? like just make the kingdom map the default and let me push M on my keyboard... the graphics are okay at best for the most part but the map looks like one I would have seen in the early 2000's and the navigation of it in terms of the UI is akin to the same time period.

It seems like ALL of the focus went into the grand campaign and barely any went into the  battles. These battles encompass as much depth as fish bowl that's only half full:

- infantry are almost as fast as cavalry
- ranged infantry don't inflict casualities to their own side when firiing at the backs and fire their full power at the target with literally no friendly fire
- stances in battle allow for tight formations which is honestly all you should use as it gives bonuses with no drawbacks, you'd think this would effect ranged attacks but I tested it and it made no difference onece they were locked in combat so just keep that on for all units.
- units get tangled up and there is no clear UI to show which unit is yours which is annoying because they literally wear the same outfits for each class with no change in colour or anything.
- Basically if you have more troops you win, all you have to do is lock up their units and just mosey on over to their capture point and take it. take that point and you win the entire battle whilst there units are locked up. meaning if you have just 1 more unit than your enemy you can literally beat them just cos they're all tied up in the battle and cant do anything to stop you. and the capture points are so close its stupid easy.


This game honestly suffers from what I think is a lack of funding to actually make something of this scale resulting in a game thats more akin to generations past of related titles like Total war rome (1), cursader kings 1/2 and/or age of empires 1.  

I am in quite the predicament atm because I want to support games like this because I want that healthy competition in the genre but the game itself is so poorly executed that I just don't know if its worth it :(",1670373261,1670373793,False,265,17,0.706601798534393311,0,True,False,False

Buildings are limited to 4 (8 max gold needed to unlock slots) so you have to think which buildings to build and where. I should note each main building has 2-6 sub-buildings.
 
Council has received a few changes, now the base cost of each type is 200 (instead of 1000) going up for each one of the same type you have. Now you unlock traits using books. Some LV3 traits can be unlocked as traditions which will give you kingdom bonuses. When you unlock a trait for your King they start at LV3.
 
Diplomacy has received a change, through the new Diplomat. Allowing you to create invasion pacts, or defensive pacts (they took out alliances, since you can ask anyone to join your war). Diplomat can be used to improve opinions of the new Nobility, Army, Merchants, Clergy, Peasantry ""factions"" which give you positive or negative effects based on their opinion.

 They have greatly improved the system of taking provinces. You have 3 options in order to get full control of a province wait for it to naturally convert (which is affect by religion and culture), use an army to force them to submit (which will make people upset), or use a cleric to peacefully integrate into your kingdom.

 The political map has been improved. There are some other changes aswell.

 For me the 2 most important elements of a grand strategy game are Stability, and Gameplay.  I have experienced zero bugs/crashes so far, I havent tried multiplayer yet. Overall KOH2 is a solid sequel.

I looked at some of the negative reviews. I forgot some people have a problem with ""low rez"" icons and UI, personally I didnt notice this at all (I am running the game at 1440p so maybe that helps). I seen a few people believe its not different from the first KOH, its similar sure most sequels should be, but there is enough to bring fresh air to this old series.

This game is the much, much awaited successor of the first ""Knights of honor"", by the same developer (tough after 18 years, I don't expect them to be really the same). The first game was unique in gameplay: an RTS on the whole Eurpean map, with a grand strategy view, and this one is not reinventing anything: it's a modern remake with expanded depth.

Despite all their good intentions, the developers probably lack manpower and the game still needs a lot of improvement to be an enjoyable experience. The UI, needs massive improvement, bad graphical choices were made. The first instalment actually plays smoother than this one.

Nonetheless, developing this game was a heroic endeavour and it has massive potential.

Also I have not experienced any bugs so far, I don't know what those people are talking about.

I don't think the negative reviews are warranted at all so far, the game is a straight up improved and remastered version of the old one, with a lot of added features and deeper old features. Especially the grand campaign where you will be spending most of your time.

It's still different in gameplay and much harder now or at least challenging tbf, but that doesn't mean the game is ""shit"" or something like that. People who post negative reviews on this game didn't even bother to play that much and just compare it to EU IV or CK. You can't just simply compare this game to other ones like mentioned, because they are from Paradox Interactive and feature more in depth gameplay than KoH 2. While being basic and oriented to the original KoH game, it still offers new features and options for example spies, merchants and clerics. They also finally brought in the cultures and new kingdoms/tribes etc.. Multiplayer offers you to play coop or against other players on the Europe map like many of us wanted it back in KoH. 
Before you buy it you should also check out some reviews on Youtube about all the stuff.

The only thing missing is the option to play the actual battles in MP, but that is because the devs can't give us this option (check the official Discord server they have it pinned there if you want to know why...)

BUY, if you liked the first game. 
DON'T BUY, if you value graphics more then gameply. 
BUY, if you like not-too-deep but still engaging strategy games. 
DON'T BUY, if you expect Total War like real time battles. 
BUY, if you like the medieval period BUT 
DON'T BUY, if you expect a complex simulation of the medieval world - the game takes some liberties in this regard. 

Not sure what elso to say atm. Just try the game out, steam allows refunds if you play less then hours and that should give you an idea, if you like the game or not.",1670359241,1670359241,True,7,0,0.541984736919403076,0,True,False,False

The quality of the product is not at all up to the price that is asked for it. In general, the game is an improved version of the first part and tightened up in many aspects, which is a plus, but the drawback is that we didn’t see anything globally new, and it’s very strange for me to see such an inflated price tag for this game. Now, if the price was at least 20-30 euros, you could close your eyes to many things, but 45 is already a lot.
