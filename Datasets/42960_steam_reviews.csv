My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

As always, it comes with the classic Paradox game mechanics and a blatantly cheating AI that makes you want to throw your PC out of the window and makes you wonder why am I spending all these hours in the game and writing positive reviews in the first place. For example you get -1000 chances for forming alliance with a great power if you already have one great power ally. Doesn't bother the AI which happily forms alliances with 4 different GPs that will always respond to call to arms while for the player the AI breaks alliances (and game doesn't inform you anyhow about this) randomly and changes its mind constantly making any kind of long term planning impossible. 

Definitely a game I love to hate but for some reason keep coming back to. But as Paradox has displayed with HoI4, CK3 and Vic3, the new era of casual-friendly, DLC spewing, money milking, easymode not-so-grand strategy games is the future of this genre, if you do like factory building, gas attacks and rebel hunting, this is the best you're going to get.",1702100586,1702204281,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Victoria II, a Paradox Interactive gem, delivers a deep grand strategy experience set in the 19th century. With intricate economic systems, complex diplomacy, and historical accuracy, it's a challenging yet rewarding game. While visuals may show their age, an active modding community breathes new life into this historical epic. For strategy enthusiasts, Victoria II remains a timeless journey through the complexities of the Victorian era

This was the second ever Paradox game I ever tried out after someone recommended it to me, and I am glad they did because this game is a blast. Between changing laws, creating an empire, putting down rebellions, and building your industry, you always have something to do as long as you have a set goal in mind. 

For example, you might decide you want to play as Two Sicilies and unite the Italian Peninsular, okay well you're going to need a strong army and weapons for that army, and then create alliances and agreements with some neighbours, sphere others, and go to war with a few. Once you've done that, what next, well you could colonise Africa, well time to build docks and more armies, throw in some ships, increase your Intellectuals and increase education spending for research for better technology to colonise lands that haven't been colonised yet, or you could steal colonies from other powers, like the Ottomans, or the French. Maybe by game end you have a massive military industrial complex and a modernised Army and Navy, with ports and colonies in Africa and Asia, though not many allies in Europe from having to fight many of them.

My point is Victoria 2 on it's own is a great game, but you know what makes a game better, mods, and Vic 2 has many good mods, just go to Mod DB and go through Vic 2 mods, you want more alt his, go with Grand Combination, which is a combination of various mods like Historical Flavour and Historical Project, adding both alt history and what occurred in our time. You could also try out Divergences of Darkness, an interesting universe with a map that is completely different to our own. There are also smaller mods like Blood and Iron, which is a mod that is for balancing and adds a few features as well. Either way if you want a mod for something, it might exist on Mod DB.

No, buy Victoria 3 Instead

Despite all of this, I still love this game. Once you're familiar with the mechanics, It truly feels like the sky's the limit. Want to make Romania the world's dominant power? You can. Want to completely shatter Germany, giving them no chance of recovery? You Can. Want to spread the International Proletarian Revolution from America? You 125% Can. And with mods, there are insane amounts of flavor and depth that other games (specifically Victoria 3) are just lacking. It truly makes you feel like you're [i] in [/i] the victorian era.

Victoria 2 is a grand strategy game that engages you in the economic and political intricacies of the 19th century. The game's economic simulation is unparalleled even today in just about any other strategy title, with a vast array of resources and industries to manage, and a detailed population system that affects everything from your workforce to your military manpower.

The game's fitting soundtrack adds to the overall atmosphere and really helps to transport you back in time. From the orchestral music to the sound effects of factories and trains, everything feels authentic and adds to the immersion.

Although it shares elements of other military strategy games, the game's combat and army management system leave something to be desired. The combat is simplistic and lacks the depth and strategy of other games in the genre, making it feel like an afterthought rather than a core aspect of the game. An entire campaign's climax is decided by the roll of a few dice, which I suppose is fitting in a sense but is simply frustrating in practice. Additionally, army management is clunky and unintuitive, with a confusing interface that can be frustrating to navigate. The lack of any composition template system means every army has to be hand-crafted and any refitting of the armed forces is a micro-intensive practice, disincentivizing large-scale combat.

Despite these shortcomings, I still heavily recommend Vic 2 for fans of grand strategy games. Its economic simulation is top-notch, and the game offers a unique and immersive experience that is still enjoyable nearly a decade and a half later. If you can overlook the game's flaws in combat and army management, you'll find a rich and rewarding game that will keep you engaged for hours on end. Get it on a decent sale if you can.",1682217817,1689745942,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

With Vic' III on the market now, slowly falling over in the cupboard as Paradox does their standard routine of ""release the framework of a game and add all the features you want in DLC updates"", people are going to begin slowly trickling in to Vic II. Much is the way of vidya, when new thing come out, people go back to old thing. Except there's one thing.

The old thing has most if not all of similar problems.

Out of all of the map games, I have such a love/hate relationship with Vic' II. It is a fun game in regards to politicking, industry building and taking your average mediocre nation of choice and becoming a global powerhouse. The absolute humor of seeing things like Japanese Africa, Russian Brazil or American Africa never gets old. The issue is that the AI is absolutely, without question, the worst part of this game. It is both braindead in producing nothing, building factories everywhere and guiding their armies into weird corners of a map for no reason, while also having HoI brain where the SECOND they can declare war on you or get a casus belli, they pop it. You want to declare war on the CSA? Here comes England. You want to reclaim Liberia after a putsch? England is here to say no. If you breathe too loudly anywhere in New England, the British Empire can and will start a war with you.

Is this a skill issue? Yes. It doesn't make that infuriating and no amount of mods will undo the absolute fun that is trying to get to 1890 without someone on planet Earth starting a War of You Containment. The fact this was left in the game and no one's really questioned it in 13 years and then acted surprised Vic' III's got the same problems astounds me. It is a game that requires a lot of drilling to make functional and not an insufferable game of cat and mouse with the Austrians because god forbid I unite Germany.

The big advantage of Vic' II is being dirt cheap and having three DLC's that actually matter. So you can buy it on sale usually for five bucks, get all the DLC for an extra five bucks and have a gay old time.

You can choose any country and guide it through political, economic, and social changes, while interacting with other nations and competing for influence and resources.

One of the my favorite feature of the game is the mod POD, which stands for Pop Demand Mod. This mod adds a lot of depth and realism to the game, by simulating the events and movements of the Victorian era not by scripted events, but by the population and an elementary economics model. This means that the game is more dynamic and unpredictable, and that you have to pay attention to the needs and desires of your people, as well as the market forces and global trends.

Victoria II is a game that requires a lot of strategy and management, but also rewards you with a rich and immersive historical simulation. It is not a game for everyone, as it can be complex and challenging, but if you are interested in the period and enjoy grand strategy games, you will find it very satisfying and fun.",1686889532,1686889532,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

[hr][/hr]

Where do I begin? Victoria 2 is probably the most unique of the Paradox map games. Where as most of her sibling games are more about map painting, Vic2 puts a lot of focus on the economy. It changes and fluctuates depending not only by what you do but by what the AI (more so other players in multiplayer) do as well. Annex a province? Now you have direct access to the taxes of the citizens and factories there but also have to pay the bureaucrats, clergymen, and soldiers that live there. Going to war? Those soldiers need guns and so does the enemy. Built a factory? That needs to import the resources required to output goods. 

That's not to say that Vic2 doesn't have map painting. Hell, I would say it's probably one of the most satisfying Paradox game to map paint in. You have a variety of map modes you can paint in. You can watch as the cultural demographics of your country shifts from one to another. You can watch the entirety of the Americas be blue as you enforce the Monroe Doctrine using your sphere of influence. Or you can control the geopolitical scene with your name stretching over your country, your puppets (just like CK2), and the colonies you control around the world. Though the shift from provinces to states is a letdown, as unless you're using mods, the command console, or just so happen to conquer a country that doesn't control a full state, you will be stuck with countries having their borders line up with mostly modern ones.

Warfare I would say is a mix between CK2, EU4, and HoI4 (let me explain). Like EU4, you have 3 unit types: infantry, artillery, and cavalry. Infantry and cav in the first row, artillery hopefully in the second. Combat as well comes down to modifiers such as generals and terrain being added to a random roll of a dice, as well as mil tech adding more damage or defense to units so they either kill more of the enemy and die less. Like CK2, you have a variety of different ways to fill those three unit types. 11 to be precise. Like HoI4, specifically in the later game, warfare switches from moving stacks to siege high value provinces to a more front line system. Though this is technically an artificial change, created by countries being able to fund a larger army rather than any real mechanical change.
The naval system is much the same except without the elements of HoI4 in it.



That's not to say Victoria 2 is without fault. There are quite a few problems. 

For one, it's very much a spreadsheet simulator or a mindless ""number goes up = good"" experience depending on how you play. The economy is pretty complex with multiple tabs just dedicated to different aspects. You can manually increase or decrease the demands for certain goods depending on what you need (I do bet some average players don't know this), create certain factories to min-max what you produce and do so in an effective manor, and focus on conquering/colonizing certain regions for raw goods. Or you could just move the sliders so that you're making money while manning a large army.

Another is the AI. No AI is perfect in Paradox titles, and are often easy to exploit. That's all well and good for most titles. However it does become a problem with Vic2. Due to how the economy works, every ""civilized"" nation (or westernized in mods) and ""uncivs"" (unwesterns) within a sphere contributes it's resources to the global pool and also takes from it to fulfill their own internal demands. And every citizen, factory, and unit has demands. The AI doesn't know how to prioritize what's demanded and properly adjust when such demand drops on a local level. This can easily lead to economic crashes, such as the American lumber industry ceasing to exist due to Russia overproducing lumber, or not having enough goods for changing after a long period of war or peace.

The biggest issue, however, has to be the unfinished nature. Without DLC, there is a lack of polish or QoL features. You are quite literally forced to play on an older version. Even with DLC most places run out of flavor and things to do early on, or its too spread out. Not to mention that 99% of the flavor is entirely historical or dynamic, with a few easter eggs and proper alt history paths. This is in spite of how diverse this period of time was, with multiple events that could have changed the course of history. On top of that, there's not a lot of historical events actually within the game, with huge events such as the '48 revolutions and many era-defining wars completely absent or improperly represented. Despite what people say, Victoria 3 does have more flavor in it's base game than Vic2 did in its last real update of 3.03.
To get the flavorful content that people love about this game you have to download mods. Yes, being dependent on mods is a downside of a game, even if said mods are really good (looking at you, Skyrim). That being said, unlike some other Paradox games mods for Vic2 tend to be good. Very few filler, one-note memes, and unbalanced messes are present with most mods focused on adding content. The modding scene is active despite the game's seemingly small community, too.



Overall, I would say [b]buy this game![/b] Especially when on-sale. Pick up both expansions as well. The upsides outweigh the downsides, and the biggest downside can be fixed with mods (despite what I said about dependent on mods).",1684168588,1684168588,True,10,0,0.607628166675567627,0,True,False,False

[strike] Don't spend your time [/strike] Prepare spend more your time to understand the Game mechanics. Also be prepare to that Game is very buggy (especially in UI). It's Awful - after 12 years, exists these different UI bugs (even with all recommended DLC).

The IDEA is Great, but realization is awful.
The many mechanisms is a fiction - they a deep, on first point of view, but haven't any sense and influence on game (you can simple skip them).

Doesn't try to play based on ""economic terms"" and detail counting, [strike]It's a regular casual game but with very complex rules... not the realistic simulator of alternative history.[/strike] Most time you simply set the min or max possibile values (the values between haven't any sense to use)

It's a very complex Strategy Game with not clear how some mechanics works.
But to be hones, currently absent over games which can give to you a more interesting possibility to change real history of Earth (and play in alternate history).

The population has agency, what they feel and want is important and can open or close various avenues of action. When they revolt it's my own workers I'm killing, my brigades are formed from POPs in their home provinces and can run out of replacement soldiers or themselves revolt. POPs change profession, social class and location pretty much unaided, all I have are a few nudges I can deploy. It feels more like a living breathing improving world than a sandbox and that goes for the economy too. 

Every instance of a good not in existence at game start is created by a POP doing something. The market for produce in excess of consumption is anachronistic. Vic 2 scores each country on the sum of prestige, industrialisation and military points. Excess world goods are offered for sale to each country in turn, for consumption or stockpiling. None left, SOL. Try again tomorrow.

The top eight countries are Great Powers, able to influence other countries into their sphere of influence and get involved in crises. The next eight are Secondary Powers who can colonise along with the GPs. The GP system makes for crazy coalition wars and crises create a lot of opportunities for intrigue and derring-do. The Scramble for Africa is nicely done with a decent random element, also evident in the invention system. 

But most of all, Vic 2 feels like a tight, focused game that captures the romantic spirit of the times. The AI is good enough to try and accomplish various tasks, but also seems to have a keen eye for weakness in general.  The pacing is good, the player focus where it should be and the base mechanics are interlinked well enough to create plenty of interest. You really don't have to play like an expert or know how it all works to do well. Every playthrough is different (even from later stem saves) and I usually have ideas for the next game well before the finish. I haven't felt the need for mods yet.

The biggest problem is no ""batch"" actions, and no automation to compensate.
let me explain.
If you want to make a factory in stellaris, you can manually click through menus, or just click an option to have AI do it for you. More importantly, it is only, like one menu to click on. A better game would have a template system, that would let you create world templates, and apply them to planets of your choice, but the AI is pretty good about choosing useful buildings.

Victoria 2 has nothing like this. it is, like three menus per factory, and you cannot stay in the menu to build the factory. you can not automate this in a practical way (capitalists will VERY slowly expand factories, but it is purely random, and not beneficial to your economy), and you cannot create regional templates to make it a one-click process. this is incredibly slow, to the point where I cannot even describe it. just, like, play china, and you will understand.

Another issue is military control. Every paradox game that I have played has bad military controls. I have heard HOI4 has a better system, but I have not tried it yet. this one is REALLY bad. Vic2 controls have a system where you select one unit, and select its location. pretty simple, right? wrong. You can have literally hundreds of armies that all need to be individually controlled. You might say that this is fine, just merge your units into a doomstack. This is even worse. This game has fast ground capturing, and a supply system. if your army is too big, it will just melt due to lack of supplies. worse, your enemies will just split up, and capture all your ground faster than you can physically, individually move every single one of your armies to stop them. I cannot describe how awful this is. imagine clicking, like 200 times, and still losing. imagine, having to pause the game every 5 minutes for 10 minutes just to be able to control it. 

The economics could be fun, but they are not the ""hyper-realism"" that people declare it as. 
The UI is garbage, but it is a paradox game, so it is actually mid-range.

Just, like, play factorio, mindustry, or a more enjoyable progression simulator for a more pleasant micromanaging game. They have good UIs, controls, and better mods. 

I have *200 hours in factorio, and it felt like I could play it for a hundred more without even modding it. I have 30 hours i this game, and I never want to play it again, even with mods.

Do expect some flaws though. Some aspects are outdated, it is a harder game to get used to in comparison to CK3 and you will face a lot of anarcho-rebel groups or containment wars. I'd suggest buying the DLC or to use some mods to iron out its quirks.

Or try your best, at least, until you realize that your people are growing hungry and restless and the Jacobins call for your head.

It's always satisfying to achieve major feats. Unify Germany, become an industrial powerhouse, become the hegemon of your continent, or of the world. There is no set goals for the game but the ones you set out for yourself, although the game does prod in certain directions.

The base game is mediocre; get the expansions (A House Divided and Heart of Darkness) for a properly (almost) polished game. Maybe get some mods too; they can really enhance the game or even take it into entirely new realms.

tl;dr:

1. Get the expansions and the patches. You'll need them. I can't stress this enough.
2. The game has a strong learning curve, and some things, like the economy, you'll have to do math *and* use your gut feeling. Just like real life economics!
3. It's more fun to play a command economy, but you get more money as laissez-faire.
4. Mods make this a lot better, if you want.

I've heard mods make the game less buggy, but this game lacks a steam workshop, I could get a Stellaris mod or a Hearts of Iron 4 mod off of steam itself and not worry about malware, but with Victoria 2 I have to visit sketchy websites? nah I'll pass.

I hope Victoria 3 patches up the issues it currently has soon, in 2 years this will be remembered fondly but I'm sure no one will play the buggy mess after Victoria 3 patches up it's issues.",1671554426,1671554426,False,1,0,0.49632379412651062,0,True,False,False

But seriously this game has killed me on the inside. I have somehow managed to get in 1k hours while graduating college, eventually working a full-time job, and also even occasionally interacting w other people IRL (a rare achievement among frequent Paradox games players).

If you're remotely into 19th and early 20th Century history, the idea of simulating a simplified (but still intricate and fun to interact with) early industrial economy, and overlooking an army composed of different brigades with different abilities and strengths/weaknesses to play to, I highly recommend buying the game with all of the DLC available, and researching different mods while you're waiting for the game to install.

It takes a whileeee to even kinda get good at this game, looking back at old saves/screenshots makes me cringe so hard. Watch different youtubers if you're into that sorta thing, and definitely peruse online forums for advice before your first attempts. Just make sure if this is something you want to get into, you're probably gonna need a lot of free-time to really enjoy this game.

(That’s also my Tinder bio btw.) I just sit to play a game as China in Victoria II however, and I feel my power flow.

As a true sigma male I have never once played as the French in Victoria II. I simply refuse to let those “people” become the largest super power.

Victoria II it’s actually a pretty simple game. It's just stuck behind an unintuitive UI and layered behind submenus. At its core its just an incremental simulation game with chaos sprinkled in and 1800's dressing. But by the gods does seeing those numbers move about satisfy. 

It’s amazing. But it’s f**ked. It’s too short - only 36500 ticks. It’s too buggy at times. It’s utterly a mess under the hood. But it’s amazing. Sort of like learning to play chess, but the rulebook is in Old Polish so you have to translate first.

The economic system in Victoria II it’s like trying to understand Quantum Mechanics - if you think you understand the Vic II economy, you don't understand the Vic II economy. Just like the real economy actually.

Victoria 2 is clunky and badly shows it's age.  There's lots of systems in it that are pretty bland and that are frustrating, ahistorical, and unfun.  But I still love the game and Victoria is special for a lot of reasons. 

Overall while it’s old as f*ck and a deeply flawed game, Victoria 2 is so loved because it offers a unique gameplay experience that no other game does.  One would be that it's a time period seldom covered in other games. It's also the time period that covers the greatest changes to human existence in history.

You also can't take a one-province s*ithole to a superpower status like in EU4. I'm not going to say it's realistic, but it gives a good challenge to the player.

It's a game that heavily focuses on politics, industry, economy, and the social aspects of countries while being highlighted by occasional war. The flipped version of basically every other Paradox game.

It's done so incredibly well and with such complexity that it basically outpaces every other game, even if I personally enjoy their other titles - It's just that good at its job even after all these years.

In conclusion…

…great game, great memes, great depression, great war. Alas, Victoria 3 is finally here. The missions, the nightmares… they’re finally over.

So, what's it about? On the surface, it's a game of globe-spanning diplomacy, conquest, and social and economic development during the Victorian era. This, it manages well enough to keep someone engaged and interested for at least a few hours. Which is necessary, because the real meat-and-potatoes of the game are in its population and economic mechanics, and those take a while to learn properly. The level of detail with which production and consumption of different goods (services are either abstracted away as part of a good, or paid for by government spending) across a global market is pretty decent for a game that was ultimately built on top of a military strategy engine - each province in the game has inhabitants, which are lumped together into 'POP's; these have different jobs, different levels of education, different stressors and access to technological development, and all of these things affect what goods they want to consume (which are grouped into three categories for each POP - survival, basic, and luxury - and these needs being met will do different things, good and bad). A POP's job also dictates its income, which determines both what goods it is able to afford as well as how much tax it will be assessed for and pay to you. So far, this is granular, but pretty normal - the big differences in Victoria 2 are found in how goods are produced, and how they find their way to market.
For production, you've got three methods of increasing complexity. 
First is direct harvesting - each province in the game produces a specific raw good, and the people who live in that province can always default to working in that job, producing that good. Technically you can also have 'aristocrat' POPs who own shares in these and make money from that, but - for gameplay purposes they can mostly be ignored if you want, because they don't need to provide input goods. 
Second method - direct production of secondary goods by POPs called 'artisans'. These are conceptually the simplest job type in the game - they buy ingredients, convert them directly into finished products, sell the products and attempt to live off the profits. In practise, they take some time to learn how to work with; as they buy input goods with their own money, it's very possible to drive them bankrupt with no hope of recovery.
Fortunately, there's also the third type of goods production - factories. These work similarly to farms and mines, in that people can always work in them if there are jobs open. They differ in that they must be built, and they need money in order to operate. That's as much detail as I can go into about their operation, because how they are built and funded differs depending on a variety of things. The laws of the country you're playing as will dictate how that works, and these can and do change during gameplay.

And that's probably the most interesting part about Victoria 2. You've got a whole variety of very detailed systems interacting with each other, but your methods for affecting any of them directly are intentionally fairly broad-spectrum and often limited, while still being impactful enough that it never feels pointless having all the extra detail in there. What I wrote above, about sending artisan POPs bankrupt? It will happen every game unless you're playing a country with very few provinces and thus very few POPs, because you can't tax one group of artisans more or less than anyone else - you set the tax rate for all of your artisans, and all of your government employees, and all of your military officers, and all of your factory administrators, on one slider. And the slider may have a limited range of settings it is allowed to be set to depending on the current government's tax policy. Bail out one large group of starving artisans who have been vital to keeping your under-developed economy producing enough money to pay for educators to raise literacy rates to research new technologies? Two other groups of artisans, plus all of your education workers, will all become hugely more wealthy and start cashing out of their current profession and changing into aristocrats, who then turn around and get upset at you because they're in a different tax setting and can't afford to buy the sailing boats and automobiles that they want to have now.
Oh! And they might have even been able to afford them, but - I didn't get to the other point, which is how goods are sold. That's interesting, too; you've got a global pool of buy orders and a global pool of sell orders (also, a domestic market, then a 'sphere' market; basically, your POPs won't sell all the food they just grew, leave nothing to eat, and then complain about starving, which is nice), and these are matched to each other according to a global ranking system - you get points for 'prestige' (cultural/technological achievements, wining wars, plus a few special events), economic power, and military power. So it's not purely about how much money you can make - you also have to position yourself to be able to spend it, and that's quite clever.

It's disastrously messy at times, but that's when it's at its very best. If you liked the moments in Crusader Kings games where your family nearly got wiped out because of one ambitious second-cousin who had a knife and the keys to the family castle - you might love this one, too. Or you might hate it; the map screen on this game looks nice, but it's not where you play most of the actual game.

WAR. it is based in tech and who has the highest numbers of soldiers, so no strategy required.

REVELS: they revolt continuously and are annoying to deal with. Even though you crush them or give in to their demands, the number of potential revolts never decrease. You can have the most prosperous nation in the world, but they continue to revolt just for the lols. 

AI. the AI continuously cheat spamming units and recovering way faster than you can.

42960,124756091,76561198009398156,0,4,655,0,655,1686935827,"Victoria 2 is one of the only games I've ever played where a lack of player agency is a constructive component of the gameplay experience. The name of the game with Victoria 2 is influence, not control; in the age of revolutions and extremist ideologies, you can't CONTROL what your people think, who they support or vote for. But you CAN influence it: high affluence and easy access to goods will keep them content and discourage them from radicalizing; focusing on the support of specific parties will make it more likely for those parties to achieve electoral victories even if the rest of your nation doesn't support the ideology they espouse; press censorship can dissuade POPs from becoming class conscious, or full press freedom can be enacted to rapidly liberalize your POPs to encourage liberalization of the government.

You as the player have no direct hand in this - but, again, you do have influence. There is no button to make imports happen, or make your people wealthier, but you can conquer lands to expand your markets, or use soft power (Influence, a mechanic locked to the eight Great Powers) to expand market access in unaffiliated nations, increasing goods access and making them cheaper. If a party loses an election, outside of a monarchy you don't get to void the results of the electoral process, but as previously mentioned you can encourage party support to try to ensure your preferred party wins elections even if your people don't fully support that ideology (just be prepared to pay the price that comes with that in militancy, for an unpopular party ruling the nation). If you want to enact press censorship, or end press censorship, you can't simply decide to do that if your Upper House doesn't support it. The ideology of your voters has to be in line with your goals, OR your people need to be militantly agitated enough to encourage the curmudgeons in your government that their lives would be at risk if they didn't reform. But you can try to expand the vote franchise to change the electoral makeup of your state, as long as you can get the same Upper House to agree to that.

This philosophy of influence without direct control is inspired. Outside of a few extremely micro-heavy elements of the design which do deserve to be criticized, the interconnection of the mechanics makes everything feel seamless while every action is also important. Adding a small nation to your Sphere of Influence could be the difference between a factory remaining open or shutting down due to a lack of markets and available resources. That factory shutting down could be the difference between a portion of your industrial population radicalizing due to unemployment and poor living conditions or remaining pleasantly aloof and supportive of your government. And that can be the difference between a revolution and a calm, prosperous nation.

You never feel like you're fighting your nation, but sometimes you will feel like you're fighting your POPs, struggling to steer them in the way they need to move for your national prosperity. That struggle to influence your own people is the cornerstone of Vicky2, and is one of the most unique, fun, and challenging implementations of indirect player control I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing. Because don't let my Steam hours fool you: I launch this game direct from the .exe, which stops it from tracking properly.

You either try to industrialize and run your economy yourself or the game does it for you inefficiently. War is doomstacks playing hide n seek then a carpet siege. 

If you don't have a substantial population or belong in the new world you get almost no immigration so you have to take lands in china for pops.

Not fun if you like playing minor nations. As there is an optimal strategy and without it you'll never compete with a major.

Politics and rebels are weird. You often just randomly get to select new laws. Jacobin rebels spawn so much its a meme in the pdx community but thats okay because haha funny rebels.

Diplomacy is annoying. Awaiting for arbitrary diplo actions that cap at 9 then having to manually buff relations by 15 pts every so often is a micro nightmare. Sphereing is kind of cool but the new market system in vicky 3 is better than this imo.

The Ui is okay for the time. But your unable to zoom to nations or provinces from popups which spoils me. I tried playing it again recently and it felt awful without most of the newer features we take for granted like a lot of mapmodes

The economy/society simulation is very fun if you're into that kind of thing. Probably the best in all of gaming until we see Vicky 3. The game can be boring if you are not a fan of economy/society simulation, for example if warfare is more important for you.

Some aspects have not aged well compared to modern titles. Biggest complaint is there can be a lot of micromanagement when you play certain big nations.

The premise is similar to other Paradox-developed strategy games; conquer the world in some sort of historical era. Victoria II, clearly, takes place in the Victorian age, which was defined by colonialism and European dominance.

Gameplay is insanely replayable. You can play until your heart’s content and you will still find things you haven’t done.

Since this is a 12-year old grand strategy game, graphics are irrelevant.

In terms of downloadable content, it can be summarized as “It’s Paradox, there will be DLC”, but, considering this game’s longevity, I was pleasantly surprised to see a relatively low price to purchase all of them.

Price point is debatable. By every measure, Victoria II is one of the best, if not the best game in its genre, however, Paradox is, at the time of review, about to release the long-awaited Victoria III. The game will probably go on sale in the near future, but you don’t have to wait if you don’t want to.

To sum up, Paradox really hit it out of the park with Victoria II, and it is, and will remain, one of the best games of all time.

After seeing the release date of Victoria 3 (Vic3), I convinced myself that if I was ever going to play Vic2 it would have to be soon. This game was sitting in my library for many years (released in 2010), so I thought why not and gave it a go. 
If anybody does not know, Vic2 is a global strategy game of Paradox Interactive. A cousin, if you will, of Hearts of Iron (HOI) and Europa Universalis (EU). And to be upfront, if this is news to you, I would rather tell you now that simply waiting for Vic3 would be your best bet. 

With people familiar with these series, Vic2 focuses more on the economy and political aspects. At first, the economy seems daunting but with a bit research you can boil down the basics of how the game works. The politics blends well with all aspects of the game which influences the player how to run their country (from libertarian to fascism) with each their pros and cons. Like all paradox games there is a meta of gameplay and once you understand that the game becomes quite manageable.

However, just because it is manageable does not mean the game is easily understandable. There is a lot of data that flies at you in the game, but a lot of that data does not lead to good information directly. For example, will my fabric industry be profitable or where exactly is ‘Mission to Civilize’ in the tech tree? The game does not really tell you directly, but you can find out ‘MANUALLY’. And this is really where the game shows its age, the tool tips are minimal and gives a bread crumb trail for the player to figure out manually. And to be fair, previous paradox games were like this back then. I get a wave of nostalgia from hearts of iron 3 as Germany with Operation Barbarossa, manually controlling the eastern front into Moscow. It took a lot of micromanaging and sifting through data to organize myself to ensure success. And this is what you will be doing if you play Vic2, lots of pausing the game and looking up the wiki to understand what flash point tension means or the difference between liberate country rather than liberate people. 

And hey, there is nothing wrong with that, but this is where Vic2 really shows its age. This game is about 12 years old with two DLCs that came out in 2012 and 2013 (with a lot of sprite packs as well). Those sprites did add some flavour to the game, but the graphics are quite barebones and nothing to write much about.

The last two aspects of the game are the diplomacy and warfare. The diplomacy is the most understandable part of the game due to the limited options you have. The crisis system is a nice touch, but all my games usually ended with white peace (status quo), so nothing really ever came from it unless I as a great power decided to screw around. The game, understandably for the timeline, limits the player’s personal conquest. For example, if you go too far out all the other great powers will team up and slap you down to size with war. 

Warfare is not in the focus for Vic2. And personally, my least favorite part of the game, as you have to game the AI with a very strict meta to make yourself victorious. As my run through with Germany I had to micromanage my death stack around western France even though the battle borders were near Belgium. It doesn’t feel realistic and its just micromanaging your stacks of units to avoid attrition and the other enemy stack that is slightly larger than you. Because 9/10 the bigger unit will win unless you do something silly like attack a unit in the mountains with a river crossing. The ally AI is frustrating at best, with the AI sometimes doing nothing (thanks UK) or just standing right beside you when you desperately need their units to aid in the battle. Otherwise, battles revolve around a simple 0-9 die system. Which if you are unlucky like me, can be rage inducing. 

So overall, if you have this game in your library this may be your chance to play it before Vic3 comes out. And if you do not have it in your library, I would suggest you wait for Vic3* as the game is definitely showing age. 

[i]*As with all Paradox games, I strongly would wait for the at least the first DLC to come out to buy the base game. Paradox first day releases tend to be buggy, unbalanced, and barebones. So give it about a few patches before buying.[/i]

It's not really fun to play outside of Europe, the US, Japan, and a handful of others. Mods make the game better but I don't really know what is the best way to play. Modded or Vanilla. Immigration is also sort of janky, and the economy is weird. You can understand it, you can see how it is supposed to work. But ultimately you never know what is really going on with it, and if you play multiplayer you can absolutely ruin the world's economy forever.

”Before the class begins, you must get on your knees and worship State Capitalism and accept that it is the most highly-evolved economic philosophy the world has ever known, even greater than Laissez-Faire!”

At this moment, a brave, reformist, laissez-faire liberal author whose voice was heard all over $COUNTRY$ and who had served in over 1848 Jacobin rebel uprisings and understood the necessity of unprofitable factories shutting down and fully supported all economic decision made by the Capitalist POPs stood up and held up a production tab.
”How would you fix this failing industry, pinhead?”
The arrogant professor smirked quite reactionarly and smugly replied “by subsidizing, you stupid Liberal”
”Wrong. The factories need to shut down. If they were valuable enough to spend money on as you say… then they should be profitable by now!”

The professor was visibly shaken, and dropped his chalk and a copy of Treasure by Foreign Trade. He stormed out of the room crying those reactionary crocodile tears. The same tears reactionaries cry for the “unemployed craftsmen” (who today live in such luxury that most can afford Life Needs) when they jealously try to claw the right to build factories from the deserving job creators. There is no doubt that at this point our professor, Benjamin Disraeli, wished he had pulled himself up by his bootstraps and become more than a conservative interventionist. He wished so much that he had a guillotine to execute himself from embarrassment, but he himself had petitioned against them!

The students applauded and all signed up for the Liberal Student's Association that day and accepted the Invisible Hand as their lord and savior. An eagle named “Laissez-Faire” flew into the room and perched atop the $COUNTRY$ Flag and shed a tear on the chalk. The Springtime of Nations event was fired several times, and Robert Peel himself showed up and repealed tarrifs across the country. The professor lost his tenure and was fired the next day. He died of the market crash induced by his subsidies.

That being said, this game is old. Both the UI and mechanics (in some cases the lack thereof) stink of older paradox design. Mods are necessary to make the game playable long term (think more than one or two playthroughs), but can't begin to solve all the issues hindering the game. Important game mechanics and more importantly the mods that make this game playable are gated behind owning both DLCs, essentially mandating you add the DLC price into the base cost. And the most interesting mechanics of this game (the economy and POPs) are rarely interacted with, existing more as set pieces than game mechanics. The community around this game can also be incredibly pretentious.

Unlike Ck3, it focuses more on the nation as a whole, rather than the personal life of the people in the game. And unlike Hoi IV, it focuses a lot more on domestic and internal affairs, rather than being largely consumed by the military aspect.
Victoria II offers so much in terms of gameplay and is able to balance them so well.

Of course, though, the DLC aspect is quite annoying, seeing how the DLC's usually have things that would be best to be in the standard game, though Victoria II does seem less DLC dependent, with the exception of Heart of Darkness and A House Divided, largely because the Greater Flavour Mod is based on Heart of Darkness, which for new players who wish to purchase that DLC, you do need to have A House Divided as well, but I say its worth it for The Greater Flavour Mod.

-attack goes well, I have miltech advantage and the AI isn't that good anyways

-despite literally being behind enemy lines, they are still reinforcing and getting supplies through magical teleports I guess

However, this does not subtract the fun if you like tactical EUIV games or the grand strategy of HOI IV. You have to play through a playthrough to figure it out, but it's understandable if you watch what you're doing and maybe google a bit. The older mechanics work pretty decent considering, however the AI is not very smart. You will end every game with quite some bordergore and world wars can break out over the stupidest things. But if you accept this and maybe download a mod like HPM to complement the vanilla game, Vicky 2 still stands strong with the modern Paradox titles. What I personally really love about Vicky 2 is that the surreal World Conquests are hard to do because of the mechanics and that it really focusses on the Great Power competition. You can for example only annex few provinces before you're 'infamy' reaches the 25 mark (basically aggressive expansion and the mark for coalition) and the struggle really focuses on influence spheres and economy. Military is still very important though, but annexing your way to the top will be a less optimised strategy.

The deciding factor in whether or not this game is for you is whether you really, actually care what the political ideology of the player's country is. If you don't, no worries--this one is just probably not for you.

But if you DO give a hoot about the origins of all modern political ideology, from the preservation of the ancien regime to the beginnings of communism, the reaction of fascism, and the dogged perseverance of market liberalism, this game is going to treat you like no other. Its balance of political, economic, and military affairs is completely unique even within Paradox's practically unique genre. Where some games would simply script the WWI event, Paradox's commitment to dynamic unscripted gameplay shines through with the Crisis system, a completely organic way of precipitating the political flashpoints that brought the great alliances into confrontation. The economic simulation is probably the deepest in the history of video games--a system so deep it has been rumored that the devs at Paradox simply forgot how it worked and were unable to figure it out, forcing them to start from scratch for Vic3--apocryphal or not, when you play the game you'll see what I mean, in the best way possible. 

That said, this game has a lot of problems. A LOT of them, actually.
* The completely linear research system is a little lackluster--functional but not really strategic.
* Likewise, the Civilization system is plainly just bad for gameplay, putting all unrecognized powers at a massive and permanent disadvantage--this is understandable given context, but with no other real avenue of gameplay, this just means I don't ever want to play them. Thankfully Vic3 is planning to essentially fix this with its ""recognition"" and ""centralization"" systems, adding some variety for non-Eurocentric play.
* The game does not exactly treat slavery & colonization as carefully as I think it warrants. While not exactly gung ho about either topic, colonization in particular is presented in a pretty gamified and ahistorical fashion. Putting players in a Eurocentric role and making it a game mechanic is fine--and thankfully Vic3 will take a more careful approach, but passing over most of it without comment or without really pushing back on the player in any significant way makes it just a little too *fun*, maybe, to scramble for Africa.",1656097399,1656097399,True,0,0,0.467113494873046875,0,True,False,False

Every time it crashed I loaded the game anew (which takes about 1,5 minutes although the specs of my PC are quite good), but alas, it crashed again. Also the tutorial shows that the game is rather intricate and at the same time the UI is not intuitive at all, quite user unfriendly. So, I have tried to play the game without the tutorial; I can of course read the manual. But still the UI is so unfriendly that I did not manage to get the game going.

Most of these flaws are a product of the game just showing it's age to put it bluntly. Now that doesn't mean all older games are inherently bad I wouldn't say that at all several of my all time favorites including this game are my favorites because they are older games, and this is what sums up Victoria II for me personally. This game feels wacky to play at times there are bugs and the UI feels dated and clunky and some of the mechanics feel poorly implemented and with a lack of explanation on how to use them. I have found myself overwhelmed with trying to manage rebels and keeping them from rampaging through my country on numerous occasions particularly the jacobins. Diplomacy in this game is rather lackluster with the ai behaving quite terribly and taking very puzzling actions. But the way the ai handles diplomacy isn't as bad as the war ai which is probably the biggest weakness of this game, which can be said honestly for most paradox games. Wars in victoria 2 can feel lackluster and way to easy at times as you can outsmart the ai with absolute ease. But despite all of these things, I still keep coming back and this is one of my most played games ever. The reason why is the fact that Victoria just has a certain charm that most grand strategy games severely lack. The complexity of the industry and economy and the internal politics of the nation are simply captivating and really fun to dive into, I can play entire sessions in the industry screen looking over numbers and designing the perfect economic system. Most modern grand strategy games lack this level of detail and simplify things way too much. I have found very few games that can compete with the level depth detail and charm Victoria II provides. Strongly recommend this game despite it not being perfect and having issues. The 20 dollar price tag is very much worth it, I have put 800 hours into this game and don't regret a single minute.",1655420989,1655420989,True,24,0,0.712567448616027832,0,True,False,False

Even if he economy is broken by goods multiplication, lacks price differences across the world or ignores the price of logistics, it is still the best and most complex simulator of world economy and industrial revolution I know of. You have many tools to rule your country to let it thrive or boil in turmoil and revolutions. You can liberate nations from their empire oppressors, or you can become the oppressor of the world. Choice is yours, you'll live with the consequences. The AI is quite weak and you can exploit many areas of the game, despite this the game is extremely enjoyable and you can play it anyway you want. You can even chill, let the game play itself, do almost nothing, and you can still have a lot of fun.

But you can just go full conquest mode still and try to conquer as much as you want. Its a lot harder to conquest in this game trying to balance revolting, and infamy, and wars on multiple fronts. You have a much more granular control of your armies controlling each army individually and where they go. I love playing a small nation and becoming a big boy or just steam rolling the world as germany or the usa. Some bullshit happens every game such as Britain starting ww3 over greece receiving macedonia. And you are allied with russia who is allied with the ottomans so you are pulled into the war. Or you can ignore and lose a good ally forever. Super tricky. 

Take your country through the industrial revolution and become a world power! Slaughter civillians, enact slavery, become a facist dictatorship, and rule the world!

I had heard a lot of great things from Vic2 but never had time to really learn the game. All in all Im quite disappointed compared to games like CK2 or EU4.

- The interface itself isn't very user-friendly, you spend a lot of time just looking for the right RGO in a very long list
- many options in the game are useless... Trade could be good, but who manages his stockpiles manually? And Im not sure having so many resources is necessary.
- the game is not balanced, in the sense that with Sweden, Belgium, Denmark, 15 years into the game I had 5 Millions in bank. I just put max taxes, max tariffs and Im golden... without obvious drawbacks
- War is simple, you fight one battle and then the winner just destroys the loser... the losing army only retreats 1 tile, contrarily to the other Pdx titles
....
I could go on and on, but worse, it looks like the replayability is limited. I mean that you have a few choices, but if you go to Africa, the 1870 rush is boring, and before that you would always attack Sokoto... You could play Japan or UK or France.. with slightly different experiences, but nothing compared to CK2 for example. Even EU3 was better.

In the end, Im quite disappointed (but then I paid the game 5 euros with expansions... so still worth it) but I trust Pdx will do something great with Vic3",1651156683,1651156683,False,2,0,0.502540707588195801,0,True,False,False

Beginning with the pros, this game will allow you to sink hundreds of hours into it, and while it does not change mechanically with each nation, it does allow for a completely different experience on almost every playthrough. I have rarely played a game of Victoria without having fun once I got the hang of it.

That being said, this game also suffers from the classic Paradox shortcomings. The combat and economy management are a little difficult to understand at first, and I would recommend looking up guides online to fully understand them rather than relying on the inadequate game instructions. Furthermore, similar to EU4, this game is basically UNPLAYABLE without buying the two substantial DLCs, both of which are priced significantly higher than any DLC should be for a 12 year old game. Paradox consistently locks what should be free patches and updates behind DLC paywalls, forcing you to spend twice or three times as much as sticker price for the essential mechanical upgrades and fixes found in the final product. Combat in particular without DLC is absolutely horrendous. Furthermore, Paradox relies on their mod community to keep the game fresh after you become an experienced player, as with all their other games, which is both a boon for the player and an indicitement against Paradox's barebones vanilla experience.

Overall, while I would recommend Victoria II, I would advise the interested consumer to wait until there is a good deal available to purchase it so as not to feed Paradox's greed.",1650205002,1650205002,True,1,0,0.504160881042480469,0,True,False,False

I started using HPM specifically because of how boring the implementation of the Meiji Restoration was in the vanilla game (literally it was just *push button* -> *become modern*), and the mod really brought a lot of flavor to the game - the only problem is that now you have to wait for ages before you really have a ton of options because of how slow westernization is, and how little you're allowed to do until you're a modernized/great power.

Japan aside, the game is cool, but has some painful limitations. My biggest issue is probably the way armies work in the game? Basically, you have to manually stack tens or hundreds of individual brigades into their armies, moving them across the map until they can join the army you want them in. It's an irksome process. Second to that, though, is how little there is to do sometimes? Depending on how far in the game you are, and what country you're playing, you may or may not have large swathes of the game locked off from you because you're either not westernized or you're not a great power. Lame.

Probably my favorite thing in the game, though, is watching how various nations in the world develop alongside yourself. It's always funny to watch Italy go through revolution after revolution - swapping between fascist, democratic, and socialist governments - or to watch the Mormons break away from the US and form their own nation... lmao. And of course, you yourself could go through those things too. It's just as fun to push your country towards being the first socialist dictatorship in the world, or to release interesting countries from yourself as puppets!

If you're coming from another pdx game and you find this game tough to get into, a couple tips.

1) Every pdx game has sort of a core focus. Eu focuses on map painting, hoi focuses on tactical combat, ck focuses on kingdom management within feudalism. In Vic, you focus on pops and economy. So if it's stressing you out that you're not constantly warring like in eu4, that's perfectly fine.

2) A few fundamental truths about the game. This is set during a period of rapid industrialization. This means... 

- You want your farmers and labourers (people who work the land) to become craftsmen (people who work in factories). Get technology that makes your farms/mines more efficient, and encourage people to join your factories.
- This means artisans (people who make specialized goods prior to industrialization generally speaking) will occasionally starve to death. Don't worry, this is normal. Fuck the poor
- Capitalists are retarded and have no concept of supply chains or making use of your RGOs (a good the province produces), so build your own factories early on, and match them with corresponding RGOs and create supply chains within the same state. After your core economy is established, it's not as important to build anymore (save for new techs). To do this, you need a government that allows you to build factories (State Capitalism)
- One slightly less intuitive thing about this game is that being really successful doesn't correlate quite as strongly with how big your country looks on a map compared to other pdx titles. You want prestige, industry score and military score, so things like literacy rates, technology, population density, good raw materials like iron/coal are more useful than blobbing if you want to become stronk.
- If your factory isn't getting a critical resource, there's a very good chance that its in very high demand on the world market. Check the trade screen and connect the dots.
- Everything is incentive based in this game. In eu4 and ck3, you can just conscript people into your army at the drop of a dime if you have the money. In vic2, you need to convince people that joining the army is worthwhile, so drag that slider up!

Hope these tips help.",1649247538,1649247538,True,45,0,0.790172040462493896,2,True,False,False

You have to manage your economy through taxes, trading, building factories etc, whilst keeping a close eye on your military/infrastructure expenditure. Balancing them is fun not annoying.
When it comes to military conquest (which these games invariably do), you need to keep an eye on your unit attrition and reinforcement levels, whilst also making sure they are actually getting supplied, and all of this while trying not to annoy the other 'Great Powers' and causing them to go to war with you. Oh, and don't forget to make sure your fleets are maintained to a high standard. We don't want to be going into a battle with more holes than a sieve in the ships :)

You can try to influence smaller countries/empires to bring them into your sphere of influence and making sure that other empires don't do similar, using a few sneaky tricks available (ban embassy etc).

I think the only thing I would maybe change, if programming allowed, would be the ability to fight your own battles on a small map. I find it frustrating that I can get beat down by a much smaller, less experienced army, but that's a very small issue in my opinion.

In my opinion, Victoria II is the best of Paradox's grand strategy games. There's just something about it. Perhaps it's how involved and in-depth the economy is. Or maybe how complex and deep the political system is. Or maybe it's the population system that breaks down the opinions of each specific group in your society (artisans, laborers, aristocrats, bureaucrats, etc.) and their attitude toward your governance. In reality, it's a combination of these things and more that make this game such a timeless masterpiece.

for me the rating is to low for this game imo. Thats why I let some opinion out of my head:

[u]Summary first:[/u]
- alternate history strategy game for connaisseures of realm-creation and people which have pleasure in leading a 
  country of their choice to glory or dominion or to something they like it to be.
- each part of the mechanics feels logical and useful (esp. with the community mods!!!) and has some kind of depth.
- immensly immersive in my eyes. You get a certain feeling for evey step u make into the modern world with plenty 
  technologies, new troops, industrial goods or even populations culture
- interesting and quiet complex population simulation mechanics from poor to rich with interests in politics, social 
  reforms, rebellion, religion, etc. They have own money, they immigrate, they have needs. All like 'easy to learn and not 
  so hard to master' ;)
- A.I. is solid. Sometimes they make some stupid wars they cant win or dont get all out of they military potential but the 
  A.I. also can suprise with some good ideas and clever timing to get their goals done.
- I recommend to buy this game in sale just because its these times where games seem to stay full price for 10 years or 
  more. 
- I highly recommend to get community-mods like Pop Demand Mod (pdm) or PoPs of Darkness to get so much more out 
  of this pearl
- i also recommend to use lets plays to reduce the time to get the basics immensly. After that u only need to check up the 
  wiki from time to time.

I got a lot from the game and want to give something back with this esp. after seeing the rating going down for vic2 recently and for me for reasons that not allways concerning the game.

Leaving [i]Paradox[/i] and all the talking aside, this game is still some great piece of gaming experience for the ones who love to create a what-if-history-would-have-been-like-this-realm. Its perfect for making up an own story while an alternating history is happening in the world around u. Imagine to have an Northamerica with balanced powers of Mexico, Confederates and the Union States. What happens if China becomes an industrial Power like 1870 already? How about Brazil being not so friendly and tries to build up an imperial reign over full south america? 

For those kind of ideas u need some hours to get into the enough to have control over all mechanics which are going some kinda deep but not really overwhelmingly detailled. I watched a let's play for like 3 episodes and had barely all in my head to let it roll.
After that i had a pretty nice time trying out stuff of all various kinds. The game also offers a nice input of historical events and understanding what the world was like back the days. In a time the gap between the cultures and technologies vastly extended to a point where war became a common mechanic to gather might, the rise of idiologies, birth of nations and the power of production u can pick out one idea of the future and try to make it happen.

To get this done u have to build up a healthy country with strong economy and military. Most time thats just one side of the coin. Good relations to other countries and Alliances will give u advantages directly or open up opportunities in the first place. Allies give u goods u need to get ur factories working or to build troops, they support u in battle or give u access to their ports for ur seacraft units and more thought they sometimes seem to act somekinda strange when it comes to participating in wars or cancelling treaties a bit suprisingly. About artificial Intelligence: Dont expect high end A.I. that's only to beat when u play like an real general. The game gives u many information and even more information is to be found in the wikis what can be a little bit overwhelming in the beginning. It takes maybe 20 hours of play or so to fully understand what is really important to look at and what is not so worth to break ur head bout. 

All in all this game is nicely balanced to get ur plans done and have fun.
If u want to proof ur genius - no. 
If u like to just drop in and play some war - don't buy it.
But if u want to be slightly challenged (even more if u want to beat the greatest powers like France,Great Britan, The USA or Germany) and are willing to invest some time while u are getting a historical interesting insight to a not even so far away past u may get this game when its in sale. Sure - for me even 50€ would have been ok. But if u are not sure... its on sale at leats 2 times a year for like 20€ with all dlcs. :)

Last but very important point:
Hats off to the mod-makers. The basegame is great but a bit slim after u got into it for some time.
Look up the extending Mods like Pop Demand Mod or PoPs of Darkness.
They immensly enrich the game with many many improvements concerning A.I., Varity, balancing.
I highly recommend to play the game with these mods if u like to have the full vic2 experience.
They are not in the workshop, but to find in the web and dont need any skills to implement.

Last line is for monkeys! Yes, if u read to this point u are most likey to be a cute lil monkey.",1526668153,1644409670,True,29,0,0.765468060970306396,2,True,False,False

- One of Paradox's older titles yet it still offers better internal country mechanics than titles that are 8-10 years newer than itself. This game is not focused on warfare and conquest unlike other paradox titles, and being the number 1 power doesnt require conquering the whole world
- That being said the warfare in this game is quite similar to other paradox titles, yet due to the natural progression of technology, battles have around 3 distinct phases in the game. warfare in 1836 is nothing like that in 1900.
- The fundamental feature about Victoria 2 are the POPs which represent a certain demographic of people in your country. Managing the wants and needs of your pops and that of your nation is the key here.
- Plethora of mods available which helps fix the amount of flavour for many countries, allows for alternate history, border fixes, and in some cases even the economy. HPM, HFM, The Grand Combination are just a few of the many great mods out there.
CONS: 
- The game shows its age especially for those who are used to newer titles such as CK3. The UI is quite outdated and the game does not tell you a whole lot about what is going on. (This lack of information is what leads to people saying you need an economics degree to understand what happens in game). The economy in this game and the world market are also quite broken, especially in the late game, which also leads to frustration.
- Warfare in the late game is also extremely tedious as the size of armies and the amount of people you can mobilize for war will be in the millions. The units in game are organized in brigades of 3000 men, which means manually moving ~1000 units in some cases.

Its pretty addictive and is a solid game, but I can't recommend it just because its essentially just EU4 but not as polished.

It did come before EU4, so its a shame the game is still pretty broken over 10 years after its release. For example, demand for resources will get so high (and stay so high) that literally nobody but the GPs can have access to them, and it leads to a death spiral of 'nobody else can be a GP because they cant train troops, and they cant train troops because they arent a GP'.

Silly stuff like that on top of lots of crashes and the combat that, while good for its age, feels dated at this point, as it was essentially copy-pasted into EU4 and really hasn't aged well I feel.

That said, the concept has a ton of potential. It just needs abit of an overhaul and some polish and it can really shine as the best Paradox Grand Strategy game of the bunch. Its looking like Paradox has every intention of doing that with Victoria 3, which is very good news, but that also means that if you are looking to get into the franchise, you really should just wait.",1644303184,1644303184,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Vitoria 2 is as weak as Vitoria 1....

The money used in aquiring these game was ...a waste of money, unfortunatly :-(

Paradox has to rework totally this concept, implement a credible economic model (in coutry and international) and political political (in country and international trading and political diplomacy).
Also, the war model sucks.....

For a game that needs to model so many essencial parameters (all that exist in a country and its interation in the world) simply Paradox did not allocate the resources or time to really present a compelling game.
Of course a game like this is not possible to develop in 1, 5 or even 10 years, as it is necessarily quite complex.

Unfortunatly I cannot recommend the aquisition of any of this games....

If you are like me and you are looking for many years for a game of this type, 

Paradox is developing Victoria 3 and already announcing it.
It is very important that they develop a free demo download for players like me to try the game, or give a 90 days ""money back"" guarante that our money is returned if the game falls bellow our wexpectations.

I have bought some of Paradox games since the company started (I am not into all type of gaming), but I am not a blind follower or believer.
WATCH OUT for MOST people recommending a game, as 90% of those have a direct interest in earning money with that game. If you go and discover them, they are ""influencers"" that earn their living in Ytube or other places.

Nothing wrong with that, as long as their reviews are honest and impartial...but, seldom I see that type of review from these ""influencers""...and you?",1643641387,1643642475,False,1,2,0.480158746242523193,0,True,False,False

[b]pros[/b]
++ population system
++ soundtrack
++ a lot of countries to choose from. You can even play as Luxemburg...if you want to.
+ addicting gameplay.
+ supports mods that offer even more content. Installing HPM or HFM is recommended
+ high learning curve with a lot of payoff

[b]cons[/b]
- The crisis system, the political parties and the decisions need more polish
- somewhat broken economy
- Annexing regions cost should be scaled and depend on each region's worth. Right now it isn't. Also, annexing remnant parts of a region should cost less if you already own other parts of it.

After 3 hours playing through the entire tutorial, this simple sentence really undersells the extremely ambitious simulation in this game.

The sentence is describing the concept of a population unit in Vic2 (also Pop or POPs). Each of these represent one of 12 professions a segment of your population can have, from soldier to aristocract. [b]Each of these is described in an astounding amount of detail[/b] from militancy, class-consciousness, literacy and unemployment to a breakdown of its finances to dozens of needs that can be not, partially or fully sated to the individual ideologies and current political issues they care about; their likelihood to promote or demote to other jobs or economic classes or migrate to and from your country.

Is that not enough socio-economic-political simulation for you? What if I tell you [b]your country won’t simply have a “artisan” pop but as many artisan pops needed to represent the unique combination of culture, religion and profession for each[/b] of them?! Again, with every pop being fully unique in all the characteristics presented above. 

Is that, somehow, still not enough socio-economic-political simulation for you? What if I tell you there are [b]over 100 countries in the game, each comprised of one or more states (each state then comprised of one or more provinces)[/b] - and that each and every one of those provinces can and will have its own roster of uniquely-described, uniquely-evolving populations each with the full set of details mentioned above.

So you’re finally convinced that there’s a fair bit of depth in the effort this game takes to represent every segment of your population? As the first sentence in this review pointed out, this is only the beginning. [b]Populations are the building block of a deeply interconnected economic system with around 40 individual materials and goods[/b] being produced and refined and the economy itself is only half of the trade market, which Victoria 2 has two of: one for local nation and coalition trading and another for international trade. Each market is fully simulated by stockpile supply and demand, with money itself being subjected to things such as inflation or being loaned at interest by national banks.

So what makes this the ultimate socio-economic political simulator, rather than just a very complex strategy board game with tons of individual moving pieces to it? It’s the fact that, [b]much like real life governance, you cannot influence any of those things directly[/b]. There isn’t a button to create new pops or make a certain pop less likely to revolt by spending resources. All you can ever (for the most part) are macro decisions in each simulated aspect of the game and wait and see how it plays out as the wheels keep turning.

Are you convinced now that this one of, if not the most ambitious world-scale simulation game ever made? What if, just for good measure, I throw in [b]the full 4X gamut of features too[/b] from ground, naval and air combat to establishing colonies to rich diplomatic options from colonization to superblock mechanics? You know, just in case you want to throw all those pops into a wargame (which you can, as you’d expect as every military unit is backed to a Pop unit).

The one thing I’ve found lacking so far is the soundtrack - even only playing through the tutorial, I’ve listened to some of the individual tracks play two or three times already, let alone in the 20 or 30 hours you’ll be playing the game for. I plan to turn this weakness into a strength though - the baroque-esque music fits perfectly with the Victorian setting and I’ll probably just turn the music off and dive into my mostly-untapped collection of classical music instead (shoutout to Musopen and co).

So far, other than the introduction video being a bit glitchy, this [b]works flawlessly on Linux[/b] through Steam Play (Wine/Proton).

As a game developer with very specific tastes and a lot of unfulfilled ideas, it’s not everyday that I come across one of my dream game ideas being sold for dirt-cheap,  fully realized and much better than anything I could ever hope to do on my own. The only thing I could wish for was that this covered more periods of history or that it had support for generating random worlds with each playthrough - thankfully, even this seems to have been brought to life by the [b]thriving fan community, with around 100 mods released on 2021 alone[/b].",1638285854,1638285854,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

They said it was the hardest paradox games but that title goes to eu4 in my opinion. I understood most about the game really quick and i only had 2 nasty moments (Generals losing more troops than you could imagine) but that was just a minor upset. The economy and politics/reform system is quite nice and warfare... well its not special but its still satisfiyng to see 90k Frenchies getting mowed down by the glorious german army.
I think everyone should give it a try, since it just simulates the Victorian age and all its aspects so well, allthough its from 2010 and doesnt have that many features.

This game generates a ton of different cool and sometimes strange situations.
This is a slow game, so dont expect fast-paced gameplay and 15 min matches.
Interface is sometimes dumb, but mostly ok.
This game is similar to Hearts Of Iron 4, but its a lot more oriented on political life, economy and social management. You can spend a lot of time adjusting taxes, fees, spendings, researches, etc.
This game has a lot of mods, which i havent tried yet.
You should probably buy it with A House Divided and Heart of Darkness DLCs, not only because they add navy forces, colonization, international crises, US Civil War starting point and much more, but because they fix a lot of bugs you might encounter in vanilla victoria II.

8/10

P.S. The game lags when time is sped up.

The balance between conflict, politics and the economy makes this one of the most atmospheric and tense games ever. Initially when I started, the game looked very complicated and was very difficult to get into. After playing for a few hours when you begin to understand the basic functions of the game, you get used to it. World wars are done very well in Vicky II, with countries throwing everything they have at you to ensure victory. Post-war economic recoveries are also done brilliantly with war exhaustion increasing by 20% at the end of a Great War, which recovery can speed up with reduction in taxes and tariffs. One of the best nations to play is no doubt the German Empire! You can become very powerful as you approach the scramble for Africa in the 1880's and the beginning of the 20th century. 

DLC is a must-have in this game! It massively improves your experience and many mods depend on it. Trust me, you do not want to experience yellow Prussia and the endless ear-drilling when you build forts and railroads! The two compulsory ones are Hearts of Darkness and A House Divided. Forget the other ones as they do pretty much nothing to improve your gameplay.

Overall, this game deserves a grand 10/10!

The game is extremely deep and filled with every statistic imaginable about the nations of the 1800s. Unfortunately, that depth is a bit of a double-edged sword as the game has a very steep learning curve and very little in the way of helpful tutorials. Plan to spend time learning the mechanics of the game on wikis and Youtube before jumping in. If you are coming from more modern Paradox games, expect to be a bit disappointed with the UI, visual cues, and general polish of the game, especially without DLC or mods. With all that being said, the time period is fascinating, the gameplay is deep, and the scope of the game is immense. There are endless ways to play and each play through will likely be unique. While Victoria II is good and deserves a recommendation, I'd ultimately suggest waiting for its recently announced successor, Victoria III, as it will likely be far more accessible to newer players.

The strategy is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of Victorian politics and economics most of the gameplay will go over a typical player's head. There's also references to the tragedies associated with colonization, which is deftly woven into the storyline- several references to Dr Livingstone's exploration of the African continent exist too. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these events, to realize that they're not just historically significant- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Victoria 2 truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humor in the line ""Rock me in my cradle"" in the cotton event, which itself is a cryptic reference to Charles Dickens' ""Bleak House"" . I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Johan Anderson's genius wit unfolds itself on their computer monitors. What fools. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Victoria 2 tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎",1631276181,1631367674,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Granted, there are problems with the base game that make it hard to enjoy, but some awesome modding communities have fixed most of those problems. Personally, I play the PopDemandMod but many others enjoy the Historical Project Mod. Both of these mods fix the main issues of the game that I would complain about (mainly the economy and rebels).

I love the idea this game presents which captures the time period. European powers becoming more and more global and wars becoming more bloody combined with new philosophical ideas causing revolutions around the world have shifted global politics away from conventional war like what happened during and prior to the Napoleonic Era and now focuses on economics, industry, and influence.

You can dominate this game, in theory, with virtually no invasions and be a totally pacifist nation. Just by building up your industry and your influence, by sphering lesser nations, you can become a global power or superpower. Or you can utilize your new industry and economic wealth to wage global war and become the greatest conquerer in history.

Plenty of games claim you can ""do anything"" and win the game but seldom do they have reasonable means of actually delivering that promise. Civilization games, for instance, have a similar score system that allows you to win by the end of the game. It, in reality, doesn't ever get utilized much since your neighbors can easily conquer you or overwhelm you if you're too focused on the long game. Those conquests, even if you are ignored, grant more points to your opponents than you would gain just being pacifist.

This game allows for far more flexibility. You absolutely can be pacifist, or at the very least anti-war, and become the #1 Great Power. You can conquer the entire map (or most of it, it's a HUGE map). You can do virtually anything and win in a variety of ways.

Even though it falls short in its attempt at complex politics and economics it delivers far more than what was ever though possible when this series first began. As of writing this review Victoria 3 was announced and it aims to deliver even MORE than this game. I am anxious but excited for the prospect and I would recommend THIS game to anyone who is potentially interested in the upcoming Victoria 3.

Play this game first, save your money, and get feel for this type of game. This sort of game is about the LONG term not the short term. You'll never just sit down and have a 1hr session. This game is going to take lots of time to get into and once you do you'll be sucked into it. So, get a feel for the flow of this sort of game so when Victoria 3 comes out you'll know if you like it or not. Hope you enjoy!

Only way to ""win"" or progress is following a guide that recommends actions without a logical reason behind them; click this, click that, boom, you get this specific pop up and your numbers go up. Why? No idea. It seems arbitrary without a basis in history. Why does encouraging clergymen help the Japanese Empire change their constitution to fit a more Western model; and why is that the only way that can happen? No explanation, no reason, nothing but intransparent and overcomplicated game systems intertwining in a mess of lack of player agency and basically looking at a world that a child controls with a dice roller where you might or might not have an impact, who knows.

What do you do in the game?
I honestly don't know.
You pause the game and have zero choices. You can change your ruling party for no tangible effects, you can press a lot of things, adjust a lot of options, but in the end it feels like everything that is happening is predetermined and you're a monkey pressing at a non-touch screen monitor expecting things to change on your command.

All the choices you have are greyed out until something hyper specific comes around to change that, and every other gameplay option is just sitting there in fast forward waiting for nothing to happen at all.

But then, I decided to go through the tutorials, don't get me wrong I had already gone through the intro but I didn't pay much attention and figured I could do it on my own. After playing the tutorial I figured out what I was doing wrong, I played it like other paradox games (like EU4 and HoI4) and didn't focus on production and politics as much (or at least the complexities of it) and therefore didn't get the full experience, after realising everything I could do and how the game worked properly I have been playing it non-stop and even enjoy it more then EU4 and HoI4, definitly recommend it and I feel it if worth all the money (even at the full price of $20)

But I can not recommend this game because of its very important flaws:

The military and battle system is really bad and makes no sense. It consist on just moving your army to an enemy province, wait until it is controlled and move to the next province. It takes a long time, it is tedious and boring. Winning battles do little for wining the war. There are no strategic points to take/defend. It does not allow you either to make any strategy. The AI does not know what to do, and just move around trying to take some unprotected province, without presenting any challenge to the player. I remember old MS-DOS games that were much better. 

Other mechanics like building consist in clicking a lot of buttons when the option becomes available. The only difficulty is to not forget to click update in any of your many provinces. This can be very annoying.

I had actually much more fun modding and changing the things in the game that I find wrong than actually playing. But Some things I can not change like the dumb AI behavior.

Maybe Paradox will improve and eliminate some of these flaws in the future, and will make great games to enjoy. Until them, I can not completely recommend this game.",1510685859,1627751351,False,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

It is a complex geopolitical simulator which, if you enjoy map and spreadsheet games like I do, you will enjoy for hours. 
The UI is fairly intuitive but the underlying mechanics are complex and will need some experience to understand, even after 1k+ hours I would not claim to know them. 
What I love most about this game is that it has no defined goal, you can play as any nation and create your own goals and build you own nation. It is a 'game you do not have to play' which means that the basics just run themselves, your decisions are what matter and they have massive impact on the game but it is not apparent. 
On your first play though, I would advise choosing an irrelevant nation and just learning the mechanics. Conquer the world type strategies are not applicable in this game. Learning and understanding the mechanics are far more important as you go. 
The worst part of the game is the 'complete cluster f*** of war'. It is exciting, but it will cost you thousands if not millions of your people, You will be so diverted by combat that you will forget many of your best plans, and even perhaps your greatest and most experienced armies. I find this realistic based on reading enough history to understand that sometimes a message does not get there and an army does not move.
I explain my stupidity with a realistic message does not get through scenario, because I find the cluster f*** fairly true. This game puts you in the position of government and does not hold your hand. 
You can, quite easily, lose a war to internal rebellion when on the cusp of victory. 
If you want an experience that will make you pace about wondering whether a war is worth the losses, this is the one, if you want a role play experience in the 1836-1936 era, this is the one.
If you want an easy to understand, low barrier to entry type game, with little effort, this is not the one for you.
This game is great for those that like proper strategy, map and spreadsheet style, with complex and deep economics and Naval/Military strategy. I ruined one of my wars because I failed to secure enough supply and the market crashed so non of my army had ammunition or weapons. 
This game is my favourite, without a doubt. I can chill as NZ, AUS or IRE, or wage war as France or Russia. Some of my best runs of this game have been as Ethiopia or Persia.

Victoria 2 is a wonderful game by itself, but it is so much better with Mods. The modding community grew quite a bit over the last two years, and there are many mods that could be games on their own - and there's no hurting in starting the game with mods, especially if you play those who just add to the basegame; HPM, GFM or TGC are those that instantly come to mind for me. Everyone who owns this game should definitely try those!

That said: the game is a lot better with the Expansion Packs, even though yellow Prussia became a well-loved meme over the years the base game has many flaws that only really get weeded out by the Expansion Packs.",1624813076,1624813076,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As of writing, the time I've spent on Vicky 2 is 139x the time I've spent on CK3. It's quite addictive.

I don't think it's too intensive. My computer is about as old as the game and can run it fairly well unless there are millions of troops on the screen. 

I highly recommend playing it with both DLCs AND the Historical Project Mod (HPM). HPM essentially just makes the whole game better: adds more African and South American nations, adds more events for a wide array of nations and improves colonisation. My only gripe is that it makes some events take longer to achieve. For example, if you want to form Germany or Italy, you need the 'Nationalism and Imperialism' technology, while in vanilla you needed to meet the requirements and could form either in the late 1930's.

I like much about the game, so here are the immediate cons for the unmodded game with DLC. (HPM fixes some of these)

-Most uncivilised nations are boring.
-Not much to do in South America unless you're Brazil and even then, not much.
-Economy makes no sense.
-Awful tutorial.
-Late game can get boring/frustrating since you're either too strong for anyone to pose a threat or you're too weak to become a Great Power.

There's a reason people play Germany, Italy or Japan. They have a lot to keep you busy and it's very easy to become overpowered as any of them (well, mostly Germany and Japan) so you can bully other nations.

I definitely would recommend!

By the way, Oranje is actually the OVS (Oranje Vrij Staat), that later became the Vrystaat (Free State) province of South Africa.

Paradox Interactive is the publisher of most games like this you see floating around the steam store. Their most notable titles are Crusader Kings, Europa Universalis, Victoria, and Hearts of Iron. theyre generally high quality games with good production value. but thats where their good things end.

every game is treated as a ""launchpad"" for several ""major"" dlcs, all of which's contents should absolutely have been included in the original release of the game. Often times, these expansions dont even change much, and they ask for a baseline of FIFTEEN DOLLARS for each one. it costs nearly THREE HUNDRED USD to buy all of the dlc for crusader kings II, even though that game is free.
This isn't the thing that really got me riled up, though. It's the fact that paradox acquired one of my favorite games of all time, Prison Architect, and within a few months they churned out a garbage DLC like they usually do. 

I really like the games that paradox puts out but i seriously cannot and will not continue to support their business model.

Fuck you, Paradox.

Most civilization management games feel like Risk with more buttons, but Victoria 2's population mechanics which simulate wealth, trade, production, and culture help to create an immersive in-game world that feels less like a board game and more like a world that's been lived in. It's a world filled with populations who are responsive to your policies, instead of just mana and manpower. When you recruit armies, you source soldiers directly from your provinces; when you close factories, your newly unemployed workers may revolt or migrate away; newly conquered territory can't just be magicked into core states, and national identities are resilient and reluctant to assimilate.

The core vision of Vicky 2 is a world based on dynamic systems that feel like they exist beyond just player interaction. It doesn't entirely succeed, but it's a damn good attempt; here's hoping that Victoria 3 can fly its banner high.",1471975740,1621968691,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It has many flaws; it frequently crashes and the AI has no idea what it is doing half the time, leaving most games to becoming ahistorical, which isn't a bad thing necessarily.
It is a fun strategy games with many nations that are different, for example as Germany/Prussia you would play politics with your neighbors and wage wars, as Japan you would seek to become a superpower and avoid the tides of war as best as you can. Lastly you can play as some South American or Middle Eastern country and bide your time, slowly becoming a superpower.

It's still the best grand strategy Paradox has ever made. 

This is the only game, in my opinion, which actually feels like you are running a *real* country, not just a paper representation. Every solider, artisan, peasant, capitalist, craftsmen, all the parts of a population (POPs) are modelled with needs and wants, which must are fulfilled by the world economy. Dozens of goods flow in and out of the world market, the price of said goods being affected by supply and demand. Elections are modelled based on the actual political leanings of the POPs, immigration, internal migrations, birth rate, death rate are represented. Your nation is not merely a entity on the map, it is the product of it's diverse peoples- just like in real life. It's incredible to see your nation turn from a rural backwater to a strong industrialized state- or just as interesting to see in crumble as you deal with a collapsing economy, an angry populace and an ineffective government.

It's one of the few games that actually cover the Nineteenth Century, which is a shame, because it's actually a immensely interesting period. Its strongest feature is the economics system, which is surprisingly in-depth and dynamic (note that the Pop Demand Mod, which greatly improves the economy, among other things). The simulation of political and social reform and development is also very interesting feature, the tech and invention system is pretty Civ-like, while the diplomacy model is alright. The military aspect could use some attention in victoria 3, as it's somewhat generic and bland. Overall, this is a great game with a community that still remains active and a lot of mods available at the Paradox forums. I've put more than 100 hours into the game, and I can't wait for victoria 3!

Things i like:
-Satisfying Economy Mechanic
-Great modding community
-Amazing Soundtrack
-Good amount of countries that have content
-Non-Linearity
Things i dislike:
-Army management
-Constant revolts (seriously, fuck jacobin rebels all my homies fucking loathe jacobin rebels)
-No real way to dramatically change the way your country functions outside of relying on revolts (there is a mechanic that allows you to change the electorate vote but that's practically useless)
-Clunky UI

Conclusion: this game stands the test of time and is a must have for anyone that is a fan of strategy games; however, i would recommend getting at least the ""Hearts of Darkness"" dlc (and waiting for a sale if you aren't a fan of grand strategy games).",1621625857,1621625857,True,3,0,0.541602432727813721,0,True,False,False

This is a 4x grand strategy game set in the victorian era that takes place from 1835 to 1935. While it's historically accurate, it does leave out most of the african tribes in west africa, and it oversimplifies diplomacy.
If you've never played a paradox game before, I'd recommend it since it's a fine game, but I personally would recommend playing a different paradox strategy game, since they've got much better games. Personally I would recommend Europa universalis IV, and imperator rome instead of this game. It is a nice change of pace from those two, but It's not as well refined. 

The good.
This game has the best economy I have ever seen in any game. 5 out of 5 stars.
I like the technology system. 4 out of 5 stars
The diplomacy is simple and easy to use. 3 out of 5 stars since this is also a frustration to me.
The production of units is based on actual economic cost. No matter how much money you have if you don't have any rifles you can't recruit new infantry battallions 5 out 5 on unit recruitment.
The way your government interacts with the economy is dynamic depending on what type of government you have 5 out of 5. As france, I used laisez faire economics, so my economy managed itself.

The Bad.
Using the influence mechanics countries arbitrarily control other countries just because they are one of the top 8 countries in the world. The ninth country has influence over other countries in this fashion until he becomes the 8th, then suddenly he has the same as the number 1 country. While the system is cool, it's jarring, and I think it done the wrong way. Countries have no opinion change based on what is actually happening, their opinion of you is solely based on if you are one of the top 8 countries, and then if you are controlling them, or being discredited by the other powers. Because of this AI's almost never form truces with each other unless they are the top 8, and the minor nations are meaningless except as nuisances and pawns.
2 out of 5
The population growth is lacking. Yes people die in wars, but the population growth rates in game are based off the population growth rates of developed countries in the 21st century. Growth rates that are just barely above the replacement rate. Back in the 19th century, as many as 50% of people wouldn't live to see adulthood in some places, but the average family would have 6-8 kids(including stillborns and miscarraiges in both numbers), so you still get the population increasing by 50% every 40-50 years. The main reasons the population didn't stick to what it'd been was medicin and industry advancements, but like France went from maybe 10-20 million to almost 60 million in 100 years, and germany went from about that many to 100 million in germany.(not austria)(note that as many as 70% of the estimated 9-15 million germans in northern germany died in the 30 years war). So, while this mechanic has the potential for 5 out of 5 stars, due to the growth rate before researching any tech being about a 0.0 % growth rate, and the growth rates after researching medicinal techs being as low as 0.02, and 0.04, this mechanic actually becomes a bit of a hindrance when considering how their economy works, so I give it 2 out of 5 stars, but admit with a little polishing it can achieve more.
Great Britain is as powerful as he historically was and unrivaled in power and a bully. 3 out of 5.
The revolt mechanics only allow you to deal with a revolt after they rebel, and they will keep arbitrarily gathering armies after they reach 100% rebellion chance for up to 5 years, and you're powerless to do anything to stop it once revolt chance hits 100% even as the number of soldiers they're going to field goes up from 150,000 to 6,000,000 of my 14 million citizens. It's frustrating cause in other paradox strategy games I can try to prevent rebellions, and even if I don't their strength doesn't just keep arbitrarily going up untill every citizen in my country is now a soldier in the rebellion. Instead when the rebellion chance reaches 100% they rise up, and I can send my armies in. I honestly think this mechanic is the one that breaks the game, and it just makes me mad, cause if they fixed this, I'd honestly change my recommendation, and recommend you get the game. 1 out of 5 stars.
So war exhaustion is a thing, and it makes sense, an army is coming and burning cities, parents get tired of sending their sons to die in wars, that makes sense, but that's not the main driving force in war exhuastion in this game, if it was I'd say 5 out of 5 stars. But no, the main way of getting war exhuastion is peace offers. You see, you might get 1 or 2 war exhuastion a month if enemy armies occupy 5 of your 150 provinces, which makes sense, but as soon as they get 3-4% advantage in the war, they have enough war score to ask for a small demand, and so they do, about twice a month. This normally wouldn't be a problem, but if the enemy is winning the war, even if just by 3-4 percent, and they offer a peace treaty, and you reject, then the player gets 5 war exhuastion, and 1 global militancy, and this can happen every 20-25 days. (keep in mind militancy is what makes your pops rebel, so having 3-4 militancy in a province will spark a rebellion.) So in my campaign, I was at war with england, the most powerful country in the world, and I was winning, I had just invaded london (succesfully) when what do you know prussia declares war on me (france) and invades my territories. I immediately sign a peace treaty, but before I can bring my troops home, they've occupied 4-5 provinces, in the next 8 months, I get 8 war exhuastion from having provinces occupied, bring my war exhuastion from 36 to 44, and I get 40 war exhuastion from 8 offers of surrender, at this point, I've started occupying prussian land, I've destroyed all of the ottomans troops(they were a cobeligerent), but despite having overwhealming force, and a string of victories in every battle, my people are defeated and rebelling, simply because I didn't immediately agree to surrender. If this mechanic hadn't existed, I could've easily annexed all of the ottomans land in africa, and taken some land from prussia too, but because I lost a couple territories in the 2 months it took me to get my 100k troops home from england, and reinforce the damaged regiments, I had to reject 8 offers of surrender in that time, and now I've got a revolt of 14 million frenchmen out of population of 8 million that happens 2 months after the war. of these people unhappy with the government, they raise an army of 6 million soldiers. Yea, 6 million frenchmen overthrow the government, just because they didn't agree to surrender french land to prussia. Kinda not a thing that would happen ever. Imagine that imperial france defending against prussia and the ottomans in a war, and they win overwhelmingly, but 6 million frenchmen rise up as soldiers against the government just because they didn't accept surrender for 8 months during the 8 month war. There was a 0% percent chance that would've happened in the 19th century. Sorry paradox, bad play on that mechanic there..  so this mechanic is a 0 out of 5 stars, and it's the other reason I can't stand this game right now.

TLDR 
2 out of 5 stars.
Reasons to play.
Amazing economy. Your government plays differently depending on what it is, and that effects how you use the economy too!
The tech system is decent.
Reasons not to get it.
The revolt system suchs.
IF you reject an AI peace offer, your citizens will revolt as in you'll get an army to fight that has 50% of your population in it, and all of your native origin armies will defect to the revolution, just because you rejected an AI peace offer. 
So, I don't recommend because the flaws kind of ruin the good parts, and cause your save to just become not playable anymore. 2 out of 5 stars.",1620790999,1620790999,False,2,0,0.430622011423110962,0,True,False,False

This game is very, very bad at introducing itself to new player, I'll tell you that much lol.

However, once I caved and bought the game on sale a third time, I committed to it and now it's easily my favorite Paradox game. If you're looking for a robust socioeconomic simulation from Paradox that offers actually interesting simulation beyond just a surface level, this is the game you want. The population is dynamic and ever evolving, with population expanding in real time down to the individual citizen. These citizens have different roles which can change depending on the conditions they're in. These citizens consume resources, different depending on who they are, that also are individually tied to a global economic simulation.

While this game can be buggy, it offers a level of complexity in its simulation beyond any of the other paradox games. Because of the detailed population mechanics, the game feels a lot more alive to me than other Paradox games (CK is also good in this regard, but in a different way). The economy is also alive in a sense and can function on its own with only moderate input. The short timeframe is also to this game's benefit I feel, as it avoids the absolute slog that CK and EU4 can end up feeling like after centuries. A full 100 year game is still very long, though, make no mistake. Things move fast in the Victorian era. 

Overall just a really great grand strategy game, certainly one of the best in the genre (if not the best, but that's heavily debatable of course). Make sure you get the dlc, they're essential.

I guess I have enough hours to leave a pretty thought out review now. All my time is on vanilla, mostly with DLCs, which some people will tell you means I should reevaluate my mental health, but you can probably take to mean the game is even more enjoyable with mods. I'll probably compare vicky to stellaris a lot, as they both fill the niche of easy paradox games in my opinion, and I'm fairly sure I've gotten about the same playtime on both.

I will start this off by being realistic - honestly, Vicky 2 probably isn't the best Paradox game in the world. That said, it takes 10 hours to really figure out, and maybe another 10 to REALLY figure out, meaning you can spend 930 hours actually playing. Contrast that with other paradox titles that are constantly updated and having added depth to keep older players interested despite making things ever more complex for newer players. I have something like 500 hours in EUIV and 270 in CK2, but didn't have the time to learn them when they came out, and struggle to catch up now, so most of that play time is really just screwing around and figuring out how to do things again before they all change. Most of Victoria *isnt* actually complicated, just opaque, but it's not hard to quickly realize you don't really need to understand how a lot of the actual mechanics operate, as long as you know how to work with them.

That's really 90% of what the appeal is. It feels and plays like a Paradox game, more so than another simple game like Stellaris, but you can pick up the basics really easily, and do well enough to take on the AI in most situations. Then it's a matter of if you want to play it more like an idle game, challenge yourself, or try something really new. It does this better than something like stellaris by dint of the entire game loop having a very different start. Vicky is pretty varied, much more like what you'll experience in other paradox titles, while stellaris is pretty consistently going to play like a straightforward 4x game. Obviously, you get far more for customization options than you do in Vicky (you can cheat those in to a degree), but the basic gameplay for at least the early portion won't vary.

Which brings us to the biggest downfall. The end game isn't always great, especially due to the various, but generally unchanging starting situations. If you play as France, you're gonna be the number one world power by the midgame, and will be able to crush everyone if you play actively and conventionally. The late game just makes that easier for you, while more modern games (stellaris) are built to throw new challenges towards you. You can invert this by playing weaker nations that really develop in the later game, but it does mean that, for most of them, your early game is either sitting around waiting for things to build up, or having to obsessively micromanage.

If you find you often restart games to try new things or whatever, this is 100% one for you. If you like the Victorian era and want something not too crazy to get into, also for you. If you want something really expansive and have the time and energy to really sit down and learn a complex grand strategy game, something like EUIV probably does have a lot more to offer as a whole, though you will also pay a lot more for it.

Fun facts I learned after my first game:
* Karl Marx was a slave owner from the state of Louisiana.
* The British lost Hong Kong to Philippines after they gained independence from Spain without the help of the United States.
* The Anglo-Germanic alliance finally broke apart after the disarmament agreement following the third great war in 1923.

Game is super fun. The amount of complexity is mind-blowing, but the more you play the more you'll understand how each aspect of the game works. Once you understand the tech trees, diplomacy, warfare, and budgeting then the rest of the game pretty much works out on its own. For example, prioritize literacy techs in the Culture tab if your literacy is low (for example Russia) or prioritize diplomatic influence techs under the Commerce tab if you need to add other countries to your sphere of influence ASAP (for example Prussia). There's so many intricacies found within the game that can make it a little frustrating, but the joy you'll get once you finish in 1st place and do some crazy stuff like forming Greater Germany or westernizing China or dismantling Prussia as Scandinavia will make it all worth it.

Here are some of the bugs which you may face:
	- There is no UI scaling so you can forget high DPI monitors (4K, 1440P), unless you like squinting
	- If you have two monitors you may have to turn one off otherwise a black bar will appear on the side of your screen, this might be another 4k issue.
	- Random crashes can happen so you may want to save frequently

I may also need to mention that this game really needs the DLCs, there is allot of content lost without the DLCs which you can of course expect from Paradox. Please do also note this isn't EU4, the DLC situation isn't as bad.

If your fine with playing a game were you have to read a tutorial on how to open it and what not to do I would suggest giving it a go.

This is a game that I absolutely love, and I've pumped hundreds of hours into. More than my steam numbers would show. I would go so far as to say it might be my all time favorite paradox game. There are so many things that are great about it. The detailed political system with parties, issues, reforms and election campaigns where your choices may or may not change outcomes. It has a challenging but rewarding diplomacy system based on spheres of influence which can be threatened at any point by existing rivals or emerging powers within the sphere. The military system, and the fact that soldiers are recruited from segments of the population, which don't necessarily regenerate at a set pace makes combat encounters uniquely intense and stressful for a grand strategy game; and after a few deadly battles you'll find yourself meticulously planning your fights for minimum casualties. The culture system in the game is also unique in that multiple cultures typically coexist inside a single province. The game more or less accurately models the diverse and amorphous patchwork of languages and nationalities found in different regions of the world. What's more is that unlike in more recent paradox titles like Imperator and CKIII, the rate of cultural change is quite realistically slow. Don't expect to fully assimilate the population of your nation over the short, 100 year timescale. To me, this really helps the 19th Century setting to feel more immersive.
That's not even touching on the colonization and economy systems, which could take up pages on their own, and are both quite deep and rewarding systems that might be the game's best selling point. 

As for more general stuff; the game runs alright, not great. It's very cpu intensive in the late game, and even on decent modern rigs it can chug. For a 10 year old game, that's not a good sign. If you have a lower end pc, your performance will be worse, but in my experience it's still playable, even on most laptops today.  
The UI and keybinds are surprisingly pretty good given how old it is. Rally points and shift clicking are very needed features that this game has. If you play a lot of CKIII, you might get frustrated at how few keyboard shortcuts there are; but once you get into the flow of things, it's really not that bad. 

So everything I've had to say so far has been either positive or neutral. Victoria II still holds up, and if you could get it at a decent price, I highly recommend it to all grand strategy fans.
The problem I have with this game is the cost. Getting this game which came out in 2010 and its DLC today will cost you $66. That's ridiculous. Just getting the two expansions and skipping the (Admittedly needless) cosmetic upgrades will still set you back $50. For comparison, Crusader kings III which came out last year and its single released content pack will cost you $59. So buying Victoria II today might very well cost more than Paradox' most recent game. 

Is it worth it though? Maybe. I mean I've put many hundreds of hours into it. But $60 for a game going on 11 years old is a huge turnoff for most people, and understandably so. That's a big investment for something that is not nearly as polished as other games in the same price-range. 

If it goes on sale, which it periodically does, I can fully recommend it; and if you find it somewhere else cheaper, I would also fully recommend it; but if the pricetag of $66 is too steep, that's understandable.",1618629353,1618629353,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

And indeed in the first round, you will hardly understand anything. However, you will quickly understand the game if you play it for a bit. Although it is very old, this game has very nice features I which would be in modern RTS games. It is indeed very similar to Europa Universalis but has in my opinion way more depth.

its warfare i find better then eu4 but obviously not hoi4 its one thing ill give to hoi4 my least favorite 
the economy and factories aspect is something i love so much as i feel in the all the games a complex and interesting economy system is missing
the graphics are alright 
the dlc i find is basically essential but the games 20 dollar price + 20 dollar dlc + a 10 dollar one makes it much much less cheaper then the other games
victoria 2 is so amazing and complex i still learn new things all the time its amazing 
the amount of empires i can create and have fun with is so many that when i start playing again i will not be bored, 
the politics system is also maybe a hot take, much better then hoi4s which has alot of politics but hoi4s feels more linear and less interesting 
the rebels can be a bit broken but they are a real danger, everything about this game feels so alive 
you can influence how your economy can function
the spheres system is also easily the best out of all the games
victoria 2 does have a really high skill ceiling for all its complexity but its one of the things i enjoy,
everything about victoria 2 is intricate and alive
the expansion in this game can be a bit lack luster unlike other games where you make massive empires but by no doubt you can do the same in this game, it just takes alot more planning and thought, the infamy in this game i find in some ways better then eu4s but at the same time worse, you have to wait so long before it goes down,
this game probably has my favorite soundtrack its so amazing, its fire yet calming and floods me with good memories making me happy, making it my favorite soundtrack with dark souls, its soundtrack puts the mood so amazingly its perfect,
this game gets even better with mods these mods arent anything crazy but add so much flavor and a big reason this game 5th favorite game of all time.

Reminds me of this quote.

In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind ever since.

“Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,” he told me, “just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.”

He didn’t say any more, but we’ve always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. In consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought — frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.

And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes, but after a certain point I don’t care what it’s founded on. When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction — Gatsby, who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the “creative temperament.”– it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No — Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.",1616829494,1616829494,True,2,0,0.542857170104980469,0,True,False,False

While the combat systems leave something to be desired, as most of the important war decisions are made before it starts, the golden goose of this game is its economy and pops system. Every single good that is produced in the game is tracked from its seller to its buyer, and every single person on the planet has things they want to buy and money to spend on it. This is a game where I am able to start literal world wars over petty border disputes, and I am often more interested in watching my factories buzz along because its just that interesting to nudge them in the right direction.

And I do mean every pop, this is not some Stellaris style game where millions of people are represented as a single unit. While the game does group demographics together, they are split into incredibly distinct categories and have an exact number of people in them. The nationality, religion, profession and location of your pops all end up contributing to how it interacts with your wider nation, and it feels incredibly complex without becoming completely obscure. the 10,000 Catholic-Irish craftsmen who have immigrated to Boston may not cause much of a stink for Uncle Sam, but the several million Koreans in occupied Japanese territory certainly will make the Emperor have a bad migraine if he's not careful. No other game I have ever played can simulate an actual economic crash or a politically motivated rebellion (or some combination of the two as is often the case) in an emergent way like Victoria 2 does. 

The major downside is that as an older Paradox title, it can have trouble running on newer devices, and mod support is non existent, and if you enjoy it enough to play it like I do, you are going to want to mod it. However, there are plenty of good instructional videos on how to go about this, and anyone who is familiar with doing more manual modding processes probably wont have to much issue with the steam version.

Overall, I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys Paradox style grand strategies, but is looking for something a little different than their usual fare.",1616253780,1616253780,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

In my first game as the US, I got invaded by the British twice, lost most of New England to them, and then had to deal with over 20 years of constant civil war/revolution after the official ""Civil War"" due to the instability of losing two massive fully mobilized wars. Eventually, I ended up as a socialist US, and finally won back the territory stolen from me 60 years before. 

In my second game, I played as Russia. I achieved a 90% literacy rate by the middle of the 19th century, invaded Manchuria, lost 30% literacy, and had to go to war with a British/Chinese alliance. Also formed the USSR about 30 years earlier than historically reasonable and burned down Eastern Germany around 3 times. 

In my third game, I played as Brazil. For a while, I roamed free in South America, accidentally invaded a nation in the US Sphere of Influence, and then waged a successful 4 year guerrilla war in the Amazon against the US and their allies, eventually succeeding in getting Panama or whatever Central American country I attempted to get a chunk of land from.

This is the most interesting historical grand strategy I've ever played. Simply by playing things out (and not reverting to an old save because one bad thing happens), so much fun stuff can happen. I have a hard time getting into any of Paradox's other grand strategy games because none of them are quite like this.

Whilst the game will basically require you to get the DLC if you really want to get the full experience, I like to see it as just part of the price of the game. This game deserves more love and a sequel, considering the game is now over a decade old with the most recent DLC (Heart of darkness) being release in 2013. I'd also recommend looking at the mods that are out there as things such as the HPM and HFM mods can really improve the experience. 

Personally, I found it was  somewhat difficult to learn but that's not considering I have had no major experience with this sort of game before. The game will provide a scope of over a century, from 1836 to 1936 allowing one to play through a post Napoleon Europe, the formation of Italy and Germany, the colonisation of Asia and Africa and the first world war. If your tempted by the game, get it (with a heart of darkness and a house divided) and you'll be sure to fall for it. :)

Compared to Paradox’s other grand strategy games, especially Europa Universalis and Hearts of Iron, Victoria II seems at first to be the ugly, obtuse, and obsolescent abandoned stepchild of the family and while I would argue that the even more obscure March of the Eagles fits this title more, Vicky is all of those things. Despite this, this game continues to host an avid fanbase and modding community, because there is no other grand strategy game in existence that attempts to cover the rapid and complex political, technological, economic, and military developments of the 19th and early 20th centuries as well as Victoria II does. With one set starting date, Vicky lacks the variety of EUIV and CK2, but each country faces a specific crafted scenario of events and political circumstances that render most countries uniquely engaging experiences with their own specific goals and ambitions. The diplomatic system represents the time well, featuring mechanics that rank and empower your nation to influence other nations and colonize based on its global clout, while the military combat system, albeit basic compared to the rest of the game, represents the advancements of the time well. It doesn’t hurt that the music is great too.

However, the core of Victoria II’s unique appeal is the mind-boggling complexity of its simulated global socioeconomic system, which represents the production, consumption, class, nationality, religion, and political opinion of every individual male worker in the entire world, whose collective activities and status all feed into systems of local, national, and international commercial exchange, manufacturing, migration, and politics, which are all under the influence of various national political and economic pressures from events, changes, and government actions across the world. This level of interlocking complexity lends Victoria II a level of socioeconomic simulation unparalleled in any other grand strategy game of its scope. This is not necessarily always a good thing, as even hundreds of hours into the game, much of this system and its various tendencies and idiosyncrasies seem forever unknowable in a game almost entirely composed of data tables and pie charts overlaid onto a map, but if such an intricate system interests you, Victoria II could be worth the money. The learning curve may seem insurmountably steep at first, but if you can get a grip on the basics, an unparalleled grand strategy exploration of one of the most transformative centuries of human history awaits.

If you like the game, get A House Divided and Heart of Darkness DLCs, they seriously enhance many aspects of the game, especially the westernization and colonization mechanics. Free mods like HPM can enhance the experience too if the vanilla Paradox version gets too bland.

In all seriousness Victoria 2 is one of the best paradox games out there. Although it has it's problems, and is dated in many ways, it still holds up as a solid grand strategy game.

Pros:
1. Pops. The Pop system makes this game truly awesome and gives each nation a unique feel. Pops represent your actual population and their statistics determine how your nation functions. For example, a nation such as the UK has high literacy and a well established industrial base, which allows for faster industrialization, whereas a country like Columbia has a relatively low literacy and poorly established industry, which makes the early game about educating and establishing industry, which gives it a much different feel than the UK. It also gives each nation a concrete way to tell how well off a nation is, which differs from games like Hoi4 where each nation has similar levels of development or EU4 which can sometimes feel like just stacking modifiers.
2. Conquest. Both EU4 and HOI4, for as great as they are, feel very much like map painting. Vic2, however, discourages map painting, and instead offers alternative methods such as sphereing, which prevents conflicts over regions from escalating to full scale war at points. Additionally, units take up real pops, so fighting a large war can cost you much of your army, which taps into your real population, aka wars cause you to lose pops which requires you to spend time at peace to recover from wars.
3. Economy. The economy in Vic2 feels realistic and encourages the acquisition of new sources of RGOs, or Resource Gathering Operations. This enourages things like building a large sphere, or in cases of non world powers, specializing your industry to fit the resources available to you. This can make different nations follow different paths of conquest. For example, a nation like the USA has an abundance of RGO to build industry, whereas nations like Japan will have to expand to get what they want, making each nations economic situation unique. Additionally, the fact that goods are sold on an open market makes things like wars have massive effects on world trade.

There are numerous other pros, such as modability.

Cons:
1. UI. The UI feel really dated, and fails to notify you of many things. For example, countries will break alliances, and you can only see that in a little area on your screen, so you often miss important information. Additionally, I feel the game should better notify you of major changes like shifting great power alliances.
2. Rebels. They are crazy. Like I get that you have to keep your population happy, but I should not be having nationwide revolts as a stable nation cause my pops dont have a bit of wool. There are ways to fix this, but it can still be a problem.

However, the pro far outweigh the cons. A couple suggestions however:
1. GET. ALL. DLC. Seriously get all the dlc and the game on sale. You dont need all the unit packs, just Heart of Darkness and House divided. Most mods require both.
2. Start with vanilla, but I recommend switching to HPM soon. HPM is kinda like Vanilla+ and adds a lot more historical content while still keeping it vanilla like.

This public administration simulator has hit a sweet spot. It is not a game about warfare. It is about education, science, commerce, industry, diplomacy, social reform, political stability... and warfare!

Victoria II's high complexity does not confuse the player at all – so long as (s)he has dedicated about one hour to studying the game's basic mechanics. It hard to master, but very rewarding.

The game is accessible because it *makes sense*. It is, in fact, quite realistic. If during a crisis you ask yourself, ""Would this make sense in real life?"", it is probably somehow implemented in the game.

Two unrealistic aspects have come under my radar. First, resources are not so realistically allocated; for instance, there is neither iron nor petroleum in Brazil. Second, Victoria II's economics promotes state-governed industrialization as the only efficient option, but it is a policy which has had mixed results in history.

The game is very appropriate for history and geopolitics fans. It plays more like a simulator than a game, as someone has once said to me.

[ Victoria II – My Campaigns]
The campaigns always begin in 1836, at least without the DLC, and I always choose to be in charge of the recently independent Empire of Brazil. I intend to master the administration of Brazil.

My first campaign aimed, very naively, at scientific and educational glory. This was at the expense of industrialism and militarism, resulting in a weak Empire that saw external agents effortlessly dominating its territory. The UK dominated our Northeastern region, Venezuela tookup the Brazilian Amazonas,  and Argentina almost annexed Rio Grande do Sul!

My second campaign was much more professional, exploiting production, trade, and industry so as to enrich my population and enlist a great army. Alas, after great industrial effort, I found out that my country produced neither coal nor iron. There weren't any available for me in the scarce international market either. My industry therefore had little to no raw material. The Empire owned monstrous factories within which there were no supplies to be seen!!

My third campaign saw me learn how to efficiently colonize regions containing coal and iron, including most of my South American neighbors and extending to sub-Saharan Africa. Raw materials in abundance would solve all my industrial problems, I thought.

The sad result was that, although I became a country with huge factories containing massive raw material surpluses, my country had very little qualified workers – about 5% of what I needed. Ugh. Traumatized from my tragic first campaign, my current administration had neglected teachers, intellectuals, and corporate executives. Their absence prevented me from developing a skilled workforce.

I failed.

—

[Victoria II – Future Developments]
Time for my fourth campaign. I am now back to the drawing board, studying population growth and workforce development.

My most recent insight is that colonization might not be the best strategy. Perhaps – perhaps! – I can use my diplomatic influence to gain pacific access to world markets (thus buying coal and iron). I might even be able to build factories in other countries, using their own coal and iron (and sulphur and petroleum). Hopefully such an economic agreement would be beneficial to both me and my colleague country, but what really matters is that it would be good for me! 😊

The diplomatic plan above would make sense in real life. Would such strategy make sense in the game? The fun part is: I don't know. Let's find out.",1612473965,1612538398,True,21,2,0.697525858879089355,0,True,False,False

I have not played the base game, nor do I intend to, as many online have derided it in favor of the final version. I also am not using the HPM, or any mods for that matter.

I finally got above 1000 hrs. in Civ 5 and decided that I needed to try a more in-depth grand strategy game, especially one with historical elements, which I prefer over sci-fi, fantasy, etc. I had never played a Paradox title, regrettably, and the online consensus seemed to be that Vic. 2 was the deepest for tall play and EUIV for wide. I went for the former as I am just better at and more experienced with the building/management aspects of strategy games than I am the war/expansion aspects (though I am learning, thanks to Bannerlord and Three Kingdoms, my first titles in each of those series).  Victoria 2 is so far the most immersive strategy game I have played. 

I am using ""immersive"" here to describe both the setting/narrative and the gameplay itself. By playing this game, I am learning so much about a period of history I generally ignore (usually go for like classical or medieval stuff) and satisfying my general interest in geopolitics and learning how the world works (in a simplified model). Every person in the world is simulated from 1836-1936. Their needs, wants, ideological sympathies, ethnic/religious loyalties, etc. all factor in to global politics and economics in a real way. Stop looking for action games where your choices have an effect on the world. This is almost an RPG.

I hate to compare a Paradox game to Civ 5. Civ is turn-based and is a 4X that doesn't simulate history, but it is my best reference. The mechanics in Civ 5 are significantly easier to understand and its streamlined design enables playing ""optimally"" (with the assistance of ZigZagAl, Car'ls Civ Guides, and FilthyRobot of course). However, approaching your first Civ games without knowledge of the mechanics, but with good political/economic intuition, will not lead to success outside of the lower difficulties. 

I have a degree in economics, yet no matter how many hours I play or wiki articles I read, I will never fully understand Victoria 2. However, my first game turned out very successful. ""Success"" is subjective here since Civ 5 has victory conditions and Vic. 2 is more of a simulation, but I was able to achieve Great Power status with a country that started as a Secondary Power, which I'll consider a success. A lot of that success can be attributed to just general knowledge of history and role-playing.

Since I had far more success using intuition in my first Vicky game than I did in my first Civ games, I would say that Victoria 2 is a more intuitive game for a certain type of gamer. This gamer has to be interested in history and willing to invest time and mental energy into learning a complex game (i.e. not a casual). If a friend of mine who was new to grand strategy and met those conditions wanted a recommendation for a new game, I would suggest Victoria 2 over Civ 5. Though, I am relatively new to strategy games myself, and would probably recommend an ""easier"" (totally subjective) game once I have more experience with Paradox, Total War, or any of the other amazing strategy games I never played because I was addicted to Civ 5.",1611683065,1611684005,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

First off, however, I will start with the cons.

1. The combat system isn't great. By late game, having dozens of armies and fleets and micromanaging large fronts are just too overwhelming, and this is easily my least favorite part of the game.
2. The learning curve. It took me months to learn how to play well, and the tutorials (while better than in most Paradox selections) still weren't adequate.
3. To really enjoy the full experience, you NEED both of the DLC.
4. There are an insane number of popups. When you are running a small country and want to speed the game up when you have no options left to do, popups every three seconds will pause your game until you read and close them, slowing you down dramatically.

Now, the pros:
1. The political system is really intriguing, and has more depth than any other grand strategy game I have ever played.
2. The economic and factory system is fairly balanced and leaves the player with a number of options to purse (state capitalism and laissez faire, for example)
3. Replayability: there are a large number of countries to choose from, including ones like Scotland and Ireland, with different challenges, populations, technologies, and resources. There are quite a few decent mods out there that will allow you to get a different experience every time.

Overall, I would say this is one of my favorite Paradox games. The DLC is overpriced, but they are often on sale. I would definitely recommend this game",1611362632,1611362632,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In all seriousness Victoria 2 is one of the best paradox games out there. Although it has it's problems, and is dated in many ways, it still holds up as a solid grand strategy game.

Pros:
1. Pops. The Pop system makes this game truly awesome and gives each nation a unique feel. Pops represent your actual population and their statistics determine how your nation functions. For example, a nation such as the UK has high literacy and a well established industrial base, which allows for faster industrialization, whereas a country like Columbia has a relatively low literacy and poorly established industry, which makes the early game about educating and establishing industry, which gives it a much different feel than the UK. It also gives each nation a concrete way to tell how well off a nation is, which differs from games like Hoi4 where each nation has similar levels of development or EU4 which can sometimes feel like just stacking modifiers.
2. Conquest. Both EU4 and HOI4, for as great as they are, feel very much like map painting. Vic2, however, discourages map painting, and instead offers alternative methods such as sphereing, which prevents conflicts over regions from escalating to full scale war at points. Additionally, units take up real pops, so fighting a large war can cost you much of your army, which taps into your real population, aka wars cause you to lose pops which requires you to spend time at peace to recover from wars.
3. Economy. The economy in Vic2 feels realistic and encourages the acquisition of new sources of RGOs, or Resource Gathering Operations. This enourages things like building a large sphere, or in cases of non world powers, specializing your industry to fit the resources available to you. This can make different nations follow different paths of conquest. For example, a nation like the USA has an abundance of RGO to build industry, whereas nations like Japan will have to expand to get what they want, making each nations economic situation unique. Additionally, the fact that goods are sold on an open market makes things like wars have massive effects on world trade.

There are numerous other pros, such as modability.

Cons:
1. UI. The UI feel really dated, and fails to notify you of many things. For example, countries will break alliances, and you can only see that in a little area on your screen, so you often miss important information. Additionally, I feel the game should better notify you of major changes like shifting great power alliances.
2. Rebels. They are crazy. Like I get that you have to keep your population happy, but I should not be having nationwide revolts as a stable nation cause my pops dont have a bit of wool. There are ways to fix this, but it can still be a problem.

However, the pro far outweigh the cons. A couple suggestions however:
1. GET. ALL. DLC. Seriously get all the dlc and the game on sale. You dont need all the unit packs, just Heart of Darkness and House divided. Most mods require both.
2. Start with vanilla, but I recommend switching to HPM soon. HPM is kinda like Vanilla+ and adds a lot more historical content while still keeping it vanilla like.

Overall, great buy!

compared to other paradox games such as Hoi4 i think  Vic 2 is much better its not as boring as Hoi4 and I love the colonization part of it its really fun!
The game is fairly easy to grasp if you are not sure how to play then search up a tutorial and then it should be easy 
The influencing is fun and you have to race with other great powers to win over say Siam
two of my favourite  things about Victoria 2 are the westernization and the decisions westernization is when you are a nation such as the Chinese empire you earn research points and reform until you can westernize and decisions are like events but they have certain requirements and can only activate them if one has the requirements met like take the left bank decision you get to annex part of Prussia and set in motion a crisis.

Part of this stems from the procedural nature and dynamic granularity of its systems. Everything in the game, be it tax income and the tides of political movements to industrial development and the potential size of one's army, is based on POPs - units of population that equate roughly to a family of four people. Each POP has needs, opinions, political leanings, a profession, and the ability to move between locations in the world. A product of POP actions (such as their purchasing habits, their jobs, and their quantity) is the RGO and resource system, with the world market and its macroeconomics being incredibly integral to gameplay. Powerful players in the world market can grow rich off trade and starve their enemies of ammunition or industrial goods, while growth is challenging for small, resource-poor nations competing with large producers.

Another part of this stems from the simple fact that this game is old and incredibly janky. The economic system, while quite deep, is built off some very flawed roots and is incredibly unrealistic (there's a joke about artisans being able to make tanks out of fruit under the proper conditions). Wars are to a degree predicated based on RNG due to the way Infamy is acquired (and the need for certain popularities of Jingoism in order to fabricate additional wargoals while already at war); under the right conditions, annexing the Rhineland as France can cause no international controversy while annexing a tiny German state can bring on a Napoleonic-level coalition. On the other side of things, there's no distinction between ""ironman"" gameplay and the use of the debug console or savescumming, and the game is rife with exploits. Finally, the game really needs both of its DLC expansions in order to function properly; thankfully, these are obscenely cheap. 

Altogether the game is highly flawed, but highly satisfying for the fact that it feels living. Both the POP system and the economy are dynamic and always changing, making growth satisfying and meaning that revolutions and large wars can impact the entire world. The game truly flourishes with modifications, however, which do many things from making Africa far more fleshed out to introducing even more alternate history pathways for the world to develop along.

On the whole, I would highly recommend playing this game, though with the caveat that it's not perfect and takes a long time (and a lot of trial and error) to really learn.",1609725191,1609725191,True,35,0,0.742566406726837158,0,True,False,False

Something about this game and it's 19th century setting just agrees with me immensely. The political intrigue, the empire building and colonization, the struggle of world powers on a grand stage. The birth and death of Romanticism, and great strides in military and naval technology.  The fantastic soundtrack also helps to immerse you in the experience, an underrated element of Paradox games.

No playthrough is exactly the same. One game as Prussia may go entirely different from the next one. You can take the Ottoman Empire and turn it into a powerhouse, or prevent Russia's monarchy from collapsing. My most fond memory is playing as Sokoto and forming a vast West African empire. One that can even stem the tide of European colonization. Or taking Qing China and modernizing it and expanding across Asia and the Pacific Ocean.

As for gripes and issues, I find this game can crash very easily, so I highly recommend saving often. But my biggest issue is just the hassle of starting a multiplayer with friends. Having to get on the same checksum can bet troubling at times, and the stability of multiplayer games can vary wildly. I recommend not having more than a handful of player per game.

Overall, it's a fantastic game, and I just really want them to make a Victoria 3 already!",1607695566,1607695566,True,2,1,0.512311577796936035,0,True,False,False

I do appreciate the scope of history. 1836 to 1936 is a very long time and the tech tree changes enough for you to immerse yourself (although it cheeses me that bolt action rifles are later than machine guns, not even slightly true IRL) in the world that forms as you play.

I hope I helped!",1576351569,1606928215,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are lots of government forms, ideologies and reforms, there's an in-depth trade, the diplomacy, overall, is enjoyable and there are several features which make your world be alive, like the women rights, the education and the healthcare, Victoria II is not a Total War game and I love it because of that.

Something about the setting, the unprecented economy simulation, the way the game handles the population and jobs, the way everything works in a supply-demand basis... It is marvelous.

I just wish the game was better, with more UI sections where you can see everything you need (currently, you cannot), with more dynamics for culture acceptance,  better war mechanics, etc.

Right now it's my favorite Paradox grand strategy tied with https://store.steampowered.com/app/203770/Crusader_Kings_II/. These two games are almost definite simulators of their respective ages. But luckily Crusader II are still getting updates and overall, they are more polished and good-looking, while Victoria II works worse mechanically than any of newer Paradox games. That's a shame because I never saw more deep and meaningful internal and external politics not only in strategies of this studio but in other strategies too. Victoria triquel is desired by some many people. I hope they will not only keep this game deep and complicated but also add flavour events like Napoleon III and even more meaningful mechanics. If DLCs will be on the quality of Victoria II, I'm all for them.

Sure it's flawed and could really use a sequel, (Which will probably release five seconds before the sun consumes earth) but it still is a masterpiece. I'm going to describe each of the four main elements of this game in their own section, so here we go.                                      

This game has probably is one of the most deep economic simulators out there. You constantly find yourself looking at the trade tab seeing what product prices are rising and which are plummeting. doing the math on what goods would be profitable to produce. and making sure you stockpile military equipment should war strike your nation. and although it can get a bit micromanagey at times it is still quite fun.

Combat is relatively basic for most of the game (until tanks and planes are introduced) with one basic formation of armies. That being infantry in the front, artillery in the back, and cavalry and engineers to support them. The main key here is the battle dice, a semi-random way to determine the outcome of battles.
While to some extent they are random different things affect your rolls such as what general you have, terrain, and whether or not you can use gas attack. The navy is even simpler with terrain being completely removed from the question. All in all i'd say it's incredibly satisfying and quite fun.

Diplomacy is relatively simple for minor nations (basically revolving around which great power you want to ally), but once you become a great power and influence and colonialism are introduced, it becomes very interesting. You end up arguing with other great powers that Switzerland should be in your sphere of influence and not theirs, or that this territory should be under my control. It creates really interesting diplomatic scenarios which are even better in multiplayer.

The final aspect i want to talk about is expansion. Expansion is relatively hard to do (as other great powers don't really like you breaching the peace) unless one of three things are true. 1: the nation you are trying to attack has a territory which is a core of your nation (you obtain cores by scripted events or having a majority of your nation's ethnicity in that province). 2: The nation you are attacking is primitive or uncivilized or 3: The province is unoccupied an can be colonized (colonization mainly kicks off during the scramble for Africa).  As for wars, ideology, and revolution the game is significantly less scripted than other games such as Hearts of Iron, which is really refreshing and makes each game feel different. All in all I'd say this aspect is amazing

To conclude, this game is amazing and for $45 bucks with dlc (which you'll need) it's pretty fairly priced. I would certainly recommend this game to any strategy fan. P.S. I would highly recommend getting the historical project mod as it adds so much to the game :)",1605265773,1605265890,True,1,0,0.508196711540222168,0,True,False,False

[b]Victoria II[/b] is a [i]grand strategy game[/i], developed by [b]Paradox Development Studio[/b], who are also known for series such as [i]Hearts of Iron[/i] or [i]Europa Universalis[/i]. Similar to those series, in Victoria II, the player gets to play any country in the world in 1836, or (with ""[b]A House Divided[/b]"") 1861. While playing the desired country, one has to gain [i]prestige[/i], [i]industrial power[/i], and [i]military power[/i] to be able to compete in the everlasting arms race for power in the world.
The year of release is 2010, but the game still enjoys popularity nowadays - Why is that?

What distinguishes Victoria II from other Paradox grand strategy titles is the high focus on [b]industrial and political management[/b]. The game has a built-in population simulation with groups that share origin, work, belief and location (POPs). This feature gives every [strike]person[/strike] adult male on the planet their own story!
This creates realism and depth in many ways.
For example, the [i]POPs[/i] have different jobs, allowing for a working economy which the player has to manage - or put the liberals in charge and hope that they will. This economy has the important task of providing the population with what it needs and no game manages to recreate this system as good as Victoria II does.
Since the game lasts until the end of 1935, a lot of political changes and new ideologies got written down for the history books. The prime example for that is the rise of social democracy and socialism, sadly a bit confusingly named in this game, with [i]socialists[/i] basically being social democrats, and [i]communists[/i] being socialists. The change in political issues during the years make for a shift in party popularity over time. These parties have their own political goals like [i]military[/i] or [i]economical[/i] policies which change what the player can do. Because of that, the player can influence the election results by giving statements during the campaign, in reference to political issues. In spite of that, the player sometimes has to let democracy rule and [b][strike]have the annoying liberals destroy the factories[/strike][/b] let their country run its own cause.
The military part is obviously also included, though not as sophisticated as in Hearts of Iron games. In my humble opinion, the politics are even more important in a game set in this era, which is why I think that Victoria II is indeed [b]The Best Paradox Grand Strategy Game[/b].",1561896214,1604765471,True,26,1,0.723781883716583252,0,True,False,False

It's the single greatest media representation of the entirety of the Victorian era and beyond, with great power geopolitics through the form of spheres of influence, an infamy system, and colonization. It displays the industrialization of the west and the ever increasing technological disparity of the world throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Its warfare systems and mechanics are quite damning but can be mastered by the most daring grand strategist; combat in this age heavily emphasizes the exponentially expanding killing power of weapons and armaments during this period, thus defensive terrain, technology, and a decent commander will always dictate upon the battlefield (that, and raw numbers: less you be the Qing).

There is so much that one could say about this games, especially when one factors in all of highly dedicated modification projects which have no doubt extended the timeline of this game to the point where many still love and play this aged game into 2021. There is and will never be anything that can compare to Victoria 2, she is a once in a lifetime game that even the current devs at Paradox can barely understand.

My only critique is that the communist governments are undemocratic whereas the definition of the Dictatorship of the Proletarian is a system in which the workers democratically own and control not just the means of production but the state as well. Also you can't have freedom of press??? and you can bring back slavery as a communist government? Like chattel slavery? Damn well nothing that can't be fixed in a mod or two. I get if you want to have the antagonists of your game be Stalinists but just don't give the fascist faction freedom of speech and aspects of democracy whereas the opposite side of the spectrum is a literal dictatorship. 
I love a game where you can play as the Texan Republic that absorbs parts of Mexico and the concept of Brazil becoming a world power. This game is not as fast pace as HOI4 and needs a little bit more strategy than Blitzkrieg. Make sure to look up a few youtube videos on the subject. Overall rating is an 8/10 with some minor suggestions and criticisms.

If you can giggle at Communist United States and Fascist Australia, this game is also perfect for you.
If you like Paradox and wanna do megacampaigns, this game is ultra-perfect for you. Fascist Kievan Rus? Perfection.

If you have played CK2/3 or EU4 and thought ""Nice, but what if combat made more sense and the economy was far more complicated?"" then sign yourself right up for Vic2, 'cos in no other Paradox game will you get the thrill of building a sweet Fabric Factory in Wales.

Likewise, if you have played HOI4 and thought ""Nice, but what if the whole game wasn't entirely based around economy fuelling the military but rather a generous mix of the two?"" but you still defo want fascists and communists in the game, then this is the perfect middle ground.

It starts similar to EU4 with territorial expansion and outright war and ends with modern diplomacy, proxy warring, and stretegic economic moves. Most fans say you play as the ""spirit of the nation"" similar to EU4. The game has a indeth but limited civilian system where each civilian seeks out the best life for themselves. They seek jobs, socialist and democratic benifits, and have their own income according to their class or job. The limitiations are in how long you actually have to experiance the change of long term civlian benifits since the game is only 100 years long and only the new world gets immigrants. How ever threw the game you change the demographics of your nation from majority poor to majority middle class and the poltical and economic implications of that. The military mechanics are interesting but I never complete a game yet since I am always trying to get the very best start so I only experince the EU4 like mechanics. The game changed from musket line warfare to combined arms with technolgoical advancment. The late game combat is a primitive version of HOI4 and early game is the simlple move stacks to said location in EU4.",1601336240,1601336533,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1) It has a comprehensive socio-economic population system that is very complex - so much so that most people who play the game barely understand it.

3) It has interesting mechanics: colonization is fun, technology is well-designed, trade is interesting, and overall the military part of the game is rather challenging.

And what we have is some high grade-pure octane Geneva convention ignoring fun. Staring in the 1830s and ending when you fuck up royal, start a war you can't win and inevitably rage quit, Victoria II lets you play as any nation that existed in the early 1830s (Or 1860s if you get the House Divided DLC). Conquer and subjugate the world as a European power, try to modernize for a few decades as an uncivilized nation in Africa or South East Asia before getting raped by the British or the French, or the British or the Spanish or the British or the Portuguese or the British or the Dutch or the British or the Italians or even the British. 

Ban slavery, turn communist, become a republic, become a monarchy, hell if you want homie you can even puppet Haiti for lolz. Do whatever you want.... if you have the power to back it up. 

Pros 
- Full world map
- Every nation playable 
- In depth Technological advancement (go from flint lock muskets to machine guns and Tanks) 
- Africa, Asia and the Middle East is basically free real estate for European empires.

Cons
- Long loading times
- If you expand to fast you'll get punished hard................But we both know you're into that ;)
- Africa, Asia and the Middle East is basically free real estate for European empires. 


Europa Universalis IV is playing checkers while Victoria II is playing Chess. 
Victoria II is a Solid 9/10 (but you're going to want the DLC's..... its a paradox game so just be grateful you only need the two main ones, Heart of Darkness and a House Divided)

I normally play conventional RPGs in a goody-two-shoes manner as it almost always seems the most pragmatically sensible thing to do, but one of the things I love about V2 is that it organically makes you into a complete arsehole, stoking a colonial crisis in order to knock another great power down or sieging out a country just to make sure its economy is so crippled it will never pose a threat again, even once the war has been won. In that way, it's a much more interesting reflection on the terrible morality of the period than either amoral or actively revisionist games set at the same time.",1597584565,1597584565,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I own CK2, EU4, Stellaris and HOi4, all of which I love and have at least 50+ hours on most, this game is my favorite out the bunch, now at the time of this review I've only got ~ 22 hours, however I enjoyed nearly all of those hours, the learning curve surprisingly isn't steep, the game is basic, the Heart of Darkness DLC is a must, and the tutorials are a great help for learning the early stages.  If this is your first Paradox strategy game, you chose a great place to start, if you're a veteran then you should be able to pick it right up and have an abundantly enjoyable experience.  The government, population systems seem overwhelming at first, but as long as you're willing to read short segments you're good to go.  Playing with friends in this game is something that makes it 100x better, solo is fun but with friends, whether working together or VS should be a fun time.  The combat is fun, technological superiority can be felt, mobilization is an amazing feature that is fun to watch as an able-bodied young man joins as an irregular to fight.  Overall this is probably one of a short list of games I would give 10/10 - for reference I gave CK2 10/10, when I review EU4, at this time I would give it 8/10, HOi4 9/10 and Stellaris 6/10.  Looking back 10/10 is a bit high for CK2, however it's still a great game, that's free and I would highly suggest grabbing, however this game is much higher on my list, it's very addicting.  

To conclude, 10/10 game, buy it a full price or on sale, your choice, but it's a worthwhile experience despite the games age.  It feels like a modern game, not a 10 year old game.",1597366432,1597366432,True,22,0,0.727973818778991699,0,True,False,False

Want to make a dominant land-power? You can do that.
Want to play tall and build up an economy, focus on industry, and build a small but modest colonial empire? You can do that too.
Want to become world hegemon and take Britain's crown? You can do that as well.
I absolutely love how this game feels tool, you have to build your country up from the age of Napoleonic warfare to modern ww1 warfare. You have to undergo the industrial revolution and build up your industry, you have to pick where you wanna expand and virtually any part of the map that isn't held by civilized countries is open, you have to pass reforms and slowly liberalize your country unless you want to get an infamous anarcho-liberal revolt, and there are fun mini-challenges you can play with yourself too, like trying to meet all of your pops life needs. T

The game does have flaws though; the economy can be broken at times, there is definitely a meta in terms of where to colonize, blobbing in China in vanilla is broken, liquor factories are absolutely busted in vanilla, and the AI will attack you relentlessly for cores unless you dwarf their military score. Still, a lot of these issues can be softened or negated by playing HPM or another mod. 

Speaking of; the mods are fantastic and just add more flavor and decisions to the game. HPM/HFM just add onto the base game, it's virtually a free expansion pack. There's little to no reason not to download one of the two after your first or second game. I'd recommend them just for the dismantle CB, which makes it so that after a great war you and the victorious powers can divide up your enemies. Although it's recommended that you try to avoid calling minor powers into these or you'll end up with things like Romanian Indochina because the CB doesn't seem to calculate war score in the ensuing negotiation. It's still a greatfeature to the mods though and adds tension; if you lose a great war, everything you worked for and colonized is gone. There are also good Alt-history mods, there's a really sick cold war mod, the concert of europe, etc. etc.

Highly recommend to anyone who likes strategy games and simulators. You need both DLCs, though. Onsale you can get the base game and both DLCs for 20$ (or for 7 rn on humble).",1595780265,1595780766,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But, I mean, if you're looking to get into 4X games or want to try something different than Stellaris or Civ VI (both games I highly recommend), this game is fantastic -- especially for history nerds. I think it's hilarious that in one game in 1910, after a Great War that saw the UK lose and get disarmed, a cabal of commies took over and renamed the UK ""The Worker's Commonwealth."" Or seeing the U.S. get broken up and a new country called ""New England"" just keeps eating states from America (first New York, then New Jersey then Pennsylvania, then Ohio). I've had games where Germany failed to get any unification going and Czechoslovakia forms in like 1880 and becomes a massive world power. Sure, it's inaccurate, but you're given an accurate picture of the world in 1836. What you do from there is the fun.

But seriously this game is insanely complicated. Watch a let's play, preferably for the country you're playing as, like in CK 2, there are different plans for each nation, to get an idea on what you should focus on. Check out A Historical Flavour Mod as well. It's the only one I run and I highly recommend it. 

This game is hard. One time I played as Mexico. If you play as Mexico, the U.S. will be like a constant villain for the play through. It's just ""Mexico trying to get its literacy rate up"" vs. ""America wants this, this and this."" They're just dicks. Meanwhile, if you're the U.S., you only see yourself trying to become remotely viable against the might that are the European powers. Besides, Mexico is pretty much doomed anyway.

Even if you play as the U.K. and you're brand new, you could still flounder away into bankruptcy by 1838 if you're not watching yourself. 

The UI is not as intuitive as newer games in the genre and you'll definitely go looking for a ""Stop General/Admiral Death Pop-Up Spam"" mod, but it's just ingenious and kind of amazing to play. Will Japan become terrifying or nah? Will the U.S. avoid the Civil War altogether? Will France ever get its shit together? (Spoiler: only if they're on the winning side of a Great War that sees either Germany or the U.K. put to the guillotine).

Favourite things to do in this game
1). Yeet on the entire world with my navy, and reaffirm that the sun does in fact never set on The British Empire. (Funded by the booming tea market)
2). As France take on all of Europe, and finally take out the pesky British only to have my new Empire destroyed by the endless hordes of rebels.
3). As Prussia form Germany, and finally get that place in the sun with glorious Krupp Stahl Tanks.
4). Cripple the British economy as the U.S, and hyper inflate the value of Iron. 
5). Dunk on the Russians, and go for round 2 against the U.S as Japan in a very weird anime prequel to WWII as Japan.",1564898537,1594111238,True,1,2,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Pros:
Depth - amazingly detailed in terms of the potential of all the information and systems it is using for the price tag you'd be inevitably picking it up for. Rewriting history as someone who grew up with history as their favourite subject in school is always an exciting and interesting experience no matter how many times one replays something. The diversity of playstyles allowed by all of the ideologies coupled together with the fact that there's not really a victory condition so it's just sandbox - means you can set your own goals of winning without the game system telling your otherwise (other than if you are wholly conquered by another nation, ofc).

Con:
It's almost too much detail to handle in a game. I've played hundreds of hours, and I still am trying to figure out how to tame the beast. While it gives you the illusion you can help direct the economy, and as you feel like you should tame it, the games mechanics are subtle and hard to grasp on how it calculates wages (how do you push wages up? you can set it to the highest minimum wage and still there will be workers getting paid £0.1 or whatever, keeping them in poverty and having barely their life needs met, while another worker will get paid £5 and have luxury needs met), fluctuating pricing on goods that result in bankrupt factories that had been performing well before for decades... the list goes on. I'd argue that this game would be perfect and without flaws if only the economy was simplified and (game mechanics) tamed to allow users to either manage the economy as it implies with a 'Planned Economy' ideology, or lightly manage via an interventionist ideology.",1593970753,1593970753,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Is it a bad game? Not at all.

Although I'm not a fan of Vic2, I'm not going leave a bad review. The game isn't deserving of that. It's just not my cup of tea, that's all.

If you came here from HoI4 or EU4 looking for something like those 2 games, you'll be disappointed. Vic2 isn't a diplomacy or military strategy simulator like its contemporaries. Although it contains aspects of those, they aren't the main focus of this game. Vic2 is more of an economy simulator. If EU4 is the guy in the company who does all the frontline PR and marketing and HoI4 is the guy who manages product designs and makes everything work, then Vic2 is the guy who files the company taxes. Compared to other Paradox grand-strategies, Vic2 is nothing special.

That's not to say it's a bad game. It can still be just as fun as the other grand-strategies, it's just that, again, the focus is on the economy and internal politics of your nation rather than on expansion. Too much expansion can actually be detrimental to your nation's stability.

In conclusion, if you like filing taxes while also uniting Germany, you'll like this game.

In all seriousness Victoria 2 is one of the best paradox games out there. Although it has it's problems, and is dated in many ways, it still holds up as a solid grand strategy game.

Pros:
1. Pops. The Pop system makes this game truly awesome and gives each nation a unique feel. Pops represent your actual population and their statistics determine how your nation functions. For example, a nation such as the UK has high literacy and a well established industrial base, which allows for faster industrialization, whereas a country like Columbia has a relatively low literacy and poorly established industry, which makes the early game about educating and establishing industry, which gives it a much different feel than the UK. It also gives each nation a concrete way to tell how well off a nation is, which differs from games like Hoi4 where each nation has similar levels of development or EU4 which can sometimes feel like just stacking modifiers.
2. Conquest. Both EU4 and HOI4, for as great as they are, feel very much like map painting. Vic2, however, discourages map painting, and instead offers alternative methods such as sphereing, which prevents conflicts over regions from escalating to full scale war at points. Additionally, units take up real pops, so fighting a large war can cost you much of your army, which taps into your real population, aka wars cause you to lose pops which requires you to spend time at peace to recover from wars.
3. Economy. The economy in Vic2 feels realistic and encourages the acquisition of new sources of RGOs, or Resource Gathering Operations. This enourages things like building a large sphere, or in cases of non world powers, specializing your industry to fit the resources available to you. This can make different nations follow different paths of conquest. For example, a nation like the USA has an abundance of RGO to build industry, whereas nations like Japan will have to expand to get what they want, making each nations economic situation unique. Additionally, the fact that goods are sold on an open market makes things like wars have massive effects on world trade.

There are numerous other pros, such as modability.

Cons:
1. UI. The UI feel really dated, and fails to notify you of many things. For example, countries will break alliances, and you can only see that in a little area on your screen, so you often miss important information. Additionally, I feel the game should better notify you of major changes like shifting great power alliances.
2. Rebels. They are crazy. Like I get that you have to keep your population happy, but I should not be having nationwide revolts as a stable nation cause my pops dont have a bit of wool. There are ways to fix this, but it can still be a problem.

However, the pro far outweigh the cons. A couple suggestions however:
1. GET. ALL. DLC. Seriously get all the dlc and the game on sale. You dont need all the unit packs, just Heart of Darkness and House divided. Most mods require both.
2. Start with vanilla, but I recommend switching to HPM soon. HPM is kinda like Vanilla+ and adds a lot more historical content while still keeping it vanilla like.

Pros
Teaches you about history (this was studied somewhere, google it!)
Lets you seriously mess up history
Really detailed and ambitious simulation of global economy
Every country is unique with specific events and decisions related to real historical events
Loads of scope for micro managing but not strictly required
Forces you to role-play (we are slaves to geo-politics)
Haven’t really noticed any serious bugs
Nice soundtrack that fits the age
Little jokes in the newspaper are a nice touch

Cons
Very steep learning curve
Takes a long time to play a whole game
Late game feels a little lacking compared to early and mid-game
Controls and mechanics are quite opaque
Basically needs expansions to enjoy the full game
A little pricey for such an old game but definitely worth it when on sale

I bought the game without the DLC, and I didn't care for it too much. It was buggy, Prussia was a secondary color, there were no army/navy limits and it was incredibly easy to just build the worlds largest navy and win by default. So I stopped playing for a bit and forgot about the game for about a month, but then I remembered that i never bought the DLC, so I decided to waste more money in attempts to unburden myself from the torture of boredom. 

I didn't buy the DLC, I bought a new game. The game is completely different, the convenience, the new features, and the fact that the game is not historically railroaded along one path. This game has infinite replay value. Want to colonize China as the Ottoman Empire? GO FOR IT! Want to rape Nanjing a few years early? YOU DO YOU! Have a burning desire to murder all of Europe as America? ITS YOUR PARTY, FRIEND! 

FOR NEW BUYERS: Yes this game is very old in the base game. If you do not buy DLC, you will be playing an 8 year old map game. If you do buy the DLC, you will be buying an incredible game that came out in 2020 and has all the newest features. This is not an exaggeration, you need the DLC's. If you don't have the money, that's perfectly fine, they put the game and the DLC on sale all the time. I learned this the hard way as 2 days after I bought the full package, it went on sale for 60% off. 

Overall, the game almost never gets stale, i have yet to get bored with it and when i do eventually get bored, thats what mods are for ;)",1592180204,1592180204,True,19,1,0.710427165031433105,0,True,False,False

You will find yourself immersed in the dawn of the industrial age, grappling with the tumult and upheaval of development and revolution, while you will also be lifted high by the glory and splendor of the European powers at the height of their power, at the height of their empire, and the height of their resplendence atop the world. Speaking of which, the world is well done, and it is still believably realistic despite its age. While it is not as minutely detailed as CK2 or EUIV, it remains the grandest of them all with a beautiful 19th-century aesthetic. The art itself is a perfect fit, and even dynamic depending on ideology, like is seen in how the heading title of the regular newspaper updates change as a result. There are few strategy games that similarly capture the Victorian aesthetic quite so well. The art only suffers due to its age, which can be seen in  the 3D assets, and while it remains visually engaging this game is in need of an update, or even better, another installment of the series. The sound is good, and the music is a great touch, even if it notably repeats at times. The sound assets themselves are somewhat dated, but still acceptable and satisfying. The gameplay is a shining achievement of grand strategy as a genre, and everything from province development to intricate diplomacy and the deeply complex and as of yet unmatched economic system puts Victoria 2 head and shoulders above other games of a similar type, and even a decade later it blows the mechanics of other games out of the water. Overall, Victoria 2 is amazing, one of my favorite games, and it is in dire need of another installment. For all this, it gets a 9.5/10. Let it be known I will pay whatever Paradox Interactive wants for Victoria 3, and I'll even break my own rule about pre-ordering in order to emphasize my enthusiasm for a prospective Vicky 3.

The crisis mechanic is a lot of fun aswell! Gets you all tense because a war between the great powers may be imminent,

Play through the 19th century and into the 20th in a game of warfare, diplomacy, industrialisation and colonisation. Play as a great power and place your nation into the spotlight of the world and the annals of history. Play as a middle power and carefully guide your nation towards success. Play as a primitive nation and fend of would-be colonisers.

With the most in-depth economics and industry system of any paradox game and a sophisticated diplomacy system that links perfectly, Victoria II is an excellent representation of the scramble for resources to fuel industrialisation during this era. 

To experience the game fully, the two expansions 'A House Divided' and 'Heart of Darkness' are required. Note, unlike more modern paradox games, these two dlc are all you need for the full experience. For more content and to improve QOL, flavour and performance the HPM (Historical Project Mod) is recommended. Although, if you want even more possibilities, the HFM (Historical Flavour Mod) can alternatively be used.

This game is one of my all-time favourites and even in 2020, nearly a full decade after its release, this game still holds up because of the strength of its fundamental mechanics. This is a game I keep coming back to. I thoroughly enjoy it and hence recommend it to anyone with an interest in industrialisation, colonisation, the time period or just grand-strategy games in general.

Victoria II is a magnificent game.",1561778381,1589707208,True,2,0,0.525547444820404053,0,True,False,False

+ Gameplay (once you start to understand) is incredibly immersive
+ No harsh limitations on who you can play -- nearly any country can become a ""great power"" in the hands of an experienced player (except for most countries that get annexed via event)
+ Tutorials don't leave much to be desired; the three different skill levels for tutorial (beginner, intermediate, expert) really help with points of the game you don't understand.
+ The game's mechanics are a welcome addition; in fact, I wish more games had mechanics as rewarding as Vicky 2's. The infamy system, colonization, the feeling of getting no infamy through war justification, westernization, GPs (Great Powers) and SPs (Secondary Powers) -- of course some of these are entirely impossible in other PDX games, but they're still undeniably fun.
+ The game is less heavily focused on military (such as HOI3/4), yet balanced. The balance between the game's aspects in economy, imperialism, population and revolts, military, and so forth make Victoria II one of the most immersive PDX games there is from a roleplaying / diplomatic perspective.
+ The game has no ""historical"" boundaries -- in all honesty, you can do whatever the hell you want. Want to make the Ottomans a global superpower by 1936? Go for it. Want to challenge yourself to westernize China and take over the east? Do it. Want to make the Confederacy a communist state? Rock on. Want to make Canada a great power, conquer and gain a sphere of influence over America, and become the dominant North American nation? Hell yeah!
+ Mods are varied and incredibly unique -- Divergences is a mod that immediately springs to mind to me. There's also Cold War mods, graphics mods, mods that add more events, accuracies, and flavor to the game, etc. etc.

NEUTRAL:
~ I'm not the hugest fan of DLC. Obviously the game is far better with DLCs. Vicky 2 suffers from the Paradox effect, as I call it -- Paradox games are somewhat barren on release and then get stacked with content in the form of (often) overpriced DLC. There's no American Civil War in base Vicky 2, nor is there an Ottoman collapse event chain. That's in the 2 DLCs -- A House Divided and Heart of Darkness. Please do buy them alongside the base game.
~ This game's learning curve is absolutely insane. I'm nearly 200 hours in and I still struggle to fix my political system, unify Germany, manage my economy, etc. Don't expect to get good at the game in a reasonable amount of time; just like HoI4, you will learn something new about the game every time you play it.
~ Multiplayer can be... frustrating to set up, to say the least. Guides online are usually vague and there's no real good sites to host MP games on. You can go look for Victoria II MP discords, I guess, but good luck. If you want to play with your friends, it'll take an hour or two at least to set up properly.

NEGATIVE:
- You're gonna get struck with bullshit in this game. A lot. That's not to say the design is bad, but sometimes you can just get war randomly declared on you and have no way to fight back. Other times you'll get obliterated during wars where you really should be winning. It just happens; everything in the game happens for one reason or another. It's a learning process.
- Some nations are just objectively not fun to play (*cough cough* Qing *cough cough*). Others are incredibly hard to make GPs. The game is very euro-centric, if you get what I mean (some exceptions, of course, like the USA and Japan).
- The game requires a lot of micromanagement that can easily lose and confuse new players. You'll need a LOT of help with working the trade and economy systems, to name two. The tutorials cover a lot, but not enough to guarantee a decent first game (even as easy countries such as the UK)

That's about as far as I can stretch for negatives.

Should you buy this game? If you like Paradox games or map games in general, absolutely yes.

The Victorian to world wars age was one of innovation, economics and political change that this game captures in a fun and quite detailed way. It is also the only game that I have seen that accounts for the culture, religious belief, literacy and employment status of every household on earth, which feeds into the political uphevils that can ocurr, like the people of the CSA rising up in communist rebelion due to you shutting down the factories, raising tariffs and recinding rights. Not due to each of these actions carrying with it an ""+5% revolt risk"" modifier, but due to you making a big part of the lower class jobless due to you closing the factories, meaning that they can't get money for their needs and wants, raising the tariffs making many goods more expensive and everyones scant savings being able to buy even less and those imigrants that you alienated with your choice to remove a path to citicenship might become a rallying point for everyone else who has beef with you to also activley fight against you. The economy is also quite detailed and things like being neutral in great wars is a good way to get started on your arms factories for instance. Technology is the most lacking of the three but it is more in-depth than in other games, well actually the research is lacking, the things you get from research are quite suficient albeit unbalanced *Shuders in the enemy having gas attack and you not having gas defence*

The political system has its moments of ""yeah that's cool"" when playing. Notably the ability for your people to rebel and make a change in the country. And also the notable world economy, which is quite screwable. While yeah this is exploity, I like the feeling of pulling invisible strings seemingly unrelated and having far reaching impacts. I I also like the constant feeling of Romantacist progress which caries through the game. Meaning advanced nations stomp non-western nations.
Now the bad shit.
The War Mechanics feel like trying to hold water in your hands. As in its total dog shit. I feel like the enemy can constantly slip past my armies because Switzerland keeps giving France military access. And when the Enemy slips past, you effectively have no counter to this. And the entire front collapses. And it devolves into you making a death stack and building forts beforehand to accumulate a totally stupid and arbitrary warscore. And I hate how random events pop up literally every 2 seconds on fast speed. Meaning gameplay is just clicking No, No, No, No, Kill the Child, No War, No, No, Gain Prestige, Random Political Event.

It's fun, it has good replayability, it has intricate mechanics, it feels period-accurate in a way a lot of games (including some Paradox titles) don't, and it doesn't feel like there are any crazy terrible downsides. I recommend it. It's worth playing at least a couple of times.

That said, let's talk downsides. This is a game where sometimes you can't do what you want, and it won't be clear why--for example, who said you couldn't improve your citizens' healthcare? The ""upperhouse""? The tutorial didn't really go over that! There are also some truly baffling design choices, like the way the military score is based solely on your generals and navy, and having a big army in itself means nothing at all. You have to do some super gamey things to get ahead--like you have to provoke your populace into being more militant about reform so you can get your upperhouse to actually pass reforms, or how the best way to become a great power is to become a cultural juggernaut, rather than, you know, being a power that is great. It's super unclear what entity you're supposed to represent, since you find yourself going against your elected government, your upper house, and your own citizens all the time. There is also some bad grammar happening, which is surprisingly immersion-breaking.
