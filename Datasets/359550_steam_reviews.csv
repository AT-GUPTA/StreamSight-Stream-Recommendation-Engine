From year one to three this game used to be so much more simple and enjoyable. The atmosphere has completely changed and the game just feels like a sweatfest where everyone plays their absolute hardest using the meta, exploits, toxicity and other crap game mechanics to their advantage. For context I have been playing this game on and off since beta and have logged thousands of hours across multiple platforms. I was hooked on the game ever since the beta. But as time goes on I play this game less and less and every time I return after awhile it always makes me so disappointed.

They have mutilated all of the classic maps, operators have completely been reworked (some for the better admittedly) and the core game mechanics are different every time I boot up this game. I'm not afraid of change but this games identity, gameplay and overall ""feel"" has been completely tarnished and turned into this ultimate competitive cash cow that gets worse with every season.

Something that really upsets and confuses me is the removal of T-Hunt. T-Hunt was an amazing gamemode that was perfect for putting on music and practising the mechanics of the game. Learning that they removed it was shocking and when I tried the horribly made practice game mode they threw together to take its place made me immediately Alt+F4 and write this review.

And that's not even the worse part. The entire game is just a mess and I could go on all day verbally about how awfully this game feels compared to what it once was but just don't care enough to write much more about how I feel.

It's just super saddening to see what was for a long time my absolute favourite game just get run into the dirt. Ever since Operation Grim Sky this game started going down the shit pipe and it will sadly never be the same again.  

If you were playing from Operation Velvet Shell to Operation Para Bellum congratulations, you were playing during this games golden era. If you missed that time, I genuinely feel bad for you. This game sucks now.

But my brother got me into watching Jynxzi a few months ago and inspired me to actually play Rainbow Six Siege (besides a week when I was in 9th grade).

There's clearly been a lot attention to detail, with a wide away of operators (playable characters) to suit different play styles. Also love the diverse set of operators. They come from around the world. Can't forget to mention the maps, honestly probably the best part of the game. Each includes many breakable surfaces so it offers and rewards creative ways to navigate and get kills. The actual objectives are pretty simple but the different match ups and maps make for a great experience. 

The game play is pretty standard for an fps shooter. Some gun customization is pretty cool, affecting the recoil which, to my knowledge, I don't pay attention to or haven't seen in other shooters. The biggest thing though is the skill ceiling. Like said before, many operators; so you gotta eventually learn to play or go against, getting accustomed to changing environments, the different map layouts, and remembering to listen to your surrounds. 

I'm obviously not the first to start playing because of Jynxzi and I'm still a noob, but honestly R6 is a solid game, 8.5/10.",1708830395,1708830395,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

please fix ubisoft connect please

update: the game doesn't even work for me anymore, the game just simply doesn't launch. ubisoft has made one of the worst launchers i have ever used, and because of this shit i can't even play the game anymore. if you really want to play this shitty fucking game, just play it on a console. ubisoft has ruined this game on pc because of their launcher.

and another thing, i have been playing this game for around 2 years, i hasn't around for the glory days of siege, but even i can say that ubisoft has made more bad changes than good. and with this next season around the corner, i doubt it will get any better. ubisoft has ruined this game because all of the devs are a bunch of morons who don't listen to their fans and don't know a good change from a bad one.

my brain deteriorating to eventually slowly drain out of an ear or to slug its way down out my nose and mouth... my beating heart stopped long ago, losing its rhythm and stopping itself as if it has lost purpose, sad and alone, it seeks refuge with my lungs, until the lungs slop off its cords to fall down and seep with my rotting corpse...

To die at someones hands for me is like having your first kiss, flutters of excitement, happiness and a sense of fullness.
of course for a dead body and decaying corpse, it isn't going to feel full, after being gutted with rusty blades and medical tools...

They're pretty garbage for not cracking down on its toxic community that its bred in this game. Literally deters new players from playing the game. At the very least they could make a setting to turn off voice chat. Instead the best thing you can do is turn down the voice chat volume to zero.. Don't even get me started on how poorly optimized and CPU intensive this game is.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1561775676,1708648494,True,2,0,0.547325074672698975,0,True,False,False

Edit: The newest season Deep Freeze seems to be a return to grace. Game has been pretty fun recently.

Edit 2: Deep Freeze has truly brought back my love for this game.

Really Fun
It is fun but a bit salty so it sometimes gets hard to play because of the salt but i have played a lot of it and spent a lot of money and love the game

So If you thinking of spending money on i game i recommend this one

Update from 700 hours in, and five years to my age:
Still a really enjoyable game, while I did stop playing it for a bit when I came back it was still welcoming. While it is definitely different from Year 3 when I started playing, it is just as fun and still provides some really great moments.

I like it on maps like Kafe Dostoyevsky

I also think there are way too many characters to choose from, I swear they add a new character every other season and they add ugly ass characters like tubarão and gridlock like I swear they are one of the uglier one's and I think they should get a new character design and make them sexier. I also have some compaints about the requierments to play ranked, like dont you think its unessesary to have to get up to level 50 to play ranked, couldn't it have been like level 30 or mabye 35 I think its is something that should be changed immediately so I can go and play ranked. I also have some compaints about the accessories and that they should add more so I can get some more optimasation. Here are some maps that I facking hate, plane I think this map is so shit because it is so facking attacker sided and they should make it more even because right now the attackers can just pick off the defenders that are on the wrong side of the plane, yacht This map it basically like plane but without wings there are on hiding places for roamers to utilize which makes it almost impossible to play someone like cavera on this map, fortress this map provides accessibility to the roof for defenders and that should not be the case because the accessibility to the roof top by the defenders makes it even harder to enter a already hard entry map, tower there is a big advantages for the attacker side because they can just pick off the people that are trying to go up to the second floor and I think that should be fixed.

They removed the PvE Terrorist Hunt gamemode.

Ranked 2.0 has ruined the games enjoyment for me. In a competitive game rank no longer means anything or gives you an indication to skill level. Cheaters and John Wick's are in every ranked game now, even if you haven't played in about 25 years. I'm not entirely sure what hidden mmr is based off of but doesn't it defeat the whole purpose of having an elo system in the game. If i am stuck in plat I want to consider myself a plat player and try and improve and get to the next rank, now I start in copper and go against champ players, guess i am a copper player now. Ranked is now just play for rewards rather than improving and the TDM ADHD meta is in full force.

Casual has been completely revamped with core 'casual' aspects like non competitive maps and freedom to strategise however you want has been ruined. Pre placed rotates and reinforcements and reworking a map like house to make it more competitive in a CASUAL gamemode makes no sense. 

The gunplay now is gradually being ruined, is this gun too popular compared to another? Increase the recoil instead of buffing the guns that don't get played to reduce the pick rate. Making guns that people have fun using less fun does not make the game more enjoyable. The 1.5x scope is one of the worst additions, objectively the best scope in the game with no weakness, why would you use another? Now it's just a bunch of 1.5x clones walking around with no strategies or thought as to how they engage a gunfight.

Adding a shooting range was a decent implementation after years of people asking for one, but why was there a need to then remove T-hunt. You add something the community loves and then proceed to take away something the community has loved for years prior, it's not even pvp, it doesn't divide players or harm the matchmaking in any way it's just a strange decision. 

The new maps; reworked or not, and operators consistently being introduced don't seem great either, granted I haven't played enough of them but nobody seems to like them in anyway, they get banned almost instantly in every game. Fenrir's gadget just seems way too strong but worst of all just painful to go up against, you can hide it in a floor and the next minute an attacker is Stevie Wonder with little to no counterplay.

What even is the battle pass as well, I feel like i'm playing the harry the hamster browser game. it's not rewarding, you don't get the credits back and it's painful to look at and navigate. Not sure how they made it worse than it was before.

I used to love this game and part of me still does but the more time goes on it just gets worse. Casual is nowhere near as fun and Ranked is nowhere near as fair and rewarding. L's on all fronts.",1570131445,1708520001,False,3,0,0.559748470783233643,0,True,False,False

I was excited to play this game but I went 'ubi-soft' really quick. It's not a game. It's tedium. It's bugged out bloatware. It's a waste of $7.99, yes I got it on sale and refunded it immediately after 35 minutes of work, bugs, dark patterns, and unskippable audio and cut-scenes.

The bloatware:
First, the game installs an unnecessary test server (50gb). Then it installs the launcher, forces you to create an account, and then installs battle eye, Ubisoft connect, Uplay, and adds TWO folders to your PICTURES directory. I have no idea how much **** it put on my PC, that's all I could find. Good luck getting ubisoft connect to uninstall (shoutout to a 2yo reddit comment > you need to hit 'quit' from the hidden windows tray icon in the carrot left of your volume controls).

The actual misery of trying to play this 'game':
I uninstalled the test server, then launched the game. Crashed (while running at 500fps) because it needed to reinstall all of the above after I removed the test server. Finally after 3 launch attempts it loads up and forces you to play what I assume to be about an hour of tutorial. Only made it 35 minutes before a bug forced me to restart the tutorial. Rappelling? Forget it. Left-handed/eyed gun HUD? Nope (It was a requested feature in 2018; did the devs add it? Why even ask lol). The rappelling glitching out and forcing me and others to restart an overengineered tutorial was the final straw. The tutorial is designed for toddlers to learn how to operate a gun and ping the ceiling, but not rappel apparently. Just play Overwatch or CSGO or Valorant. They're all individually leaps and bounds better than this game. Writing this review was a poor but acceptable solace received for you (pointing at ubisoft) wasting 35 minutes of my time. Ultimately it's our fault though. We're just too dumb and we keep buying ubisoft products. If gamers were smart, ubisoft wouldn't have succeeded as a franchise.",1708497830,1708497830,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

And instead of improving Anti-Cheat Ubisoft will instead add new characters, nerf characters that didn't need it, buff characters that didn't need it, and make overall unnecessary changes. The game has many bugs that Ubisoft refuses to fix as well. 
Let me list a few:
-Game Freezes Every Few Seconds so you have to restart game (Or do Affinity Fix)
-Mouse Appears on Screen so You Have to Alt Tab
-Can't get Out of the Options Menu so You have to Restart your game
-Audio Glitches Out and you can't here anything or say anything
-Mic Bugs Out so you can't use your mic unless you restart your game
-Spectating a black screen 
-No Mic
Let me list a few problems:
-Very Long Queue Times (Longest For Me Was 2 Hours)
-Shitty Servers
-Hitbox Issues

I'm not going to talk about the shitty community.
There's so many cheaters in the game that someone actually tried arguing with me to simply get better and just kill the cheaters because it's part of the game.
Fucking shit ass company, the game is fun but Ubisoft is so fucking retarded.
Overall, I recommend you buy this game if you're mentally insane.
I hope this game dies Ubisoft is such a dogshit company they are so fucking insanely unaware of their own issues that they don't fix anything and leave the game to die.

Since its release in 2015, it has captivated millions of players worldwide with its intense gameplay, strategic depth, and ever-expanding roster of operators. As a team-based multiplayer shooter, Rainbow Six Siege challenges players to outsmart and outmaneuver their opponents in high-stakes, close-quarters combat scenarios. Let's delve into the myriad facets that make Rainbow Six Siege one of the most beloved titles in the genre.

Gameplay:
At its core, Rainbow Six Siege revolves around the concept of asymmetrical warfare, where two teams of operators with unique abilities face off in tense, tactical encounters. Each round presents a dynamic puzzle, with attackers aiming to breach and secure an objective while defenders strive to fortify their position and repel the assault. The game's emphasis on environmental destruction adds a layer of realism and unpredictability, allowing players to breach walls, barricades, and floors to gain a tactical advantage.

The diverse roster of operators further enhances the depth of gameplay, with each operator bringing a distinct set of gadgets, weapons, and abilities to the battlefield. From breaching charges and reinforced walls to drones and surveillance cameras, the possibilities for strategic play are virtually endless. The game's tactical depth rewards coordination, communication, and adaptability, making teamwork essential for success.

Maps and Environments:
Rainbow Six Siege features a variety of meticulously designed maps, ranging from tightly enclosed urban environments to sprawling outdoor locales. Each map offers multiple routes, sightlines, and points of entry, encouraging players to devise creative strategies and adapt to ever-changing circumstances. Whether it's rappelling up the side of a skyscraper or breaching through a basement wall, the game's dynamic environments provide endless opportunities for emergent gameplay and memorable moments.

Operators and Customization:
With over 60 operators to choose from, Rainbow Six Siege offers a staggering amount of variety and customization. Operators are divided into different CTUs (Counter-Terrorist Units), each with its own unique gadgets and abilities. From the agile and stealthy operators of the SAS to the high-tech gadgets of the GIGN, there's an operator to suit every playstyle and preference.

In addition to choosing an operator, players can customize their loadouts with a wide array of weapons, attachments, and equipment. Whether you prefer a stealthy approach with suppressed weapons or a more aggressive playstyle with shotguns and explosives, the customization options allow for endless experimentation and personalization.

Community and Esports:
Rainbow Six Siege boasts a thriving community of dedicated players, with millions of active users and a vibrant esports scene. Regular updates, balance patches, and new content releases keep the game fresh and engaging, while events and seasonal challenges offer rewards and incentives for players to keep coming back.

The game's competitive scene has also flourished in recent years, with professional teams competing in tournaments and leagues around the world. The tactical depth and skill-based gameplay of Rainbow Six Siege make it a compelling esport to watch and follow, with high-stakes matches and clutch plays keeping viewers on the edge of their seats.

Conclusion:
Rainbow Six Siege is more than just a game; it's a constantly evolving, living ecosystem that continues to push the boundaries of competitive gaming. With its deep gameplay mechanics, diverse roster of operators, and thriving community, it offers endless hours of strategic fun for players of all skill levels. Whether you're coordinating with teammates to execute a flawless breach or outsmarting your opponents with cunning tactics, Rainbow Six Siege delivers an unparalleled multiplayer experience that is as exhilarating as it is rewarding. So gear up, choose your operators, and prepare for the ultimate test of skill and strategy in Rainbow Six Siege.",1694408565,1708496053,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Rating: ★★★★☆

Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege, developed by Ubisoft, has solidified itself as a cornerstone in the tactical shooter genre, offering intense, team-based gameplay that demands strategic thinking and precise execution. While the game undeniably delivers a thrilling experience, the high stakes and competitive nature can, at times, lead to a sense of frustration and intensity that some may find draining.

The core of Rainbow Six Siege lies in its emphasis on realistic, close-quarters combat and destructible environments. The game's unique Operators, each with their specialized abilities, add a layer of depth to the tactical gameplay, encouraging diverse team compositions and strategic planning. The attention to detail in weapon mechanics and environmental destruction enhances the immersion, creating an atmosphere of tension and urgency.

The competitive nature of Rainbow Six Siege is both a strength and a potential drawback. The game demands constant vigilance, communication, and adaptability, creating an adrenaline-fueled experience that can be emotionally draining for players seeking a more casual gaming session. The learning curve is steep, and the pressure to perform at a high level may contribute to a sense of frustration for newcomers or those less experienced in tactical shooters.

The constant updates and additions to the game, including new Operators, maps, and game modes, showcase Ubisoft's commitment to keeping Rainbow Six Siege fresh and engaging. The evolving meta and strategic landscape add longevity to the experience, ensuring that dedicated players always have something new to explore.

The toxic behavior within the Rainbow Six Siege community has been a persistent issue. Instances of harassment, unsportsmanlike conduct, and occasional cheating can create a less-than-enjoyable environment. While Ubisoft has implemented measures to address toxicity, it remains an ongoing concern that can detract from the overall experience.

The monetization model, primarily centered around cosmetic microtransactions, allows players to customize their Operators and weapons without impacting gameplay. While this approach avoids pay-to-win scenarios, the allure of cosmetic items may contribute to the game's reputation as a ""soul-sucking"" experience for those who get drawn into the microtransaction ecosystem.

In conclusion, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege delivers an exceptional and immersive tactical shooter experience that is both exhilarating and challenging. Its competitive nature and high stakes may not be suitable for everyone, as the intensity and potential for frustration can be draining. However, for those seeking a deep and strategic multiplayer experience, Rainbow Six Siege remains a benchmark in the genre, offering a gameplay experience that is as demanding as it is rewarding.

Rainbow Six Siege: Where friendships are tested and walls are reinforced!

If you've ever dreamed of being part of a SWAT team but lack the physique, discipline, or overall ability to function as a cohesive unit, then Rainbow Six Siege is the game for you!

Picture this: You and your team of misfits are tasked with either rescuing a hostage or preventing a bomb from going off. Sounds simple, right? Wrong! Because in Siege, the only thing more fragile than your tactics is your ego.

Prepare yourself for the thrill of breaching a room, only to be swiftly taken out by a sneaky camper who's been patiently waiting in a corner for the past ten minutes. But fear not! You'll have plenty of opportunities to exact revenge when you respawn, only to fall victim to the same camper again. Ah, the circle of life... or should I say, the circle of ""git gud.""

And let's not forget the joy of communication! Who needs tactical callouts when you can just scream ""He's in that room with the thingy!"" and hope for the best? Bonus points if your teammates understand your unique blend of panic and confusion.

But don't let the steep learning curve discourage you. With enough dedication, you too can become a master at accidentally blowing up your own team with poorly placed explosives or barricades. It's all part of the fun!

So grab your reinforced walls, don your tactical gear, and get ready for a rollercoaster of emotions in Rainbow Six Siege. Just remember: in the world of Siege, the only thing more unpredictable than your opponents is your own ability to fail spectacularly. Enjoy",1708472054,1708472054,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

You see, Ubisoft has completely changed the casual gameplay and made it into a COD clone that's all about sweaty deathmatch rather than careful strategy. The only way to get the old casual experience is to play ranked, which for most people is something that requires a lot of time commitment and can be very toxic if you don't have 4 friends to play with. Ultimately I can't recommend this anymore, used to be my favorite game but now it's appealing to a much younger audience that wants a dopamine rush rather than thinking and strategy.

Old review:
My most played game on Steam. Despite Ubisoft’s best efforts, I just can’t stay away from Siege. Siege offers something very unique in the multiplayer shooter genre; it lets you be creative. One game mode doesn’t get repetitive when there’s 4 locations on each map, each with myriad possibilities for the 65 different characters (with new ones being added every few months). The weighty gunplay, a fantastic destruction system, and layers upon layers of strategy make it something I’ll never get bored of. I’ve taken my fair share of breaks but whenever I get frustrated with another game I always return to. Unfortunately Ubisoft is both listening to the player base and tone deaf at the same time. The buggy launcher, random bugs that go unfixed for months, and bizarre changes that ultimately get rolled back after backlash mar an otherwise amazing game. If you’re looking for a shooter that prioritizes creativity and teamwork over quick reactions and crazy aim then this is for you. 

*I highly recommend buying an edition that includes characters since it can take a while to unlock them all",1688180731,1708465029,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game does feel better now, but the fact that there are some maps that do not make it into Quick Match (formerly Casual) is ridiculous. There is in fact no way to play a map like Oregon or Theme Park with the Secure Area gamemode (my favourite over bomb). But if you used to play this on console and were thinking about getting it, I would recommend it. The game feels solid and with constant updates it is for sure worth it.

Tactics, strategies and the ability to gather information about the opponent is more important than the actual shooting.
 You can play Ranked, standard (ranked without points) and casual (less rounds), or you can play arcade which is just some fun mini games to test your aim and other things. You now also get access to a shooting range where you can test your loadout beforehand, a game against AI for you to train alone and a way to learn all maps in the game.

Game is great so far. Underrated it seems. More of my friends need to play it more.  

It’s a tad like CS2. It even has the store like CS2 and the watch tab to watch your plays and matches(?). Weird thing it’s in beta. Or because I’am rank zero. that nothing is online?
I recommend it. No crashes. No bugs that ruin the experience. 

Just remember it’s about micro transactions and all that crap. Not sure if playing unlocks some things and gives you earnings to buy stuff or both.

Small footnote - never ever confuse ""Tactical"" and ""Tacticool""
[b]Tactical[/b] (Interior > Exterior) - ""art of arrangement"", planning, ""thought outstrips action"", etc. 
   (a.k.a. try to predict enemy movement, patiently and quietly await the right moment for execution)
[b]Tacticool[/b] (Exterior > Interior)  - cool reload animations, smooth weapons, conversations, callouts and callsigns as if you ever were in Navy Seals or Rangers(overwhelming majority of those milsim guys never were there and never will get there even if they were willing to).
   (a.k.a. make up the worst plan possible, use military jargon, execute it in the worst manner possible, while still using military jargon, example - rush the building as if you were completely stripped of your sensory organs, get fragged in most obvious and open spot possible, but doing it [i]in style[/i] while screaming ""I'm hit"", ""Enemy spotted"", etc.)

Old Rainbow Six games were excellent not because they had those beefy reload animations, realistic graphics or cool and tough looking operators[spoiler](or a shitload of community-made porn)[/spoiler] but because of ability to plan any mission down to the smallest detail, to execute mission either in slow and thorough pace or in shock, percussive tempo(also, there was a possibility and sometimes a requirement of doing the mission while remaining unnoticed), to make sure every team member survives the mission and shows top performance during execution, because if they don't - they will be either heavily injured and not being able to participate in next couple of missions or gone for the rest of the game...

(should be read with outrageous french accent)
[i]""And because of that...""[/i]


My expectations:
[i]""...on the frontlines of this strange war is the [u]counter-terrorism task force[/u] codenamed 'Rainbow'. Operating out of basis on both sides of the Atlantic, Rainbow operatives are ready to strike at a moment's notice anywhere on the globe. Although their existence is [u]secret[/u]*, their combined courage and vigilance have [u]saved the lives of millions[/u]...""[/i] (c) Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear intro
Tactical immersive shooter, with strong accent on cooperation, player's use of intelligence, with no second chance**, realistic threats and realistic solutions for them. And, of course, an easy-to-hate targets - terrorists who need to be given a severe punishment for their crimes...

[spoiler]But, unfortunately, developing stuff for little kids makes more money than developing games that require the use of brain. And that's why we see this instead of Rainbow Six: Patriots(a bit out of ""tactical"", but at least realistic):... [/spoiler]

Reality (after y3 it became even worse [up until year 8, where I stopped playing])
""It's freaking space aliens, man!""(c) Wolfenstein 2: New Colossus
Circus with airsoft guns(and those buff-nerf rollercoaster hills), overwatch-like operators (every op has at least 2 replacements), pink [b][u]camouflage[/u][/b]*** as such(really catches my eye after seeing ""tactical"" tag on this game's page and knowing about it's predecessors), unicorn helmets, anime stuff, pizza outfits, [b]people which are completely unable to use their sensory organs and just wasting time during rounds[/b] (sadly, like in any other online game), pros crying about realistic settings being too op (like it wasn't meant to be like this), devs ruining every single aspect of the game with their pro league pleasing updates, fuckton of preposterous bugs, errors, gadgets, backstories and, finally, an enormous, unstopping flood of shit coming each season with less and less things that can make me play this game any longer. 

Ubi Soft(it's current staff) are exterminating ""Tactical"" genre with the piece of garbage they called ""[b][i]Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six[/i][/b]"" game in favor of mainstreams and money.

The only cool thing(close to year 8) - some character, who said he was part of Rainbow unit before (or was leading it, judging by word combination ""my unit""), almost quoted ""Reality"" paragraph of this review and then shot that psychotherapist guy. Sadly, people nowadays consider such solutions too radical and stop others from solving problems the [b]correct[/b] way...


* - The group is secret(and it's existence known only to highest government officials) but we will host a freaking airsoft championship annualy, exposing our operators to public (Nokk and Fisher existence is highly classified, but who could care less, right?), promoting some psychotherapist without any military training to commander of multinational military organization(is it common practice in spec ops units?). Let alone those fucking candy-shite/zombie-halloween/alien-invasion things*** that aren't supposed to be a matter of debate at event theme discussion for Tom Clancy game, you will see no such things in Ghost Recon, right?
UPD: The game is about counter-terrorism unit, but we will take away from players the [b]main[/b] part of the series - counter-terrorism operations, cause why not make fans any angrier?

** - In my opinion, letting dead players ability to communicate with alive teammates is, was and will be a great mistake to make in competitive shooters, those on back row should remain silent, mainly because 
 they will always know what's best for those who still engaged, disregarding amount of noise and disruption they produce(and totally not being able to analyze the situation that led them to being a spectator).

*** - There was an experimental camouflage called ""Mountbatten Pink"" - a pale pink coloring proposed for use by lord Louis Mountbatten during WW2, main purpose of which is to hide ships during sunset(which, according to sailors, didn't work, if it weren't giving out an exact position to enemy at any time of the day, even dusk)

*** - those people who like it either 10yo kids who never ever played a single Rainbow Six game or it's those streamers who are making surprised and exicted faces after seeing any illusion of content(or money bags for a review full of lies and false advertisement). NO old Rainbow Six fan will consider this a good idea.



[FOR LAZIES]
If you want a game, where you can waste your mental health, time and make sure the humanity needs to be purged from the face of the Earth: it's your choice.
You can also watch XDefiant trailer to waste a bit less time to get same result.

If you want a multiplayer game, where the word ""Tactical"" means something - go to Ground Branch(from one of the developers of first Rainbow Six and Ghost Recon games), Intruder(Splinter Cell SvM like PvP game), Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear (There is a whole discord server for multiplayer experience. In fact, any old Ghost Recon or Rainbow Six at all will do, cause people made those playable in multiplayer nowadays), or...

Is it fun? Yes. In those moments that click, I haven't had as much fun in a competitive first person shooter, ever.
But it also sucks. A lot. There's a lot of really cheap strategies, blatant meta, and a steep learning curve. Not only do you have to become aware of these, but you have to pray your teammates are as well. 

Which brings me to the largest issue with this game - it's community. 
You will get some cool, amazing people sometimes - dudes that are supportive, give call outs, etc. But more often than you get those, you get guys who refuse to listen to callouts or are genuinely toxic. Name calling, trolling, afk, and much, much more.

And finally... it's a ubisoft game. The progression is slow as fuck, unless you pay money.

i first saw the r6 trailer and i realy liked it back then even tho the game came out very diffrernt than the trailer , i bought r6 in late season 2 year 1 when bb and valk came out , back then it was amazing game , no try hards , most people didnt know all maps and tricks , it was very fun , with good weapons , i remember even shutguns very very good even op i would say but after times passess every thing changed and the community gone in wrong direction, i seen good people and terrible  people in r6 , i had fun and rages too, i would say the last time i realy had fun in this game will go back the season that lion and finka came out , maps like university was my favorite back then , i played solo and with friends , after that season most my frinds quit r6 or played less than i , then i started playing solo , that time i released that game is more toxic that it should be , the among i got team killed (some times even vote kicked ) was so much that i for uninstall the game first time and was like im done , i told my self i play r6 again when i have full team or freinds at least , i reuninstall the game when my friend bought a new pc to pay with me , i started again playing r6 again to find out every season it get worse , even my friend mentioned
 that we take break from r6 lol , the only season i was excited to come out was the shadow legacy because i loved splinter cell so much but still it wasnt enough to keep me playing, the only times i played this trash game after that season it would becasue of my friend no other reason 
if you a old seige player you would agree the last times you had actual fun was when lion and ela were good operators 

#game it self has mistakes:

the game  started good when it came out , people say it was realistic but this people were wrong the game was always tactical never realistic , back then every operators was good and we barely see opertors who were actualy not useable for theire guns or gadgets , we had night maps ,community wasnt great but it wasnt this much garabge like its is now , the fall of siege was when people started listen to stupid stearmers and pro league  players , it started like tips and tricks but then it stared to abbuse Mechanics that it shouldnt be in the game in first place , like pixel hole peaks (theire removed it after 6 years , they need 6 years to figure out this is a broken unrealsitic garbage that shouldnt be in the game in first place ) then was shaiko peak (i always hated that people who camp in corners always had theire advantage against people who push , when i sawt the lean peak for first time i was like finally a way to deal with those people , then it changed to some thing that people say shako peak that i still belive it shouldnt be in game like that , normal lean peak are good and healthy for game but thats shailo peak is absulute broken mechanic) then the pro league hype satred and ubisoft started to only focus only on pro league players , just imagine for a single round win for attackers was enough for this developers to nerf zofia bucasuse she could stand up if she was injured (just imagine how rare it was for that situation to came that zofai would come to clutch that) now you would say ok what is the problem now , i would say to you they bring that mechanic to 5 defenders when a team pick rook , than people start to listen to streamers and pro league players, who only  nagging , do you remember when nokk was getting a buff? a operator  that is mostly usless and even the developers said thay give her a huge buff , what its her situation now? she got nerfed lol , do you know why? because of pro league , the list of this thing goes one i can write book for even this subject but lets move one for others thing like
balanced guns , im just starting with lmg nerfs , imagine lmgs were not used and without changes for years then last year when every assualt rife was so nerfed that they were useless , people started to use lgms then the nagging of stearmers and pro league player and theire fan (try hards) started , theire say the lgms were op lol , just imagine on one ever used lmg for years ,how are lmgs op now ?? if lmgs were op , people woulkd used since release not 6-7 years later , if you wanna satrted this game be perpare for this kind of things because the community is delusional and full of garbage people

#operators :

most operators are unique , i would say back then it was more balanced then now after all they nerfes and changes but the game started from a shooter tactical game to somthing thats isnt the game you recognize if you played years ago , now its like overwacth , valorant , cod mix , witch is bad but developers instead of making good ideas , they ruin more, back then every seaosn had 2 operators now its only 1 , some operators are used more moslty for guns not even gadgets

#battle passes :

mostly  fine but not good you need to have them

#servers :
most garbage thing you ever see , there was 3 season that even on launch day you couldnt join and it takes them  20 days to actualy fix it

#casual and ranked and multi player in general :

casual are now full of try hards , toixc people , team kills and the list goes one , people dont know what even fun is , there are all win hungry people , you would say now days are most games like this because real losers started palying more games now it nearly kiled the game now for casual and older gamers who dont care about winning in videos game now because you know what, its a freaking video game, ranked was better back then but now is even more toxic  and more try harding then ever with ranked 2 , ranked2 is more like grind rather than a ranked match , becasue there is somthing called hidden mmr that you cant see, now you copper macthes are even sweatier than a plat match back then lol , the amount of cheaters is just too much and the developers wont change it, they update it but next pacth is just the same story.

for last im going to say that if im going to play this game after this review , it is because for my friend who want paly this games some times other than that it not a enjoyable experience you would like to be . wanna try it ? i would say sure give it a try why not if you realy want try this game but dont make it your main game after bad day at work or anything , but for the veterns palyert who still paly this game , my friend this game isnt worth playing solo anymore , quit it or play dont play toomuch , i fell you you say this is a unique game thats there are no game like it, yes but it is shame that is like this now , but i wish a similar game like this come out and we  can mvoe on lol , i still have hope for ready or not multi player mode .

By the end of the week i had 24 hours on this game. This was awesome for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to not spend time with my dad, i would have to always go out with my friends or just watching YouTube. So my dad decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if he could maybe play alongside me. He loaded into the game, picked his character and started playing but was stuck on what you where supposed to do. My dad (boomer) asked me for help so (forced) i hosted a game for him to join. I hated it as it was the worst time I had spent with my dad since my mom had died. This game has since brought me and my dad further apart (he is trash) now he wants to hang out outside of the house.

Rainbow Six Siege isn't just a game; it's an experience that reshaped my perspective on gaming and left an indelible mark on my life. From the moment I delved into its intricate world of tactical gameplay, I knew I had stumbled upon something truly extraordinary. Ubisoft's masterpiece isn't merely a run-of-the-mill shooter; it's a meticulously crafted symphony of strategy, teamwork, and adrenaline-pumping action that has redefined the very essence of competitive gaming.

One of the most profound ways Rainbow Six Siege has impacted my life is through its emphasis on teamwork and communication. Unlike many other games where individual prowess reigns supreme, Siege teaches you that success hinges on collaboration and synergy with your teammates. Through countless hours spent coordinating strategies, devising intricate plans, and executing them flawlessly, I learned invaluable lessons in leadership, adaptability, and effective communication. These skills have not only enhanced my gaming experience but have also transcended into my personal and professional life, making me a more effective team player and leader in various aspects of life.

Furthermore, Rainbow Six Siege's dynamic gameplay constantly challenges players to think on their feet and devise creative solutions to overcome obstacles. Whether it's breaching a fortified objective, defending against a relentless assault, or outsmarting opponents in a tense standoff, every match presents a unique set of challenges that demand strategic thinking and quick decision-making. This constant mental stimulation has sharpened my cognitive abilities, improved my problem-solving skills, and instilled in me a sense of resilience and determination that extends far beyond the virtual battlefield.

Moreover, the Rainbow Six Siege community is unlike any other I've encountered in gaming. It's a diverse melting pot of players from all walks of life, united by their passion for tactical gameplay and shared experiences. Whether it's forming lasting friendships with fellow operators, engaging in spirited debates about strategies and tactics, or simply reveling in the thrill of victory together, the sense of camaraderie fostered within the Siege community is truly unparalleled. Through interactions with my fellow players, I've forged connections that have enriched my life and expanded my horizons in ways I never thought possible.

In conclusion, Rainbow Six Siege isn't just a game; it's a transformative experience that has left an indelible mark on my life. Through its emphasis on teamwork, strategic gameplay, and vibrant community, Siege has not only provided endless hours of entertainment but has also empowered me with invaluable life lessons and meaningful connections. For me, and countless others, Rainbow Six Siege isn't just the best game ever made; it's a lifestyle, a passion, and a testament to the incredible impact that gaming can have on our lives.",1682201221,1708308595,True,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

- Operation Health was the start of the downfall. Nothing good was fixed, and only created more issues.
- Operator hitboxes have been up and down over the last couple of years, but for the most part, have been fixed, but still can be insanely buggy.
- To be good, you used to have to learn strategies that would give you the edge on the other team. Now its a TDM meta, so its better to rush corners or fast peak. Ex: If your holding an angle and someone swings you, you have half a second less time to react then they do. At higher levels, especially on PC, this makes it nearly impossible for you to win the gunfight. 
- Operator pool is very very diluted. All Ubi cares about is money, so they just make new ops that make other ops gadgets and guns useless. 
- Competitive play requires minimal skill to achieve higher ranks. It is all about grinding and who plays the most during that season. On top of that, when reset, you can play about 20 games until you lose and gain same mmr per match, but since you start in copper, you will be like silver by the time the game starts putting you against the players you were playing in Plat or Diamond last season.
- Gamemodes suck, they ruined cas by making less prep phase which is a huge disadvantage for many different operators on defense. It also doesn't help new players at all because it teaches them bad placement for reinforcements, barricades, etc. 

Thats pretty much it. The fact that I spent a whopping 5 minutes writing this review just goes to show how bad this game has become. I could have actually spent more time on this and gone into things more in detail, but I don't really have the patience. 

All in all, don't waste your money on this terrible Ubi game unless you are just buying it to play with friends and have fun in random game modes.

Servers are crashing every day (or game), there is no way to enjoy it.  

Server crashes, you are back to lobby pressing to reconnect like fucking idiot and it is unable to reconnect and then you get banned to 2days for not your fault. But if you try reaching support even if they answer after a month they will say there is nothing they can do, so you just have to wait until ban passes and then you thing you can finally enjoy it but after two games same shit will happend...

Некоторые ,, Бывалые Геймеры,, сравнивают ,,Радугу,, c CS:GO, то есть сравнивают два абсолютно разных мира. Единственное сходство у обеих игр так это то, что они комнандные шутеры и шутеры от первого лица.

Плюсы

1. Разнообразие оперативников. У нас на выбор есть 26 оперативников, 13 атакующих и 13 обороняющихся. Каждый оперативник имеет свою особую способность. Один имеет ручной гранатомёт, а другой способен улавливать пульс человеческого сердца и знать, где находится враг. Вхашник :D

2. Множество карт. Их кол-во не заставит тебя заскучать.

3. Живой онлайн и быстрое подключение к игре. Всегда играет много людей и тебе запросто удасться подключиться к серверу.

4. Оригинальная идея игры ИМХО. Я никогда не играл в подобные шутаны. Здесь тебе нужно будет продумывать каждый свой шаг, каджое движение, как лучше? зайти через дверной проем как нормальный человек или влететь в здание через окно.

5. Звуки в игре. ПРОСТО АХРЕНИТЕЛЬНЫЕ.

Ну вот и все наиболее интересные плюсы. Можно конечно ещё отнести к ним наличие раскрасок (скинов) на оружие и оперативника, установка различных плюшек на оружие, таких как прицелы или глушители, но это все на любителя.

Минусы

1. Пинг. Это пожалуй самый большой минус, ведь для России стабильный пинг это 110-120, когда для пиндосов и Европы он 30-60. Из-за этого и происходят всякие фейлы. Со мной был случай, когда я стрелял по модельке игрока, впустил в него пуль так 10, а его просто взяло и швырануло в другую часть комнаты и он благополучно мне грохнул (на тот момент у меня был пинг 120, а у него 22)

2. Читаки. Ubisoft пытаются бороться с Читерами, в прошлой обнове ввели новый АнтиЧит и потихоньку начинают с ними бороться.

3. СПОЙЛЕР. 

НИ ПЛЮС, НИ МИНУС. БОЛЬШЕ ВСЕГО ПО ИГРЕ У МЕНЯ ГОРИТ НА ЛЮДЕЙ, КОТОРЫЕ КУПИЛИ РАДУГУ, НО ДО ЭТОГО ИГРАЛИ ТОЛЬКО В CS:GO, ОНИ С ТРУДОМ ПОНИМАЮТ, ЧТО ТАКОЕ СЛАЖЕННАЯ КОМАНДНАЯ РАБОТА, ВЕДЬ ОНИ ПРИВЫКЛИ КИДАТЬ 100500 ФЛЭШЕК И ЗАБЕГАТЬ НА ЛОНГ, ПОТОМ ИХ БЫСТРО ВЫНОСЯТ И ОНИ НАЧИНАЮТ НЫТЬ, ЧТО МОЛ, КАК ТАК ТО МЕНЯ ТАКОГО КИБЕРСПОРТСМЕНА УБИЛИ. В РАДУГЕ СИТУАЦИЯ ОДИН В ОДИН.

Порой обидно смотреть, как Юбики убивают Радугу. я отмечу этот обзор как положительный, чтобы они поняли, что в их руках действитель годная игра, которая не должна быть забытой и брошенной на просторах Стима...

Recipe:
Sticky Korean chicken wings

Ingredients

For the chicken
500g chicken wings
large chunk of ginger, finely grated
50g cornflour
vegetable oil, for frying
sesame seeds and sliced spring onion, to serve
For the sauce
6 tbsp dark brown sugar
2 tbsp gochujang (Korean chilli paste)
2 tbsp soy sauce
2 large garlic cloves, crushed
small piece ginger, grated
2 tsp sesame oil

Method

STEP 1
To make the sauce, put all the ingredients in a saucepan and simmer gently until syrupy, so around 3-4 mins. Take off the heat and set aside.

STEP 2
Season the chicken wings with salt, pepper and the grated ginger. Toss the chicken with the cornflour until completely coated.

STEP 3
Heat about 2cm of vegetable oil in a large frying pan over a medium/high heat. Fry the chicken wings for 8-10 mins until crisp, turning halfway. Remove from the oil and place on kitchen paper. Leave to cool slightly (around 2 mins).

STEP 4
Reheat the sauce, and toss the crispy chicken wings in it. Tip into a bowl and top with the sesame seeds and sliced spring onions.

Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege, a popular tactical shooter video game developed by Ubisoft, has garnered a massive player base and significant attention in the gaming community since its release in 2015. However, beneath its flashy graphics and intense gameplay lies a host of issues that make it a deeply flawed experience for many players. From toxic behavior to technical shortcomings, Rainbow Six Siege presents numerous challenges that undermine its potential as a truly enjoyable gaming experience.

One of the most glaring problems with Rainbow Six Siege is its toxic community. In online multiplayer matches, players often encounter verbal abuse, harassment, and other forms of toxic behavior from teammates and opponents alike. The game's reliance on teamwork and communication exacerbates this issue, as players are frequently subjected to criticism and hostility if they make mistakes or fail to perform up to expectations. This toxic environment not only ruins the gaming experience for many players but also drives away newcomers who may be deterred by the negativity.

Furthermore, Rainbow Six Siege suffers from numerous technical issues that hinder gameplay and frustrate players. From server outages and connectivity problems to glitches and bugs, the game is rife with technical shortcomings that disrupt matches and diminish the overall enjoyment of the experience. Frequent crashes, lag spikes, and other performance issues plague both the console and PC versions of the game, leading to widespread frustration among players who expect a smooth and seamless gaming experience.

Another significant issue with Rainbow Six Siege is its imbalanced gameplay and flawed mechanics. Despite attempts by the developers to balance the game through patches and updates, certain operators and weapons remain overpowered, while others are underpowered or underutilized. This imbalance creates an unfair playing field where certain strategies and tactics dominate, leaving little room for experimentation or creative expression. Moreover, the game's reliance on microtransactions and loot boxes to unlock new operators and cosmetics further exacerbates this issue, as players are forced to either grind for hours or spend real money to access content that should be available from the start.

In addition to its gameplay issues, Rainbow Six Siege has also been criticized for its lackluster single-player experience. While the game offers a series of solo missions and situations, they pale in comparison to the depth and complexity of the multiplayer modes. As a result, players who prefer to play alone or who lack reliable internet connections are left with a subpar gaming experience that fails to justify the game's high price tag.

Overall, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege falls short of its potential due to a myriad of issues that detract from the overall experience. From its toxic community and technical shortcomings to its imbalanced gameplay and lackluster single-player content, the game fails to deliver on the promise of tactical shooter excellence. While some players may still find enjoyment in Rainbow Six Siege despite its flaws, it's clear that significant improvements are needed to address the game's numerous shortcomings and restore faith in its long-term viability as a competitive multiplayer experience. Until then, Rainbow Six Siege will continue to struggle to maintain its relevance in an increasingly crowded gaming landscape.

Once we hit level 50 was where our downhill began, When you hit level 50 game in this game you get to play ranked which may sound fun because it gave us something to work for in this game but it was quite the opposite, every time we played we would get off and go to bed thinking about how much we lost and what we could have been doing instead of playing this dogshit of a game,  but then the next morning we would wake up and get right back on and that is one problem with this game is how addicting it is but to continue the story we would get on every night and think that there would be a different outcome but sadly it was always the same we even took long breaks from this game to get away from the depressing mental that comes with playing this game but when we came back the game was in an even worse state than before with the cheaters bad bugs and depressing game play.

At the same time its addicting when you get a kill but when you try to learn a new operator it can be a frustrating experience and playing ranked and standard is really stressful and overwhelming too due to many people one the mic pressuring you which makes you overwhelmed and do something bad in the game because of it.  Its fun with friends but again when you take this game too seriously it can really overwhelm and stress you out.

Yeah, This game isnt for me honestly its like the Dark souls of First person shooters. its only fun at times with friends but most people will take this game seriously and tell you that ""you suck"" if you have trouble learning the games mechanics.  
Oh and the matchmaking is really strange, there will be matches where one person has 8 kills in the lobby while everyone else has 2 or 3 kills.  Plus you have to be Lucky in the lobby youre in and have a bit of skill with it as well it seems. I have many bad lucks in lobbies and with  shitty team mates as well.   There are times when i gotten MVP in the lobby tho and had a decent amount of kills. 

Not to mention the cheaters this game has. I have only ran into smurfs and people who spawn kill and theyre like a dark souls boss fight at this point,  when:  some 1 in the  defending team spawn kills in this game ,when they kill you when you dont see them on your screen and when they shoot around corners and destroy every gadget your operator has. 

The game crashes and they seem to not want to improve  the quality of the game that [b]much[/b] but they'll add Transgender operators to the game tho and the devs will just say they need focus on how much ""inclusion"" and ""diversity"" the roster ""needs""...  

Pulse is a fun operator imo.  Im some sections in the map if the bombs are on 2nd floor you can just camp under there, use heartbeat scanner and if you see some one while on first floor and throw a c4 as long the floor is soft under the 2nd floor. ive gotten some epic kills with it lol.

Only play this with friends not with randoms. Just dont jump down the rabbit hole this game has. Video games are for fun and having a good time not for screaming and being mad at your friends",1617982699,1708229311,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is the epitome of, ""Let's make this really popular game as a AAA studio and call it great! Let's never fix issues that really matter and also on top of that, make it run like shit because our servers are awful!"". Never in my life have I played a video game like Rainbow Six Siege. That is a good and a bad thing. In the beginning, I really enjoyed this game, that's not to say that I still don't but I hate it now. This game is an actual Love-Hate relationship. They constantly want to add new shit without the consideration of whether the content they are releasing is actually good. Most of the time it's not. Especially now. I refuse to sit and listen to people who say there's been an upgrade over the years to this game because that's a straight up lie. Ubisoft, if you ever see this review, fuck you from the bottom of my heart. Your servers are trash. Your game runs like trash at the most random times and makes no sense. Your game refuses to operate properly when it matters most. Now I know a lot of you are thinking, ""Mouse, why are you being a little whiny bitch? Why don't you just play a good game instead?"", you'd be right in assuming these things but I still love the feel of accomplishment this game gives when I achieve new levels of skill. It's rewarding. But what isn't rewarding is the blatant neglect that these shitheads at Ubisoft show in their game. Save your money, save your time, and by all means....please save your sanity. This game is not worth the amount of stress it will give you. 

Stay safe and stay away from this game. Best wishes, Mouse.",1708225640,1708225640,False,0,0,0,2,True,False,False

游玩时长最长的游戏，最需要脑袋的FPS游戏
单单靠枪法还不够，随时走到一半，被C4炸死，被Spawn Peek。。。
无数次的死亡，才在500多小时后才抓住这游戏的一点点基础
玩到今天，打了无数次Rank，从赢一场就可以上到Plat，到连续输到silver，又奇迹般的连续赢到Plat
对，这游戏就是那么的神奇，这游戏也陪伴我走了很久
已经退游的我，也不知道这游戏现在是什么样子，真的真的很怀恋以前一起和朋友游玩的时光
5年不简单，完完全全可以改变一个人的性格，这游戏也教导我输赢不重要，最主要的是过程
太在意输赢，就把情绪也栽了下去，输了游戏，输了朋友，完全不划算
为了这游戏，疯狂的练枪法，疯狂的刷AI，season pass 全部都买下去，想回去真的很疯狂
现在真的没有时间玩回去了，只能看回去以前的种种精华，各种秀操作，甩枪爆头，第一次参加比赛，还能赢下一场
这游戏是真的真的很推荐，在我心目中已经不是一款游戏，比较像。。。回忆。。。吧",1708225329,1708225329,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Playing Rainbow Six Siege, like any video game, can have various effects on an individual's mental well-being. It's important to note that these effects can vary from person to person, and many players engage with the game without experiencing negative mental side effects. However, here are some potential aspects to consider:

Stress and Pressure: Rainbow Six Siege is a tactical first-person shooter that requires quick thinking, strategic planning, and precise execution. The intense nature of the gameplay can lead to stress and pressure, especially during high-stakes moments. Some players may find this exhilarating, while others may feel overwhelmed.

Frustration and Anger: The competitive nature of Rainbow Six Siege can lead to frustration and anger, particularly when facing challenging opponents, experiencing in-game losses, or encountering perceived unfairness. This emotional response can impact one's mood and overall mental state.

Communication Skills: The game heavily emphasizes communication and teamwork. Positive interactions with teammates can enhance communication skills and foster a sense of camaraderie. On the other hand, negative experiences with toxic players or a lack of effective communication can have detrimental effects on mental well-being.

Concentration and Focus: Success in Rainbow Six Siege often requires a high level of concentration and focus. Extended gaming sessions without breaks may lead to mental fatigue, affecting cognitive performance both in-game and in other areas of life.

Social Isolation: While Rainbow Six Siege offers opportunities for social interaction through online multiplayer, excessive gaming can contribute to social isolation if it leads to neglect of real-world relationships or responsibilities.

It's essential for players to be mindful of their gaming habits and how they impact their mental health. Setting reasonable time limits, taking breaks, maintaining a healthy balance between gaming and other activities, and being aware of emotional responses during gameplay are crucial steps to mitigate potential negative effects.

If individuals find that their gaming habits are negatively impacting their mental well-being, seeking support from friends, family, or mental health professionals is advisable. Additionally, taking breaks, practicing self-care, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle are essential for overall mental health, regardless of one's engagement with video games.

Hey there, fellow gamers! If you're into heart-pounding action and strategic gameplay, then you've got to check out Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six. Developed by Ubisoft, this game is all about putting your tactical skills to the test in intense counter-terrorism operations.

When you dive into Rainbow Six, get ready to step into the boots of elite operatives from around the world. You'll be taking on missions that require serious planning and teamwork. Seriously, communication is key here – whether you're coordinating your breach points or covering your teammate's back, you'll need to work together to come out on top.

One of the coolest things about Rainbow Six is the environmental destruction. Seriously, you can blow holes in walls, blast through floors – you name it. It adds a whole new layer of strategy to the game, letting you get creative with your approach to each mission.

And let's talk about the visuals and sound. The game looks amazing, with detailed environments that really draw you in. And the sound design? It's top-notch. Every gunshot and footstep adds to the tension, keeping you on the edge of your seat.

Now, I know what you're thinking – what about the story? Well, while Rainbow Six is mostly focused on multiplayer, the single-player campaign still delivers. It's all about sacrifice, heroism, and the high-stakes world of counter-terrorism.

And speaking of multiplayer, there's plenty of replayability here. Whether you're diving into ranked matches or just goofing around in casual play, there's always a new challenge waiting for you.

So, if you're looking for a game that'll get your adrenaline pumping and your brain working overtime, look no further than Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six. Trust me, you won't be disappointed. thanks chatgpt for the review

Gameplay Mechanics:
Rainbow Six Siege is renowned for its strategic depth and teamwork-centric gameplay. The emphasis on tactics, communication, and environmental destruction sets it apart from other shooters. The diverse roster of Operators with unique abilities adds complexity and variety to matches. However, the steep learning curve may alienate some newcomers, as mastering maps, operators, and strategies requires time and patience.

Graphics and Audio:
The game boasts detailed environments and realistic sound design, enhancing immersion and tactical awareness. Visuals are crisp, and the attention to detail in character models and weapon design is commendable. The audio cues play a crucial role in gameplay, alerting players to approaching enemies or environmental hazards.

Content and Updates:
Ubisoft has been consistent in providing post-launch support through regular updates, including new Operators, maps, and gameplay tweaks. The evolving meta keeps the experience fresh, and the commitment to fixing bugs and addressing community feedback is evident. However, some players have criticized the microtransaction model for cosmetics and Operators, arguing that it can feel predatory or grind-heavy.

Community and Multiplayer Experience:
Rainbow Six Siege thrives on its vibrant community and competitive multiplayer scene. The game encourages teamwork and coordination, fostering a dedicated player base. However, toxicity and cheating remain persistent issues, impacting the overall experience for some players. Ubisoft's efforts to combat toxicity through reporting systems and bans have seen mixed success.

Single-player and PVE Content:
While Rainbow Six Siege primarily focuses on multiplayer, it offers limited single-player and PVE content through situations and terrorist hunt modes. While these modes can be enjoyable for practice or casual play, they lack the depth and longevity of the multiplayer experience.

In summary, Rainbow Six Siege offers a unique and engaging tactical shooter experience with deep gameplay mechanics, frequent updates, and a dedicated community. However, its steep learning curve, microtransactions, and ongoing issues with toxicity may deter some players. Ultimately, its appeal hinges on a player's preference for strategic gameplay and willingness to invest time into mastering its intricacies.",1708200096,1708200096,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False

However it seems that Ubisoft invests all of their resources to screw up this game season by season instead of improving it. The servers are atrocious, cheating is rampant, technical support is non existent, optimisation is a missing word from the developer's vocabulary. My breaking point was when I was simply kicked out from a match and the game deleted the session information so I couldn't even rejoin to the ongoing match and got the loss penalty.

Eventhough I purchased this game at sale I feel offended about the current status of this game.

edit: game is even worse, 20% of the players cheat, legit players are leaving in droves, servers suck still, lag is regular, sometimes upto half a second. you get bans because their servers kick you. the game is probably dying, if you dont already own this game, buying it now is pointless. check out ready or not, its buggy, but still better than seige these days. game has just lost its realitic tactical identy and is basically a sweaty cod wanna be now. anywhoo, heres my rant from a few years ago. enjoy!

this game has gotten so shit... im constantly put into lobbies way above my skill set, the server lag since the new season is constantly over 100ms, they boasted about finally getting a handle on the cheating problem that plagues pc but i feel like i have ran into a couple within the first week, ive been in every single catagory of your reputation system in the first 3 days... how do i go from the worse catagory, to the best, to the second worse and then second best... like where the fuck do i stand in your standards?

ubisoft, you promised us a ten year game, i gave you my money because of that promise, and since year two its been more skins than fixing your broken battle eye shit. im so done with you ubi, you can suck my dick. that ready or not game looks bad fucking ass, and its not ubishit. how does some barely known  dev with 6 years of experience do better than industry vet of 36 fucking years. ive been playing siege longer than Void interactive has existed. i just dont understand how ubi got to this shitty as point that they cant be bothered to fix one of their biggest fucking ongoing projects/games.

the 8 year old version of me from 1999 would have never imagined a game company that made classics like rayman 2, splinter cell or any tom clancy game could fall this far. next payday im buying ready or not and supporting a company that may not do any better, but at the same time hasnt let me down for the last half decade...",1582448207,1708079877,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

I'd wish the aspects the game once had can regain to even improve on, and even maybe make a R6 (second version of the game yet I doubt the devs would ever attempt that) in order to restore the unique status it has and represent the concept of what it is to play the match (whether like the definition of siege is, or even a chess match on strategies). 

Lastly my opinion wouldn't matter, I did the effort to at least state the flaws this game unfortunately is plagued with. I recommend a different game otherwise it'll become a addiction/feeling to requirement and unnecessary stress.

The only 2 problems are that on Ranked mode, there's a TON of hackers (filled to the brim with them), so... good luck winning anything when the other team can see through walls and can kill you on one shot to the head without you even being able to retaliate. The other issue are the servers themselves which are trash. It sometimes kicks you out of a match because of an ""error"" and then ban you for it. Or sometimes it will just not allow you to get in a match with the rest of your team and then ban you because of it and there's nothing you can do.

In short, the game is good as long as you stay away from the Ranked and ""Standard"" modes since there are a lot of hackers there and the servers are buggy as hell.

Though this game was really fun and simple in newcomer playlist, it isn't quite like that when you go try ranked the first time at level 50. Here are some (probably all) of the possibilities you might encounter (unless ur smurfing duh):
1. Get called out ""Oh my god we got a level 50 in our team :///""
2. Gets 360 headshotted (players under Y6 would probably die immediately because friendly fire is already on during prep phase back then) by your own tm8 while reinforcing walls (which was supposed to be rotations walls). Oh yea and especially next to a mira window you should try that (not recommended)
3. Get shot directly after spawning (it's called a spawnpeek duh)
4. You might think ur doing the right thing, but NO the 4.5 K/D ex-Diamond level 250 with 1297207 hrs playtime on ur team will always yell at you when your not playing according to what they want you to play. You are also forced to use a specific operator which u might not have unlocked yet because you're new (except u have a CEO daddy and a model mommy).
5. If you happen to be a female wanting to play casually, REFUND THE GAME IMMEDIATELY, orr you can go play against bots and quick matches which have more chill players. But if you're good then maybe that's okay just don't reveal ur self or even use ur mic.
6. The urge to punch your gaming accessories is very high every ranked game and increases by 10% chance after every rank up

Good luck new players !!! ;)",1669310863,1708058963,True,1,0,0.522058844566345215,0,True,False,False

Cheap weekend is hacker weekend. If you get banned by mistake ubi doesn't care the support just has a pre-script written out about how they don't give an F about you coz you're just a number. 

They used to do 1 map + 4 new weapons + 2 operators now it's 1 map rework, 1 operator, no guns and they charge full price for a season pass which is not even half the content. Every season that comes out is buggier and buggier somehow, honestly feels like the skeleton crew. 

I used to love this game but even since the original devs left they ruined it. Bugs with shields have been in the game since year 1, they're changing/reworking now but the devs don't understand why they're bad in the first place so they're buffing them in other ways instead of asking the community what they'd like to see/implemented. 

They're removing old mechanics in the game which made the game fun/unique like a character used to have a unique interaction with another character (Ela + Zofia) but the devs dumb the game down so it's TDM meta turn your brain off and shoot the enemy after everyone complained about the game being ""Too heavily gadget meta"" which is what the game is meant to be about. 

Dev's combine old characters to make new characters instead of coming up with something unique that people have been asking for they're trying to hit a ""100 charters"" in the game but when they're combining 2 chracters to make 1 and then just giving it to the other side attack or defence yeah very boring.

Dev's when they ""Fix"" it is not an indefinite fix, bugs either come back because they're not patched properly, mechanics like drop shooting gets removed which is a good thing but you can still do it instead of entirely outright removing as it should be. Honestly with this game being one of Ubisofts top games besides being addictive tacticle shooter there is nothing going for it anymore.

My final review score is 4/10 - DO NOT PLAY, HEAVILY AVOID AND DO NOT LISTEN TO ANYONE ELSE TRUST.

The movement is a bit slow, it's very tactical game (i mean there's a lot to learn even if your aim is kinda descent) also there's a lot to grind if you are just starting now so get ready.

- You have to buy the battle pass if you want some cool skins
- Lots to grind
- Not a really casual game

Developed by Ubisoft Montreal, this game takes the beloved Tom Clancy franchise to new heights with its intense and strategic gameplay.

Gameplay (10/10):
The heart and soul of R6 Siege lie in its unparalleled gameplay. Set in various real-world locations, players assume the roles of elite counter-terrorism operators, each with a unique set of skills and gadgets. The game focuses on close-quarters combat, destructible environments, and strategic decision-making. Matches are 5v5, emphasizing teamwork, communication, and precise execution of plans.

The diverse roster of operators, divided into different CTU (Counter Terrorism Unit) factions, brings a refreshing variety to gameplay. Whether you prefer breaching walls with Sledge, setting traps with Frost, or gathering intel with Valkyrie, there's an operator that suits every playstyle. The constant addition of new operators and maps through seasonal updates keeps the game fresh and ensures a dynamic experience for both newcomers and seasoned players.

Realistic and Destructible Environments (9/10):
Rainbow Six Siege is renowned for its realistic and destructible environments. Almost every surface in the game is destructible, allowing for creative and unexpected strategies. Reinforce walls, breach through floors, and create sightlines that give your team the upper hand. The destruction adds an extra layer of depth to the tactical aspects of the game, making every match feel dynamic and unpredictable.

Graphics and Sound (8/10):
While not the most visually stunning game in its genre, R6 Siege boasts realistic character models, detailed maps, and impressive lighting effects. The audio design is exceptional, with distinct sounds for footsteps, gunfire, and environmental cues. The sound plays a crucial role in gameplay, as being able to identify enemy movements or gadget deployment can be the difference between success and failure.

Learning Curve (7/10):
R6 Siege has a steep learning curve, and new players may find themselves overwhelmed initially. The intricate map layouts, diverse operators, and strategic nuances can be challenging to grasp. However, this learning curve contributes to the game's long-term appeal, rewarding players who invest time in honing their skills and understanding the intricacies of each operator and map.

Community and Esports (10/10):
Rainbow Six Siege has cultivated a dedicated and passionate community. Regular updates, balance changes, and a commitment to esports have kept the player base engaged. The Pro League and major tournaments showcase high-level gameplay and strategies, inspiring players to improve and adopt advanced tactics.

Conclusion:
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a must-buy for fans of tactical shooters and those seeking a competitive multiplayer experience. Its deep and strategic gameplay, combined with a constantly evolving roster of operators and maps, ensures that no two matches are alike. While the learning curve may be steep, the reward is an unparalleled sense of accomplishment as you master the art of siege warfare. With a thriving community and a commitment to ongoing support from Ubisoft, Rainbow Six Siege continues to be a top-tier multiplayer experience years after its initial release.",1707940821,1707940821,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

This is the game for you, Rainbow Six Siege is a enticingly enraging game.

You will constantly be about an inch away from either not taking a shower for a week and becoming good at the game, or punching your monitor because your teammates are as aware as a toster, and have the reaction time of a snail, as well as the aim and recoil control of a baby holding an M249 LMG.

If all of that sounds enticing and like a game youd like to play, I would recommend you also look into mental therapy and time management.. Don't even get me started on the ranking system and how to unlock it.

I've played this game for a long time, and there's still too many bugs after Four years for me to write a perfect review. This game is good. It's a tactical first-person shooter, and it's unique. It's a fun great game up until you encounter many of the bugs that have been in the game since year one. Between the Massive amount of game-breaking bugs, and audio bugs, which have been around for a very long time, i can't put a good review up. Ubisoft doesn't listen to their players. They decide what they want to do with the game themselves. They show close to no support for the player community and it's breathtaking how a game can become so big, yet give such an unpolished performance. That's not to say this game isn't worth your time, it very much is just that. worth your time if this is what you're in to. It's just very frustrating how simple bugs have never been fixed or worked with, yet the whole community complains about them.

EDIT!: After another 781 hours to be exact, and somewhere about 5 years later, i have come back to the game and it seems that most of the small annoying bugs have been fixed finally after all these years! ",1588387562,1707875447,True,0,0,0.576950311660766602,3,True,False,False

for starters i wanna say Congrats on the success. definitely not an easy task to have a shooter for almost a decade and still have a consistent fan base.   

absolute pleasure to have played your game for so long and for more to come.
zero regrets on any purchase or micro transaction. Happy to have contributed to the success of a fantastic game. 

as an Xbox player i don't run into hackers like PC but i'm sure there has been Cronus somewhere along the way.

good work on the new training modes and AI opponents definitely something to aid new players.
(cant wait to see the evolution of siege AI)

extra/event game modes definitely add to the experience of siege. after playing this game for almost 9 years its nice to have something fresh and temporary mixed with the ever changing meta, on top of new ops/maps.

i would love to see some new throwable's/oneshots, trophy system for attackers (new op, 2 ADS like jager, too much have i been spammed with impacts on attack)

From its inception, the game has continually evolved, refining its mechanics, expanding its content, and fostering a thriving community that remains deeply committed to its success.

At the heart of Rainbow Six Siege's appeal lies its emphasis on teamwork and communication. Unlike traditional shooters where individual prowess often reigns supreme, Siege places a premium on coordination and cooperation among teammates. Whether you're breaching a reinforced wall, coordinating a hostage rescue, or defending an objective from enemy incursions, success in Siege hinges on effective collaboration and synergy with your squadmates.

One of the game's most defining features is its diverse roster of operators, each equipped with unique gadgets, weapons, and abilities. From elite counter-terrorism units to rogue operatives, the operators in Siege offer a wealth of tactical options and strategic possibilities. Whether you prefer the stealthy reconnaissance of Valkyrie, the explosive breaching power of Ash, or the gadget manipulation of Thatcher, there's an operator to suit every playstyle and preference.

The depth of Siege's gameplay extends beyond its diverse operator roster to its meticulously crafted maps and environments. Each map presents its own set of challenges and opportunities, from multi-level structures to open-air courtyards, forcing players to adapt their tactics and strategies on the fly. Whether you're navigating the tight corridors of the Hereford Base or battling amidst the chaotic streets of Favela, every map in Siege offers a unique and immersive gameplay experience.

In addition to its engaging multiplayer modes, Siege also features a robust single-player experience through its Terrorist Hunt mode and Situations missions. These solo and cooperative challenges offer players the opportunity to hone their skills, familiarize themselves with the game's mechanics, and earn rewards to unlock new operators and gear. Whether you're a seasoned veteran looking to sharpen your skills or a newcomer seeking to learn the ropes, Siege provides ample opportunities for both.

Furthermore, Rainbow Six Siege has cultivated a passionate and dedicated community that continues to drive the game's growth and longevity. From pro players and content creators to casual enthusiasts, the Siege community is united by a shared passion for tactical gameplay and competitive camaraderie. Whether it's sharing strategies, discussing balance changes, or simply celebrating epic moments, the Siege community serves as a vibrant hub of activity and engagement.

The game's developer, Ubisoft Montreal, deserves praise for its ongoing commitment to supporting and expanding Rainbow Six Siege. Since its launch in 2015, the game has received regular updates, patches, and content drops, introducing new operators, maps, modes, and quality-of-life improvements. This dedication to post-launch support has not only kept the game fresh and exciting but also fostered a sense of trust and goodwill among the player base.

Moreover, Siege's esports scene has flourished, with the game becoming a staple of the competitive gaming circuit. From major tournaments like the Six Invitational to grassroots community events, Siege esports offer thrilling spectacles of skill, strategy, and teamwork. The game's emphasis on tactical depth and dynamic gameplay lends itself well to competitive play, making it a favorite among both players and spectators alike.

Beyond its gameplay mechanics and competitive scene, Rainbow Six Siege has also made strides in promoting diversity and inclusion within the gaming community. The game features a diverse cast of operators representing a wide range of nationalities, backgrounds, and identities. Furthermore, Ubisoft has taken steps to address issues of toxicity and harassment within the community, implementing measures to promote a more welcoming and inclusive environment for all players.

In terms of technical prowess, Rainbow Six Siege continues to impress with its stunning visuals, immersive sound design, and smooth gameplay mechanics. From the intricate details of its destructible environments to the visceral impact of its weapons and explosions, Siege delivers a sensory experience that is both exhilarating and immersive. Whether you're navigating the chaos of a firefight or executing a meticulously planned breach, every moment in Siege feels intense and impactful.

The game's longevity is further bolstered by its robust progression system, which rewards players with experience points, renown, and in-game currency for their achievements and contributions. Whether you're winning matches, completing challenges, or participating in events, there are always new rewards to unlock, operators to recruit, and gear to customize. This sense of progression and personalization adds depth and replay value to Siege, keeping players invested in the long term.

Furthermore, Rainbow Six Siege has proven itself to be a pioneer in the realm of live-service gaming, setting a new standard for ongoing support and content delivery. Through its seasonal updates, themed events, and limited-time modes, Siege provides a steady stream of new content and experiences to keep players engaged and entertained. Whether it's introducing new operators, balancing gameplay mechanics, or overhauling maps, Ubisoft remains committed to evolving and improving Siege for years to come.

In addition to its multiplayer offerings, Siege also boasts a robust suite of community tools and features that empower players to create, share, and discover content. From custom game modes and player-created maps to fan-made artwork and videos, the Siege community is a treasure trove of creativity and innovation. Whether you're looking to showcase your skills, collaborate with fellow players, or simply find inspiration, there's no shortage of ways to get involved and make your mark in Siege.

Another key strength of Rainbow Six Siege is its accessibility and inclusivity, with options and features designed to accommodate players of all skill levels and abilities. Whether you're a seasoned veteran or a newcomer to the genre, Siege offers a range of tutorials, guides, and matchmaking options to help you get started and improve your skills. From casual playlists and newcomer playlists to ranked matches and custom games, there's a mode for every level of player to enjoy.

Moreover, Siege's commitment to player feedback and community engagement sets it apart as a developer that truly listens to its audience. Through forums, social media channels, and live streams, Ubisoft Montreal maintains an open dialogue with the player base, soliciting feedback, addressing concerns, and sharing insights into the game's development process. This transparent and collaborative approach fosters a sense of trust and partnership between the developers and the community, ensuring that Siege continues to evolve in response to player needs and preferences.

Furthermore, Rainbow Six Siege serves as a testament to the power of collaboration and cross-platform play, bringing together players from diverse backgrounds and platforms to share in the thrill of tactical combat. Whether you're playing on PC, console, or even mobile devices, Siege offers seamless cross-platform functionality, allowing players to connect and compete with friends and rivals across different platforms and ecosystems. This inclusivity and accessibility further strengthen the game's community and ensure that everyone has the opportunity to participate and enjoy the experience.",1707442300,1707851720,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

Listen up, operators! I've had enough of this nonsense. We didn't sign up for Rainbow Six Siege to be a bunch of pushovers. We're not here to bow down to the opposition and let them trample all over us. No more excuses, no more half-hearted attempts. It's time we get our act together, and I mean right now! I'm sick and tired of seeing us fall short, game after game. We didn't pick up our weapons and don these uniforms to become the laughingstock of this operation. The enemy thinks they've got us figured out, that we're an easy target. Well, I've got news for them – we're not going down without a fight, and it's about time we show them what we're made of. I want every single one of you to dig deep and find that fighting spirit within you. This is not a stroll in the damn park; this is a battlefield, and we're here to win. No more playing nice, no more second-guessing. It's time to channel that anger, that frustration, into a force to be reckoned with. Our tactics have become predictable, our strategies stale. We need to shake things up, catch them off guard. The element of surprise is our best friend, and it's time we make the enemy question their every move.And don't even get me started on communication! We're a team, damn it! If you see something, say something. We're not mind readers, and I won't tolerate anyone keeping crucial information to themselves. This is a fight for survival, and we survive by working together.I don't want to hear any more excuses about bad luck or tough opponents. We are the toughest sons of guns in this operation, and it's high time we start acting like it. We didn't join Rainbow Six Siege to be mediocre; we joined to be the best. So, let's strap in, gear up, and let the anger in our hearts propel us to victory.Get out there, show them what it means to mess with BikerKing and the baddest team Rainbow has ever seen!

DECEMBER 2023. I have a 15 day Ban for ""botting"". I'm a cheater now, apparently. Ubisoft won't reply to my ticket. Absolutely dreadful company! 4k hours, having bought 2 elite skins and several game passes, and they treat players like this!!!!

Now you get 24 hour ban for abandoning too many times. It's Ubisoft's fault for players always getting kicked from match and they get error trying to rejoin, then they faced with a lovely ban. Its a stupid and toxic move by Ubisoft. Now you can vote if a player is being toxic in chat, leading to a mute. Great idea, but a 4 stack of toxic players have the power to vote against one person, team kill all match, and that victim gets muted instead. Rethink!

-It is one of the best competitive shooters of all time. 
That's about it, honestly. 

Cons:
-Literally you will have the most toxic interactions with people almost every match. Your teammates all went and died in the first 45 seconds of the round? Get ready to be backseat gamed the entirety of that round and be told how stupid any decision you make is. Make head holes instead of foot holes? You probably should have been aborted. 
-Bullets come out of your forehead on this game, so you put your head against the wall and hold ridiculous peeks no one will ever be able to defend against. It's not fun gameplay.
-The Map and Operator bans in ranked make the game stale. You can play for 3 hours and you'll play the same 3-4 maps on repeat with the exact same 4-6 operators banned. 
-Cheating is RAMPANT in higher ranked lobbies. Get ready to get tracked through walls constantly. 
-Speaking of cheating: Say you get into a ranked game or standard match and there's a cheater on your team or the other team. That's 30+ minutes of your life lost because you're teammates won't surrender because they ""want to beat the cheater"" for whatever stupid reason, and if you leave you get banned. 
-I have a billion hours in this game, and I don't have all the operators unlocked. I took quite a break, but I have well over 100 since I've been back and I still am missing 3-4 of the new ones.

Bad teammates that absolutely spit on you on every step of the way and can't seem to have developed more than a 10th of their brain cells, being boked all the time by unbelievabilities (secret angles, unbelivable luck, mental issues, small peepee ppl that get you though your back in the most insane moments and unnatainable skill), everything is kinda grayish and you will get disappointed 90% of the time. has its sactifactory moments and can be fun if played with friends (doing it by yourself can be nice if you had a bad day and win your first 2 matches with a decent amount of kills). Gameplay is decent and, after learning the fundamentals, it becomes a new kind of grind, for anything you want in the game. Overall, it is a game that will supply you with fun, disappointment, excitement, anger, confusion and that feeling of no matter how hard you try, you just cqan not grow and suceed (just like real life).

The number ONE (PROBLEM) about this game is (>>>SERVER<<<) every new season that comes in you have to face this problem (SERVER ERROR) again and again and AGAIN!! (NOT JOKING)!!! you have to wait 2 weeks or One month if you lucky 1 week but no no no don't be happy yet!! if there have a small! even the small update in this multiverse! you highly gonna face a same problem (depend on your luck) you most think i'm joking right! haha don't believe me go to google and type (Ubisoft server) and go to images... + if you decide to play this game and you want to face this problem fine...and you have to face a new problem (skin reset) yeah. Every time you load in this game if there have the server problem your skin well reset (not gone) you have to put your skin one by one... just imagine this if there have 200 hero/operator and you have every skin on your all hero/operator you have equip one by one (this is also depend on your luck)

Number 2 ( Tactical ) if you read about this game is about how tactical this game is... (this the only one reason why i play this game) more and more this game become fortnite.. there add more stupid think and they throw out all the good sh#t genuinely there throw all the good think out!! the think that people really like!! 

Number 3 (Uplay apps) you cannot run the game without the apps and the best think about this apps is nothing it not good and it not bad maybe... if have a friends that play this game you have to intv them by this apps (Uplay) sometime you cannot see your friends online and cannot intv them (sometime) for me too many time already 

The last one (Rank) i don't know why their decide to change the rank system.. the low level rank can play with highest rank.... it so stupid!!!!!!! just imagine this you new to the game, you just start to play, lead about this game and you play online co-op your first rank...your opponent is the most sweaty highest rank in this game!! is just stupid! fyi it not only in rank...casual game also and also your random teammate 78% useless!... if you get random teammate highest rank...it fake sometime there have booster player... there show highest rank but play like (dogwater) this is what we call fake cham...(this is also depend on your luck) sometime maybe sh#t, sometime maybe good.

that all ty (DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME)

To begin with, visually it looks fantastic since the graphics are incredible and it is very pleasant to see the level of detail that exists in the maps to the point of placing everything that a house, restaurant, plane, etc. has in real life.

Another thing that I loved is the gameplay, since even after 7 years since its launch, not a single game has come out that is similar to it, in Rainbow Six you can destroy walls, reinforce them so that they do not break them, place traps and have a very tactical gameplay where you have to know how to position yourself and even with all this the truth is that the game is very fun.... in the rest within the gameplay it has everything that a hero-shooter can have, where each character has his own weapons (which you can customize like in COD) and his own abilities, only here there are no famous ""Ultis"" with the novelty that in this game all the characters are humans from different countries, not like in other games where There are also robotic characters or even science fiction animals and beings.

The game, even despite the time it has been on the market, continues to be constantly updated, adding new characters, battle passes, maps, etc.

Maybe the only bad thing I've seen is that its community is quite toxic... if you make a small mistake there are players who even kill you in the next round because of the anger you caused them (and not just a mistake, if for any reason If you make them angry, they can kill you or report you).

It also has a very disastrous anti-cheat system and that ruins the playability of some players, much more so in ranks.

In short, a highly recommended game in case you don't like other hero-shooters like Valorant or Overwtach.... or if you are simply interested in something more competitive.",1707718581,1707718581,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
