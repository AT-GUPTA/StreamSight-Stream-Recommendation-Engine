I didn't play original Mafia, the only game from Mafia trilogy that i actually played is the Mafia II, long time ago. When i saw they made a reboot I coudn't resist, sure i buy the game on sale and didn't know what to expect but darn it, it is amazing game. Sure it has some of the problem like linear gameplay which doesn't really give you possibility of chosing how you want to end game. It would be nice if the gameplay is more fluid, open world like and that you have options, instead you must go by the script. 

Story is what is the best selling point of this game, at least to me it is well done, voice actors did a splendid job, and you had feeling like you are there, like it is real. Combat system is little clunky but still nicely done, it has realism, you dont need to spend entire clip by shoting your foe to head to die, one hit in head kill enemy. Driving, many similar games have big problems with driving, and they nailed it. You can feel the car and it is little bit harder then in GTA but its darn more realistic especially for cars from 1920-1930 era. You cannot expect fast acceleration on them but they act as they should, especially when there is rain. Overall fantastic game. It should be longer, more missions, side missions but it is okay as it is. I hope one day that if Mafia 4 is done, it will be done properly but still i am glad i played it. Do i recommend Mafia: Definitive Edition. YES!! If you play original, you will not be dissapointed by reboot version. If you don't want to buy it at full price, buy at sale and try, it is great.

Hangar 13 has masterfully breathed new life into the Mafia franchise, creating a visually stunning and emotionally charged experience that captivates both longtime fans and newcomers alike. The first thing that strikes players is the jaw-dropping visual overhaul. The meticulously recreated city of Lost Heaven is a testament to the developers' dedication to authenticity. From the smoky jazz clubs to the rain-soaked streets, every detail exudes the atmosphere of the Prohibition era. The character models are exceptionally well-crafted, and the facial animations convey a level of emotion that draws players into the narrative with unprecedented immersion. The narrative, while faithful to the original, has been expanded and enhanced to provide a deeper understanding of the characters and their motivations. Tommy Angelo's evolution from a cab driver to a reluctant member of the Salieri crime family is portrayed with nuance and authenticity. The voice acting is top-notch, with the cast delivering compelling performances that elevate the story to cinematic heights.

The gameplay has also undergone a significant transformation. While the core mechanics maintain the essence of the original, the controls have been modernized to provide a smoother and more responsive experience. Gunplay feels satisfying, and the cover system adds a layer of strategy to the intense shootouts that punctuate the narrative. Driving, a pivotal aspect of the Mafia series, has been revamped, offering a more realistic and enjoyable experience with vintage cars that handle distinctively. One of the standout features of Mafia: Definitive Edition is its attention to detail in recreating the era's soundtrack. The soulful jazz tunes and orchestral pieces complement the narrative beautifully, immersing players in the ambiance of the 1930s. The combination of stellar sound design and a meticulously crafted soundtrack enhances the emotional impact of key moments throughout the game. While Mafia: Definitive Edition pays homage to its predecessor, it is not without its flaws. Some may find the pacing a bit slow at times, particularly in the early stages of the game. Additionally, the open-world elements are limited compared to contemporary sandbox games, but this is a deliberate choice to maintain the focused narrative experience.

In conclusion, Mafia: Definitive Edition is a triumph, successfully modernizing a classic while preserving the essence that made the original so beloved. It stands as a testament to the potential of remakes when handled with care and respect for the source material. Whether you're a veteran of the original or a newcomer to the world of organized crime, Mafia: Definitive Edition is a must-play for its compelling narrative, stunning visuals, and nostalgic charm.",1708525016,1708525016,True,1,0,0.525139689445495605,0,True,False,False

The story is flawless, nothing wrong with it. However, if you want to play to enjoy the story, i suggest you to play it on normal difficulty. I myself never play it in normal, only in hard and classic cuz I seek the challenges and thrill presented by Mafia II (classic), which I played long before this game was released. Sadly,  i don't got the same challenge and thrill from this game,.

The shooting mechanics are solid, although not as good as Mafia II. Unfortunately, this aspect is hindered by minimal feedback system: enemies don't get knocked back when hit and can still shoot the player. Thus, players must truly understand enemy movement patterns to shoot them without losing hp. If the player shoots other than at the head, enemies continue to shoot as if nothing happened. This is exacerbated by some enemies aggressively advancing towards the player's hiding spot, especially on hard difficulty—they are unstoppable!

The game features a fast-paced action element. However, the character animation of Tommy (the main character) is exceptionally slow, making him vulnerable to enemy attacks. As an example, it takes about 4 to 6 seconds for the player to get into and start the car's engine before being able to drive. It really suck, especially in situations where the player surrounded by the police, like in the ""Election Campaign"" chapter.

Melee combat is utterly unsatisfying; players only need to blindly press the ""Q"" button (if playing with a keyboard) until the enemy falls. If the enemy attacks, the player cannot cancel their attack, and the only response is to press the counter button.

The fuel system is poorly executed. The game NEVER tell the player about it and gas station legend in map is hard to notice. When your car ran out of gas, you have to take it to gas station to make it moving properly, otherwise it will stay like that. However, since the game never tells you about fuel system, you will think that there is a bug that makes your car broke, at least that what happened to me, it's give me a hard time till i check the community tab.

Above all, the worst aspect of the game is its level design. Despite its Mafia-style shooting, the game heavily incorporates out-of-place racing missions. However, the real issue is not the inclusion of racing segments, which are common in games like GTA, but rather the extreme difficulty and lack of enjoyment in these races.

In the Fair Play mission, especially on the classic level, players are not allowed to crash or fall behind because the two leading racers are truly unstoppable. This makes completing Fair Play nearly impossible.

In a side mission to obtain the mutagen car, players must follow a series of checkpoints in a rally. However, the checkpoint scope is very small, and some placements are misleading (the next checkpoint located behind the one just reached). Additionally, traffic in the game is also problematic. When players are required to obey traffic rules to avoid police attention, cars on the road always disrupt this, often appearing suddenly in the middle of intersections when the player is moving at high speeds.",1703756057,1708423796,False,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

[h1] Mafia: Definitive Edition [/h1]

Even though I was originally skeptical because I didn't know how the whole game would turn out... It was mainly because Mafia contained a certain moral message... A significant part of it has indeed been removed in the Definitive Edition, but it's not that catastrophic. It's probably not fair to compare the original game, created by Mr. Vávra, with today's remake, which at least has iconic Czech dabing. Although it's a bit strange to hear the same characters, but 20 years older.

[h2] Story [/h2]

I think everyone knows this story completely. The main protagonist Thomas Angelo meets Detective Norman, where he confides in him that he needs help getting his family out of the city and getting them a new identity due to events from the past days. So, Thomas begins to recount his story to Norman as a former member of the Salieri family.

In 1932, taxi driver Thomas Angelo is surprised by two mobsters, namely Paulie and Sam, as they are both chased by other mobsters from the Morello family. Sam points a gun at Tom, saying they both need to disappear quickly. This inadvertently involves Tom in a gang shootout.
After shaking off the mobsters, they go to Salieri's bar. Tom receives compensation from Mr. Salieri in the form of an envelope full of money with a message that if he needs a job for decent money, good guys like him are always welcome... And thus begins the whole story of Thomas Angelo. The original story is more or less identical, with a few deviations.

[h2] Ratings [/h2]

Ignoring certain missing things from the original game, it's an absolutely captivating game. A big plus for me is the better story of Sarah, which in the original game was quite tragic. I was also pleasantly surprised by the classic difficulty level, which I enjoyed, as well as the realistic car and motorcycle driving model.

[h1] Mafia: Definitivní edice [/h1]

I když jsem původně byl skeptický, protože jsem nevěděl, jak celá hra dopadne... Bylo to především kvůli tomu, že Mafia obsahovala určité morální poselství... Značná část z něj sice byla odstraněna v Definitivní edici, ale není to tak katastrofální. Je asi neobjektivní srovnávat původní hru, kterou vytvořil pan Vávra, s dnešním remakem, který má alespoň ikonický český dabing. Přestože je trochu zvláštní slyšet ty samé postavy, ale o 20 let starší.

[h2] Příběh [/h2]

Myslím, že tento příběh zná úplně každý. Hlavní protagonista Thomas Angelo se setká s detektivem Normanem, kde se mu svěřuje, že potřebuje pomoc dostat svou rodinu z města a získat jim novou identitu kvůli událostem z minulých dnů. Takže Thomas začne Normanovi převyprávět svůj příběh jako bývalý člen rodiny Salieriho.

V roce 1932 taxikáře Thomase Angela překvapí dva mafiáni, konkrétně Paulie a Sam, když jsou oba pronásledováni dalšími mafiány z rodiny Morello. Sam na Toma namíří pistolí s tím, že potřebují oba rychle zmizet. Tímto způsobem se Tom neúmyslně zapojil do gangsterské přestřelky.
Poté, co mafiány setřese, jedou do Salieriho baru. Tom dostane od Pana Salieriho kompenzaci ve formě obálky plné peněz s vzkazem, že pokud bude potřebovat práci za slušné peníze, tak dobrý chlap jako on je vždy vítán... A tímto začíná celý příběh Thomase Angela. Původní příběh je víceméně až na pár odchylek totožný.

[h2] Hodnocení [/h2]

Když budeme ignorovat určité chybějící věci z původní hry,  tak je to naprosto úchvatná hra. Jako velké plus beru lepší příběh Sáry, který byl v původní hře až tragický. Dost mě překvapila i klasická obtížnost, která mě bavila i realistický model řízení auta či motorek.

It was the first time playing this one, previously playing both Mafia 2 & Mafia 3. Like the other two, this one features excellent performances from its new cast, a fantastic driving model, and a beautiful and authentic city oozing with 1930's atmosphere.

It feels and sounds very authentic all though I found the accents of some of the players to be very off, yes its a small thing but still, an Italian American should sound Italian American and an Irish American should sound like an Irish American.

I enjoyed the story rich play that this franchise is famous for but I found the story mode to be very short, clocking the entire game and all its collectables in less then 10 hours and I felt like I was taking my time.

The game is so good I got sad when it ended that's how good and short it felt. I highly recommend this game if you are a fan of anything and everything to do with organised crime, the 1930's and the Mafia franchise in general. 9/10",1708340883,1708340883,True,1,0,0.524117171764373779,0,True,False,False

Set in the fictional city of Lost Heaven during the Prohibition era, this action-adventure game brings the beloved narrative, characters, and atmosphere of the original to modern platforms with a fresh coat of paint. With enhanced graphics, improved gameplay mechanics, and a faithful reimagining of the story, Mafia: Definitive Edition aims to captivate both fans of the original and newcomers alike.


GAMEPLAY (8/10):
The combat mechanics have been significantly improved from the original game, providing a satisfying and responsive third-person shooting experience. Gunfights are intense and strategic, with a cover system that adds depth to the gameplay. The realistic weapon handling contributes to the immersion, making each encounter feel impactful. The driving mechanics strike a balance between realism and accessibility, offering an enjoyable experience whether cruising through the city or engaging in high-speed pursuits.
The variety of vehicles, coupled with attention to detail in the design of the city streets, contributes to a sense of immersion in the 1930s setting. While not a fully open-world game, the semi-open world of Lost Heaven invites exploration with its detailed environments, period-appropriate landmarks and hidden collectibles.

GRAPHICS AND ATMOSPHERE (9/10):
The developers at Hangar 13 have gone to great lengths to recreate the world of Lost Heaven with meticulous attention to detail. The character models are highly detailed, showcasing realistic facial expressions and clothing textures. The environments are beautifully rendered, from the rain-soaked streets to the lavish interiors of period-appropriate buildings. Lighting and shadow effects further enhance the visual fidelity, creating a visually stunning experience that captivates players from start to finish. The graphical overhaul is particularly evident in the cityscape, with improved textures, dynamic weather effects, and a level of realism that was unimaginable in the original 2002 release. The attention to detail extends to the vehicles, showcasing the craftsmanship of the era's automobiles. The game successfully transports players to the Prohibition era of the 1930s, capturing the essence of the time with authenticity. The architecture, fashion, and overall design of Lost Heaven contribute to a rich and immersive atmosphere that enhances the storytelling. The attention to detail in recreating the period-appropriate setting is evident in every corner of the game. The city feels alive with its bustling streets, populated by pedestrians and vehicles that adhere to the era's design. The dynamic day-night cycle and changing weather conditions further contribute to the atmospheric immersion, creating a sense of time progression throughout the game.

SOUND AND MUSIC (8.5/10):
The game's sound design aims to capture the ambiance of the 1930s. This includes the sounds of city life, traffic, gunshots, and other environmental elements. Attention to detail in the audio, such as the distinctive engine noises of the era's cars, helps enhance the immersive experience. The characters are voiced by talented actors who bring the story to life. The voice acting contributes to the authenticity of the characters and helps players connect with the narrative. The game features a period-appropriate soundtrack that includes music from the 1930s. This helps to immerse players in the atmosphere of the time. The music is carefully chosen to suit the different moods and situations in the game, whether it's a tense action sequence or a more contemplative moment. In the game, players can tune into in-game radio stations while driving, featuring music and commentary reminiscent of the 1930s.

STORY AND CHARACTERS (9/10):
The story follows the protagonist, Tommy Angelo, a cab driver who becomes entangled with the Salieri crime family after a chance encounter with two members being pursued by a rival gang. As Tommy gets deeper into the world of organized crime, players witness his transformation from an ordinary citizen to a trusted member of the Salieri family. The plot is well-structured and paced, presenting a cinematic experience that captures the essence of classic gangster films. Themes of loyalty, betrayal, and the consequences of a life of crime are explored throughout the narrative. The storytelling is complemented by well-crafted dialogue, authentic voice acting, and a script that maintains tension and intrigue from start to finish. The narrative also introduces a diverse cast of characters, each with their own motivations, flaws, and unique personalities. The intertwining relationships within the Salieri family and the broader criminal underworld contribute to the complexity and depth of the overall story.

GAME LENGTH AND COMPLETION TIME (7/10):
The length of time required to complete Mafia: Definitive Edition can vary depending on individual playstyles, exploration tendencies, and difficulty settings. On average, completing the main story campaign will take most players around 10 to 12 hours. If you choose to engage in side activities, explore the open world, and pursue optional objectives, the total playtime can extend beyond the main story duration. Completionists who aim to find all collectibles and complete side missions may spend upwards of 25 to 30 hours in the game. It's important to note that these estimates are generalizations, and individual experiences may vary. Players who are more focused on the main story and less on exploration may finish the game more quickly, while those who take their time and thoroughly explore the world may extend their playtime.

CONCLUSION AND SCORE:
Mafia: Definitive Edition successfully captures the spirit of the original while elevating the experience with modern graphics and gameplay mechanics. The compelling narrative, memorable characters, and attention to detail make it a must-play for both fans of the original Mafia and newcomers looking for a gripping journey through the criminal underworld. Hangar 13 has not only revived a classic but has set a new standard for how remakes should be done. Mafia: Definitive Edition is a timeless tale retold with flair, and it stands as a shining example of the potential of video game remakes done right.

+ Some historical events mentioned in the radio or the newspaper.

- Mafia 2 that got released in 2010 has better close combat system than a game from 2020. You just spam Q and the enemies can't even block your attacks.

- Knocked out enemies constantly get stuck in walls or very weird positions. Enemies shot in the head fall down screaming in pain holding their chest.

- After you burn down *****'s house in a mission and go to the location after the mission, the house is completely fine with lights turned on.

- It's missing any memorable soundtrack that the franchise is known for (same for radio songs).

- The game is capped at 60hz for me on fullscreen for no reason.

- The absolutely worst thing is the fact that this is a remake and not a remaster. The dialogues and catchphrases in Czech version are just boring, not at all as funny and memorable like in the original game. The missions are boring and linear and can't be completed in different ways like in Mafia 2002.

I don't underestand why this game is so well rated.

Stepping back into Lost Heaven in Mafia: Definitive Edition is like revisiting a cherished film with a stunning high-definition remaster. The 2020 remake takes the classic 2002 mob story and infuses it with modern visuals, gameplay tweaks, and even a few narrative surprises. While it doesn't stray too far from the original path, it offers a welcome refresh for seasoned players and a captivating introduction for newcomers.

Visually, Mafia: Definitive Edition is a masterclass. Lost Heaven bursts onto the screen with meticulously recreated landmarks, detailed interiors, and atmospheric lighting. Cruising down sun-drenched streets in a gleaming 1930s car feels like stepping into a living postcard. While the core gameplay leans towards linear missions, the open world begs to be explored, showcasing the stunning visuals and offering a sense of immersion rarely found in remakes.

The story remains the heart and soul of the experience. You follow Tommy Angelo, a taxi driver thrust into the dangerous world of organized crime. The narrative unfolds with gritty realism, capturing the allure and brutality of the mob life. While some minor changes were made, the core emotional beats remain intact, ensuring a rollercoaster ride of loyalty, betrayal, and moral ambiguity.

Freeride missions, unfortunately, take a backseat in this edition. While you can explore the open world, there are no additional side activities or challenges beyond the main story missions. This might disappoint players seeking extended playtime, but the focus on the narrative might be welcome for those wanting a streamlined experience.

Collectables offer a slight distraction. Hidden around Lost Heaven are Tommy Bronte's Playboy magazines, wanted posters, and even golden Tommy statues. Finding them rewards you with lore entries and cosmetic unlocks, adding a touch of exploration incentive.

Overall, Mafia: Definitive Edition is a love letter to the original, offering a nostalgic trip down memory lane with a modern polish. The stunning visuals, captivating story, and immersive world make it a worthwhile experience for both veterans and newcomers. While the lack of expansive open-world activities might leave some wanting more, the focus on the core narrative delivers a powerful and emotional journey. If you're looking for a classic mob story brought to life with stunning visuals and engaging gameplay, Mafia: Definitive Edition is a must-play.

Score: 8.5/10 - A polished gem with a captivating story and stunning visuals, but lacking extensive open-world content.",1707567398,1707567398,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Without losing its essence this is a gift for the nostalgic fans and a great introduction to the Mafia games for those who are new. The game successfully balances action sequences,immersive storytelling and period-accurate exploration.

With themes of loyalty and friendship but also betrayal and revenge,Mafia offers a complex narrative with moral dilemmas and a strong accent on character development. By recounting his involvement with the Salieri, Tommy is confessing his past actions searching for redemption,a way to unburden himself from the things he done but also to make a deal to protect his family.

The narrative follows the story of Tommy Angelo,a cab driver that becomes entangled with the Salieri crime family. Drawn into a world of organized crime,Tommy climbs the ranks and earns respect and privilege to be part of the family. The retrospective narrative provides insight into the consequences of being part of a criminal group .

Mafia Definitive Edition is a substantial upgrade in terms of visuals over the 2002 classic, it's a stunning recreation. The game benefits also from improved controls particularly in shooting and driving mechanics. 
For me it was a great experience, it felt like a polished version of the 2002 classic. I had so much fun driving and exploring,even if this doesn't feel like a complete open world experience. 

In conclusion Mafia : Definitive Edition pays homage to the original release with a cinematic experience ,one to remember ,a gift for everyone who loves a good story and a excellent introduction to the Mafia games for a new player.

Pros:
-Story
-Graphics
-Sound
-Attention to detail
-expanded content

There are bugs in the game but nothing game breaking. for example: I found myself taking damage once while simply vaulting over a barrier without any combat present. Another bug I experienced was the characters awkwardly teleporting during a silent take down however it didnt cost me any stealth during the mission. The only bug that caused me to restart the game was when a cut scene failed to activate when driving to the checkpoint. Despite a few minor bugs I still found myself immersed in the story, picking out any foreshadowing and just listening to 1930s music on the radio (which is always good on the rainy nights). Ive seen a few people complain about the length of the game but I think I got my 14 hours worth especially when you take a lot at the $70 price tags for most games these days.

They fixed the driving by introducing a ""Skip Drive"" button. If the solution to a problem with your game is to let us not play your game, maybe there are deeper problems worth investigating.

Gonna do some gatekeeping here, because i think it is worth it. 

This game must be played on Classic mode, which refers to original Mafa 1's difficulty. (That game is still difficult than this tho. I remember dying a lot in that game but this one, except chapter 5 *the race*, it was a pretty smooth experience, not that hard.) 

Playing on Classic difficulty, means that you must not take any bullet, more than 2-3 anyway. Because you will die obviously. I think this should be intended difficulty setting because, it works better with the story too. Adds another layer to this adult story. It establishes a coherence between story and gameplay and makes narrative more well-seated. Like, this game has reminiscence of movies like The Godfather and Once Upon a Time in America, it is even like their videogame version. Its more of a dram than action-adventure. So, killing every enemies without thinking and running into them like in Mafia 3 in a dram story wouldn't make the narrative receivable.

But in Classic mode, you must take cover, wait for enemies move, observe them, wait for their ammos run out and manage your ammo carefully; these put you into more dangerous situations which is more accurate to a mob's life. Your life is at stake for the job and it is difficult to protect it when bullets are flying in the air. Enemies help to establish this coherence too. When they got shot, they dont get out from their cover and just shoot without teasing themselves. So you must make another move to make them get out or find another angle to see them. 

Like FromSoft games, they too make really hard bosses to beat because they want to tell us that they are real deal. They are legends. They wouldnt be like this if you could kill all of them easily. You would have a feeling like ''Huh, this is the Nameless King? Looks more like Fameless to me.'' or smth like that. 

Classic mode is not unjust or frustrating in this meaning. You just have to be a little more patient and hesitant. That's it. You wait for the opening, for the right time, you see the opportunity, you shoot and kill. More important, you survive another day. It is smoother experience than the original one. 

[b]Classic mode makes you say that ''wow, this is hard, being a gangster is hard, fatal even''. Reminds you this is not a pure action game. And i loved that. So wanted to appreciate that. I wish they hadn't ruined the rest of the Mafia games.

Pros:
+ Outstanding story
+ Unforgettable characters
+ Amazing music
+ Atmosphere
+ Decent graphics (city and transport)
+ Good gameplay (shooting part and probably driving because it's claimed to be realistic, while it may be frustrating sometimes, it brings some challenge)

Cons:
- Graphics (NPCs, Tommy and some scenes sometimes): the models and their animations look outdated (the cutscenes look great though), they just don't fit the realistic picture of the city.
- Gameplay: I would say that the missions could have been designed better because they feel outdated too. Like it or not, but gameplay is a key part of almost every game (except the interactive movie genre) no matter how great the story is.
- The race: it is a very questionable game design idea as by the moment the mission starts you didn't even get to know the game, so if you are not familiar with the original, chances are you will rage quit and uninstall the game.
- The credits song [spoiler]by Ice Cube[/spoiler]. It's nice but what the f?

With no sort of character progression (or any progression really outside of the story), there is no hook pulling you forward aside from seeing what happens to Tommy.

The game is absolutely wonderful in terms of story and immersive climate you sink in.
Driving the car however, especially in the race mission, requires you to get used to it - the race comes way too early as it is by far the most difficult car-related mission in the game.

What has changed from the original from 21 years ago? As befits a remake, the new old production from Hangar13 has not changed only in terms of the graphics engine, but also some dialogues have been changed and some of the characters have been partially rewritten, making the characters more interesting and the whole story more coherent and, most importantly, finally connects entirely with Mafia II, which takes place after the events of the first part of the trilogy. After the introduction, let's get into the details of the remake of the latest Mafia game. Like every part of the Mafia series, here we get a great linear plot with interesting characters all the time, a well-made climatic city. Staying on the subject of the city, apart from the fact that it has been really well designed, its biggest problem is that there is absolutely nothing to do in it, apart from scattered ""collectibles"" and about two or three hidden side missions, there is absolutely no more activity in it, which makes it empty and boring, it's worth noting that after completing the story line, we can't explore it freely, if we want to do it, we have to switch to a separate mode prepared by the creators. Minor aspects such as the driving model or the feeling of shooting is literally transferred from the third part of the trilogy and it is just + it is pleasant and there is nothing to complain about. The same is true with optimization and graphics, everything is fine. The disadvantages are definitely the music, there are no decent songs from those years, which is a pity because mostly the music was part of the great atmosphere in the second part. On + while passing the story, we can hear information about the ongoing war in Europe and the view of the Americans on this event. And finally, two quick disadvantages of the game you need to give it time before the story starts to get going, the first chapters are quite boring. The second thing is pointless collectibles that really don't give anything, they're just...

[h2]Story[/h2]
Welcome to Lost Heaven, a city seeped in 1930s charm, fedora fashion, and enough mob drama to make even your grandma shout, ""Fuhgeddaboudit!"" Mafia: The Definitive Edition weaves a gripping narrative, complete with characters as colorful as a speakeasy cocktail. From cabbie to capo, Tommy Angelo's journey through the ranks of the Salieri crime family is a rollercoaster of loyalty, betrayal, and enough plot twists to make your spaghetti fork jealous.

The dialogue? It's like they swiped it straight from a gangster's handbook. Quick-witted remarks and sharp exchanges keep you engaged, and the voice acting? It's so on point, you'll swear you're sitting in a smoky backroom planning the next heist yourself. Choices matter, and the branching paths add a layer of unpredictability that'll keep you guessing who's on your side and who's just waiting to backstab you like a mafia-themed game of Clue.

[h2]Gameplay[/h2]
Jumping into the gameplay is like putting on a perfectly tailored suit—it just feels right. The controls are smoother than a silk-lined Cadillac, and the mechanics are as polished as the brass knuckles tucked in your waistband. From heart-pounding shootouts to white-knuckle car chases, Mafia knows how to keep the adrenaline pumping.

The attention to detail is so meticulous that you can practically smell the cigar smoke wafting through Little Italy. The city's layout is a nostalgic trip back in time, with level designs that immerse you in the era. And let's talk about the cars—each one is a roaring testament to 1930s automotive elegance. The developers didn't just create a game; they crafted a time machine.

[h2]Graphics[/h2]
If the devil's in the details, then Mafia: The Definitive Edition is diabolically good. The graphics are as sharp as a well-dressed mob boss, with textures so rich you'll want to reach out and touch the pinstripes. The lighting dances through the streets, casting shadows that add an extra layer of atmosphere. It's not just a game; it's a visual feast that'll have you snapping screenshots like you're a mobster paparazzo.

Comparisons to other games? Fuhgettaboutit! Mafia sets a new standard for visual storytelling in its genre. It's not about hyper-realism; it's about capturing the essence of the era, and boy, does it do it with style. If other games are the competition, then Mafia is the mob boss looking down from the top floor, saying, ""You call that a game?""

[h2]Sound[/h2]
From the jazzy tunes of the roaring '30s to the rat-a-tat of Tommy's Tommy gun, the sound in Mafia is the auditory equivalent of a perfectly orchestrated heist. The voice acting is so spot-on, you'll be wondering if Marlon Brando himself made a guest appearance. The ambient sounds of the city immerse you in its underworld, creating an atmosphere so thick you could cut it with a switchblade.

And let's not forget the soundtrack—the soulful melodies and energetic jazz transport you to a time when fedoras were mandatory, and speakeasies were the place to be. The sound design isn't just background noise; it's the unsung hero that elevates the entire experience.

[h2]Overall[/h2]
Mafia: The Definitive Edition isn't just a game; it's an offer you can't refuse. The story is a gripping tale of crime and redemption, the gameplay is a seamless dance between challenge and reward, the graphics are a visual masterpiece, and the sound is a symphony of 1930s nostalgia.

Should you play it? If you have a soft spot for fedoras, tommy guns, and a narrative that's more twisted than a mafia handshake, then yes, you absolutely should. It's not just a game; it's an immersive journey into the heart of organized crime, where every choice has consequences and every alley has secrets.

So, in the words of Tommy Angelo himself, ""It's only a matter of time before they come for me... and when they do, they won't be gentle."" Embrace the underworld, fellow gamer, because Mafia: The Definitive Edition is a ride you won't forget.",1701343977,1705971663,True,2,0,0.539363503456115723,0,True,False,False

Around half the play time is driving. Driving to the next plot point through the big living city and listening to the radio feels meditative. You think about all that is happening with Tommy and get the feeling that this story won’t end well. The game is not long, around 10 hours, but tells a fully fledged story. Gameplay feels dated but that didn't detract from the game much, overall you play for the story and not shootouts. Characters are great, the voice acting is good, they feel like real people, caught in this bad story. Tommy and the gang do not fish for sympathy, you kinda feel bad for Tommy in the beginning but by the middle of the game you understand, this is what he wants to do, no regrets. Finished it in three days, episodic structure keeps you entertained and always wanting to know what’s next. Recommend.

This reboot has some pretty visuals, which tend to bug out all the time, and a very nice quality of life skip for unnecessary drives, but misses the mark for miles. Voice acting and delivery of the lines sinks the game hard. They decided to give the story a tiny bit more life but it really just boils down to politically correct horse crap that makes sure to tick all those lovely DEI marks. It's a period piece where the original at least had the stones to touch base on that. Here they made sure to make some certain cuts and additions to ensure no one was offended. 

As for game play the bread and butter of the shooting is okay but nothing to really write home about. For some reason they thought taking away the vast arsenal from the original was a good idea. Having access to two guns is kind of realistic I guess but once you jam a tommy gun down your pants it kinda defeats that argument. Guns also sound and feel like peashooters. The orginal had them kicking like mules. The 44 mag felt like you were blasting a hand cannon and knocking enemies on their asses with it felt good.  Here it feels like every other peashooter of a gun. Absolutely sad they butchered a classic like that; however, disregarding the original the gun play is okay. 

Grab it on sale. Otherwise just play the original. You might have to drive around more in the 1st game but the story with the better VO and gun play blow this reboot out of the park.

Edit: Played through to the end and the story telling just gets more virtue signally and tries desperately to make what was once a badass mobster story into a bs tear jerker. They made Pauli into the biggest pussy on the planet. His new VO certainly does enough justice in that regard but now his character ark is total trash cakes.  Every additional scene they made with Sarah just makes me want to pull the plug on my PC they feel so pretentious. 

Some of the new set pieces are very poorly designed and are extremely annoying to play. The only thing meaningful this reboot does is the combat, which does have some good moments but lord the guns are so bad. The enemies at least on classic difficulty can soak a few bullets with zero reaction. Only if your up close enough to kiss them with the barrel of a shotgun or after taking a few rounds will they show any real feedback. In the original the enemies actually reacted to getting shot each time, which made the combat feel so much more alive then whatever the hell this reboot tries doing.

I tried a few years ago, before they announced the remake, because I had played Mafia 2 at the time and it quickly became one of my favorite titles, mainly because of the storyline. So, I tried playing the first part to learn more about its world and characters, but I couldn't; it had aged too bad. 
To my surprise, a few years later, they announced the remake, and I was very excited. Finally, I could close the complete arc that I had liked so much. 
Now, regarding the game itself: Graphically, it is beautiful; the vehicles, environments, and characters are sublime. Every detail is carefully crafted. 
Unfortunately, it's just a pretty picture to admire because gameplay-wise, the title is very weak. They could have taken advantage of the remake to add more variety, something else to do in the open world, perhaps a shop to customize our character, some mini-games, anything that would make exploring the city enjoyable instead of a chore. 
Once you finish the story, there's nothing else to do. The game could easily be a linear video game since the open world is empty and lacks activities. I think that's the worst part because, in other aspects, like the plot, the game is brilliant. 
There are also some issues with the animations, a bit clunky, but I've just finished playing Red Dead Redemption 2, and there's no comparison; maybe I just need to get used to it.

They even tried to change the plot while keeping the key events unchanged. But, I'll repeat, it's hard to ruin a good story.

I instantly fell in love with the story, the characters and the ""aesthetic"" of those years. When this remake came out, I can't describe the joy and the hype to see my favorite characters and story recreated all brand new from the ground up! 
Now that I finally played it I can say that they surely made some changes; some positive and some...not necessarily bad but still not great. Anyway, over all it's a well done remake! Even the infamous race was still doable on Classic. Just remember, the controls seem ""crazy"" because these are OLD cars, so of course it's quite challenging, mostly in Simulation Mode. But once you get the hang of it, it's a piece of cake (well, almost, you're still gonna crash but -hey!- not as much as before! :D)
Only thing I wish they implemented is being able to enter certain buildings and areas (not just Salieri's) in Free Ride; instead you need an external mod for that which is quite silly, in my opinion.  :/

SPOILER

[spoiler]I wasn't expecting the dialogue at the end to be changed. From ""Crime doesn't pay"" to ""Family is everything""...meh.

Soundtrack is a masterpiece for the ear. A classic music in the radio.
Voice actors for Czech language is peak. Old and golden voice actors like Marek Vašut as Tommy Angelo or Petr Rychlý as Paulie.
Unfortunately the minus I have with this game is the gameplay itself. Especially aiming and how the crosshair works. You ain't spraying with Thompson but rather tap it. But also few things are scripted in difficulty Classic. Example is the race on Classic difficulty, the crashes are scripted. And your opponent racer has to get ahead of you, it will and you have to wait till he makes a mistake otherwise you ain't getting ahead of him.

Like do you have any idea of how shit the turning is? You can't turn on a dime, you can't even drift. The fucking keys that supposedly mess with the transmission don't do shit. 
This is genuinely some of the worst driving in any video game series ever. Like you can't even make it simple, it's rng and nonsense. Practice doesn't mean shit because it doesn't matter how well you drive the game just screws you over repeadedly. It's not a difficult game, it's just rng garbage with cars that slide around like they're on an air hockey table. 
fucking dog water game

Okay? Watch Dogs 2 has the same shitty fucking issue of competing drivers being on magnetic fucking tracks that you can't ram into to knock them out, but when ai hits me I go fucking skidding which is retarded.
The fucking racing missions is geuinely the shittiest fucking thing ever because not only do you don't have any chance of getting first placce, but you can't see the other drivers on the minimap other than the first 4 cars which is retarded on top of the fact that it rubber bands the drivers behind you do catch up with you. 
I'm literally watching the ai gain speed from nowhere and passing me despite the fact I am literally going so fast I cannot fucking turn. 

I either turn too much or not at all, and it's inconsistent to the point where if I want not crash I fail the objective. 
Why is it made this way? Why can't you retards be fucked to fix your game instead of just bumping up the graphics and still have shit like police cars literally falling off of buildings because they spawned on the roof. 
Like are you retarded? 
The only reason i failed the mission is because police cars literally fell out of the sky. 
What kind of shit game does that kind of stuff? 

Saints Row III?
Borderlands III??
Mafia III???

If I see them materialize in front of me that is a shitty fucking game. 
This is a shitty fucking game. 
Why do you make it so tedious to do basic things. 
""Lower the difficulty"" 
Why does playing on a harder difficulty make it impossible to win the race legitamately?
Why does lowering the difficulty make police cars not spawn out of thin air and not show up on the minimap?
are you retarded? 
Maybe don't rig the game in the first place. 

If you do nothing and just park the car in the road your car explodes because the ai isn't allowed to overlap you. This is retarded. Lose if you lose, and lose if you don't. 
There's no winning.
The race car can't reverse.
The race car can't drive on grass or dirt it just swerves out of control if you even so much as graze it. 
The ai can shove you into the wall or into the dirt and grass. You can't do shit to the ai because even if you fucking ram into them and flip them over the game just respawns them. 

This is not a fucking racing game.
This is not a fucking driving game.
But that's all you fucking do.
There's no fucking shoot outs.
There's no fucking brawl fights.
This is a peice of shit fuckign game. ",1705426684,1705428377,False,4,4,0.509770333766937256,0,True,False,False

I enjoyed this game very much. The graphics are beautiful in the Definitive Edition, although my PC struggled a bit in terms of frame rate (if your CPU is old like mine, you might struggle to play this game). As I am more used to the mechanics of the aforementioned Rockstar games, it took me a little getting used to in terms of shooting, since the reticle is a circle and not the most accurate for shooting. I was also a bit disappointed that this isn't a true open world game, since the environment is very beautifully designed and yet you cannot explore the world freely. It's pretty much a linear set game, one mission to the next. I liked the progression since I have less means to distract myself, but I also like exploring.

Spoiler free review:-
Honestly this game is one hell of a ride. Story is good won`t get too much details about it. Their are many twists and turns in it. You have to experience it for yourself. This remake is better than the original it fleshes out things and characters interactions and adds a depth to them. Like tommy's and Sarahs relationship was better fleshed out. Its a linear straight forward story game Chapters wise don`t expect any gta like open world. Tommy was goated in this It showed his character development as to how he went from a avg normal day joe taxi driver to one of the best hitmen/Cappo for the Don.",1705187252,1705188619,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

The atrocious TAA that causes smearing and blur cannot be turned off, even with mods and forcing the setting through NVIDIA's control panel.

The driving physics is atrocious. While setting the driving physics to ""Simulation"" in-game makes things a little tolerable, it puts you at a disadvantage in the racing and chasing parts.

There are forced stealth sections that should honestly have been cut down on this remake. This isn't 2004 anymore. Hangar 21 had an opportunity to create a modern experience that takes the best parts of the OG mafia and trims the clunky parts but... honestly I think they did the opposite.

The checkpoint system places you at the BEGINNING of the chase or stealth section when you fail them. Quite infuriating when you fail at the end.

With GTA5, the mission designs are flawed, yes. But there is downtime in-between missions where you drive around the city as a breather. In this game, you are thrown into one mission after the other. There is no time to wander and appreciate the city they've built. No freeroam (I know there is one in the menu) as part of the storyline. To do that you'll have to select it in the main menu.

[SPOILERS BELOW]

The story is the most egregious part. It starts off slow. Builds up to a betrayal you can see coming a mile away. The GTAs do this, and Mafia is no exception.

It's the abruptness and missing story beats that sour the whole twist. You find the supposed ""diamonds"" were narcotics, and the Don has been keeping the truth from your crew.

The ""diamonds"" serve as cover for cigars, but Sam was the one briefed first by the Don? At this point Tommy is the go-to guy for the Don after having taken care of the most important events in the game. YOU get Frank's ledger, YOU kill the other mob boss, YOU win the garbage race. The Don trusts you the most, enough to disclose the existence of a rat in the family (that turns out to be Frank), yet he keeps the cigar-dope job under your nose? Doesn't make narrative sense.

Ludonarrative dissonance is a word thrown around by video essayists, but it absolutely applies here. Tommy at multiple points shows he doesn't want innocent bystanders killed. He even makes certain jobs harder because of that. Yet in-game, he mows down hundreds of cops and goons who could've been just like him. Who's to say the enemies at the other end of the barrel isn't some heart-of-gold taxi driver down on his luck scooped up by the mafioso so they can pay their bills?

Sam is never shown to be the guy willing to throw his crewmates under the bus to get a leg-up in the mafioso career ladder. Instead we see him looking out for the other two in the Trio. Yet all of a sudden he caps his best friend, and tries to plug Tommy so Don looks at him kindly as the Godfather's favorite pet? What??

How did he even find out about the bank job? Yes he heard about it in the car but how did he know to go straight to the apartment afterwards? Why didn't Tommy split up right then and there? Why would you stay in town longer than necessary after poking at the hive's nest?

Why isn't there a lead-up to the bank job? It's supposed to be thing big end-of-all-heists that's supposed to get them out of their shitty lives as low-level grunts, but we don't see any planning. There are no missions that lay out the blueprints of the building, what you'll do, and how you'll get out of there.

It's just ""hey lets rob a bank"" and you are there at the next cutscene. Tommy does all this for his kids that we don't see until the final cutscene.

Tommy makes a deal with Irish to get back at the Don who betrayed him. The actual arrest and jail-time isn't a mission, but a montage of cutscenes. He gets old, we see his kid(s), now multiple (i thought it was just a ""baby girl"", and he gets popped at the end by the VERY DON HE PUT IN JAIL.

This one we ALSO see coming because Frank got capped at a dog race, but the Don was NOT in prison at the time. It's just a forced way to say ""you can't escape the mafia life bro"".

All of this ends with Vin Diesel--sorry, TOMMY--saying some crap about ""family"". Like the entire game was leading up to a Fast and Furious line. Very disappointing and not even worth the money at a sale price.",1705108420,1705108420,False,1,0,0.489847272634506226,0,True,False,False

On one hand, I want to sing its praise for how the story telling has been going thus far. It's fantastic. And then on the other had you have the f'ing racing mission. 

I'm serious, the racing mission is hot garbage. A story driven game should not be this challenging. The way the car handles is like you're driving on ice. It's ridiculously hard to keep control of the car while simultaneously dodging other racers from pit maneuvering you. I strongly suggest downloading a mod for the race. It's what I had to do to keep my sanity.

So I was excited to see this remake. Sadly, it does not live up to expectations. Despite claiming that they added content they have actually produced a game with much less content than the original. The difficulty is way down. The open world aspects are basically gone. Your hand is held through the entire thing. 

While the action scenes are still true to the original, and challenging, the heart and soul of the game is gone. You can no longer approach missions as you see fit. If the game wants you to use stealth then you're going to, or the mission will fail. If you want to approach the target from an abnormal area, you can't, you've been plopped down in a location with one way out, through the enemy directly. They made other weird changes like the getaway plane actually being a plane instead of a blimp like in the original.

They added a cutscene where Sarah says the politician you assassinate championed the 19th amendment. Even though this games takes place in the 30's and the 19th amendment was passed in 1968. So not only did they add a historical inaccuracy to a game that was once heralded for its historical accuracy but a game that's already heavy in exposition now has way more exposition. As far as I can tell that's the only content they actually added, cut scenes. There is significantly less game play in this version. 

Which brings me to my last complaint. All the car missions are gone, along with the need to learn to pick locks. These were multi-part missions that felt like at least half the game. Just GONE. They did give a nod to these missions through post cards, but they aren't integrated into the story, the cut scenes and dialogue is gone, and instead of entire missions it's just a scavenger hunt. 

The raised rail system isn't usable anymore either. In the original game, after you take the train in the story, you could take the train to get around town as much as you wanted. There was also a mission involving the train platform, that's totally gone. In this game you can't take the train, ever. 

I expected a LOT more. You can't access the airport or race track in free mode, which I expected in the remake. They REMOVED tons of missions, which I never expected in the remake, and it makes it bad. They added historically inaccurate feminist non-sense, albeit in one cut scene, still ruins it. 

Game doesn't even look much better, and has massively higher performance requirements. 

If you want to experience Mafia the way we all fell in love with it, ignore this version. The things that make this game bad are the same things that make Mafia 2 and 3 bad, no depth, no immersion, no heart, no soul. Just go to gog.com and get the original version. Mod it into 1080p, mod the original music back into it, play that.

Mafia: Definitive Edition is a full-scale remake of the original 2002 classic. While appearing similar in looks and style to GTA5, Mafia focuses a lot more on the narrative and story it has to tell, with the definitive edition including a free-roam mode, where you can explore the city of Lost Heaven in your own time.

Technically, the game runs fairly well. Aside from some abrupt texture and model pop-in at close ranges, the game is a visual treat, with ample detail to recreate the feel of 1930s America. 

I was most impressed by the driving in the game. It feels much more weighty than you would expect, and I enjoy the feel of driving every vehicle the game features. The soundtrack is another stellar part of the game, using original motifs and melodies, but also a fresh true sound; the music really is timeless.

For a nicely crafted story, excellent open world, mobster themed gameplay and a sweet-as-fuck soundtrack to accompany it all, Mafia: Definitive Edition is certainly worth a try.",1701014108,1705022218,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Though I did love the original game, the controls were just bad, and driving was an exercise in futility. This updating of what was an already good game, is vital to anyone getting into the series.

Now, this game is far from perfect. The story can probably be wrapped up easily in under 10 hours, maybe even less. There isn't any additional content either. Also, you're never really able to explore the open world too much because you're always going from mission to mission. I think there is a mode that let's you explore, but it isn't part of the normal game play.

All-in-all, it really is the definitive experience for the first Mafia game, and if you're looking to get back into the series, or start again from the beginning, it might be better to pick this up than play the original.",1705005129,1705005129,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Simple recommendation - If you like mafia type games, mafia story lines, you for sure want to check this game out. You get your old school vibes, old cars, mafia story line, high life etc.
More in dept review - Just because this is a remake of a legendary game, I feel like Hangar 13 went a bit too far away from originality of this game. Sad that Hangar 13 didn't even offer voice acting to original voice actors from Mafia 1, that really cut a big part out of the nostalgia. Overall game and missions felt great, the city, radio, just wonderful place to be. As far as missions themselves, everything was great, was not really enjoying end of the game. Missed the cut scene of the original of Tommy being in jail before getting old and spending rest of his life else were, but other than that, was a really huge fan of the game. Free Roam, in my opinion, little less to do in there, after you finish main story, only 12 side missions made game feel like that really quickly ends.

Amazing game, 9/10. The cars are heavily improved, and the town of Lost Heaven looks more alive now. The only issue I had with the game was how classic mode was too easy until the race, which was more like the original, HARD as humanly possible.

It took me far fewer tries in the remake than in the original to beat it, though.
On the 5th try, I learned that the solution for the race was literally spamming the ram button and slowing down heavily at sharp turns. If you pull it off, you just gotta make sure you don't make a mistake; the other racers in the game are scripted to fail eventually. So, if you're a potential buyer, abuse this piece of information.

Overall, this game is worth it.
for the price, only if it's on sale, lol.

Away with the Sepia filter! Lost Heaven is appropriately grim-dark and heavenly, when it needs to be. 
Set pieces feel hyper-detailed and dynamic. Shootouts are always entertaining. Mobsters drop dead in dramatic fashion. Gunplay and movement is quick and weighty at the same time. Give me more arenas and I would shoot more.

Sadly, after finishing the story, the city doesn't feel as lively as it should. Public transit is unavailable. Most areas are blocked off by indestructible fences. Bushes.  Aside from extraordinarily goofy missions and a ton of collectables, including outfits and vehicles, there isn't anything to do besides drive around. 
Going on a rampage isn't a viable pass-time as it is in.. similar games in the genre. Cops drop chase as soon as you exit your vehicle, provided they aren't directly engaged with, you don't even have to move.
Fast travel is jumping through hoops. - Die or find a Bus Station and return to Salieri's. Then, 'walk' around to find the right envelope and 'go to mission' to take you across town to a phone booth you previously unlocked. Good luck figuring out which one's which.

[h1]Mafia: Definitive Edition[/h1]

«Mafia: Definitive Edition» — это переосмысленная версия классической игры «Mafia», выпущенная в 2002 году. Разработчики из Hangar 13 и 2K Games решили воссоздать эту криминальную эпопею с нуля, чтобы предложить игрокам современную графику и улучшенный игровой процесс.

Основное внимание в «Mafia: Definitive Edition» уделяется повествованию и созданию атмосферы 1930-х годов в мире организованной преступности. Игрок в роли Томми Анджело, члена мафиозного клана, продвигается в итальянской мафии посредством различных событий и криминальных операций.

Одним из главных преимуществ «Mafia: Definitive Edition» являются улучшенные визуальные эффекты и графика. Реконструированная окружающая среда, транспортные средства и персонажи позволяют игрокам полностью погрузиться в атмосферу места преступления.

Геймплей также претерпел некоторые изменения. Он стал более современным и адаптированным к современным стандартам. Бой и стрельба стали более плавными, а система управления машиной улучшилась.

Но главное достижение «Mafia: Definitive Edition» — сохранение и даже улучшение оригинального глубокого и эмоционального сюжета. Персонажи более живые, их отношения запоминающиеся, а повороты сюжета остаются захватывающими.

В целом «Mafia: Definitive Edition» — это не просто ремейк, а настоящая реинкарнация культовой игры. Она воплощает в себе лучшие аспекты оригинала и представляет собой современное воплощение для нового поколения игроков. Для тех, кто ценит красочные сюжеты, великолепную атмосферу и качественный геймплей, эта игра предоставляет прекрасную возможность пережить золотую эпоху организованной преступности в новом мире.

On May 13, 2020, 2K announced Mafia Definitive Series developed by Hangar 13. Hangar 13, hmm. I remember on July 18, 2015, 2K announced Mafia III developed by Hangar 13. After Mafia III was released, everyone hated it. The story isn't about the Mafia, the open world is awful, and all the missions are the same.

When Mafia Definitive Series was announced, every single gamer said, ""F*ck that studio, that game will be awful."" On September 25, 2020, Mafia Definitive Edition was released. It's not a AAA game, but it's working well and stays true to the original story with a few new mechanics. The graphics aren't awesome but look very good. Sounds are really good. Animations aren't as smooth as the original Mafia II, but it's not too bad, and the missions are faithful to the original. Cutscenes, oh man, they're like movie scenes.

Gameplay

Absolutely astonishing. I love that they kept the feeling that the first game had in its design of the entire map and its missions that it offers. But it may be the definitive edition of a game that came out in 2002, but it didn't really be that game in a way. Mafia's gameplay was usually that you needed to avoid getting injured usually. The driving in the first game absolutely sucked, but it kinda felt rewarding in a weird way. Health didnt regenerate like we have it now. If you were low at a checkpoint then oh well, thats all the hp you're getting for the entire mission or unless you find a way of healing. Bullets felt lethal, ammo felt needed, different ways to do a mission were impressive. They added some of the feeling back into their classic mode in the definitive edition but it just really didnt feel the same. With that aside, the game really does feel polished, its a fun experience to go through having all of these intense scenes. I love how they remade the missions to feel a bit more enjoyable for the user. Introducing the player to driving in the new running man mission is an amazing way to show off the driving portion of the game. Although, im sure the animations dont feel like Tommy, right? Thats because the entire game runs on the Mafia 3 engine. Usually I dont care about this detail, but the original made Tommy look like someone whos in the mob, not the damn military. The animations for Tommy's actions in combat are really similar if not the same to Lincoln Clay in Mafia 3. Driving do feel smooth tho. Especially the ram feature. The ram feature allows your to make kinda tighter turns while speeding up the car you're driving for a really short time frame. This is really useful in Fairplay mostly. The guns didnt really feel that bad when it came to damage in the remake. The original game had very lethal shotguns that either blow you away or just kill you in one shot. The saw-off shotgun being a prime example of this. It fires 2 shots really quickly but then the reload takes a bit. The pump shotgun fires at a more steady rate but the reload time isnt really as bad on it. But wheres the lethal part in all of this? It's if the enemy has it. There exists a bug in the game where a shotgun can rapid fire, basically allowing a free kill on the main player. NPC's have health in the original where in the remake, they can indeed be shot at by enemies but they dont have health. They have an infinite amount of health since you cant hurt your allies in the remake, but in the original you could actually kill your allies. Of course if you did, the mission would fail usually. But whats interesting is that they fight back if you fight them or if you shoot a certain amount of times near them during the general start of missions where you start off in Saliari's bar most of the time. Ammo didnt carry over clips. Any bullet you didnt use in the clip you were using and you reload, the bullets just gone. For example if you're shooting a pistol and you have 2 bullets left, you reload. The 2 bullets wont carry over to the next clip, instead you have a different clip with the max amount of bullets that can be held within a clip. This detail was really similar to the real world where bullets dont magically transfer over to the next clip.

Story

Mafia's story has always been simple, but the definitive edition made the characters feel more important. Especially Sarah. Sarah was Tommy's love interest in both games, however the original game only had mention of her through dialogue after her main mission. The definitive edition made her feel as a character. They gave her a more important role aswell as including her in some cutscenes and spare dialogue in future plus missions before her main one. Still prefer the old ending cutscene with sam at the art gallery. The message was more meaningful instead of giving us the whole ""we had good times Tom, but eventually we all die."". I did love that they made sam's death a bit more satisfying in the remake. Story is just generally explained better in the remake than the original. 

Free Ride

Free ride mode in the definitive edition feels... Limited????? Its a weird way to describe it but to be honest you only have a handful of easter eggs, Lucas Bertone missions, and the exploration of the map. The original had a save feature where you had to interact with saliari's bar in order to save your game. You could chose what car you wanted to start with, what part of town you wanted to spawn at, the conditions of npc behavior, and even different varients of the map. You could kill gangsters that can be seen on the street or just driving a car. You get a chunk of money for just killing one of them, but usually they're pretty lethal with their weapon choices.

Summary

I overall enjoy the definitive edition of a game I got to play when I was little. It brings so many memories of the good days in Mafia. No doubt, the game has its flaws.

Up until this you've gotten into 1 shootout, about 3 get-away drives, and 1 vehicle combat. That's all the skill they've been requiring of you. 

[Fairplay] is a insane difficulty spike that requires you to win a race with the most perfect of precision while driving a car that handles about as well as Bambi on ice. The slightest bump causes you to spin-out, sand causes you to spin-out, bumps launch you into the air and flips you, bumping into another car can lock your wheels with theirs and cause you to spin-out. All this while the enemy racers drive with perfect skill and no mistakes. Add on that the other racers AI seems somewhat random and they're always a smidgen faster than you. All this together and you have a high precision race where if you aren't in First Place after the first turn you might as well reset.

Simply put I'm amazed this game was even able to be released with how bad this mission is. I was genuinely enjoying my self the first four missions, and I hear the rest of the game is great. I just refuse to spend hours and hundreds of attempts just to reach it.

When the game came out, i didn't wait and purchased it. It's probably the most ""played through"" game in my life till this day and I play it (Mafia 1) at least once a year ever since. I stopped counting after 24th playthrough.
The definitive edition is far away from ""definitive"", unfortunately. New visuals mean almost nothing to me. The game is underwhelming at best, annoying at worst. The interface and controls are very sad - non-responsive and stupidly frustrating because of the ""take cover"" mechanism. The game is missing serious sections of the original and feels very empty. Don't let me start about the physics aspect which was a showcase of the original 5 years ahead of any competition in same/similar genre.
No challenge getting new cars or doing quite challenging sub-quests. It's like a school run race, where everyone gets medal for participation. It leaves good impression of the cinematic story, but very bad aftertaste because of wasted potential. Seems the developers and the distributor wanted to appeal to modern audience, probably taking ""it"" for completely stupid, lazy and not able to value good challenge and better game mechanics.
Unfortunately it's not a definitive, nor good ""successor"" of the original. The storytelling is bit more dynamic (not entirely a positive if you ask me) and parts of the story changes make sense. The visuals are better (duh), but if it's for the cost of taking away from the other strong aspects of the original game - it's not a good deal for me.
If you are lower on IQ, new to gaming, or loving game consoles and some ""standard"" modern day ""arcady"" game mechanics, this is for you. If you expect a gaming masterpiece (especially for PC gaming) with strong story and exceptional game-play, rather move on.

- Enemies are pretty hard to defeat if your playing above the normal difficulty (you will rage), the AI is sort of dumb at times. Fighting with fists or weapons were wacky and boring, too easy after you figured what to do. Killing feels epic.
- Quite a bit of driving in this game, if you can't handle the cars, refund. Took me some time to get used to the car handling but it was not horrible by any means, even started to do some sick drifting on turns, BUT THE BIKES, holy shit I don't want to talk about them, they feel like boats, can be seen in the ""You Lucky Bastard"" chapter.

I am really sad. This game was so close to being perfect for me, like a tiny inch away and I would fall in love with this game. Throughout the game, I just really wished this game was more open world, sure you can explore the world after, all alone :(  but the story line is SOO straight, no side missions or anything, nothing, something special I liked about GTA games.

I was really skeptical about the theme and story, thought I will find it boring, HOWEVER it was amazing, and I am surprised considering my taste is really leaned towards modern things. This game is special because of the story, You will enjoy it.

Driving is eh, it's set in the 30's so part of it is your driving cars that aren't far removed from the Model T. And a kicker for a lot of people, this is not a true open world game. There's a city and at some points you can drive around and not head for your objective. Thing is there is nothing to do in the city except finding collectibles.
So saying all those negatives, why do I recommend this game? It's the story, the story is fantastic. Now if your familiar with Mafia movies and pop culture, you'll be getting more of what you like. It's not state-of-the-art, it's not the Godfather, but damn is it good! Get this game on sale, and kill 8-12 hours with a killer story.",1704182054,1704182054,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Hangar 13 has not only successfully revived a classic title but has elevated it to new heights with stunning visuals, immersive storytelling, and refined gameplay mechanics.

First and foremost, the graphics are jaw-dropping. The developers have painstakingly recreated the city of Lost Heaven with incredible attention to detail. The architecture, the streets, and the atmosphere all contribute to a nostalgic yet fresh experience. The character models are meticulously crafted, making the protagonists and antagonists alike feel more lifelike than ever before.

The narrative is where Mafia Definitive Edition truly shines. While staying true to the original storyline, the revamped script and voice acting breathe new life into the characters. Tommy Angelo's journey from a cab driver to a key player in the Salieri crime family is both compelling and emotionally charged. The storytelling is so well-executed that even those familiar with the original game will find themselves captivated by the revamped narrative twists.

Gameplay improvements are evident throughout, providing a more polished and enjoyable experience. The gunplay feels satisfying, and the driving mechanics have been fine-tuned to strike the right balance between realism and accessibility. The integration of cover mechanics adds strategic depth to shootouts, making every encounter a thrilling experience.

The attention to detail extends beyond the visuals and narrative, permeating every aspect of the game. From the authentic 1930s soundtrack to the period-appropriate vehicles, Mafia Definitive Edition effortlessly transports players to the Prohibition era. The inclusion of side missions and collectibles also adds longevity to the game, encouraging exploration and engagement beyond the main story.

In conclusion, Mafia Definitive Edition is a triumphant reimagining of a classic title. It successfully combines the nostalgia of the original with modern gaming standards, resulting in a visually stunning, emotionally resonant, and thoroughly enjoyable experience. Hangar 13 has set a new standard for remakes, and I can't wait to see what they have in store for the future. Bravo!",1704164360,1704164360,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The mafia under the betrayal
Nice story line,but in a hurry.Though each plot has its foreshadowing,most of them can't account for the roles' actions or changes.The whole story is focus on the role controlled by the player,rather than the mafia or that three guys,which means you may often do everything alone without any help(others in the mafia only take actions together when they want to kill you...)l think each role needs a story of themselves to enrich their characteristics.

Experienced a crash less than 3.5 hours into the game.
Almost no accessibility options, but you can adjust key bindings.
No DLSS or AMD FSR.
You get ads in game to buy Mafia 2 and 3, but you can at least hide that message permanently if you want to so that's good.
2k Launcher is annoying.
No saving function in this remaster; you have to play-through a mission to get to an autosave.

In terms of the game itself, I liked what I played so far. The story was interesting and the gameplay was enjoyable enough. Lost Haven is nice. Sound is good too. There are all new voice actors in this game compared to the last one, and it isn't the original developer that did this remaster, but I did not play the original  so this wasn't an issue for me.

If you have a PC that exceeds the recommended specs by a lot and can comfortably run modern games (released since 2020) in Fullscreen at 60+ fps, I would recommend this game, and I might consider playing this again once I upgrade my PC.

But this remaster was designed very poorly on a lot of levels for a game released in 2020, and the game is unplayable in borderless fullscreen, so I cannot recommend this game.",1704016546,1704016934,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It took me one hour to complete that stupid mission, but I do find it funny that it's almost as broken as in the oringal. Once again Hangar 13 had the perfect opportunity to deliver a much more broader, interesting experience and expand on what the original game had achieved, but they opted for a more stream lined game instead, with little incentive for exploration. If anything, Mafia is a text book example on how to do a respectful remake, that's for sure, but it could've been much more tho. The ending is still as great as I remembered, with a little tweak that makes it even more emotional. I do miss a little bit of the old faces and voices, but it's understandable that they had to go with new ones of course. If you like story driven games, and specially if you haven't experienced the first Mafia, you should try this one out.

Pros:
- Better Graphic ✅
- Nice Good looking cars ✅
Cons:
- Characthers dont look like the OG ones, and that's negative for me (personal opinion) ❌ 
- i spent two hours on the race mission , i had to watch a youtube video in order to complete it, and i was playing in classic difficulty and couldn't risk to change difficulty and lost all my progess ❌
- They didn't put the train scene, Really ? Like there was a cutscene from the car chase train but it's not like the original not even for a bit , come on man, that was one of my favourite cutscene from the OG game :-(  ❌
- They put new scene with Paulie instead of the scene in the house (the bank robbery scene) ❌
- New songs are great , but i wish they put some of the old ones, from the OG Game ❌
- Cars in general in this game are undrivable, but good looking tho ❌
- Probably they changed a lot of scene and stuff from OG and i didn't realize ❌
- They couldv'e implemented better aimsight for shooting ❌
Final Opinion and vote: All and all , and alright Game, expect for these cons , so i still reccomend to buy this game when it's in Sale, because the core it's always from the OG game , and if you play this one, you will have some of the Feels from the Original One, so that's Good. For the most parts, i was annyoied by the driving and the shooting, but that's alright, i was playing in classic difficulty as well, so that's on me. Final Vote is 7/10 if it had more pros than cons i would have give 10. But it is what it is, i hope they will make other Mafias, i like this Saga and i want to support it. Not make mistake like the Third one tho, pls :p

Played through on the 'hard' setting.  Enemies are basically bullet proof.  You need to hit them about 6 times for them to die and they don't have a lot of impact from being shot.  

Appears open world but really it's on rails misson  to mission to mission with a discrete path to each.

I'd recommend it but be prepared for some frustration with the combat mechanic.",1703841317,1703841317,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

the thing i think the game did most phenomenally is the characters. not only did all of them have their own unique charm design or personality wise, their development throughout the story was subtle but very obviously /there/. 
It was also a very immersive experience. puts your into the mindset of Tommy really well. (spoilers? kind of?>)  in the very last mission especially my thought process was basically identical to Tommy's, and i think that's really cool. makes you feel way more connected to the main character.

If you want an open world game, then this is not for you since this one is a linear story game where if you go where the game don't want you to, it will start a countdown that makes you go back where you were going before.

I proceed to rate the aspects of the game:

- Main history: 7/10 it would be an 8/10 if it wasn't because of that nonsense changes they've made for this remake (some missions were cut and some dialogues were changed for worse), the original game story isn't even perfect since it has some inconsistencies but definitely the original has the best version of the story. The last thing I'm adding here is that in one mission you can pass through the door without killing all the enemies and yet Tommy will tell that he has killed all of them, nothing more to add here.
- Gameplay: 3/10 and I'm being generous, I've beaten it in classic difficulty to make it challenging I guess. The gameplay is awful, and the gunplay is seriously really bad, also I hate the combat system, it annoys me. Even if I played in classic difficulty and somewhat I enjoyed the game only because of the story until the end, enemies are bullet sponges (this is something I hate from modern games) and the gunplay makes it worse. At least the gameplay is better than the original game, but for our standards it's bad.
- AI in general: 3/10 the AI in general made me laugh sometimes, that's why I gave it an extra point, because in general it's annoying and frustrating when it comes to allies AI (sometimes they get stuck in one room for some reason), and the enemies AI? Well... seriously, how can I pass through my enemies at 10 meters without being seen? This AI is a bad joke to the game industry 
- ""Free Ride"" mode: 3/10 lacks content and it is really boring since you can't use money in the game, and indeed you can't do activities that requires money for payment except por paying fines (when the police catch you). The only somewhat fun stuff this mode includes are secret cars, weapons, outfit, missions and more collectibles, other than that as I've said before, it lacks of content and makes Lost Heaven feel empty even if the map is somewhat kind of big. 
- Graphics and design in general: 8/10 they are nice to see not gonna lie (overall I love how Lost Heaven looks, I think they've done a really good work in that aspect), but there are some details I don't like of the game, like Tommy's daughter for example (seriously, couldn't they've done a better design and not make her look like a simple NPC?).
- Collectibles: 5/10 there are some decent collectibles like the ones in the main story missions, but overall the rest are all generic trophies and I don't think I will collect them all, maybe I'll do it in the future, I don't know to be honest.

Lots of Colors, huge world and blablabla. I've never played the original game besides a bit in free ride and an demo version  I believe so I don't know how close it is to it's source material, but I've heared its a great remake.

The Game has a really good atmosphere, offers an Noir Mode, which is super cool, gives it old movie vibes and offers a pleasant singleplayer experience BUT, as far as it feels for me, it runs on the Mafia 3 Engine, which I really dislike. The Shooting feels odd, not as satisfying as in Mafia 2, the Driving is Awful in my opinion and those 2 make a huge portion of the game. The Physics are just wanky. Honestly, I liked Mafia 2 more, even if those physics were pretty weird. Just, I'm driving 30' Cars, not modern sports cars, so they should feel shit.

Regardless, let's talk about mission design. Overall I loved the missions, the Story they tried to (re)tell was a pleasure to follow trough, but with about 10 hours of playtime just way too short. I know the original Story ain't as long but still sad. A mission that I really hated tho, was the Mission where you had to race. As mentioned earlier the driving physics are really bad, and it was an unpleasant experience being forced to win a Race that was no fun at all to me. I had to do it like 3 times Over coz the wanky physics screwed me over. There is also a Mission where you have to protect booze whilst being in the back of the truck. It's a fun Railshooter experience but still a bad and unpleasant mission, so Dislike that 2.

On the other Side, you had missions that were more engaging such as the old Prison or the final Mission. Really a lot of Fun to play these, even tho it's sad, when you grew accustomed to these Characters. I  will still love Vito and Joe more.

Talking about those, There is a Mission in Mafia 2 that correlates with the game here, where Joe and Vito have a cameo, which I really like. I never understood this mission in Mafia 2 until I played the Remake and watched Videos to inform me.

Now I wanna be angry about 1 more thing, which may exclusively be to the German version of the game. Mafia 2 had great voice acting, this game however... Neither atmospheric nor really good. The Characters never whispered in Situations where they should've been. There Is a Scene where they scream about killing someone whilst on way to him, super stupid. Also most of the time it sounded like people where right next to you when  they were not. A lot of times the voice acting sounded expressionless, which makes me sad, but the VA of Vito Scaletta was atleast the right one.

What to say at the end of the game? I wish there was more Content, more Guns, more boom, but it's just the Remake of the original Mafia. I've heared great things and wanted to play it myself, ending up paying 40€. It's a pleasant and great experience, tho on Hard it's stupid to have to run to a Medkit every gunfight.

I recommend this game to fans of the Mafia Franchise or to people who like a decent gangster Story BUT, I do not recommend it to be brought for 40€. This game is more like a 20-25 € Experience, not worth 40 Bucks. Since the game has no real DLC, it loses it's charm very quick, and the open world feels really empty.

The game follows the tale of Tommy Angelo as he navigates the perils of life as a gangster in the 1930's city of Lost Haven. Tommy's struggle between the life he has chosen & life he wishes to have throughout the story, helps to make him a memorable protagonist in the franchise.

Pros:
+Great Story: The story while detailing Tommy Angelo's rise from struggling cab driver to mafia capo also does a great job portraying the realities of life in a 1930's prohibition era Lost Haven where the Salieri and Morello crime families are feuding for control of the city. The story also does a great job detailing the origins of these crime families as well as their downfall.
+Great Graphics: The city of Lost Haven simply looks beautiful from its bustling streets to its towering buildings. This makes for a brilliant 1930's themed backdrop as you visit various locations throughout the story.
+Good Combat: The game while being somewhat bare-bones in this aspect does offer some one-handed, two-handed & melee weapons for use in combat. The cover system can feel a bit clunky & imprecise when taking on groups of enemies & there is no skill tree to complement combat.
+Good Controls: The game's controls are simple and responsive when in combat or racing through the rainy streets of Lost Haven to outrun the law.
+Great Soundtrack: The songs played through the available radio stations in game definitely complement the 1930's look & feel of the game.

Cons:
-The game's story is very short and condensed within 20 chapters which can be cleared in 5-7 hours if not less. Outside this there is nothing to do, leading to minimum replay value except if achievement hunting.",1703187419,1703187419,True,82,2,0.848199009895324707,15,True,False,False

It's nice to experience the revived city with complete graphical overhaul, but the main point of Mafia was the story, and here it falls flat because of poorly written script.

I remember trying to pass the race mission for like a million times before finally calling it quits. With this remake, I got another shot at seeing the whole story of Mafia.
The mentioned story takes place during the time of prohibition (1930s) in the city of Lost Haven, somewhere in America. You are Thomas Angelo, a regular cab driver with Italian roots. Finding yourself in the right place at the wrong time, you meet Paulie and Sam, a couple of gangsters who drag you into the criminal underworld. 
There are two things this remake brings to the table: difficulty levels and improved graphics. I naively started the game at 'classic' difficulty, but was forced to tune it down when I got to the race mission (after I spent a couple of hours trying to pass it... it was even harder than I remember). The improved graphics are nice, but could have been nicer. The rest of the game is basically the same as in 2002 when it first came out. Be warned though, what was good in 2002 is pretty terrible today. Glitchy controls, retarded AI and rows upon rows of enemies you'll be showered with - that's what you should expect. Luckily the game has incredible story, great voice-acting and quality cut-scenes, otherwise it would be completely unworthy of playing. It's also pretty short and linear (which was a common thing 20 years ago), with almost no side-content beside main missions.
This remake could have been great. Instead, it feels like it was made only to make a quick buck with a little face-lift on a 20-year old game. I would recommend buying Mafia: Definitive Edition only if you like gangster movies and only if you find it on sale.

The ending was quite tragic, but very meaningful, spreading the important message that family is your greatest weakness but also your greatest strength.

Moreover, Mafia Definitive Edition updates its technical aspects. Updated graphics, high-quality sound, and an engaging soundtrack contribute to an overall captivating sensation.

-A história é boa de acompanhar, as missoes são divertidas.

-A mecânica de combate é bem estranha, nada muito dificíl mas que incomoda já que não está alinhada com as mecânicas modernas

-Gostei muito da atenção aos pequenos detalhes como o black noir, que dá uma sensação de filme, o rádio fica chiado quando entramos no túnel

-A mecânica de direção é esquisita, não sei ao certo se quiseram trazer uma característica dos carros de 1930 ou se é uma limitação tecnológica do jogo.

- excellent graphics and decent optimization. i use a rtx 3050 with a i5-12400f, and i usually got 75-100 fps for missions in lost heaven, but dropped below 60 frequently on countryside missions, but i can understand, forest-y areas in any game can tank performance, from my experience at least.

Shooting sucks. When you shoot enemy he doesn't react at all until he's dead, which give shooting very strange feeling. Often you and other guy just shoot at each other and wait who'll die first.

Mafia: Definitive Edition, a masterful recreation of the 2002 classic, transcends mere nostalgia, presenting an enriched and visually stunning experience that, at its core, explores the intricate dynamics of loyalty and the profound importance of family.

The Rich Tapestry of Storytelling:

At the heart of this gripping narrative is Tommy Angelo, a taxi driver turned reluctant mobster whose journey into the criminal underworld of Lost Heaven unfolds with cinematic brilliance. The script, expertly voiced characters, and meticulous attention to detail in character development create a narrative tapestry that not only pays homage to the original but elevates it to contemporary storytelling standards.

Visual Splendor and Historical Authenticity:

The visual overhaul is nothing short of breathtaking. Lost Heaven, the game's setting, feels alive with the hustle and bustle of 1930s city life, and every frame reflects the glamour, grit, and authenticity of the era. From the architecture to the fashion, the developers have meticulously recreated a world that not only looks beautiful but feels immersive and historically grounded.

The Salieri Family:

The standout element that elevates Mafia: Definitive Edition is its exploration of family dynamics within the Salieri crime family. Unlike many crime sagas that dwell solely on the brutality of the underworld, this game takes the time to delve into the emotional intricacies of the relationships within the criminal fraternity.

The Salieri family isn't just a criminal organization; it's a tight-knit group bound by trust, shared experiences, and a profound sense of loyalty. Each character feels distinct and human, making the player genuinely care about their fates. The family is portrayed as more than just a collective of criminals; it's a surrogate family where bonds are forged in the crucible of danger and ambition.

The Significance of Family:

Tommy Angelo's journey, while laden with criminal endeavors, is fundamentally a quest for belonging and purpose. Amidst the chaos and danger of the mob, the game subtly underscores the importance of family as an anchor that keeps characters grounded. It's not just about rising through the ranks; it's a search for identity, belonging, and a sense of self in a world teetering on the edge of lawlessness.

Ambient Immersion and Emotional Resonance:

The game's atmospheric soundtrack, period-appropriate radio broadcasts, and meticulous attention to historical detail contribute to an immersive experience that transcends the gaming medium. It's not just playing a game; it's living in a meticulously crafted world that captures the essence of the 1930s.

In Conclusion:

Mafia: Definitive Edition is not merely a remake; it's a profound exploration of human connections in the tumultuous world of organized crime. Through its captivating narrative, visual brilliance, and nuanced portrayal of family bonds, it stands as a testament to the storytelling potential of video games. It's a journey that goes beyond the pursuit of power, reminding us that, even in the darkest of times, family is the thread that weaves through the complexities of loyalty, betrayal, and ultimately, redemption.",1701767921,1701767921,True,3,0,0.541666686534881592,0,True,False,False

> Mafia: Definitive Edition is not a bad game. It is a mediocre game with a mediocre story. The first half of the story is building up our character and the environment pretty well, but after the half of the game you can sense a feeling of rush, and therefore some plot elements makes no sense. But even with all it's failures, the story is decent, and you can pretty sure have fun with it. But I concur that after you beat the game for the first time, most people will not find go back to play it again. The game has no reason to make you play it twice. 

> The gamepley was clunky, especially when we travel on foot or shoot with our weapon. The driving is not bad, but the AI could have been better. Apparently they were designed in a certain way and don't notice the player's car at all. The shooting isn't satisfactory either. Even though the gun sounds were decent, it didn't make me feel like I am shooting with a weapon. 

> One of the other clunky part of the game was unfortunately the FPS. I played with a solid 90 FPS with ultra settings but the clunkiness of the game made me feel like I was playing with 40 FPS. Your movement feels slow, especially the camera speed and angles. Something definitely feels wrong.

> The voice acting: Our main character's voice acting feels so unnatural and forced. I know that voice acting is not an easy job, I have also had voice acting lessons but this is still not an excuse in my eyes. Every other character's voice felt natural, unless when Don Salieri speaks Italian; it felt very weird but other than that I have nothing bad to say about other voice actors. It is only that our protagonist that I have a problem with. 

> The music: The radio on cars were a good touch of the developers, but I would have wished to see a variety for music, especially in action scenes. To be honest, that one action music that plays in every mission and in every scene, whether goofy, sad, or happy or not, I am really bored with it. The last mission of the game should be dramatic, it should have evoked certain emotions in you, but instead we had this same, goofy action music playing on the background, and that's why I didn't feel the emotions that the developers tried to surface inside of me. I wished it could have been better, because that music part was really annoying. 

> One thing that also bothered me was the feeling of ""finishing the game as quickly as possible and move on"". Yes, that was a real issue for me. I can't talk about how other players felt but while I was playing the game I was able to barely tolerate two missions in one day. I just didn't want to play more than two missions because I have had already better games that awaited me around the corner. The game didn't make itself a priority for me like how it would make with other certain games. It turned into a chore for me to finish it, because let's be honest, I didn't want to keep a 50 GB, 10 hours worth video game for what I believed to be mediocre. I am so glad it is finished finally, but that doesn't mean I hate the game and I can't recommend other people when it is on sale. 

Conclusion: If you want to buy a Mafia game, you should definitely buy this one on sale. It is not a bad game. You can see that people behind this project tried their best. And I can say that they have managed to do a decent job, but don't expect a mind-blown experience. It will be a one-shot thing that maybe you will play it once in a year just for memories and action.",1701707395,1701708676,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

[u]Story[/u]
Compared to Mafia 2 & especially Mafia 3, this feels like a proper Mafioso story. Bootleggers trying to get that sweet liquid gold, while doing the occasional illegal act. [spoiler]As well as changing the ending twist for why Tommy & Paulie decide to go against their Don.[/spoiler]
[u]Voice acting[/u] 
Compared to the original, Tommy especially feels vastly improved. No disrespect to the original VA, but in this entry, you can better gauge Tommy's emotions; while in the original, he felt much more one-note.  
[u]Shorter Opening Taxi Section[/u]
The opening taxi section is much, much shorter. Allowing you to get on with the game. 
[u]Being able to skip optional driving[/u] 
Was nice being able to skip these on my Classic playthough, since I went right into that after finishing up getting all the collectibles on my Hard playthrough. 
[u]Gunplay & Cover System[/u]
You dive into cover swift and cleanly; as when you aim and fire.  
[u]Weapon Variety[/u]
Weapon variety isn't too large, yet not too small. Just the right amount that fits the current era. 
[u]Driving[/u]
I played with my transmissions being automatic, not manual. With that said, the driving felt smooth and responsive. I personally felt little to no difference between regular and simulation options, except the race. There you cannot brake as hard, or else you will spin out. 
[u]Movement & Sprint Speed[/u]
Sprint feels like an actual sprint, unlike Mafia 2's light jog. You [b]book it[/b] when you tell Tommy to!
[u]Collectibles Carry Over Playthroughs[/u]
Self-explanatory
[u]Chapter Select & Collectibles[/u]
If you missed any collectibles during a mission, you can simply select the chapter, find it and leave. 
[u]Ending feels much more realistic[/u] 
Unlike the original where it felt like some happy ending, this ones feels much more realistic and subtle. [spoiler]You see Tommy's rage at being sent away for 8 years. As well as the other characters being arrested. And they had Tommy go out with dignity; here he knows he's about to be killed and takes it with a smile.[/spoiler]

[h1]Neutrals[/h1]
[u]Extremely Simplistic Melee System[/u]
The melee system here is even more simplistic than Mafia 2's three button version. Here it's two, with a technical third, if you hold the attack button to do a ""power attack""
[u]Reused finishing animations[/u]
You will see the same finishing animations quite often.  

[h1]Cons[/h1]
[u]Race[/u]
Anyone who has heard about Mafia knows about the dreaded race, and it hasn't changed here. It is just as difficult and time consuming as it was in the original. Only real difference is you don't die from a broken neck, if you roll your car over. But you might as well, as if you crash at all, you're going to lose. No ifs, ands, or buts. You have to be close to perfect in order to win the race. My initial Hard playthrough took me 2 hours. While my Classic took half an hour, which I'm going to credit to me immediately going into it after my Hard playthrough. I understand it's to remain faithful to the Original, but come on... There was no reason that it had to remain as hard as it did.
[u]Death Screen Takes 5 Seconds to complete[/u] 
5 seconds doesn't sound like a lot, but if you're stuck on a section, it can seem like an eternity. 
[u]Some story beats feel odd/missing[/u]
You'll notice there's no real side stuff brought up. You're never really told when Tommy marries Sarah, have a daughter or get their house, unless you're really paying attention to the conversations that can potentially be missed. 
[u]No Backstory on Tommy except at the very end[/u] 
I understand not everyone cares about character's backstories, but it would have been nice to learn some throughout the story. You instead only really learn about Tommy's past if you read notes in his house in the very last chapter. Notes you can miss, if you speed out of his house and go to the Art Gallery. 
[u]No long-term Wanted System[/u]
If you shake the police both on foot and in your vehicle, you'll be free to walk/drive right by the same Police Officers who were chasing you seconds ago and nothing will happen. It would have been nice for the team to implement that same Wanted system as they had in Mafia 2. I.E. Remembering your car's plates or what you look like. My main reason for this criticism is after you [spoiler]assassinate Turnbull,[/spoiler] you can literally run back to where you make your initial entry into the building. Hide there till the police give up their chase and literally run back out where you came in from, past those officers and end the mission. Seems rather silly. 
[u]Fox Collectibles[/u]
These feel unbelievably tacked on and an excuse to make the player explore the map. The countryside, especially. 
[u]Some weapons feel underpowered[/u] 
Tommy Gun takes a quarter to half a magazine to kill via bodyshots. 
Magnum (Yes, a MAGNUM REVOLVER of all guns) takes 3 bodyshots to kill. 
[u]Tommy Gun does not sound tough enough[/u]
One of the most iconic weapons of American history and it sounds like a peashooter. 
[u][spoiler]Joe[/spoiler] looks terrible in the ending cutscene[/u]
This is a nitpick, I know. But c'mon... Tell me he doesn't look awful compared to his original design...

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Despite my large list of cons, it's still a good game that I recommend. Everything is vastly improved, compared to the original release. Only warning is to be ready to edure a hell that is Chapter 4/The Race. Once you get past that, it is smooth sailing.",1701394850,1701632051,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game difficulty (Classic) was just right. I haven't played the original version of this game, but I must say that I felt like there is nothing to complain about. Some missions are really hard on this difficulty (for example the race, which I spent more than an hour on), but it still managed to be fun.

The only thing I can say against this game is the destruction model of the cars, which is very basic compared to the likes of GTA and other AAA games. But nothing to worry about.

However, the biggest flaw is in the city itself, as it was much more immersive in the first game, encouraging exploration in between missions and offering nice details such as functioning train stations.
There are several other missing details, such as the possibility to take a shortcut during the car race (which is still very hard tho, at least on max diffculty), and, overall, it feels like they butchered this open world masterpiece, which was ahead of his time, to end up with a mediocre linear game.",1701625025,1701625025,False,17,1,0.587307989597320557,0,True,False,False

Neutral would be much more fitting, but alas, no such option exists. The story is genuinely incredible. But I cannot, in good conscience, recommend a game that feels as incomplete and botched as this one does. The reality is, this game is more like a movie, except every couple of minutes you have to play a jank-ass minigame to progress.

The story really is the biggest thing this game has going for it; perfect for those who love those typical mob vibes. Now I must say, the old version's gameplay was downright horrific; janky engine, unintuitive controls, the whole lot. So I think it's safe to say that the Definitive Edition has come leaps and bounds over the original in some respects. 

However, I would be lying if I said its gameplay is good by any metric; there are many glaring issues that make it frustrating to play at best. The engine is jank as all hell, the controls have stupid mappings (and changing them makes certain enemies unkillable, ask me how I know), and the god-awful mouse acceleration cannot be turned off and makes shooting a disgustingly bad experience, to name a few. Overall, they did make [i] some [/i] progress towards fixing these issues over the original game, but it feels more like a low effort reskin of an old game, rather than a fix of the archaic museum piece that Mafia is. 

Mafia II was a far better game, in my opinion, in almost every respect, and I do think that anyone looking to experience the thrills like Mafia II's again will be disappointed in Mafia: DE. Just about every part of this game is frustrating and immersion breaking; the fistfighting is clunky, the controls don't make any sense, and the enemies don't seem very balanced. Most games will make you tougher to compensate for how many enemies you have to kill. For whatever reason, it feels like Mafia has taken the opposite approach, making you eat sh*t with every bullet you take, while you get nothing but your limp d*ck. It makes it very hard not to die, and this game will make you sit through 20 seconds of watching Tommy flop to the ground, followed by the most braindead loading screen known to man before letting you get back into action. There are a couple missions that beg to reduce their difficulty, because beating them is not a challenge, it's a middle finger to you and your skills. 

Now I cannot entirely blame the devs for the way this game feels. It is reminiscent of the original Mafia's gameplay experience, and this presents the dilemma: do they keep some of the original ([i] highly [/i] questionable) design choices to be truthful to the original game, or do they change them to emulate a better execution (like Mafia II's), thus sacrificing the identity of the game, and perhaps even the freshness of experiencing a new playstyle? Me personally, I don't consider the jank to be part of the original charm, so keeping it around is not a plus. But they managed to cut a bunch of what made the older game as immersive as it was, like side quests, the driving missions, the enterable shops and public transport. All of the worldbuilding that was [i] already done for them [/i] was just tossed away, and the game feels a lot more barebones because of it.

The graphics and sounds truly are better than the original by miles; this is doubly so the case the cars. But I feel like I'm mostly just spending time comparing this game to its predecessor, which, regrettably, speaks volumes to the execution of this remaster, let alone to its merit as a standalone game. I want to like it, because good mob stories just fill that gap in the heart. But to rework a game as much as they did, and for [i] this [/i] to be all that they have to show for it, I am not impressed.",1701569741,1701569741,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The biggest problem for me is some of the missions bug out and cut scenes repeat. At first, I thought it would stop after the first one, but then on the second and third missions/cut scenes the characters would start talking and then the sound would go silent or freeze and then the scene would repeat two or three times before progress and there's no way to skip through.
I don't think it's my machine as I have a top of the line graphics card, ram etc.
Frustrating and game breaking.
Because of this, despite the fact I love the action, game play and storyline, I have to give a no recomenndation.

✅ The graphics, lighting and reflections are well done
✅ The palette of colors and their saturation reflecting the atmosphere of those years
✅ City atmosphere. Through collectibles and radio messages, you can feel the specter of Black Thursday or uncertainty related to Hitler's aspirations
✅Decent optimization
✅Simulation driving mode, which can be felt most when racing or riding a motorcycle 
✅Appearance of first aid kits known from the original
✅Collectibles in the form of comics and cigarette cards with well-known heroes (in the time period from the first part of Mafia) of the cities of Lost Haven, Empire Bay, New Bordeaux and 2 new ones
✅Radio news reporting not only on the Lost Haven situation (related to our actions), but also on Empire Bay
✅Developing several side characters, e.g. during the mission Visiting the Rich
✅An extensive plot of Sara and her entire character
✅The character of Tommy, Frank and the character of Sam in the final stages of the game
✅All additional cutscenes that enrich the game and expand the story and characters
✅Extended ending and course of Intermezzo inserts
✅Changed the flow of some missions to better fit the concept of the remake
✅ Maintaining the focused core of the original story
✅Chemistry between characters

➖Dubbing and models of some characters
➖No introduction or preparation for Jobs on the Side, just jumping straight into the action
➖The fact that we can hear the police radio and the fact that every pedestrian will magically always notify the police about the incident and every patrol will immediately recognize us because they know who did it
➖All you need to do is enter a specific car model once, and then each car you encounter in the city will be immediately opened with the engine ready to start + after learning how to open a car with a lockpick, Tommy will open every car
➖The hero's ambidexterity. Since receiving his first gun, Tommy has become a master of shooting it with both his right hand and his left hand

I've been pondering this question when I played this cinematic triumph from beginning to the credits and while everything is covered it still misses that tiny detail what made original Mafia so special - and yet again I could state that this remake trusts on its own values and doesn't stick in 20 years old formula. 

Speaking of formula, one big difference between the games is a racing mission, that really reflects the distance between the games in a bigger picture as well. In this Definitive Edition it was many times more arcade - still challenging, but much more forgiving. If you made f.ex. a tiny mistake and hit the wall no harm done and back the track but in original Mafia the axle between the tire and trunk would bend causing wobbling tire and ruining the race. More laughable thing in the game was that if your car turns over you can use your Baron von Munchausen powers and magically flip the vehicle on its right side. In original of course this led to brutal death for poor Tommy being crushed between the track and the seat.

So I do say that the Definitive Edition is made much more user friendly, also the checkpoints are pretty frequent and losing the cops is much simpler and even less enjoyable. However this comes with the pros as well - fighting system isn't perfect, but still a lot better than random change of fists in the first one, also many of the unnecessary dull parts have been cut like planning of the bank robbery for in the remake it is much more smoother and the whole episode can be done swifter than the loong travel with the Paulie in the original. Shame that they erased Yellow Pete. Not to mention the Free Ride Extreme mode. They really did not hesitate to use the scissors for dozens of miles of driving has been completely erased, replaced by cutscenes, saving passive playtime for some, but taking away fun exploring time from others. Many cases when I sighted something missing I felt controversial - I did not like it always, but occasionally I understood the changes. I never were mad, but more like baffled. What I can't forgive that I never heard Django Reinhardt's 'Belleville' from the radio though.

And what about the tiny detail, which I mentioned in the beginning? How to define that? Is it the nostalgia? Perhaps, but I believe it is more in how they changed the story's philosophy. What made Mafia so unforgettable masterpiece was the story of doing right and wrong, being a good or bad person, is the love and friendship worth shit? Changes in script has ripped a hole into the game's soul, but has been replaced with something that is as worthy as the matter which is now gone. There is no knots and loose ends are shut.

I'd like to image original Mafia as elder Don seeing his legacy being turned more glamorous than ever before, but missing the respect and honor which were very fond to him. However, this young gogetter Remake sees that all of it is still in there, respecting the legacy, but making the details into its own image. This is Mafia of the third decade standing on its own feet and the original 2002 one remains still one of the best games ever done! If I were you I'd play both of them through and then decide.",1701296478,1701374449,True,10,0,0.625883400440216064,0,True,False,False

There is also the option to change difficulties at any point however changing from classic to anything else and then back again will get rid of the ""Win Classic Mode"" badge thing.

The game brings you back to the 1930's in America with it being historically accurate - from the drinking bans to the mafia gang break outs - it accurately depicts the life of Italian bandits during the great Depression and takes you through the story of Tommy Angelo with flash forwards to bring his story together.  The game took you through twists and turns, heartbreaks and betrayal and I loved how they pulled everything together at the end. 

The game's graphics were really good with the characters looking almost human like in the cut scenes (obviously you could tell they were from a game) and continued to be this good throughout the whole game. I did have a problem with the end scene/ epilogue which was glitching a bit though. Even the mouths moving looked like they were actually saying the words which made the game more realistic. It was the perfect mix between story and action!


""Remember that money, jobs, even best pals will come and go. But family? Family is forever."" - Tommy Angelo

SPOILER: The epilogue was my favourite bit I think. Just the fact that we saw Sarah and Tommy get old together and Tommy walking their daughter down the isle melted my heart. I loved how they made his speech cover the scenes that were happening in the background so not only did we know what happened to Tommy and Sarah, we also knew what happened to other people - I also loved the sound affects and the sombre music that was playing among his speech. The last bit did break my heart though with Tommy dying but it also somewhat brings the whole thing together, especially with the whole family surrounding him at the end comparing that to him being a lonely taxi driver with no one at the beginning.",1701281619,1701281619,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

That clarification out of the way: this is a solid remake I'd recommend to most people over the original (which is really the highest praise I can give a remake). TL;DR it's a solid 8/10 with a great story that has been retold with skill and reverence for the original. Not perfect, but worth the 14 hours I spent.

Now, for those who like more detail, let's get into the weeds.

There's some Eurojank in here, namely the AI is pretty rough when it comes to anything (combat, traffic, heck even just pedestrians crossing the street act weird) and also the movement system isn't as polished as something you'd get in a Rockstar game. But, those flaws aside it's a well done retelling of pretty solid video game plot for the time it was released. You may feel something by the end of this, and while that feeling may be frustration at some of the later segments of the game when the rough edges of the movement system and AI start to show themselves as the challenges ramp up, it's much more likely it will be a feeling of sorrow at the fate of the trio of men at the center of the story's narrative.

And narrative is king here, the gameplay doesn't overstay it's welcome unless you drop into the free ride sandbox mode (which is pretty fun, do recommend checking it out, a good place to practice driving if you're struggling as well). The game it's self is a quick ride, I beat it in about 14 hours according to steam and that's including time messing around in sandbox. The story is what you're paying your ticket for, as are the generally nice visuals. Voice acting is solid as well and specifically I really like Paulie's voice actor who made me care way more about the character than I did in my run of the original (though I do miss Tommy's original voice actor, guy was aces).

Gameplay-wise the shooting is passable, but really what makes this game worth a recommendation over the original is the inclusion of more modern systems such as cover and improved stealth. The original was an ambitious game and would lay the groundwork for titles like GTA:SA that would add stealth systems to the open world crime genre, but suffice to say those clunky old stealth systems that feel like they were made in an afternoon of coding can be rough today. This system isn't the best but is solid enough that I found myself rarely reloading due to botched stealth, probably a bit too forgiving but for a more casual game like this that's just right really.

Driving is phenomenal and you can tell is the part of the engine they spent the most time on (which is funny because then they let you skip driving to and between missions like they were ashamed of it, that poor programmer haha). Specifically I really liked the manual drive and recommend playing that way if you want a little more challenge. Learning what gear does what on what terrain was a cool revelation moment and felt very natural aside from me ALWAYS forgetting how to reverse for a quarter second (I blame decades of GTA). It takes getting used to and the real test was that race but it adds a lot of character to the driving, and is very true to the original experience. Also of note is that not every car has the same handling or gear set-up, which really adds another nice level of detail to the world. For example the slick four door luxury in 2nd gear is gonna be going pretty fast while at the same time getting good handling for hills and turns, meanwhile the clunky work truck in 2nd is gonna struggle to get speed but will handle pretty nicely (and it's 3rd gear will be closer to the luxury's 2nd).

Mission structure is pretty solid. Unless I'm mistaken they removed some stuff from the original and also added a bit, but for the most part it hits the same important beats. Some of the changes felt unneeded, but some of the narrative ones felt like they added a lot.

In the end every remake is going to have issues, you can't recreate a game decades after it's release and end up with the exact same product. We will see if this changes because of modern games being so polished, but I have my doubts any true remake will ever be 1:1. Teams change, times change, and people change. The trick with Remakes is recapturing that original spirit and remaining largely true to the original vision while innovating and changing enough to reinvigorate the experience.

Mafia: Definitive Edition manages to deliver what seems to be an increasingly hard thing these days; A captivating solid remake of the original that stays true to the source while knowing what it wanted to accomplish too.

The period setting feels alive and is great to be in. The gameplay is pretty basic and the game is over fairly quickly. I would recommend you get it on sale with deep discount - I picked it up with Mafia 2 & 3 definitive editions for a low price.

The gameplay is a little stale but generally fine. The driving doesn't feel too good but it was tolerable. The gunfighting is rather basic although generally clicky and enjoyable enough. Although I didn't love it, it kind of serves its purpose as an engine for the story.

I didn't play the original Mafia, judging from other reviews the scale was a bit grander and there was more in the way of open world gameplay and side quests. Playing this version, it does feel a bit hollowed out and I did get the sense that something was missing.

It plays fine on Linux with Proton-GE. I didn't even need a workaround for the launcher.

Finally, just a comment on the racing level as I see a lot of people are moaning about it. I thought it was stupid and out of place, but it isn't that hard or that bad.

I want to say something for Mafia 1. After all, the game released in 2002, it has gone almost 20 years until the remake version released in 2020. You can't require more to the game which published almost 20 years ago. It's not fair to let it compared with the series of GTA.
Looking at the graphic performance of remake edition, it is awesome, I think is an key factor to make people could go on playing the game which's gameplay lags behind current games.

I like the graphics, the map is so beautiful and each scene is well done. But I'm not a fan of the story is kind of standard nothing really too special. Overall I like all the missions but they are quite similar.
Very few weapons, and I really don't like all actions map to a single button, reload, open doors, first-aid or pick up stuffs are all button x.
And its actually a linear game, yes you can drive around town wherever you want but there is nothing you can do on the map other than driving or maybe get five star and get away, I will say is more like a interaction movie.
The driving system is amazing if you like driving around on a beautiful map this is the game to go with.

The graphics and environment are absolutely stunning. Yet, the game feels stripped of purposes to explore. Storyline no longer takes you all around the city; Many driving of the missions are skipped with cutscenes; The side quests from Lucas Bertone are gone. The public transport from the original are barred from us now. All in all it's a shame that the developers cut these contents that make the original so beloved.

In fact, imo, the DE lacks details of the original level. Of course, the city and the graphics give much more details visually. But the details in the stories and the details in the gameplay are gone. Replacing them are the overtly-hand holding that makes the game feels more like a film. The original shines as it allows you to make your own choices from time to time; For instance, in the mission Molotov party, you can choose to block the backdoor of the bar with a crate to earn yourself a few more minutes before you wreck the cars. In the same mission, a better car that you can collect is hidden in a garage. The remake, however, directly point you to that car. Another example is Visiting Rich People, in the origin you can have Salvatore to pick the prosecutor's car for you (which also teaches you how to pick that specific car). This is entirely optional and requires player's thinking. Or in the Running Man, where u can tell a lady who is waiting in an alley that her date got the address wrong as you found him earlier in another similar alley. In Definitive Edition? These are all gone. The mission feels short as it forcefully holds your hand and strips you of freedom to explore the levels. This strips players like me the sense of achievement when I finish the mission in different ways (and succeed in doing so).

I like the developers' attempt to give characters more depth. But the drastic change in terms of personalities sometimes feels a bit too much. The reduction of missions doesn't help either as characters feels much less relatable, namely Ralph and Lucas. Especially since their function in game is mostly gone now. However, I do applaud the developers's effort in trying to give more insights of the era with the additional or changed dialogue.

Mafia 3's combat system is not something I like at all, but it is acceptable. With the classic difficulties, it does prove to be a fun challenge to manage your resources. So I would say the gun play is much more modern and enjoyable than the original.

All in all, Mafia: Definitive Edition has its merits, but loses on many other aspects that made the original Mafia so praised and loved. The game feels rushed, and there are many contents that felt like they were cut at the last minute. I recommend waiting for a sale at least at 50%.

Edit #1: Grammar, spellings, etc. Confirmed that in Running Man you can talk to the lady; My mistakes, and many thanks to @steve who mentioned it in the comment.",1700761532,1700761532,True,2,0,0.415584444999694824,0,True,True,False

How can a AAA studio fuck up this bad. The game is shallow and the world feels empty, the animations are lazy and break all the time, they managed to botch the melee combat too and aiming feels like I'm dragging my mouse through rough sand. 

The gun play is terrible and the weapons have no impact to them. Most of the time I feel like I'm using a pea shooter.
I couldn't keep up with the story with how much the game broke throughout my game sessions, the scripting is done in a lazy manner and you see it in play all time which breaks the immersion immensely.

I can't understand how a trash release like this can get praise and approval by critics and gamers alike , it just shows how much the gaming industry has fallen.

I was leading by the first lap, if anything I thought it could be a bit more difficult. I think those people just don't understand what braking zones, wheel spin, and racing lines are. Would've loved to see a racing side activity which allows the player to race anytime. The story is the main appeal of the game, although it is shorter than I would've hoped for.

Low on features, dead open world with little to no interactivity. I realize Hangar 13 wanted to keep faithful to the original, but damn add some side activities or open world interactivity! Most annoying parts are the stealth missions with terrible stealth mechanics, they are almost exactly the same as the MJ missions in Spider-man PS4, except there is no way to distract guards, and someone usually always has line of sight on you.

Overall Mafia II is still a much better game. Hangar 13 had the chance to make this something truly special, but it seems they were burnt out after designing the open world.

It's a faithful recreation of the original game. Visuals are stunning, acting is on point and the city is immersive. Also having ""Classic"" difficulty setting is amazing, reason being is that it makes the game feel more like the original.

Definitely the best Mafia game by far.

At the end of the day, this is just a game from 2002 with a fresh coat of paint. And that coat of paint is very very good don't get me wrong (see GTA definitive editions for an example of the same idea executed horribly), but the core gameplay feels very dated to me. My biggest gripe here is with gunplay. It's just so unsatisfying. You'll shoot an enemy anywhere but the head and he won't even react to it. Feels like my guy is firing an airsoft gun not a deadly firearm. I was willing to excuse dated level design on account of the game being 20 years old, but the gunplay and clunky movement should have been fixed in the remaster. 

At the end of the day it was fun, but I get the feeling of a lot of missed potential. The open world is so cool and interesting to look at from afar, but there's really not much to it, it's just a backdrop. The story is great and well written, but the gameplay doesn't really excite that much. I'd recommend if it's on sale but otherwise I think you'd be better off just watching The Godfather or Goodfellas.",1700529459,1700529459,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Mafia is a gangster epidemic set in 1930s America, offering a vivid narrative and a stunning setting. Its gameplay is linear, primarily focusing on shooting, dodging and finding cover- interspersed with segments of driving. The remake features excellent performances from a new cast, my favourites being Paulie and The Don.

Sadly, the free-roam mode offers limited activities, and the game’s length is not particularly extensive- I finished pretty comfortably in 6-7 hours. 

I would recommend for those interested in mafia stories or the 1930s era, but it may not stand out to players seeking a more dynamic open-world experience or innovative gameplay.

Mafia 1 was probably my most liked game from the olden days. This, is however a dumbed down version of an original game. Somehow, 20 years later after initial Mafia release they are able to release a worse game than 20 years ago.
1) driving is garbage, feels unintuitive, no real difference between cars, no feeling you get when you get a newer car
2) police/gang getaway system is just abhorrent, these ""objects"" were placed in the map for you to be able to lose the cops/gangs instantly if you drive into these objects, which gives you a ""cinematic"" and they crash in it every time. Wtf is even that
3) AI is constantly trying to get you into collision, if you are going trough an intersection, the AI will stop the car and start moving again if you are going in front of it. Same with pedestrians. Wtf is this garbage
4) Map is smaller than 20 years ago. How is this even possible?
5) Shooting mechanics are also just worse than in the initial game. How can you create a game 20 years later with this kind of shit shooting mechanic seen in godfather games? AI hit with bullets just shrug it off and keep going, unless you hit them with the shotty and just delete them. No decent physics when hit with bullets, 20 year old game had that, but not this one. The AI just numbfuckingly charging in front of you.
6) The storymode is just going from one cutscene to another, no more driving to a mission, no more experiencing the world itself, just 20sec max of going to the next cutscene
7) The characters all look the same, if you looked at Sam Paulie and Tommie, they all look the fucking same, you would have to come face-to-face to see who it actually is. Also all the cutscenes are filled with unnecessary bullshit like 50 different ways Don Salieri chews on a fucking cigar. How about making characters that look distinct? Also they look nothing like they used to look in the original game, especially consigliere Frank Colleti, which suppose to be Italian, but he looks like hes a nazi german scientist.
8) The controls can make you vommit (cannot change them) Q to hit meele, left control to take cover, page up to change weapons. Whoever created these is a halfwit",1700308062,1700308062,False,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

The game promised a nostalgic journey through the world of organized crime, but it ultimately left me frustrated and disappointed, thanks in no small part to the abysmal race mission.

Let's start with the gameplay mechanics, which are a mess. The controls feel clunky and unresponsive, making it incredibly challenging to navigate through the poorly designed streets of Lost Heaven. The handling of the vehicles is downright atrocious, with a lack of precision that leads to constant collisions and frustration. It's as if the developers wanted to recreate the feel of driving a tank rather than a classic car.

Now, let's address the elephant in the room—the race mission. This particular segment of the game is an absolute disaster. The difficulty level is outrageously high, and it seems the developers completely overlooked the fact that players should enjoy the game, not suffer through it. The rubber-banding AI is infuriating, as opponents magically catch up and overtake you, no matter how flawlessly you drive. The result is a maddening loop of frustration that forces players to replay the same section ad nauseam.

To make matters worse, the race mission is a clear example of poor game design. The narrow streets and tight turns make it nearly impossible to maintain any kind of lead, and the constant need for flawless execution leaves no room for strategic or enjoyable gameplay. It's a shame that such a poorly designed mission tarnishes what could have been a decent remake of a classic title.

All in all, Mafia: Definitive Edition falls short of its promise, and the horrible race mission is a glaring example of the game's failings. The frustrating gameplay mechanics and lackluster design choices make it difficult to recommend this title to anyone seeking an enjoyable gaming experience. Save yourself the headache and look elsewhere for a more satisfying trip down memory lane.",1700294612,1700294612,False,5,0,0.510996878147125244,0,True,False,False

I recently had the pleasure of diving into the world of Mafia: Definitive Edition, and I must say, it exceeded all my expectations. Purchased at a mere $10 during a fantastic discount, this remake of the original Mafia is an absolute steal.

From the moment I started playing, it was evident that Hangar 13 put a tremendous amount of effort into revitalizing this classic title. The graphics are stunning, breathing new life into the city of Lost Heaven with meticulous attention to detail. The character models, environments, and even the vintage cars exude a level of authenticity that immerses you completely in the 1930s setting.

The narrative, which was already a strong point in the original Mafia, has been masterfully reimagined. The storytelling is gripping, with well-developed characters and a plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Voice acting is top-notch, capturing the essence of the era and the personalities of each character. The cinematic sequences are a treat to watch, seamlessly blending with the gameplay to create a truly cinematic experience.

Gameplay-wise, Mafia: Definitive Edition strikes a perfect balance between modern gaming conveniences and the nostalgic feel of the original. The controls are intuitive, making it easy for both newcomers and fans of the original to pick up and play. The shooting mechanics are satisfying, and the driving sequences are a joy, offering a mix of exhilarating chases and leisurely rides through the beautifully crafted city.

What truly sets this remake apart is the love and respect it pays to the source material. The developers have not only enhanced the visuals and gameplay but also retained the essence of what made the original Mafia a classic. The attention to detail in recreating the atmosphere, music, and even the little nuances of the characters' movements showcases a deep understanding and appreciation for the original game.

Considering the depth of content, the quality of the remake, and the sheer enjoyment I've derived from Mafia: Definitive Edition, the $10 price tag feels like daylight robbery (in a good way!). It's a testament to the developers' commitment to delivering an outstanding gaming experience without breaking the bank.

In conclusion, if you're a fan of the original Mafia or someone looking to experience a gripping crime drama in a beautifully reimagined world, Mafia: Definitive Edition is an absolute must-buy, especially when snagged at such an incredible discount. Don't miss out on this gem that seamlessly blends the best of the past with the conveniences of the present gaming landscape. It's a journey back in time that's well worth the investment!",1700265282,1700265349,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The original game (even though it looked impressive for its era) looks like something you would order from Wish compared to this game.

The game is very faithful to its original with a few additions to help you discover sub-plots or some scenes that felt underwhelming. The voice lines are completely new, the motion capture quality is insane (not uncharted 4 level but it's still damn good), there are new locations to discover, new secrets to find... pretty much every single thing is brand new except the story. I was not a strong fan of the original game, always liked the second game more but with this new game, I feel like now I can embrace it with all its glory. 

The optimization is all over the place, it's a bit dicey whether you'll have a problem or not but if you stick around for a couple of hours, the game can easily compensate for the annoying issues. If you have a 144hz monitor with an Nvidia GPU, what you need to do is > 
Open the Nvidia Control Panel > Manage 3D Settings > Program Settings > Either add manually or select the game from the menu > Change preferred refresh rate to highest available. This will allow you to play the game (or rather allow you to) fullscreen 144hz. Otherwise, it sends you back to the desktop unless you Alt+Enter and open windowed mode.

And finally, the car race part is still extremely annoying if you don't change the driving settings to regular from simulation. You might lose a couple of hours getting frustrated for nothing.

Honestly just setting the speed limiter on and driving to a mission with jazz on the radio is so relaxing and enjoyable, more so than any other game I've played of late.

Okay, so most of the main gameplay loop is basically driving around and cover shooting, with small stealth-ish sections. But the game does this really well, and is very convincing as a period piece. With a good plot that moves along briskly in just 20 missions including some really action-packed set pieces, the game doesn't last long enough to feel too repetitive. It's also a fairly accessible game that most people could easily finish on Easy/Medium i completed on Classic (Most difficult setting)

If you'd love a good ol' shoot-em-up with a solid gangster story, without any complicated gameplay mechanics and a million side quests, this is the game for you. I just finished the game today and I'm pretty sure I'll replay it at some point.

-Graphics and environment detail are great
-Voice Acting and facial animations are pretty good too.

Cons:
-Bad performance
-No activities or side-missions in the so called open-world. The game is basically 100% linear with the city only serving as a background.
-Set pieces during missions are clunky, buggy or downright broken. If you diverge even slightly from the intended path the missions mostly fall apart.
-No character customization whatsoever from what I've experienced.
-Controls are horrible for mouse+keyboard and key rebinds offer only very basic options. (Who had the brilliant idea of toggling back from WALK to RUN every time you stop moving? Completely ridiculous).

Bought this on sale and, even so, I regret my purchase. Would recommend only if you absolutely adore the setting of NY in the 30's and are willing to put up with a bad performing, linear, clunky and shallow console port.

The plot is simple and effective, with themes of honor-among-thieves, the wages-of-sin, and conflicting loyalties. The level design is top notch with multiple memorable scenes.

In the technical aspect, the game is good enough. It looks and plays ok but not great and has the occasional bug.

The notorious racing mission is still there and takes getting used to.

Mafia (2002) was a landmark title in its realistic and polished approach to the gameworld and the plot. The remake is good for what it is without really innovating. Rating 7.5/10.

The game was not even mine. It was a second hand present from my old cousin who loved it and recommended it to try it. I was 12 back then (yes, underage, sue me ;))

Almost two decades later, we had the opportunity to relive the original (and great) story with updated graphics, and the experience was overall very satisfactory.

The story presents slight tweaks on the story, which were not needed, and I would personally have enjoyed more an even more replica of the original drama, but the new one is quite nice nonetheless. The graphics are more than sufficient to appreciate the beauty of NY (Or Lost Heaven) of the early 30s, and the gameplay satisfies but does not reinvent. I don't need reinvention on a remake, so works for me.

The cars are beautiful, and the feeling of entering accidentally in the Salieri Family is as interesting as it ever was.

The one thing I miss on this remake, is the Free Ride and Free Ride Extreme. They were great additions, specially the later. A reinvented game mode for that would have been cherry on top.

[list]
[*] Amazing graphics (the nights are simply a treat for the eyes).
[*] Good soundtrack.
[*] Redesigned game mechanics only complement the atmosphere of the 1930s.

[h3] Cons [/h3]
[list]
[*] There are differences in some plot points with the original Mafia.
[*] Side missions are completed very quickly, and then the game begins for those who will enjoy a simple drive through an American city in the 1930s.

[h3] Conclusion [/h3]
If you are a fan of the original Mafia, then the game may disappoint you in terms of the plot, but not in terms of graphics or the world itself (as you progress through the story). If you have not played the 2002 Mafia before, sure, play the remake, and then if Tommy’s story touches you, maybe you’ll decide to go through the original and understand why the same old Mafia of 2002 is so loved.",1699818137,1699819475,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

As Tommy Angelo, a cab driver unexpectedly drawn into the Salieri crime family, players navigate a gripping tale of loyalty, betrayal, and redemption. The game, rebuilt from the ground up, boasts modern graphics, enhanced gameplay, and new features like a free ride mode and collectibles, capturing the era's essence through authentic cars, weapons, music, and outfits. It's a cinematic experience for fans of the original and newcomers alike, standing as a remarkable remake in the action-adventure genre.

However, the game isn't without its drawbacks. One notable issue is its length; Mafia: Definitive Edition is relatively short compared to other games in its genre. This brevity might leave players wanting more, especially those accustomed to expansive open-world games with numerous side quests and a lengthy main storyline. The game's focus on the main quest, while ensuring a tightly knit and story-driven experience, also means there's a lack of side quests. This absence of additional content can be seen as a missed opportunity to explore more of the richly recreated world and its characters.

While the main quest is excellently crafted and provides a compelling narrative, the game's short duration and lack of side content might not satisfy players seeking a more prolonged gaming experience with ample exploration opportunities. In this respect, Mafia: Definitive Edition might feel limited to those who enjoy diving deep into side quests and spending many hours in a game world.

In summary, Mafia: Definitive Edition excels in delivering a visually stunning and narratively engaging experience that faithfully captures the spirit of the 1930s and the original game. However, its relatively short playtime and the absence of side quests may leave some players desiring more content and depth. Despite this, it remains a must-play for fans of the series and those who appreciate action-adventure games with a strong focus on storytelling.",1699640710,1699725443,True,0,1,0,1,True,False,False

It might work for those who never played Mafia, but if you can perceive the old graphics and get into the old product, this one is unequivocally worse.

Regularly you will find that Hangar 13, for unknown reasons, those or other moments just cut or simplify. Embedding a personal 2K launcher and bandle ads inside the game.

Time goes by and the bots have only gotten easier on classic difficulty, making missions without any kind of challenge. You just go through the movie from cutscene to cutscene.

I'll probably just ditch the remaster and replay Mafia Lost Haven all over again.

I was especially not happy with the car physics, it's atrocious. I love the car physics in Mafia 2, Mafia Lost Haven, but here it's just awful. Didn't check on other difficulties, but the classic one is just fucked.

I played on gamepad, and on the mission already with the race, I just have a problem to turn, when in Mafia 2 and other parts, physics creates difficulty, but does not create an artificial problem, you drive a car that has its own traction. Here fucking turns at an angle, after which it is unclear why the car carries.

The voiceover, just as if they ran neuroset and did not improve in any way, years have passed, and on one of the most important parts for the atmosphere, just nailed. 

It would be very good if this remaster was just a reskin, with improvement of some moments.",1699579207,1699707518,False,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

The original Mafia game was an exceptional title, but this Definitive Edition takes a classic and elevates it to something truly extraordinary. While the game remains true to the original storyline, its significant enhancements in various aspects make it a compelling experience for both newcomers and those familiar with the original.

[h3]Enhanced Controls and Accessibility[/h3]

One of the notable improvements in the Definitive Edition is the game's control mechanism. The controls are more intuitive and responsive, significantly enhancing the gameplay experience. The seamless transition between a controller and keyboard/mouse, including the updated in-game button icons, adds a layer of user-friendly design that is much appreciated. This flexibility, particularly when switching from foot to vehicle sections, elevates the gaming experience.

[h3]Audio and Music Upgrades[/h3]

The audio in the Definitive Edition has been meticulously upgraded. The music remains faithful to the original’s tone but has been beautifully remastered, resulting in a richer and more immersive auditory experience. The enhanced sound quality adds depth to every scene, drawing players deeper into the game's atmospheric world.

[h3]Storytelling and Character Depth[/h3]

While the core content of the game remains unchanged, there are subtle yet impactful enhancements in how the story is told and how the characters are developed. These changes add more depth to the characters and give a fresh perspective to the narrative, enriching the overall storytelling experience. This aspect makes the game even more engaging, especially for those who are revisiting the story from the original game.

[h3]Graphic Excellence and Cityscape Visualization[/h3]

A standout feature of the Definitive Edition is the stunning graphical overhaul. The city, a central element of the game, is breathtakingly realized with meticulous attention to detail. The lighting, textures, and overall visual presentation are of the highest quality, making every part of the city, from quiet alleys to bustling streets, come alive. This attention to graphical detail extends to character models, vehicles, and environmental elements, creating a cohesive and immersive world that is both visually impressive and highly engaging.

[h3]Performance[/h3]

On the technical front, the game performs exceptionally well. Running the game at max settings in 1440p on a 5700XT results in smooth, uninterrupted gameplay. This level of performance ensures that players can fully enjoy the beautifully recreated world of Mafia without technical distractions.

[h3]Conclusion[/h3]

Mafia: Definitive Edition is not merely a remaster but a comprehensive overhaul that significantly enhances an already great game. The combination of improved visuals, refined controls, enhanced audio, and deeper storytelling makes it a must-play title. Whether you are experiencing Mafia for the first time or revisiting this classic, the Definitive Edition offers a complete, immersive, and nostalgic experience that stands out as a benchmark for how remakes should be done.",1699533302,1699533302,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Mafia Definitive Edition is a game that's got me all nostalgic and excited about the gangster world of the 1930s, but it's not without its share of hiccups. Here's my take on this remastered classic:

First of all, the visual overhaul in Mafia Definitive Edition is nothing short of impressive. The city of Lost Heaven looks stunning, and the attention to detail is astonishing. The characters, cars, and even the clothing feel like they've been transported straight from the '30s. It's a love letter to the era, and I couldn't be happier with how it looks.

The story is where Mafia truly shines. Tommy Angelo's journey from a simple cab driver to a feared mobster is compelling and engaging. The narrative is gripping, and the voice acting is top-notch. It's like being in a classic gangster movie, and I couldn't get enough of it.

However, there are a few rough edges. The gameplay, while generally solid, can feel a bit dated at times. Gunfights can be a tad frustrating, with some wonky hit detection, and the AI of both your allies and enemies leaves something to be desired. The controls, especially on a controller, can take some getting used to.

Another minor complaint is the lack of modern quality-of-life features. Fast travel could have been a real time-saver, and the mission structure, while well-crafted, can sometimes feel a bit repetitive.

In the end, Mafia Definitive Edition is a fantastic experience if you're looking for a slice of the '30s gangster life. The story and visuals are its strong suits, but it does stumble a bit in the gameplay department. If you can overlook these minor issues and are ready for a trip back in time, this game is well worth the ride. Just remember, it's not without its share of bumps on the road to the top.

Not only that, but they also stripped away some stuff that was in the original Mafia too.

There's no clothing stores or gun shops, no gas stations, no ""free time"" in between missions to drive around the city letting engulf yourself with the atmospheric sorroundings while listening to the soundtrack. Which I might add, is lacking some of the best tunes from the original.

Atmosphere is a very big and important aspect of this franchise, and some decisions regarding that feel a bit underwhelming in this remake...

I know some of those features weren't in the original and I can see how some might argue that they neither belong in the remake. 

But from my perspective it wouldn't have hurt to include these new things that, if anything, would've only made the experience more rounded and satisfying than it is right now.

It feels like they just took the quickest and safest route possible: just copy exactly every mission from Mafia and remake it in a new engine. There's little to none in terms of innovation. 

Though to give them some credit, some missions are much more improved than in the original. For instance, A Trip to the Country, which was amazingly done. While others, like Moonlighting, have been dumbed down a lot and you can tell.

Overall, not a bad remake, just a bit disappointing and not what I expected. I'd say is worth it, especially now that it goes on discount a lot.",1624854457,1699289828,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

Out with the old and in with the new, eh? Mafia: Definitive edition breathes a whole new breath of life into a game we all thought we would never see again. A remaster of the 2002 classic, is is worth your time, or your dough? Lets get into it.

[h1] [b] The Good [/b] [/h1]

[b] [*] The Graphics [/b]

- Rarely ever my first point, but in a remaster of this caliber? Oh yeah, its a big point. This game was originally released in 2002... which is about nineteen years ago. This is an [i] old [/i] game. Point is, we're talking about a game that had around PS2 or original Xbox level quality, for reference. It looked just horrible. Somehow, through what I imagine to be a horrifying amount of work, it has been turned into one of the most beautiful and realistic games that I've played this year. It literally is just a whole new game now. 

[b] [*] The Story and Characters [/b]

- There's nothing quite like a game with an enthralling story and characters that both warm your heart, and dig in under your skin. Mafia is one of these rare games, a game that truly captures the essence of humanity. No cheap, gimmicky characters that are just two-dimensional stereotypes. Each and every character has depth, and much more to the that meets the eye. Truly a master of storytelling. 

[b] [*]The World [/b]

- I'm a sucker for a good setting. Taking place in the city of Lost Heaven, Mafia gives the player a whole new wide-open world for them to explore, along with a special game-mode called ""freeride"" which is purely focused on exploration. Its a big, beautiful world out there, and its yours to explore. 

[b] [*]The Ranged Combat [/b]

- The Mafia game's are known for their combat, specifically just how fun and simple they make blowing someone away. This remaster just makes it a bit more fun, with new weapon mechanics applied and updated combat to make gunning down the rival gangs and police of Lost Heaven just that bit more fun. You might wonder why I mentioned the ranged combat specifically, well...

[h1] [b] The Bad [/b] [/h1]

[b] [*] The Melee Combat [/b]

- It is just... atrocious. On the ""good"" side, it is literally just spamming Q, or whatever key you bind. On the bad side, it is completely unresponsive and built around a horrid and broken counter system. To melee attack an enemy, you must counter them. It doesn't matter if you swung first, they're not attacking, or you are literally watching your baseball bat connect with their skull, if you don't wait for them to attack first to counter and stun them, your attack will not count. It is so pathetically broken. Not a big deal, as you can just pull out your gat and blow 'em away, but I see what they did. They thought they could get away with an unfinished melee system. Nah

[b] [*]The Length [/b]

- Now this isn't a complaint, complaint. This is more of a ""be aware of this"". Sure, they ain't charging $60 for this, but they are asking for around $30. Thing is though, without hunting all collectibles down (which aren't that cool, anyway) this game is truly around 10 hours long. $30 for a 10 hour game? I don't regret it, as I loved the game, but I don't feel great about it. A common complaint about remasters. 

[h1] [b] The Ugly [/b] [/h1]

[b] [*] The Vehicles and Vehicular Combat [/b]

- Somebody shoot me. 90% of the driving and vehicles in Mafia: Definitive Edition are just horrible. Every car acts like they're the main star of Tokyo Drift, clipping anything makes you take immense damage and lose all speed and momentum (not how physics work!) and is over all infuriating. Its literally only tolerable to drift with around 3 or 4 of the 40+ vehicles available.

[h1] [b] Overall [/b] [/h1]

Mafia: Definitive Edition is an amazing example of a remaster. It is actually one of the best looking remasters I've ever seen, and legitimately looks like a whole new game. Most of the combat is quite fun, and the story/characters are memorable, plus more. The only downsides are opinion-based, such as driving and what-not. I would truly recommend this to anyone who wants to play. A prime example of what a remaster should be.",1612819437,1699178635,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

I have played the Mafia trilogy and this by far ranks among the best. I loved the story-driven style of the game where the focus is the narrative and events. While I was not convinced by some of the characters (like Salieri), I still found the overall cinematic and narrative feel of the game refreshing.

 The dialogue is well-written and compared to Mafia 1 classic, there has been a very delicate yet effective rework on it where the characters are brought more to life and their behavior is more reflective and accurate.

The world is breath-taking and has many beautiful settings. Perhaps the only thing missing about the game was the open-world experience where many parts of the map were unexploited, but I guess that may have been to avoid the boring long drives.

One aspect that was annoying is the controls. I do not understand why the user would need 2 controls for the running depending on the setting. A simple Walk / Run toggle is enough. I was so confused and at times of battle and fights it got frustrating. 2K should have reviewed this odd part.",1699099837,1699099978,True,0,0,0.497340410947799683,0,True,False,False

Not many games leave a lasting impact on me, but I’d be damned if I never told you that [b]Mafia[/b], which has to be one of the greatest games I have ever played. It has a fantastic story with some stellar gameplay to go along with it. I should note that I have not played the original from 2002, so the [b]Definitive Edition[/b] is the only version that I have played.

[h1]Story[/h1]
The year is 1930, [b]Tommy Angelo[/b] is a struggling taxi driver during [b]The Great Depression[/b], one night he was strong-armed into helping two members of the [b]Selleri[/b] crime family. After saving both [b]Paulie Lombardo[/b] and [b]Sam Trapani[/b] from a rival mafia gang, [b]Tommy[/b] is rewarded for his help and is offered a position thanks to [b]Don’s Ennio[/b] organization. [b]Tommy[/b] is reluctant at first, however, the rewards he starts to get end up being too big to ignore. However, he also starts to get into more dangerous jobs that also increase in risk.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3065652962
The story for [b]Mafia[/b] is fantastic, it manages to create a very nice and enjoyable crime drama and I love the chemistry between the characters. The trio you get is all just enjoyable and at times they have a charm that makes them special. The story really starts to shine in the later parts of the game, but I can’t explain it due to spoilers, so you will just have to take it from me and this review.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
[b]Mafia: Definitive Edition[/b] has some new things to it that make it different from the original, one of the new features of the game is that you can now ride motorcycles, which is a first for the series. The gameplay mechanics are mostly based on the 3rd game in the series, including the classic difficulty, where ammo is managed differently, and police respond to crimes more frequently. There is also a [b]free ride mode[/b], where you can take part in side missions, there are also some taxi missions and a racing mode for you to access too.

During missions, you will be thrust into combat-based missions, some of them require melee but the large majority of them will make you use guns for various reasons. There are a few nice weapons for you to use but my favorite has to be the [b]Tommy Gun[/b]. It actually made me feel like I was in the 1930s and the gun just felt nice to use regardless. I wish I could have used the sniper rifle more, as it was only used in one mission of the game, and you only took one shot with it, overall, though, the guns felt nice to use and I never had any issues with any of them.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3065646661
Since [b]Tommy[/b] was a taxi driver before joining the mafia, he will be driving for most of the missions in the game. The driving in the game is fine, although the cars are a little hard to control at times, I think this is because they wanted the cars to have an old-like feel to them while driving. One feature that I love is the fact that you can have a limiter on the speed that your car can have, this helps in driving at times. Mainly because I don’t want to accidentally charge my car at full speed while turning because of the controls. I wish more open-world games with driving did something like this as I just love it all together.

I do in fact have three issues with [b]Mafia: Definitive Edition[/b], the first one has to do with when you are aiming your gun. Sometimes when you start to aim, your gun will fire automatically, I have no idea as of to why when I never pressed the trigger button, so I assume this is a glitch. Then there is the issue with the lock on during car chases, while they were few and far between, the lock on is a bit of a mess. The issue here is that sometimes the target you were firing at will change, and there is no way to switch targets at all. This makes the car chases a little clunky when aiming, not a huge issue, as it rarely came up but still something that annoyed me.

[h1]Graphics and Performance[/h1]
The graphics for this remake are really beautiful and detailed, they give off this rich 1930s feel and charm that I loved. I tested the game on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB, AMD Ryzen 5 1500X Quad-Core Processor 3.50, and 16 GB of RAM, I experienced no issues while I was playing and got 60 FPS.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3065655032
I did encounter some minor bugs while I was playing, however, nothing game breaking but there were some. One of the oddest ones I have come across was this one bug where cars will just far from the sky, it actually happened to me during a police chase in the game. This actually resulted in me failing the mission and I had to redo it.

[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]
Despite my issues with the game, [b]Mafia: Definitive Edition[/b] is a fantastic game and one I highly recommend for those who love crime dramas. If you are someone who likes story-heavy games, then I think this would be a fine purchase for you to get. Although there is only 12 hours of the main game so I would wait for a sale.

Who builds a 1930's mobster city with all these great period accurate cars and NPCs and then puts nothing in it for you to actually engage with it other than travel from story mission A to B? The Mafia series apparently. This is something I could forgive with Mafia 2 and to some extent 3 because I found their stories so engaging that you just let it slide, but man, without that you've got such a boring game on your hands.

The game like mafia 2 and 3 it is extremely atmospheric and the attention to detail of the cars and architecture of the buildings is absolutely stunning.

Mafia: Definitive Edition, a loving reimagining of the classic 2002 title, is a nostalgia-infused journey through the gritty underworld of organized crime. Spending 9.6 hours with this game was like revisiting an old friend and experiencing a vintage story with modern sensibilities.

The game's narrative thrusts you into the shoes of Tommy Angelo, a cab driver reluctantly drawn into the criminal world of the Salieri family. The storytelling in Mafia: Definitive Edition is nothing short of exceptional. It's a tale of friendship, loyalty, betrayal, and the cost of living life on the wrong side of the law. The characters are vividly brought to life, with superb voice acting and authentic dialogue that immerses you in the era of the 1930s.

One of the standout features of Mafia: Definitive Edition is its painstaking attention to historical accuracy. The city of Lost Heaven is a meticulously crafted, bustling metropolis that perfectly captures the essence of its time. From the architecture and vehicles to the fashion and music, every detail serves to immerse you in the Prohibition-era atmosphere.

The gameplay is a perfect blend of action and realism. Driving is an integral part of the experience, and the game's handling of classic vehicles is both authentic and enjoyable. Shootouts and combat scenarios offer a satisfying challenge, making every bullet count in a true-to-life way.

Mafia: Definitive Edition boasts impressive visual enhancements compared to its 2002 predecessor. The character models, environments, and lighting have been overhauled, resulting in a game that's as beautiful as it is evocative. The weather effects, especially rain, create an ambiance that enhances the immersion and visual appeal.

The 9.6 hours of gameplay likely only scratched the surface of what Mafia: Definitive Edition offers. The game's missions, which range from high-speed chases to intense shootouts, maintain a high level of variety and excitement throughout.

One of the minor drawbacks of the game is the occasional clunkiness in character animations and facial expressions, which can feel a bit outdated compared to contemporary titles. However, this is a minor blemish in an otherwise finely crafted experience.

In conclusion, Mafia: Definitive Edition is a remarkable reimagining of a classic title, showcasing the power of nostalgia and storytelling in gaming. With 9.6 hours of gameplay, you've likely experienced only a fraction of the narrative's depth and the immersive world it presents.

-Nice graphics
-Beautiful city
-Very good story
-Gameplay is fun
-Cool motocycles
-Great voice acting

But the downsides are:
-The city is empty when it comes to interiors and there is nothing to do. 
-Side missions are a bit lazy and boring (one in particular is the worst garbage ever)
-They have removed many things about the original game which doesn't make sense
-They locked all the interiors for some stupid reason, you can see the interior, but the door is locked. It doesn't make any sense, for example you can see inside your home, but can't go in. Just why would they do it?
-If you play free roam, you have go change your clothes every time you play if you don't to wear stupid cabbie clothes. You can't manually save either. 
-They have locked the race track in free roam and you can't just drive around it freely unless you want to race against AI

Little things like these are annoying.

It is also worth mentioning that the police are not as strict as the original game and the player is rather encouraged to deviate from the rules of the road which is one major departure from the original.

I was pretty surprised the game is faithful to the 2002 version in structure beat for beat which I appreciate a lot and what is more the remake comes with the benefit of Lost Heaven being visually better than ever.

Now with a modern engine, aesthetic details such as neon lights, billboards, towering skyscrapers, 'Americana' and all the nuance in-between shows that the developers took their time crafting a 1930's American city with great care. Additionally aside from minor changes, the map/city layout effectively feels like the original which is even more impressive. Only downside is the public transport is no longer usable but that's not too much of a problem.

You can tell that the game is developed on Mafia 3's technical foundation however the game is faithful enough to the original to feel different.

Focused story experience helps keep ADHD brain in focus, some may not like this
The shooting is a mixed bag, shooting accuracy will be a big complaint, main issue I have is with the shotguns

Driving physics are some of the best out there! The motorbike handling puts AAA games like cyberpunk to absolute shame, that's not to say vehicle handle well, but this is the era before tires even got halfway decent

Lack of side content/gameplay or 'emergent gameplay' whether scripted or not doesn't help this game feel complete, as a result, I couldn't recommend people to buy at full price, wait for a decent sale.

However, this game is pure cinematic mastery to its core.

As a game it's lacking at times, there are precious few collectibles and the game doesn't have a money system like its sequels, so if you're hoping for a 1930's version of GTA you'll likely be disappointed.

I found the open world very successful in terms of detail, from the details of the buildings to the electricity poles and public areas.

The story is a bit slow, there is a slow narrative and the vibe is just like Red Dead Redemption 2. But there are some issues:
-The ending of the story feels a bit rushed and quite unsatisfying.
-I personally wish there was an open world during the story. The game takes place on a huge open world map, but frankly, I would like to be free during the story, just like in GTA or Witcher style games. Because some areas cannot be visited at all, even throughout the game.
- The story is well-knitted but it doesn't hold up. To be honest, I could only finish it in 6-7 times because playing the game starts to get tiring after 1 hour.
- Car mechanics are annoying, literally soo soo annoying. Even the sfx file of brakes are giving me discomfort. The thing I hated most in this game was driving.
- The aim thing is also a bit strange, to be honest, it doesn't go where you push it. You can't just give the guys a thumbs up and move on. It's weird but it doesn't bother me.

Apart from that, the atmosphere, graphics and plot of the game are really nice. This atmosphere comes to the fore especially in the definitive edition. It's definitely a game you can try if you like mafia style stories, you won't regret it.",1696679511,1696679511,True,3,0,0.523505985736846924,2,True,False,False

Mafia Definitive Edition is a stunning remaster of the classic 2002 game that takes players on a gripping journey into the world of organized crime during the Prohibition era. Developed by Hangar 13 and published by 2K Games, this modern reimagining successfully captures the essence of the original while delivering an enhanced experience for both longtime fans and newcomers.

Visually, Mafia Definitive Edition shines. The game's meticulously recreated 1930s setting in the fictional city of Lost Heaven is a true testament to the attention to detail and craftsmanship of the development team. The city streets are bustling with life, period-accurate vehicles, and an atmosphere that oozes authenticity. The character models and facial animations have been significantly improved, bringing the cast of characters to life in a way that was not possible in the original.

The narrative remains the heart of the game, and it has lost none of its allure over the years. Playing as Tommy Angelo, a taxi driver drawn into the criminal underworld, you'll experience a gripping story filled with drama, betrayal, and moral dilemmas. The voice acting is top-notch, with the characters' performances enhancing the emotional depth of the story.

Gameplay in Mafia Definitive Edition has seen a substantial overhaul to match contemporary standards. The driving mechanics are vastly improved, making it a joy to cruise through the city's streets. Gunplay, however, can feel a bit dated, lacking the fluidity and precision found in more recent titles. Nevertheless, the game's focus on cover-based shooting and limited ammo resources adds a layer of tension and strategy.

One of the standout features of this remaster is the inclusion of collectibles, including vintage magazines and postcards that provide insight into the era. These collectibles not only encourage exploration but also add a layer of historical context to the game.

Mafia Definitive Edition's soundtrack is a highlight, featuring a timeless selection of jazz and orchestral music that perfectly complements the atmosphere of the 1930s. The sound design, from the roaring engines of classic cars to the chatter of NPCs on the streets, further immerses players in the game's world.

Despite its many strengths, Mafia Definitive Edition does have a few minor flaws. Some AI behavior can be unpredictable, and occasional graphical glitches can temporarily pull you out of the experience. Additionally, the game's pacing can feel uneven at times, with some missions feeling rushed while others drag on.

In conclusion, Mafia Definitive Edition is a lovingly crafted remaster that pays homage to the original while making significant improvements in graphics and gameplay. It successfully transports players to a bygone era of crime and intrigue, offering a compelling narrative set against the backdrop of a beautifully realized 1930s city. While it may not be without its flaws, the game's nostalgic charm and engaging story make it a must-play for fans of the original and newcomers alike.

Positive: great acting, good dialogues, coherent story, nice environment art. No bugs.
 
Negative: the main story is painfully linear, it's more like watching a movie and having to do the driving yourself, as well as the shooting. You cannot deviate right or left, you cannot decide how you want to complete a mission, e.g. quietly or violently, nothing that you do influences what happens next or how NPCs react to you, there is absolutely zero decision making. There is only one way to play the game, and if you leave the area that you should be in during a mission, you fail and start from the checkpoint again. Enemies are programmed in a perfectly determined, predictable way. It's getting repetitive and boring very early. The main story ends after about 20 hours of casual play. Lack of saves may be slowing you down and be a bit annoying. There are a few parts that are really hard to complete, especially the freaking race. The difficulty level could be a bit better balanced. I played on Classical difficulty and it wasn't really that hard (except for the race, Jesus Christ!). You may get stuck there for good. The linear nature of the story means that you cannot in any way skip this part, which is absolutely nonsensical. 

 In the free ride mode (the other mode is the story) there is really almost nothing to do. I mean, there are two dozens of extra missions, taxi driving, races, and that's it. There is nothing to explore, no buildings to enter, nothing to loot, nobody to interact with. As for an RPG that I thought Mafia is. Driving mechanism is a bit weird, not realistic at all, but also not as fun as in GTA. And so is the camera movement (compering with GTA or RD2). 

I miss the days when open worlds really meant open and interesting spaces to explore, like Fallout or Fallout 2. Ah, nobody makes games like this anymore. There aren't too many weapons to choose from. All cars drive more or less the same. Cars don't get damaged (anyone remembers Carmageddon?). The world is vast, but during the main story I had a feeling I am revolving around the same places over and over again, the same bridge, the same tunnel, the same roundabout in Chinatown. And it wasn't inviting or anything, I feel no reason to explore. You can collect comic books, and... that's it. Nothing else. We should not be calling this an ""open world"", it should be called ""empty world"". It's very beautiful, all models, roads, buildings are very well made. But there is nothing to steal, nobody to rob or nothing to buy. I imagine Mafia could really be an ""extortionist simulator"", where you have different gangs and you start beating restaurant owners to give you money, fight the other gangs, bribe cops, get your buddies out of prison etc. to build your own underground empire. I also imagine Mafia world to be a perfect environment to play Arma III in ;) 

All in all it's a good game for a couple of days, I bought it with a great discount for just over $10, so it was ok. But if I paid the full price I think I'd be a bit disappointed. 

After these 20 hours I don't really feel like playing more. Compared with Red Dead 2 the story is incredible short.",1695038319,1695038319,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Don't pick the Classic difficulty level right away. It can cause you a lot of trouble, especially if you haven't played Mafia The City of Lost Heaven or you remember little of it. A normal or high difficulty level is the optimal setting for a first playthrough.

Rely heavily on covers. They are a new feature in Mafia 1 Remake, so using them is not so obvious. Try to hide behind indestructible covers as much as possible and remember to destroy covers used by enemies.

Often look at the mini-map displayed on the screen. The mini-map is primarily for checking the best route, but it also shows, e.g. locations of opponents and police officers, or items that can be examined.

Heal by using first aid kit points. They are hanging on walls in locations where opponents appear. Since you can use each point once, don't take the first aid kit if you have received only minor damage.

Remember the traffic regulations. Any violation carries the risk of starting a police pursuit. First of all, you should avoid hitting pedestrians and other cars. In addition, you should also activate the maximum speed limiter.

Cars are best stolen quietly by breaking into them. You do this by using the lockpick received at the beginning of mission 4. Breaking a car window or throwing a driver out of the cab will alert police officers

You can freely change the difficulty level

Be sure to use covers during fights

Some opponents can be eliminated with stealth takedowns

Use dodges in melee fights

Use the mini-map...
The mini-map is always visible in the bottom right corner of the screen and this is a major improvement over the original game. The mini-map has several important uses:
It displays a suggested route to your destination – you won't have to open the world map. This is particularly helpful in those stages, which involve, for example, reaching a designated location within a time limit.
It displays enemies' icons – they are marked in red. Keeping an eye on the mini-map reduces the risk of getting attacked by surprise.
It displays icons of police officers and police cars. This is very helpful in those missions and sequences where you have to escape the police or when you want to avoid getting detected again after losing a tail.
It marks first aid kits and supplies. You can locate first aid points and chests with ammo supplies faster.
It marks important places and secrets. Important locations to explore are marked, for example, in A Trip to the Country mission. Thanks to the markings, you can find the collectibles scattered around the city.

Try to avoid breaking the law when traveling around the city
If you don't want to get the attention of police, do the following things:
Do not exceed speed limits – The game has a built-in speed limiter and once you turn it on, the vehicle will never go too fast.
Don't attack civilians – This includes directly attacking people on the street, hitting pedestrians with cars, and throwing drivers out of their vehicles. If you need a new vehicle, it's best to use a lockpick and steal a parked car.
Do not crash into other vehicles – The traffic in the game is not very dense, but you should still avoid driving too close to other cars. Also, watch out for vehicles leaving side streets or turning up at intersections.
Don't go through intersections at red lights – If you're in no hurry, wait for the lights to change. You don't have to wait too long for the green.

The simulated driving model provides a lot of fun but makes it harder to complete missions

However, it is a remaster so there are still elements to the game that are a bit clunky, the driving is a bit stiff and it does feel like your a steering a truck 24/7.

That aside the missions are fun with a different variety of all out shooting and stealth, while the character development is brilliant.

If you want a casual story game to play when your bored this game is it.

If you play games on the hardest difficulty or only buy games you'll play more than once, I don't recommend this game. If you like collectibles or care about your achievements on Steam, I strongly recommend you DO NOT GET THIS GAME. The game does NOT respect your time at all.

If you've watched/read/played/heard *any* gang/mafia/triad/yakuza type media, then there won't be the slightest surprise or unforeseen turn in the plot. That in itself isn't a bad thing if you like this type of plot, but don't expect anything more than a very standard gang plot. The only two characters I liked in the whole game were Tommy and Ralph, though. The guns very much feel like they are guns of the time period compared to modern games- every gun has a ton of bullet spread and any form of movement widens the spread further. This turns out to not be a ton of fun in practice, though, as it can be frustrating to be shooting at an enemy clearly in your crosshair and not be hitting them. Whether the cars drive well or not is sort of personal preference in this game, but I didn't enjoy them as much as any other game that has you driving around a city this frequently. Whether you love, hate, or anywhere in between, the plot, however, you probably won't replay the campaign that often as the game has so many little parts that take forever to get through for no reason. Your character moves so slowly in certain important locations like Salieri's bar, but you spend so much time in those places! You always spawn somewhere, slowly walk to a cutscene or unskippable dialogue, then get in a car and drive to a cutscene before the mission actually starts! Things like this almost completely remove replayability for me. The collectibles are terrible, is another thing. There are so many and the map is massive and you can't even get 1/4th of them in the campaign. You have to drive around the city with a third party interactive map for the free roam collectibles to be even remotely bearable.",1692579342,1692579342,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's kinda sad that they couldn't hire a single Italian-speaking person to cringe-check everything. There's a character at one point who is supposed to not speak anything other than Italian and it's so hard to listen to.

Someone somewhere has described this as a driving simulator with a linear action adventure, and aficionados seem to tell prospective players to not expect a GTA clone, as the world isn't really free-roaming. Well, I agree, except this doesn't redeem the game one bit. Physics are wonky and the driving is unpleasant due to how unpredictable stuff on and around the streets can be. Some lamp posts can be taken down, but the majority won't. Some wooden elements are destructible, but a small stop sign in the middle of nowhere can insta-kill you if you're driving fast enough.

There's a ""free ride"" mode at the end where you can keep torturing yourself with secret missions and a bunch of collectibles that you can only possibly find with a guide open on the side.

Cutscenes are the thing that Hangar 13 are good at. They're pretty cool.

The car physics are pretty weird and annoying sometimes (especially in race). But it's easy to get used to it (for me, at least).

That being said, while I do enjoy the game, I don't think it's worth buying, because the game can crash and overheat your pc, and also you will get the hard drive not installed error. I had this happen to me at least twice where I had to go back into the game after playing for even no more than 40 minutes. Also there is a bug in where the game will glitch out and prevent you from moving forward, in which you'll have to redownload the entire game. I'm warning you now so that later you don't run into it and then request steam for a refund and you can't get your money back. The game is too demanding graphically, so I think you should only buy it if your pc is above fit for the game, not if it even matches it, because my computer was a 64-bit windows 10 with nvidia gtx 1060 graphics card, and it STILL wouldn't prevent the crashes, even though the game ran properly when it wasn't crashing even though it could run, my NVIDIA GTX 1660 graphics card wasn't able to keep the game running.
Finished the game with all achievements finally but still had the problem in my classic difficulty playthrough as well. Luckily this game had autosaves or I would be REALLY in trouble seeing as no matter how low the settings were my hard drive failed from overheat thanks to whatever this game was graphically pushing my graphics card to do. After finishing it, and the problem not changing, I doubt I'll return to it, but it was ok I guess in story regard, and the gameplay was nice too, but I couldn't really enjoy it because of the crashing trouble. I have increased playtime but that's cause I was playing for achievements and it was too late back then to refund it but given how troublesome the definitive experience was for me, I doubt i'll try mafia 3, but i have to see if my pc can even run that using the demo.

Original Mafia is like being in the events themselves. Raw experience, sometimes lenghty, sometimes unpolished, sometimes unfair, but thrilling and unforgettable.
Definitive edition is like having the events told. Lengthy parts shortened, unpolished parts polished, unfair parts changed to make them seem fairer and thrilling parts embelished to seem even more thrilling. But somewhere along the line it just loses the energy and feeling you had from the experience itself.  It tells the story well, you can almost see the events, but its just not the same as being there.

yes if this game came out 10 or 15 years ago then it would have been considered to be groundbreaking but game of such quality in 2020 is simply unacceptable.

cons- ****dead and barren open world, the open world provides absolutely zero functionality. no wonder why the devs included the option to skip driving from places to places. its nothing but an afterthought by the devs so that the game can be marketed to a broader audience, just another feature to hype up the game.

******super linear.
******much less hand holding would have been appreciated.
******it's 2020 and no branches of storylines or freedom of choices.
Yes i know it's a remake of a game from 2002 and they tried to be faithful to the original source but once again there is a industry standard in this day and age and these industry standards should be ensured. Why bother remaking the game if you can't improve upon the mechanics and surprise the gamers, if they intended to keep the game 100% similar to the old source then why even bother with a remake. A shallow scripted story in 2020 doesn't cut it.

The story is pretty good, but the real highlight is the attention to detail from small things like a little hop Tom does if you go into a sprint after aiming down the sights, along with the option for cars to have a sequential gearbox.

Every character, every mission is memorable and with the newly added voice acting and motion capture you can really see the details of the emotions the actors put to the game, the little details, tiny hints that a character gives really enriched the story immensely. 

Game is semi-open world, you can explore the map in freeplay mode but at the end of the day, besides getting the collectibles(for which there are a lot of) you don't really have anything to do. 
Gameplay is simple enough, you cover when they are shooting, you shoot when they are reloading. There is a classic difficulty which is a bit harder than the other difficulties, a bit more realistic where you have to drive the speed limit, not steal any cars, not hitting any cars etc. It makes the game a bit more realistic but at the end of the day, in some missions, classic difficulty becomes kind of rude. There are a few missions where this difficulty spikes and combining this with the lack of frequent saves increases the rudeness of the game.

Overall, such a great story to experience",1690922950,1690958116,True,1,0,0.518716573715209961,0,True,False,False

Mafia DE is probably closer to the gameplay and presentation of Mafia 2. Mafia 1 had a more open and less scripted level design, it had no cover system, and it feels more ""pure"". It's jank, but it has ""soul"". The remake is solid, but definitely feels more like one of those big corpo movie remakes. The story and characters have been changed quite a bit, the mission environments are more linear and scripted, and the gameplay relies on a cover system like Mafia 2.

So basically, if you're familiar with older games and you don't mind some early 2000s jank, Mafia 1 is better thanks to its writing, presentation, and music. If you prefer modern stuff that's closer to Mafia 2, play Mafia DE. If you have enough time and money, playing both won't hurt either.",1690916495,1690916495,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've played the original in my early teens ages ago and seeing it remade with modern graphics is just mindblowing. The feeling of the 30s is unmatched, cars and bikes are beautiful and Lost Heaven, albeit a bit different in places, is substantially the same as it was back when I first visited it. Cutscenes have incredible fidelity now and the action is more visceral than it ever was. The story itself is pretty good, short and bittersweet as it should be, it doesnt overstay its welcome too much and it provides pretty nice setpieces throughout to enhance the experience. Overall I got what I paid for, and I'm satisfied, though if I had to point out a flaw that would definitely be in the absurdly high heating of my GPU even during indoors conversations, some stuttering in places, and a very silly usage of physics. I saw a truck fly across the street and get stuck in place halfway through a mission on a 90 degrees angle in mid air, my bike got stuck into some geometry during a chase, and several other occurrences of cars just flying or flipping over at high speed. Granted its nothing you cant live with and it only occurs occasionally, but it happens a bit too frequently for modern games' standards.
What I cant live with however, is the game crashing during the dreadful race mission. Again, physics related problem which occurred regularly. I suggest skipping the mission entirely through save edit.",1690887932,1690887932,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

because this game while being good does not worth 60 dollars. not in the slightets. yes graphics is quite good. gunplay is fun and the voices are well... ok... but something from the originals clearly is missing. i remember the original missions being way way harder. not only because you dident had cover but also because there were much much more enemis in the original. some of the missions in this remake are cut versions of the originals. the port level where you kill morello brother was very very long and tough in the original game. with alot of enemeis everywhere. you were short in ammo. you could just cover and shot from it. it was a tough game. but the remake is very generic. the only thing that saves it is very good acting and dialouge. however. the overly raspy italian steretype voice of tommy is pure cringe. and i dont understand why the characters look so different. it just dosent fit. i much prefer the original tommy. 

you know, people stoned me for saying this but i really do think this should have been an open world game. yes. i know the originals are not open world but the remake should have been. its just that the city is very cool and detailed but you never actually have the change to exploring it. this includes the country side. 

most of the missions in this remake like i said. are short. easy. and dumbed down big time. the original is a way better game.

Dont play on classic. The race is balls if you do. The game has alot of cracks, but i highly recommend for the story. Buy this if the trilogy is on sale for 15. The world is immersive, and the driving is amazing. Reminds me of GTA 4 with how the vehicles handle, but better. 

Alright so spoilers but like. As much as i like the sinister undertones of ""Family is forever"" im mixed on the ending.

Like, I feel like the game was setting up tommy to overtake his boss, but the last chapter just kinda throws that away quickly with a ""happy ending but he dies later"" type thing. which i guess cant be avoided if you want the in media res trope with him and the cop speaking to eachother in the future.

I think the last scene should stay the same, with tommy dying, but like. idk. honestly this game feels like two games, with an ending in the middle with killing morello, but then it just keeps going. then right before a second ending it dies.

However, despite the graphical overhaul, the controls may feel a bit clunky and take some time to adapt to, especially for players used to more modern gameplay mechanics. While it may take a bit of patience to master the controls, the engaging story and captivating world make the learning curve worthwhile.

Mafia I Definitive Edition stands as a testament to the power of a well-crafted story-based game. The developers have taken great care to preserve the essence of the original while elevating it to a new level for the current generation of players. This game is a must-play for both newcomers and fans of the original, as it offers an experience that is both nostalgic and contemporary.

1030840,143006670,76561198317459965,147,10,663,0,663,1690582719,"Mafia 1 Definitive Edition is, even with all the upgrades to graphics and gameplay, a game that still doesn't feel modern or fully remade.
It is not a bad game by any means, but I find it hard to recommend, perhaps only with a heavy discount; It's way too short (10.5 hrs) for me to recommend at full price.

The good:

- Graphics: San Francisco looks gorgeous in this game. The whole game is beautiful. Especially the cars and  the buildings.
- The characters: Although I definitely feel they could have been fleshed out more with a longer story, the cast of characters is among the strongest aspects of this game.
- Driving: This is not a racing game so it's nothing too extraordinary but it works fine.
- Immersion: The game sells the feeling of being in the mob pretty well, although it doesn't properly portray the danger you're in. Tommy, Sam and Paulie feel too invincible and free from consequence. 
 
The decent/mixed:

- The Story: It has a lot of references to popular gangster films and tries to homage them, however, don't expect the Godfather here. The story is an 8/10 and honestly left me with mixed feelings over how rushed it felt with that ending.
- The gunplay: It's not bad but it lacks weight. Idk but it just doesn't feel as satisfying as it could. There's also very little gun variety.
- Level design: Some levels are very fun, but others at times feel like little more than shooting galleries.
- The police: At lower difficulties they are pretty dumb, at higher ones they are omniscient. 
- Stealth: Nothing to write home about. Simple but it gets the job done.

The bad:

- Lack of content: This game could've really used some side missions to make it a little longer and flesh out it's characters and world. The story is just back to back main story and cut-scenes for 10 hours. Having such a beautiful yet empty city is a waste. 
- The melee combat: Two buttons for it. Punch and dodge. You basically just have to mash them and there's 0 depth to it. 
- The AI: It's bad and makes later gunfights feel boring (Uncharted 1 level of AI, maybe worse). This also affects stealth sections, making them feel trivial.
- Impact of the story on the world: The world doesn't seem very reactive to the way the story progresses, which makes you feel like there's very little danger/stakes to the crimes or scenarios you participate in (This is worsened by the John Wick level of feats Tommy ends up being tasked with past a certain point). Only near the end after the Bank level did this feel different.

What's missing:

- Any progression system: You don't level up, unlock/upgrade your equipment, gain skills or anything like that. Tommy has the same skills at the beginning of the game as he does in the final mission. Not even his health is improved.
- Interactivity: There is a free roam mode where you get to drive around the open world outside of missions but there's nothing to do. The world is pretty, but empty.
 
Conclusion: Decent game, but buy only with deep discount. Had potential to be much more.",1690619929,1690622175,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

It's another shining example of how to do a remake the right way. I don't know if anyone has tried to play the original Mafia before but it has not aged well at all, mechanically it's damn near impossible to play by modern standards. This remake does a flawless job of modernizing the controls and gameplay while still maintaining the integrity of the original game. There are some voice actor re-casts that some people are annoyed with, mostly Paulie but I think Paulies new voice actor is the superior acting. Paulie always gave offf that classic mobster goon vibe but his voice never really fit that energy, in this remake it's spot on in my opinion. The game itself is relatively short, you can blast through it in about about 8 to 12 hours depending on difficulty you play on. I just finished a run on Classic (hardest) difficulty and it took me just over 12 hours to finish. This included about 2 hours of me redoing the race because my god that was the hardest part of the entire game I swear. The only other gripe I have with this remake is that Hanger 13 for whatever reason decided to use Temporal Anti-Aliasing, which don't get me wrong on higher resolutions it typically is a solid AA solution. But if you're playing on a 1080p monitor you are in for a bad time with animation ghosting. It usually only shows up in very specific lighting situations but it's always annoying to see a character's arm ghosting like that one scene in The Matrix. The issue is that you don't have the option to just have anti-aliasing off entirely because if you are on a strong enough setup then an AA solution isn't something you actually need so only having the option to set it to low, medium, or high (none of those settings will alleviate the ghosting) instead of just turning it off is a problem. There is a mod that disables the TAA but sadly that has its own issues such as characters hair being bright white anytime they are in direct light, I tried the mod out and was happy the ghosting was gone but the bright white hair in light ended up being a deal breaker for me so I reverted to not using it. All in all though a solid 9 out of 10 experience, if only I had the option to turn TAA in the game itself I'd be able to give this a 10 out of 10.",1690359063,1690359063,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Instead he's like a crazy madman swinging a baseball bat going ooough! and just a completely different character,

In the first line of Dialogue with Ralphie, when ralphie said ""so we got two cripples working here""

Paulie didn't say ""We ain't nothing alike, you got that""
He said ""That's right. but I ain't a fool""

Completely different tones in attitude there.
Paulie just acts like a completely total utter Twat.

That's not even just it, but I don't want to type this any longer than I have to.

It's a disappointment, It's sad, it's certainly not the kind of remaster I'd want from such an amazing game.

Don't get me wrong I had fun and I believe if you are into this genre, do play it.

However, its extremely linear, very small world, repetitive, quick history, lack of freedom, not many guns, clothes, cars, etc.

They do have the free roam at the end but it gets boring quick. I had 5 stars with the police hunting me and having killed 100 or more, ran for a bit and they ""lost interest"" ok then. 

Get it for big discount. If not, I do not recommend it.

Here we mostly oriented on the plot, from time to time it might even feel like a movie. And plot is really worthy here! 

Atmosphere, graphics, quests are quite nice. I've really enjoyed every minute being there with Tommy on his adventure. 

Different difficulty levels to choose from, optional quests can be skipped. A hell of collectables if you like this kind of stuff. 

Even on the normal mode - game was quite a challenge. Especially, on places where you need to shot a lot. It was really difficult and took time until i get used to it and understood how to get it done. 

Quite optimized. 

You can finish it in 10-15 hours depend on how quick you are and how many collectables you want to find. 

There is a garage with cars you can still on the streets. Be aware of the police too, it can be quite challenging to get away.

The narrative-driven gameplay follows Tommy's rise through the ranks of organized crime, exploring themes of loyalty, moral dilemmas, and the consequences of one's choices.

Lost Heaven is a breathtakingly authentic city, with its stunning architecture, vintage cars, and atmospheric ambiance capturing the essence of the 1930s. The developers have spared no effort in creating a living, breathing world.

Gameplay mechanics are very solid offering a perfect blend of action, exploration, and storytelling. Driving through the city streets feels smooth and enjoyable, while engaging in gunfights delivers a satisfying and immersive experience. 

The story is told from Tommy's perspective and it starts from the end of the game and Tommy presets the story in chapters and later on ends where the game starts.

At first I wasn't impressed, the gunplay is passable but quite repetitive, almost every gunfight plays out the same and there's like 3 guns to choose from. By far the worst part for me was the driving, the fact that the protagonist is an ""expert driver"" and drives in pretty much every mission wasn't helping either. I even had to download a savefile to skip a racing mission which you have to win to progress the story, which I gave up on after an hour of restarts.

The setting and story is where the game shines the most, every character is memorable, every mission has its meaning and leads perfectly up to the big, satisfying finale. The city is extremely well made, graphics are beautiful and everything feels quite alive. I played using the Czech dub because that's how I played Mafia 2 many years ago, it was very well made too and would recommend it to any Czech speaker. 

(On a side note I recommend turning off the subtitles, while I love playing with them there are a few key moments in the game that are ""spoiled"" by the subtitles cutting off suddenly)

The last few missions are the best part of the game in my opinion, it ties everything together beautifully, the main antagonist, the start of the sequel, everything, don't wanna say too much so just play it yourself, it really is worth it.",1689363448,1689363448,True,19,1,0.657919228076934814,0,True,False,False

This is a very nicely crafted mob story, very satisfying to finish it on classic mode. (The race was the hardest part :p)

The characters are a catch, OK development. The ending for me is a little conflicting, you carry the Don and his silly family to riches and one event that Tom isnt even responsible for means betrayal to the family. Gl dony & samy.  Sam is a POS and so is the DON, they dont want to talk about nothing but can lie and expect Tom to not care. Don is a stain to society and deserves the virtual prison cell for his fat virtual self. Besides how I feel about a part of the ending,  the story is a nice 9/10 would be a 10/10 if i could make some choices but i no complain ;)

Driving is fun 9/10

Shooting is decent, cant complain 8/10

City is nice, looks nice, people walking around, cars are driving n shit but the police are either officer Doofy's or a cult of John Wick's. 9/10

The missions are fun and are not repetitive, the story telling and dialog mixed with the gameplay was perfect. 

Solid game to get on sale :) idk about full price cuz the sht is pretty short tbh. I went afk for like 2 hours & spent an hour getting the game to stop freezing at the 2k intro.

Main character is ok to get behind, but isn't exactly what one would call ""likeable.""  Even if his gang isn't as bad as most.

There are a few weapons and explosives, but nothing special there.  Lots of cars.  You'll spend a great deal of this game driving.  However, it doesn't force you to drive unnecessarily, as you can often skip drives to story missions.  There's a small amount of sneaking and taking down enemies, but there's definitely more firearm combat.

The main game itself has a good story, but it's not super great either.  It can be pretty predictable.

After that, there's not a whole lot else unless you're a completionist.  There are a ton of collectibles, none of which show up on your primary map, but they'll appear on your mini map only when you're close to them.  There are no hints whatsoever to where they are.  You literally just have to search every inch of the city.

There are also side missions that the game makes no effort to make known to the player.  You have to go to certain places and interact with certain items and that's how you activate them.  Would have never known about them if I hadn't read about them online.  That said, some of these side missions are hope diamond sized pieces of crap and the guy who designed them should have his temporal lobes ventilated via lead dispersion.  Same with Classic difficulty.

There's an achievement that requires you to complete the game on Classic difficulty.  A word of warning:  This difficulty setting is blatantly unfair and will require you to ""git gud"" and try over and over to finish at least two certain story missions.

To start with, this game is NOT open-world. All you get is mission after mission in the story line and the missions are like a year or two apart in the timeline of the game. No continuity in story-telling at all. They do have a free roam mode for exploration, but there's literally nothing you can interact with even though the map is large. Stores are not enterable, trains are not ridable, and you don't get to customize your character except for a few preset outfits in the free roam mode.
Story is also bad in my opinion. [spoiler]Your best buddies just betray you because ""they were threatened by opposing gang"" or tried to kill you because ""you did something without asking the Don for approval"". Yeah people change overtime and that happens perhaps in years of the in game time span but for the gameplay experience they were your best mate in one mission and your enemy in the next. This is nonsense.[/spoiler]
The game uses the same engine as Mafia 3, which is pretty decent in the visuals but the physics couldn't be worse. Cars don't knock people over, they just push them away and they bleed. In the racing mission your car will flip even with the slightest bump, and it will be thrown into the sky when it hits a wall.

The gameplay is very fun! Whether its the driving, the shooting, or just missions, youll have a ton of fun playing!


The story is very interesting, and has many cool characters! Ones youll sympathise with and grow to love!

Mafia: Definitive Edition Looks incredible, the graphics is insane-  and the game is very well optimized! So you shouldnt have any trouble running this game even at max settings! (Im sitting on a 1070 Ti and i5 8600k case you were wonderin) 

This is a game you'll be able to pick up and finish all within a week, and thats if you're dropping round 2 hrs a day.

As for what I dislike about it, the game has a ton of glitches. at some point I found myself saying, Wow, what a glitchfest this is... They arent game breaking bugs by all means, but it will cause you to die quite a few times and might ruin your experience a bit. Overall it shouldnt take up much of your time, since they're minor glitches. its just how often you get hit by em that gets on my nerves sometimes!

Here's some of the improvements to the original, 2002 game:
1. As expected of an 18 year difference, the scenery and visuals are much improved. 
1A. OH MY WORD THE SUNLIGHT
2. The characters faces  have WAY more expression now. [spoiler] no more plastic faces![/spoiler] [spoiler]Sarah looks human now[/spoiler]
3. The remake is sympathetic to the original while making it's own take on the story 
4. The map changes are good and expand upon the original
4A: Vincenzo's workshop is actually in the Garage... and actually makes sense now.
5. I like how Salieri is portrayed as the sympathetic underdog [spoiler]until he goes crazy and takes out Morello, thinking he's suddenly become invincible and starts getting power crazy[/spoiler]
6. The story has been smoothed out, and improved. 
7. ""World Building"" such as brands, music etc. are improved on the original.

However, there's also things I don't like
1. Biff is no longer an informant on the streets
2. [spoiler]Morello no longer has the same level of  level crossing incident.[/spoiler] [spoiler] in fact, NONE of the normal railways are at ground level any more[/spoiler][spoiler] THERE'S NOT EVEN REAL TRACK WHERE THERE'S TRAINS[/spoiler]
2A: [spoiler] in ""You Lucky Bastard"" you pull a lever in a signal box to move the freight car.. that's not how railroads work. At MANY levels[/spoiler]
3. Public transport is unable to be used off to the player... [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6wuIBWforI]even when you can actually GET to it![/url] [spoiler]this might be due to sloppy building placement and unfinished train track more than anything else[/spoiler]
3B: the elevated railway judders when using the end of track loop. 
3C: Bus stops, but no buses? [spoiler] They do turn up, but only at end-game and in free-ride[/spoiler]
4. The traffic AI is OVERLY perceptive and stops for you to turn... but then beeps at you? 
5. Similar to 4. the AI can moan at you... when they're suicidally walking in front of your car!
6. The player model has some funny collision with scenery items, such as phone booths [spoiler] which you can use in free ride to earn cars[/spoiler]
7. OH DEAR GOD PAULIE, WHADDA THEY DO TO YA

Its fun asf. the gun play is nice and the open world is decent, hell I would say the cars feel nice! but the race- Oh my god. Talk about the most dog shit thing to do to someone loving the game so far. Like its fucking unreal how bad they do you in it. The worst car out of the bunch. The speed never can reach top like those other cars- and the most slippery controls you can get with it. If you had any other car that could reach that speed you would nail that race hard- but they don't. They refuse too. and because you wanted to do classic difficulty, its beyond fucking doable. but I still love this game so fucking much. everything else is amazing. but that race is story required- You can't skip it, so if you can't get it, your just stuck. you can watch all the videos you want or hear people out, but you won't get better until you give up on the achievement wanting or grab a save load online to skip it. This should never be a case for a game and for that I won't recommend it.

Fight.. FIGHT.

Daaaaamn, now this game completely blew me away, it's a cinematic masterpiece!

I never played far in the original Mafia game as I got bored with the first 2 missions that had you driving people around in taxis, I thought that was the extent of the gameplay so I rather just played the free-play mode where you can go around killing people. Anyways, with the remake, I went in blind and bloody hell was I surprised, I'm not a fan of the setting per se but the game nails it and it really makes you care about everything going on in the world and with the characters.

The gameplay is greatly improved over the original, the driving feels nice and accurate, and the mission pacing and structure are really good and NEVER left me bored which is amazing :)... the only crappy thing is that damn racing mission, I know it's widely known to be the worst part of the original game and feck me it's a pain in the remake as well, I had to put the game on easy just to let the AI allow me to get in front :P. 

So to summarise: The game surprised me a lot and despite not particularly being a fan of the time era and mafia setting I ended up really loving the game. Oh, and my husband watched me play through the whole game as well as he also found it really entertaining to watch.

As such, I rate this game... a 4.5/5 amazing experience! 
The only downside is that bloody racing mission, but just cheese your way through that and enjoy the rest of the game :)",1606546508,1688628408,True,6,0,0.56204378604888916,0,True,False,False

Performance is fantastic and the game looks great, even on low settings. 


Gameplay is... fine. If you ever played any third-person shooter with cover and driving mechanics, the gameplay should feel very familiar. There are some unique mechanics that comes from the original game, like police reacting to traffic violations and cars having limited gas. Stealth is very finicky, at least on Classic difficulty, you can easily be spotted and fail the mission if you need to be stealthy. 


Which brings me to my next point: the game is aggressively scripted. This is an antithesis to the design philosophy of the original Mafia. The original game didn't care if you got spotted or if the alarm got raised, too bad, you still need to finish the job and even accounted different choices and mistakes the player can make. In this game you need to stick to the script or the game can hit you with a game over, if it doesn't, its pretty easy to break the scripting and find exploits. 


Still, the real appeal of this game is it's expanded story that foreshadows and references the other Mafia games, and the expanded characterizations and relationships of the characters. Most of the changes I think works, as world-building and characters have been Hanger 13's strong suit. For the story alone, it is worth the play through.

the acting you can actually see the emotions in characters especially in the ending.

Mafia Definitive Edition is the way a remake should be. While it has some story differences, it remains true to the plot and the whole game pans out the same. The game play is excellent and remains faithful to the original while still feeling modern. Game length is around the same, only taking me an hour shorter. The only negative I can give this game is the bugs. Compared to the original, I ran into more bugs. Overall I really recommend Mafia Definitive Edition to any one who played the original or wants a couple fun weekends.

Here is the most successful and eye-catching game of the series . This game cheers our eyes with its environments, music and venues that successfully reflect the difficulties of the period, the corruption of the state, the life of a citizen and the work of the mafia. Like our first game, the second game does not lack any of these features. You already know what happened in the last game 

                                                      GRAPHICS 
Usually the ""definitive"" versions are a bit nasty and feel like a quick job, but with this game it's different. They gave the ""definitive"" versions of the 2nd and 3rd game for free, but bought this game with money. And yes, this game has been really successful. I've played it  on classic difficulty with no problems.
The optimization has been done successfully and is visually stunning.
There is not much missing in this section.

                                                        SOUNDS

- The period music, atmosphere, vehicle sounds and of course the voiceovers are successful and draw you in.
- -/+ Gun sounds average.

                                                      GAMEPLAY 

Everything was perfect, including vehicle handling and missions.
- The hitting feeling is successful.
- Introduction to the mechanics of the cover and the operations you perform there are successful and error-free.
- There isn't much in this section.  

                                                     VEHICLE USE

I liked the driving, I liked the feeling of the vehicles of the period

+ They have faithfully preserved the atmosphere of the 1930s without disturbing the atmosphere of the same original game.

+ Cutscenes deepen the story characters as personalities in great detail. Of course, this put the scenes in the mood of hollywood movies. Of course, after all, this is Remake, the men cannot ""copy paste"" the 2002 scenes as they do today. I appreciated the time and effort they put into Motion Capture, even though I found it unnecessary that they lengthen the scenes in some episodes pointlessly.

+ The driving feel of the vehicles is just like the turtle, with the driving mechanics it gives the feeling that they are really 1930 vehicles. If you play as a simulation, like in the original game, the vehicles make you feel their clumsiness with very fine details.

+ The artificial intelligence of the cops is exactly what I wanted this time, even the NPCs in the city have nice artificial intelligence, when you do excessive speed or have an accident, the NPCs in the city can take your license plate and report it to the police. If you play in the simulation, the cops are not eye-catching, just like in the original game, they don't give you a speed show like the fast sports cars in the GTA and NFS series.

+ Classic difficulty gives you the pleasure of ""Mafia The City Lost Heaven"", enemies can fly you with a single sniper bullet at long range or with a single shotgun bullet at close range. even gun bullets, First Aid first aid kits are very difficult to find in the section, and this really gives you the feeling of tension in the action in a very tense way.


+ A nice feature has been introduced for players who do not like Skip Drive-style long journeys, but if you experience it as ""Skip Drive"" all the time, you will not understand the dialogues between the characters in the story, and you will not be able to properly experience the story flow and the atmosphere of the city in the game. Of course, after all, it's your game taste, how you want to play, especially for those who will do ""Speedrun"" :D

+ For players who want to explore the brand new Lost Heaven city, it's nice to think of a Freeride free roam mode where you can do side quests for snacks, just like in the original series.

                                                      (CONS)
 
- NPCs in the city are just idly wandering around the city in normal quiet situations and saying hi to Tommy Angelo. They only react according to the situation that the player has experienced in the city. You made a remake game in 2020, brother, at least it should give a little bit of NPCs a sense of vitality that will fill our eyes. For example, if they added small random events like ""Random Event"" like in Gta V and RDR2, this would make the city of Lost Heaven in a 2020 game feel much more cultural, I'm sure they could make nice random events to fit the cover. The open world of the game is not even that huge, so not only does it consist of creating an authentic visual city atmosphere, but also design the interior accordingly and enrich it with various artificial intelligences in your next games.

- I get that you don't mess around with the open world, you stick with the Original series, but it would be nice if you didn't at least remove Lucas Bertone's alternate side missions from the Original game. I guess they decided to remove them from the game in order not to spend more money and time on reworking those side missions.

- Unfortunately, the enemy artificial intelligence is still grinning a lot, some enemies do not react to bullets at all even though they eat ""Headshot"",

- There are minor animation glitches in the game, but they don't outweigh the ''Cyberpunk",1674165349,1687357041,True,2,0,0.541666686534881592,0,True,False,False

Now if we talk about the need for a remake of this part, then we can see that most of us either did not know about its possible release or were waiting at glance for the trailer that appeared on the internet  on June 13 2020.

PLUSES of the games:
 - good graphics;
 - saving the main gameplay chips, which can be partially attributed to the minus;
 - good dialogue.

 - there are no additional tasks, but there are from the original;

It is very much cut and dumbed down version of the original game. It lacks everything that made the original game one of the greatest pieces ever. Many good things have been taken away from mission and level design. Things have been cut from the story and characters as well, and they have been replaced with very poor choices, or simply cut out. Level design is horribly dumbed down and alternative approaches have been made impossible.

Performance-wise the game runs well on maximum settings, but the graphics are very smudgy and textures are low res. I regret paying a full price for this. It does not do honor to the original game, it's a disgrace.

My review is from the perspective of someone that hadn't played the original Mafia.
The game was a great experience overall, with some minor issues. The gunplay was kind-of annoying until I took a thompson and got closer to enemies to tap them in the head. It's your usual rambo gameplay where you're a taxi driver, a guy who does races (a racist), the best killer in town, undefeatable street fight champion (could beat Tyson), and so on. You could be an astronaut as well if it gave you an option. This doesn't mean the gameplay was bad, it's like any other game of the genre. What made the game enjoyable were the fantastic characters, the story and the graphics that have enhanced the experience significantly.

The most annoying aspect of the game was the driving, and considering that you're spending about half the game driving and there's even a racing mission made it a little frustrating at times. I guess that's just how the old cars felt huh. The characters have made the experience so much better. Their personality and their voice have been incredibly fun to listen to. Combining it with the story made a wonderful experience.",1686410830,1686410830,True,15,3,0.596870601177215576,0,True,False,False

However, everything else is downright bad. Gunplay is inconsistent and hitboxes missmatching, driving is extremely bad (at least in classic mode) and the story is so predictable, short and just...not interesting. Its a classic story of a random guy meeting mafia by accident and continuing to be working under them until...you know the drill, it has been written so many times. Story itself is about 10-12h long, where cutscenes take most of the air time. The rest of the time you will spend just driving from point A to B, and the rest few hours left are actual gameplay.

There is really nothing to remember the game for. Graphics felt nice and voice acting was also well made, but the game feels empty. Its just a driving simulator with a lot of hidden things to collect. And good luck collecting them all without a guide.

By the way, I never play any original Mafia series. This DE game has good story and graphic but developer team should add some side missions to enjoy like GTA or Red Dead Redemption 2. I saw Mafia 3 DE fixed about this but I still need a little more.

I love overall of Mafia 3 DE very much, there are many improvement gameplay from Mafia 1 DE and Mafia 2 DE. But BUSH is still a big obstacle which make me crazy in all Mafia series. We should walk or ride something through them. It like a very strong stone or building that make my car crashed. lol

Hope to see any improvement in next Mafia game or any game from this company, I ready to enjoy all the time :)

This reboot is decent enough graphically, but as a cover shooter it's nothing outstanding, especially in today's games market. Just like other games of the franchise, there is little to no freedom or inclination to explore outside of the mission parameters, no side-quests to complete, no skills progression or character customisation.
The city setting looks and feels convincing, and the map is one of the game's best features, but with no optional side-quests, no meaningful collectables (only meaningless collectables), and no weapons to buy or customise, all it is, is a series of missions strung together with cutscenes and a lot of driving in between. 
It's not a terrible game - there's just not enough depth to keep me interested. It is effectively a sandbox without any toys, and that's a shame because it could have been so much better with a bit more thought toward content.
If you already know what to expect from this franchise, or you're just looking for a quick 1930's gangster shooter fix to satisfy your inner Lucky Luciano, then you may find it enjoyable enough while it lasts.

The definitive edition has improved the gameplay aspect considerably & the graphics is absolutely bonkers. I actually appreciate how they have expanded Sarah's story as it feels more complete now.

But I didn't feel connected with some other characters like the way I did in the original Mafia. It just hasn't been the same with Ralph, Lucas & even Vincenzo. Also, I love the original soundtracks way more.

This is still an amazing game though. 

P.S - The race in the classic mode is still as hard as I could recall. It took like 3 weeks for me & my brother to successfully complete that race (we took turns) when the original came out. Can never forget that! 🤣🤣

That mission killed my motivation to play this game. I tried many difficult games, just to make it clear for anyone with the wrong idea. Many retries with some Sekiro's bosses, some Cuphead bosses, some simulator and tactical games etc. 
Tried some racing games, including Forza Horizon 4 without assists on Expert difficulty. This mission, on the other hand, is how annoyance would look if it was something material. One mission had difficulty/crap much higher than the rest of the game. If that makes it different, I played on K&M. Not ideal for racing games, but fine for TPS. 

I refunded the game. Later, I have found a guide that explains how to easily win in this mission. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2782386698

Purchased the game again. Fine game, except this race mission. In Free Ride, you can change outfits, do side missions etc. There's also mods. I use combat gameplay overhaul and few others, on Classic difficulty. Much better than vanilla game. Harder too, of course (prepare to be 1–2 shot often).

A narrativa é sensacional, tendo um ótimo desenvolvimento tanto da trama como dos personagens, e fazendo varias referencias ao clássico poderoso chefão.
O gameplay é simples tendo excelentes partes de tiroteio, um arsenal modesto de armas, e perseguições alucinantes de carros.
Quanto aos veículos, tem uma grande variedade e todos eles são muito únicos, dando para sentir quais são mais pesados e lentos e os que são mais leves e rápidos. Claro dando destaque aos lindos e únicos visuais dos anos 30 de cada um.
A progressão da historia é por capítulos, uma melhor que o outra, porém quando estiver jogando o modo historia você não tem opção de fazer side quests.
Há o modo separado chamado free ride onde você tem a liberdade de fazer o que quiser, como as side quests ( que são bem desafiadoras e zueiras ) e explorar o mapa atrás de colecionáveis que são as revistas em quadrinhos. 
Quanto ao mapa e a ambientação é tudo muito bonito e detalhado, passando bem a vibe dos anos 30. 
Este de longe é um dos melhores remakes já feitos, levando em conta que o original infelizmente ficou muito datado.
O jogo é uma ótima experiencia narrativa, bastante fiel ao original e com um gameplay muito mais fluido que o enriquece ainda mais.

I really appreciated this revision they created, remodeled to be truly appreciated even in 2023 by the new generations of gamers.
It's not a very long game, we're still talking about a creation made in 2002 if I'm not mistaken, then released in Europe in 2004, so you have to intensely appreciate every minute spent in the campaign.
I highly recommend it to everyone, without exception, I think it's one of those games that must be tried. You will see that Mafia 2 will be there around the corner to wink at you and lure you into its clutches.

As an Italian I only have to say about one small detail .... The conversations in the game in Italian (if played in the original English language) are obscene :D
In order not to hire an Italian actor for the dubbing, they had an English native speaker read sentences who most likely didn't even know what he was reading: D Clearly English accent, wrong tonality, wrong pauses, in short, a disaster.

While I have played better shooters-and definitely better racing games, when I think of that one level-once you get the feel of the shooting and driving they will feel quite smooth. 

The experience overall is very cinematic, not in the blockbuster ""low plot, high spectacle"" kind, but instead you get this transformative feeling of being fully immersed in the story. I have greatly enjoyed it, I highly recommend the game even at full price and even more so with any kind of discount.

Some older gamers who have played and liked the original may hate this reboot because it's not a 100% exact copy. I happen to fall among the latter, and since the original Mafia is my favorite game ever and holds such a special place in my heart, it would make sense for me to be picky and b!tch about the reboot, how it misses some details, how things have changed and so on. But you know what? When I played Mafia: DE I was overrun by the same ecstatic emotions that I felt when I first played Mafia and I totally loved this new rendition.

What else made this possible if not my nostalgia for the story, the city, the characters, etc.? But I didn't care - I loved it for what it was, loved to see the beauty of Lost Heaven backed by amazing visuals, loved to relive the story, loved the cars, the missions, pretty much everything. Yeah they could've worked on some characters a bit more, yeah they could've let us do some side jobs for Luca Bertone instead of simply using postcards for car missions, of course they could've let us play every part that was playable in the original instead of covering some bits with cutscenes, among a few other things. These are improvements that won't see the light of day, but I will never think that's enough to bash this game.

The game has been criticized for many reasons by the original's fans, from voice actors doing an allegedly crappy job to the gameplay being generic, and some gamers went so far as to immediately write Mafia: DE off because they saw Hangar13's name on it. I don't get it. Playing the remake I could often feel the love that the devs put into it, and not once did I think they were just doing their job making minimal effort. Mafia 1 was extraordinary in its details, it was a difficult yet rewarding game, and I suppose being so hardcore is why some of its fans can't get over the modernized remake. However, times have changed, the standards have changed, and I believe nowadays you often gotta appeal to a much wider audience than some 20 years ago if you want your game to succeed. And it probably just so happens that that audience is a tad more generic than it was in 2002.

In any case, I understand the criticism that this game got from some long-time fans of the franchise, and they definitely don't have to like Mafia: Definitive Edition. As for me, I didn't like it either. I loved it.

As an avid fan of the Mafia series, I was both excited and skeptical when I heard about the Mafia Definitive Edition remake. However, after diving into the world of Lost Heaven, I can confidently say that this reimagining is an absolute triumph, breathing new life into a classic title while staying true to its roots furthermore, While no game is without flaws, The Definitive Edition comes remarkably close to perfection. The occasional minor graphical glitch or AI quirk does little to detract from the overall experience. Lastly I will say it only took me 30 hours to complete the story twice and get 100% (first time on easy) (second time on classic) achivements.",1683945836,1683945836,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, I didn't like how the project was executed. Having the open world map and missions separate from each other wasn't great. The lack of attention to detail is evident in the free roam mode, with all points of interest on the map for collecting items being either empty or closed (e.g., cafes, cemeteries, stadiums, parks, etc.). Ships in the sea are static, the texture of flowers is sometimes blurred, and there are many other flaws. NPCs only have three actions - walking, sitting, and standing in pairs. The game also froze a couple of times during free roam mode. Moreover, sometimes I got stuck in a texture outside the city and died.

In conclusion, judge for yourself. With all the dialogues/travel and almost all achievements completed (except for the difficulty one due to the race, which I lowered), the game took me 22 hours.",1611923622,1683899389,True,6,0,0.579679548740386963,0,True,False,False

The only problem I had occaisionally was the knock out prompt not appearing when I sneak up on someone. No frame rate drops, no glitches, no crashes. This is the first game I can say that about in years. I felt like I was on a pre WWW console, where games were made right the first time.

The story is great. The voice acting is top notch as well. The Don is clearly a Paul Sorvino knockoff, but in all the best possible way. The mission structure is jut like a mafia movie. I will admit I love mafia movies, so I'm clearly biased. I thought they did a great job of portraying characters you get invested in. It's been a while since a game has gotten me this well.

The setting is great. You can add a noir filter if you'd like. A lot of the areas are beautiful at night. Dimly lit set pieces that you'd expect from the setting. The way the red bricks light up at night was great.

I played on Normal. The game play is good. Aiming with a controller is just terrible. I use a mouse to aim, but mostly play with a controller due to my wrists. The cover system is ok. I thought it should have more options to switch cover and orbit than it does. Maybe it's because I've played other cover shooters that give you more options to move around. There were also cover objects low enough to vault over, but the game won't allow you. It was just odd. Also, when you leave cover, the game takes you out of ducking. This will cause enemies to hear you immediately when sneaking up behind them. Guns felt good. Movement overall feels good. I actually don't think that driving is bad. The devs did make some poor decisions about what you could hit with a car. I've hit shrubs and boxes on the ground that slammed me to a halt....

I like the option for GPS to be road signs informing you where to go at intersections. You needn't look at the minimap at all, and there's not lines on the ground to follow. It's far more immersive. The radio also really sets the mood. I never once felt the need to skip the drive (probably would on repeat plays,) because the city is great. The length of the game keeps it from overstaying it's welcome. Major point for manual transmissions in cars!

I'm also not a fan of the available controller schemes. I didn't find them at all intuitive. Most cover games use a somewhat consistent scheme because it works. This is just personal opinion though.

I never bother with realistic traffic/police. I don't want a traffic ticket in a game any more than I want one in real life. I'm glad the option is there for the masochists that do. The same with the original difficulty that reloads weapons the real way. Thanks for not forcing me to do it. I am glad it's there. The speed limiter is also a great idea for people who do want to play with realistic police on. It also works as an E brake very well.

The games biggest flaws are  vehicle health, collectibles and Free Ride mode. Your health and your vehicle's health are shared. The level of dumb in this decision...ugh. The collectibles are useless. They offer nothing. They couldn't even bother writing a synopsis of every story that you have to collect. They tie into Free Ride. The entire premise of it is just dumb. Leave the game to reload the game in a mode that you can't even explore properties that are mission sandboxes. Then leave that mode, and reload the game again to continue the story. It exposes just how empty the world is. A much better way to do this would to be able to turn missions off and on again in the game. It's just a way to force trophy hunters to go see all the empty buildings they made. Seriously, most of the buildings are empty. Just walls and floors. Had they made the world with more detail, it would've been fun to explore. The Free Ride races all exemplify how this company doesn't understand driving. There's so many small objects that slam your car to a halt that thou should be able to plow through. The experimental vehicle races are just frustrating, as the vehicles are usually impossible to control. Driving just isn't that great, and thankfully the story works around it.

Overall, I recommend it. Solid 8 out of 10. First game I've given this high of a rating to in years.

Just...poor.

It's a trash besides good cinematic stuff...

Let me start with cons:
1. Combat is just a pure trash (on classic at least, on which I played). Let me give you examples... You shoot them with bigger gun & they always get stuck in the same animation while standing as they are injured.. Same thing is also with deaths it's always so scripted, no good ragdolls whatsover, also regarding blood it's pathetic, even MAFIA 1 had better bloody moments than this one... In general combat is shit & first one had better one with way more immersion...

2. AI is stupid.. It's stupid like insanely, also they wall hack most of the time. AI will always slide from one cover to another... Always... Also, they might try flanking you, which is interesting mechanic, but it doesn't work most of the time well & they flank you well only in very open areas or scripted zones where they are led by developers to flank you.

3. Developers nerfed the game to the point what even in major mission of Chuch shootout once you take morgue car & on all police radios they say what we are in the morgue car which must be stoped by all the means once you stop & crounch behind the car few meters away they just forget about you... And then again you can hop in the same car & speed a bit to get stoped & the same cops near the church will forget about you...  For example, in Mafia 2 you had plate numbers, so without major changes on the car the cops would know it's the car which they were seeking for, but here they don't remember shit about you.

4. Missions are heavily scripted & especially on the start where you always speak with your story leading characters outside of cutscenes & get stuck as game forces you to stay & speak... P.S the worst part what outside movie scenes characters have worse facial expressions than in MAFIA 1!!! I mean they are static...

In general it's a game only in case you want to have a story reviewed, but even then there is a 5th part which sickens me least but Tommy... Tommy is just Tom now... He is generic gangster with terrible change in character from first part...  Get it in case you never played MAFIA 1 & want the story, but don't even waste time on Hard mode / Classic mode as this game is super not rewarding & much worse than MAFIA 1  (besides graphics).


Edit: Same thing with prison mission, like with part 3 where you go in the Church in Mission from the top in the prison I just ran away inside instead of going back and cops suddenly forgot what i just killed their friends & walked by them & they even said something like ""good weather"" or ""hello"" :DD This is pathetic it took me like 30 seconds to loose max wanted level...

[b]Mafia: Definitive Edition - An excellent remake of the classic 2002 game. However, the shooting and gameplay look rather outdated. For some reason, they made it possible to skip driving cars during missions, although many players fell in love with Mafia precisely for driving between missions. The game is very good, but Mafia II will be better for me. But I highly recommend playing this game.[/b]",1681053967,1683203881,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Oyunun hikaye anlatımı güzel, ancak karakterlerle bağ kurmamızı sağlayabilecek kadar kuvvettli hissettirmiyor.
-Oyunun dövüş mekanikleri 2000'li yılları başlarındaki kadar iyi. Dövüş mekanikleri çok özgür hissettirmiyor. Klasik bir siper al ateş et mantığına göre dizayn edilmiş elbette hikaye ağırlıklı gidildiği için rahatsız etmiyor.
-Araba sürme mekaniği biraz hantal kalmış. Hikayenin geçtiği yıla göre düşünürsek belki o yılda eski model arabalar için o rahatsızlık hissi normal midir bilemedim.
-Oyunda görevleri arası bir yerden bir yere giderken açık dünya algısı yaratılmak istenilmiş, ancak ben böyle bir beklentiyle oyunu satın alamadığım için benim hoşuma gitti, ancak ben açık dünyada istediğimi yaparım taraklarında gezecek olan varsa bu oyun o oyun değil.

Eksiler(Oyunun hikayesini bitirdikte sonra yazdığım kısım)
Ana hikaye bitirdikten sonra serbest gezinti modunda oyunu deneyimleme imkanı sunuyor, ancak açık dünyası ruhsuz ve yapılacak kayda değer birşey olmadığı için bunu büyük eksiklik olarak tanımlayabiliriz. En azından 20-30 dakikalık küçük bir görev eklenebilirdi.
-Oyun beklenti yüksek tutulmadığında hikaye olarak ortlamanın üstünde kalitesi var evet, ancak oyundaki neredeyse hiçbir karakterle bağ kurulacak kadar güzel bir olay örgüsü veya oyunculuk göremedim. Ana karakter için çok önemli olan eşiyle ilgili sahneler bile o kadar ruhsuz ve kısa tutulmuş ki karakterin evlilik kısmı hiçbir şekildei inandırıcı olmamış kısa bir düğün sahnesine bile razı olabilirdim. Ayrıca güzel diye tanımladığım hikaye bir yerde sonra o kadar yüzeysel ilerliyor ki sanki gerçek hikayenin özetini oynuyormuş gibi hissettiriyor. işin en ilginç kısmı ise kötü adamlarla yüzleşilen hikayelerde boss fight kıvamında özel hissettiren bir dövüş sahnesi olur ve dersin ki burası en zor kısım burayı geçersem oyunu bitirdim hissini oyuncuya verir. Zorluk konusunda bu oyunda öyle büyük bir dengesizlik var ki göreceli olarak basit bir kamyonu alıp bir yerden bir yere götürme görevinde yaşanan zorluk final sahnesinde yaşanmıyor.


Özetle: Oyun hikayenin açılış kısmını ve oyuncuyu ısındırma kısmını güzel yapmış. Oyuna sudan çıkmış balık gibi atmadan önce göreceli olarak kolay diyebileceğimiz işlerle oyuncuyu ısındırıyor. Hikayenin dallanıp budaklanması ve ağır çatışma sekanslarına girmek biraz zaman alıyor. Gördüğüm eksilere rağmen bu oyun bir klasik olarak oynanmaya değer bir oyun gibi duruyor.",1683040224,1683149249,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Mind you that I was pretty young when the original version came out so I was only allowed to play the free ride mode and I absolutely loved it back then. Therefore I didn't really have many expectations when it comes to the story.
I was positively surprised about how much I enjoyed the 13.5 hours of story gameplay, even though it was kind of short. I was ready to write a stunning review until I started the free ride mode on this remastered version. It was disappointing, to be honest. You are not able to ride the trains or trams anymore which was almost the best part for me. Doing taxi rides is also less fun because it takes so long to find a passenger. Gangsters aren't driving around either. I know these things might sound small but they were such a big part of my love for this game that I walked away disappointed.... and bought the original game again.

All in all, I can recommend this game to anyone who has never played the original version. To the free-ride fans of the original not so much.",1683057338,1683057338,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[u]What I liked about the game[/u]
[list] 
[*]	The developers have made a lot of improvements to the gameplay. A cover system has been added which really improves combat. The vehicles handle better. It is much easier to throw grenades and Molotovs. Hand-to-hand and melee combat is much much better. They have also improved the stealth and now you can take down enemies quietly and hide their body.  

[*]	Hanger 13 have kept those little gimmicky things which made the original special, like being fined or arrested for speeding and refueling your car.   

[*]	Tons of collectables, like pulp magazines and cigarette cards. 

[*]	Although not as generous as free ride extreme you can unlock jobs in free-ride mode which award you with unique cars and weapons.  The game has some awesome unique cars, like the Crazy horse, Flame spear, and the Disorder. You can also unlock new clothes.  

[*]	The game looks absolutely stunning. Hanger 13 has done a very good job remaking the city and the countryside, and all the cars, characters and cut scenes. I like the characters new look, especially Tommy, Paulie, Sam and Salieri. I like what they did with the countryside, having the city and country in one big map with no loading screens.  

[*]	The developers have reworked some of the missions, like Only for relaxation. Some Missions have been made longer and there is much more going on in the levels. The notorious racing level is still there and it is still very challenging. The cut scenes have been changed as well.  

[*]	They have added motorbikes.  

[*]	Brilliant soundtrack.  

[u]What I disliked or was disappointed with[/u]

[*]	I would have liked to of seen some of the gimmicks from mafia 2 be in this game, for example buying drinks from the bar, getting your shoes shined, or being able to buy clothes from shops. I would I liked to of seen some new weapons. 

[*]	There are only 2 types of motorbikes. 

[*]	I wasn’t keen on the vehicle collisions; it felt like bumper-cars.  

[*]	Shooting while driving wasn’t great. 

[*]	Some of the missions were cut a bit, like Moonlighting.

[*]	I didn’t like some of the rewards you got in free ride mode, like golden weapons and cars that don’t belong in that period.  
[/list]
[u]Conclusion[/u] 

Mafia Definitive edition is a fantastic remake; probably one of the best. Hanger 13 has done a fantastic job remaking the cars, the city, the countryside, the cut-scenes and the characters. My biggest complaints are that some of the mechanics needed improving and they could have gone that bit further with the game. If you enjoy games like GTA or the other Mafia games then I highly recommend you buy this game.

This game would've been competing with the likes of the original GTA 3, which is some pretty stiff competition. This game is less open-world than GTA (not really openly exploring stuff most of the time, moreso going through setpieces in a world), but that's about the only bad thing about it.
That being said, this game's presentation and worldbuilding kinda blew me away. The characters in this game are great and you actually get to feeling bad for them as the years of crime take their toll. Story is riveting pretty much all the way to the end and even has an epilogue that segues into Mafia II. The soundtrack fits the times and there's even small details I really appreciated like how radio broadcasts will follow the player's exploits. Of the 3 mafia games in the trilogy, this is probably the best one.
The biggest downside to this game is it's owned by 2K and they suck. You have to use their stupid launcher to run this game, and while it hasn't caused performance issues with this version, it apparently might be exacerbating issues with this game's two sequels.

Story telling and Characters: 
New faces of characters doesn't reflect the original vibe. The story telling become a cheap action packed american movie in this edition. Very dramatic and charismatic scenes are altered with much worse and action packed ones (Sergio's warehouse gate explosion scene completely changed to something else). I remember every minute of this game since I finished original Mafia 1 like 8 times. Playing this game is painful if you remember the old one. You should have make the Mafia 2 and 3 like the original Mafia 1 not make the Mafia 1 like the other 2. 

Graphics and Items:
I must admit that I've liked the environment and new graphics. Keeping some of the iconic cars and adding some new vehicles was a nice call.

You will definitely get enjoyment out of your ~10-17 hours of playtime. The game is fun, the story is decent.

Remaking a classic game is a gamble. As a developer, you are faced with the unenviable task of recreating an old title, making it new and contemporary, but also staying true to the source material because nostalgic fans will bitch about it on Twitter if you don’t. 

With rolling the dice on a remake, you could get great things like the new Resident Evil games, Destroy All Humans, and Black Mesa, but most of the time, studios vomit out titles like Super Mario 64 DS and Goldeneye 007: Reloaded, generally middling games that fail their namesake. Whether this failure stems from bad work or the glossy, rose-tinted fantasy of nostalgia, remaking, NOT remastering, an ancient relic of gamer past is a balancing act of accessibility and allowing the player to relive the past.

Mafia, the original 2002 PC game, was the perfect relic to put through the hi-res machine and make anew. The game in its 2002 form is unplayable at best. While it may have broke the barriers of yesteryear, it is not fun in 2023, with bad control mapping, ridiculous difficulty spikes, and optimization issues. So thankfully, we have an alternative to screaming at the monitor because our mobster guy failed the effing race level again. 

The new Mafia (the “Definitive Edition,” you might say) is a solid sandbox game that is easy to play but hard to complete. It is a perfectly balanced nostalgia-fest that recontextualizes a classic story for a new crop of gamers. Gone are broken save points, sound issues, and unfair bullshit and what takes its place is a polished, measured masterclass of game design with decent graphics and old school simplicity.

Shooting and overall controls work perfectly on a keyboard or controller, with no archaic mapping that harkens to Windows 95. Blending the good Mafia II, Gears of War cover shooting mechanics from the era of 360/PS3, the new Mafia has comfortable, difficult but fair aiming that is fun and action packed. Movement is smooth but has the weight of realistic character action. Perspective and better camera work helps make the new Mafia accessible where the original wasn’t. Yet, difficulty of the linear story mode is somewhat identical to the 2002 counterpart, IF you want it to be. Which brings me to the difficulty options…

In this new Mafia, you can adjust your experience and cater to your taste, whether it be a smooth story playthrough or an old-school trial by fire. This gameplay editing is extensive too, so have fun with shaking things up a bit! Providing this makes old games accessible and opens more barriers for shared gaming communities. You can play easy and still have a challenge, but not the long, grueling triumph of completing Illusion Softwork’s original masterpiece. It’s honestly perfect.

The visuals are serviceable to modern standards, but share the same limitations of Mafia II, a game from 2010! It looks more polished than the original and has a completely new cast for familiar characters. It’s a remake in a cinematic sense as well, barring only identical story elements. That is commendable and gives a new, fresh perspective on an older story. This helps the franchise move away from problematic aspects of the first two original games from 2002-2010. This makes the story palatable, but maintaining story integrity. I personally don’t mind problematic things, but I see the logic of the decision. Overall, it’s a great remake storywise but the visuals are decent. I wanted more ambition there but it’s a decent revision that isn’t an eye sore. And it runs well, which is a rarity for modern releases! Thank God! Mamma Mia! **Italian kissing and hand motions**

Hangar 13’s Mafia: Definitive Edition is a great remake of average presentation. It’s timeless and accessible. It’s old and new. Fresh and moldy. Easy and difficult. A balanced release. A masterpiece? No. That’s Mafia II. But damn close!

This review will give insight on the main story, and a little bit on the achievements as well since I've done them. Maybe it will help you decide whether it's worth buying.

A lot of reviews compare Mafia: DE to the original Mafia game, I have not played the original, so this review is from that perspective. As far as I can tell, this game just cuts out some meaningless driving time.

The original Mafia is also available for a much lower price, it's an old game with poor graphics, but functionally the same as DE, minus the achievements. If you want the story, aren't a fan of the price tag of the DE and don't mind some 2002 graphics and other jank, then that's probably a good option.

[u][b]Open World:[/b][/u]
Mafia: DE, for a start, is advertised as an Open World game, and while it is Open World, the story is very linear and there's no side content besides a few hidden vehicles and collectables to find. Unless you are on the ""Free Ride"" mode, you're always in a mission, and for the most part, you can't deviate from it very much. Some missions prevent you from going off track, some prevent you from leaving your vehicle, but some do allow to you explore before you go to your objective if you like. The point I'm making is that the Open World doesn't come into play naturally, while you are driving around different areas for different missions, you're usually going from A to B, this isn't a bad quality, but just know that this game doesn't play like GTA does, it's a story game primarily.

[u][b]Story:[/b][/u]
Now, the story is great, engaging enough with likeable characters. There are a few moments where you'd think problems could be resolved civilly, and that maybe things could be resolved by talking things out, but it can all be justified by it being a Mafia game, it's all about shooting people and every call being that of ""The Don"". I found myself immersed regardless, the story and growth of the main cast is entertaining and great, the twists and turns are incredible. 

I found the missions to be relatively challenging, playing on Classic. I could take very few bullets and the enemies could take a lot more, it's all about abusing cover and hitting headshots. One thing of note, the cars are very ""boat-like"" for the most part (which makes sense as they're cars from the '30s), a lot of the missions involving a lot of fast driving can be quite tedious, the race mission is on another level of tedious though. The driving isn't terrible, fun at points, but compared to the story or combat, it's not great.

[u][b]Collectables:[/b][/u]
As far as collectables go, if you care about them, I would highly recommend looking up the locations of the ones in missions in advance, there are some areas you cannot access in Free Ride, so if you miss them at the time, you'll be replaying the missions to the point where you can get them, you can quit out after though and retain the collectable progress. I spent around 6 hours getting the collectables post-story completion, a lot of that was replaying missions to grab ones I had missed.
In total, there is absolutely loads to collect:[list]
[*]10 Magazines
[*]22 Cigarette Cards
[*]50 Mystery Foxes
[*]80 Comics (4 Comics with 20 editions each) [/list]

A lot of this review sounds like criticism, but understand that I can't give a ton of insight and detail on the good aspects of the game without spoiling things. 

[u][b]TLDR:[/b][/u] Mafia: Definitive Edition is a story game primarily, the Open World aspect comes second and doesn't come into play during the main story often, you're just driving through it, that being said; the story is very good, the combat is fun and engaging, the characters are likeable, the cars are good fun, the race mission is terrible. If you don't want to spend a lot, the original Mafia is available for a far better price, minus some graphical quality.

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.",1601190595,1682660936,True,0,1,0,1,True,False,False

If you however like walking simulators, love forced slow walking sections and very linear game design, and expect a lot of hand holding, then this game might be for you.

So.....
.....this is gonna be a very unpopular opinion, but Mafia: Definitive Edition is a extremely disappointing game in all regards. I've only played Mafia II before, and never touched the original Mafia (2002), but it seems like developers didn't take any features that were introduced in Mafia II. You have the entire city modeled with so much potential yet never do anything interesting with it. I realize there is a free ride mode but what I've heard is that it's just there for collecting cars, do some phone booth missions and maybe some taxi services and races but that seems to be it. There was no real incentive to try it, since there are no places to rob, no guns to collect, heck there is no money even FFS (in a game where you are a criminal). Anything that could add some immersion or create interesting gameplay experience. Say what ever you want about Ubisoft sandbox-game design but atleast you have stuff to do and gameplay in general just works.

This is a story-focused game, so obviously you are here for that but game could have a magnificent story for all I care but it matters very little if gameplay is dogshit. Gunplay is one of the worst I've experienced in a AAA game. The way it's done is inexcusable; 
- aiming is unnecessarily clunky, using a circle instead of reticle (with pistols), leading to shots you really shouldn't miss. Tommy not having a military background unlike Vito (Mafia II) is not an excuse; he would learn to shoot better eventually, but it's not reflected through gameplay. He can pull a perfect sniper shot in one story mission but somehow still has issues getting accurate shots in-game.
- Enemies (most of the time) do not react to being shot, until you get a fatal hit. They are bullet sponges on higher difficulties which makes guns feel really weak, so you really want to go for headshots.
- Movement can be inconsistent. Sometimes Tommy moves where you want him to go but other time he might make a circle or having delay which is really bad when in middle of gun fights
- Cover mechanic is just terrible; it's easy to accidentally take cover in wrong spot or getting out of cover when you don't intend it to happen and it's even worse when you add that tanky movement I mentioned previously, so that might lead to unfair deaths. And if you don't use that magnetic cover function, instead try to ""dynamically"" take cover and shoot (like you would in any decent shooter), Tommy refuses to shoot until game decides he can, despite having a clear line of sight.
- No way to choose your gear before missions. The reason why Mafia II open-world worked is because you could choose what gear to take (by buying or stealing). It allowed you to prepare for next encounters and waste your money between missions however you pleased (with few exceptions).
- Lack of real arsenal. I think there was like four side-arms and three primary guns in the entire game, unless I missed some. I'm fairly sure Mafia 2 had a few more than that (and felt like proper guns, not like BB guns).
- Either game is getting tedious and you die due to clunky design or is simply too easy, because game tells everything you have to do without letting you figure out anything yourself. There are no complications, where you have to figure out the next step. It's just the same old, go to point B, shoot people or do not get caught and follow the narrow path we (devs) designed for you. DO NOT BREAK AWAY FROM THE SCRIPT! What is it with modern AAA games, when they can't let you just play the damn game without any hand holding.

What also shouldn't be given any excuses, is the way story is presented in-game. Cutscenes are fine and mostly well executed (and thx god can be skipped) but unfortunately this game has forced walking sections, which take away control from the player (and these you cannot skip, so you are forced to wait). Other times game gives you 15 seconds of gameplay until interrupting you again with another cutscene or unskippable dialog. It's painful to experience this kind of story telling everytime I touch a AAA-game that tries to be like a movie. Game devs, please understand that there are alternative ways to tell a story, using in-game mechanics and possibly some element of player choice so experiencing short comings feel more personal (like
[spoiler] losing all your money and your house in Mafia II late-game so you as a player would feel as pissed as Vito did or letting you stealthily break the safe for bigger payday or fail to do so by raising alarm and killing guards leading to getting only 1/3 of the reward [/spoiler] 

I've encountered a few major bugs. In one mission where you are suppose follow a car without getting spotted, it got stuck in traffic because there was a truck blocking the road, leading to game over and starting it from beginning. Another issue is that tabbing out can mute the game audio, which only can be fixed by restarting the game. And sometimes in vehicle chases or shootouts, game might instantly kill you after cutscene has played (because protected target had a low HP I guess), but it didn't even give me a second to react.
Also hate the fact that game changes my weapons and ammo count when reloading checkpoints sometimes.

Mafia DE got so tedious that I decided to disable simulated driving and cop reactions and choose to skip  driving sections because whats the point of driving in a open world if there is nothing to do. I completed it on hard difficulty. And don't give me shit for being bad at the game, because I did beat race track mission on hard and simulated driving.

Sorry if my review is a bit messy but I had to explain my reasons in the best way I could so I didn't miss anything important. There is more to say, but I'll leave that for professional reviewers. The amount of positive reception this game got just baffles me when you consider how many issues this game has.
Whether it is driving, shooting and stealthing, everything in Mafia: Definitive Edition is either painfully mediocre or worse than that.

Just watch the cutscenes or walkthroughs on Youtube, and you wouldn't miss a thing.",1682251273,1682251273,False,0,1,0.485571593046188354,0,True,False,False

Not 10 out of 10, but a solid remake nonetheless. Took about 8 hours to beat on highest difficulty available. Core story is almost exact copy of the original with small-ish alterations here and there that don't matter much in a long run. Compared to original, remake is scaled to down by 2-2.5 times. Pointless driving segments are removed entirely, some scenes moved into cutscenes, some - removed entirely. Unlike original... how should I put it? Mmm... remake ""gets to the point"" much faster than the original. Solid 6 to 8 hours linear campaign that manages to keep you interested till the end.

However, not [i]EVERYTHING[/i] in Mafia: Definitive Edition was to my liking and I don't agree with certain decisions made for it. Side missions for Lucas Bertone were cut entirely. Apart from his brief appearence in previously mentioned infamous Fair Play (by the way, I do love the fact that devs decided to keep Fair Play challenging, this mission does not hold your hand at all) and his micro role in Free Ride, his character is not utilized at all. While I agree that his missions in the original messed with game's already slow pacing, they shouldn't have cut him out entirely. Some of the side missions were quite interesting and obtaining luxurious cars through him felt quite rewarding.

They made a decisiont to cut Free Ride Extreme too, well... not exactly. Original game featured two types of Free Ride modes: Free Ride, GTA-like sandbox and Free Ride Extreme - unlockable by beating campaign, Free Ride Extreme featured a slightly alterated version of Lost Heaven with stunt ramps, Easter Eggs (like that creepy-ass Rock face) and (I believe) 18 missions that unlocked bonus ""prototype"" cars that eithere were wacky or speedy af. For the remake, devs made a decision to merge these two modes. While it's not a bad idea, a lot of extremely fun missions like ""Save a damsel from a Sea Monster"" or ""Cross a bridge"" on Bolt Ace while a blimp above you is bombing you or ""Chase the plane"" were cut entirely. SOME original missions like ""Chase UFO"" HAVE made it into the remake, but there's only a handful of these, rest is remake exclusive and all of them are... extremely boring.

Last thing that I did not appreciate in a butchering of ""Moonlighing"" mission. Literally 75% of the mission is... gone. Cut. Even without cutscenes. Game file diggers found characters and assets that were meant for this mission went unused. Hella weird, considering how faithful rest of the game is. Feels like they simply ran out of time.

Woudn't say that it is worth a full price but it is a steal at a sale. If you liked newer Mafia games, you will like this one to. 7.5 out of 10.",1679238051,1681977970,True,48,0,0.711822509765625,0,True,False,False

It's way past midnight and i have big things to this morning, were it not the case i might have done the whole story in one sittting (aside from smoke and throne breaks yk).
The game needed some tinkering but nothing too complicated...
By the way, there's an extra launcher before actually launching the game which has never been a good thing in my experience in over two decades of gaming...

Final review : 

There's huge attention to detail and a lot of efforts put in this title... but not on all fronts.
First off, full controller support is not here as claimed. I hqd a friend to come over and try to use his xbox controller (i don't have not want one) and can confirm that even xbox controller support is poorly implemented at best.
Graphics are really good, from the environments to even skin imperfections and wrinkles caused by frowning or smiling it's all here and astounding.
That gives even more weight to the already excellent reworked dialogues and so to the story.
However, i have a contrast problem (can be fixed easily) with my 165Hz monitor.
When it comes to gameplay i recomment sticking to classic mode as other difficulties are far less satisfying mechanics/difficulty standpoint.
Out of the whole game i found frustrating is that notorious race and a turret section where you need to be fast af and super accurate with a thompson...
My biggest gripe with this game by far is the amount of collectible and the meaningless free ride mode to pad the game considerably. That part was on enjoyable in the slightest, it just felt like chores.

Whilst there is an ""open world"" in Mafia: Definitive Edition, it is only there in service of the story. It is there when you travel to the mission objective, but it isn't full of icons for things you need to cross off the list. You undertake a series of missions, mostly involving driving around, shooting things, very much like a GTA game, but aside from collecting a few cards and magazine covers, you just do the missions and enjoy the story. Think LA Noir, but on the other side of the law.

From the opening cut scene, you are led from one mission to the next, often skipping the usual trudge back to the next mission marker on the map. Once you complete a mission, the next scene begins. Whilst it is possible to go out and roam the streets, this is a separate mode called Free Ride. You [i]can[/i] just do the missions and walk away. I really, [i]really[/i] appreciate that in my advancing years (lol). 

The story is beautifully told. Set during the depression/prohibition era in the US just as the spectre of WW2 was appearing on the horizon. The world you inhabit during missions is full of atmosphere and period radio stations, classic architecture and classic cars. It takes around 11 hours to complete the story, but it was one of the few games I've played recently that really gripped me. Like a good book I just couldn't put it down.

With this being the ""definitive edition', I've not played the original, but the definitive edition looks better than some newer games. With its ""optimal"" graphics setting it pushes my RTX 3070Ti quite hard at 4K, but it sure is pretty.

I wholeheartedly recommend this one.",1681226365,1681226365,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Overall – Mafia: Definitive Edition was just a frustrating experience for me.  The driving and shooting mechanics feel awful… and guess what you spend most of the game doing… driving and shooting... Graphically, its impressive, the story is also a bit better than you’d expect, and has an extremely strong lead in to Mafia II, but the gameplay is really what ends up being the weak point here. If you’re planning to play the trilogy, maybe it’s worth your time to check this game out, but for me it was one and done.  Recommended.

In fact, if the original Mafia used a third-person view but ended up adopting a first-person shooter gunplay, for the Definitive Edition it was thought well to harmonize these mechanics by taking Mafia III as a reference and thus redesigning the entire experience, from the interface to the cover system.

The end result is certainly enjoyable and quite modern, bringing to life some of the most challenging sequences in a campaign that unravels through more than twenty missions that are gradually more complex and multifaceted. The arsenal available to the protagonist is fairly extensive between pistols, rifles, machine guns and special weapons, but a melee combat system based on simple attack and counterattack mechanisms has also been introduced, with some spectacular finishers.
The lack of refinement of certain moments, between more or less obvious glitches (which we imagine, however, will be fixed with the first updates) and various ""jams,"" leaves a little bitter taste in our mouths and reminds us that what we are playing is a remake of a title that has almost twenty years on its shoulders. The artificial intelligence of enemies falls under the same discourse: some behaviors are convincing, see when they change position behind cover to shoot at us from a different point; others are quite inexplicable, such as when they proceed straight ahead heedless of bullets.

All this also applies when driving, at least with the default settings: police cars will only give us grief if we choose to set the original difficulty, and similarly the behavior of our vehicle will become more nervous if we choose the simulative option in place of the arcade approach. It is nice to have this freedom of choice, despite the fact that as mentioned, the scenery is merely functional to the action and does not enjoy a life of its own.

ingredients

For the optional tomato sauce
    2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
    3/4 cup finely chopped onion
    3/4 cup finely chopped carrots
    3/4 cup finely chopped celery
    2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
    1 clove garlic, minced
    1 (28-ounce) can crushed or whole tomatoes, including the juice, or 1 3/4 pound of fresh tomatoes peeled, seeded, and chopped
    1/2 teaspoon dried basil or 2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
    1 teaspoon tomato paste
    Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

For the meatballs
    2/3 cup milk (whole or 2 percent)
    3 slices of white bread, crusts removed (about 3 ounces)
    1 pound ground beef (at least 16 percent fat)
    1 pound ground pork
    1/4 cup ricotta cheese
    1/4 cup grated Parmesan or Romano cheese
    2 large eggs
    1 teaspoon salt (or 2 teaspoons kosher salt)
    1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
    2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
    1 teaspoon dried oregano or marjoram
    2 to 3 cloves garlic, minced
    About 1 cup flour, for dusting
    1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil
    2 1/2 cups (24 ounces) tomato sauce (recipe follows, or use already prepared)

Method

    Make the tomato sauce:
    Heat the olive oil in a large skillet on medium heat. Add the onion, carrots, celery, and parsley. Stir to coat with the oil, reduce the heat to low, and cover the pan. Cook until the vegetables are soft and cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes.
    Remove the cover, add the garlic, and increase the heat to medium-high. Cook the garlic for half a minute, then add the tomatoes (if using whole canned tomatoes, break up with your fingers as you add them to the pan). Add the basil and tomato paste. Season with salt and pepper.
    Bring to a low simmer, reduce the heat to low, and let cook uncovered until thickened while you prepare the meatballs, 15 to 30 minutes.
    Purée in a blender, or push through a food mill if you'd like a smooth consistency. Return to the pan and adjust the seasonings.

    Soak the torn bread in hot milk:
    To make the meatballs, heat the milk in a small pot until steamy. Turn off the heat, tear the bread into little pieces and soak it in the milk until it partially dissolves. Mash it until you get something that resembles a paste. Turn it out onto a plate to let it cool.
    Submerge the bread in hot milk and let it soak Submerge the bread in hot milk and let it soak
    Soak the bread in hot milk in a saucepan Soak the bread in hot milk in a saucepan
    
Make the meatball mixture:
    In a large bowl, combine the beef, pork, ricotta cheese, grated Parmesan, eggs, garlic, parsley, oregano, salt, pepper, and the bread-milk mixture. Mix it well with your hands until it barely combines.

    Don't overwork the mixture or it will become tough. It is OK to have some discernible bits of bread or meat in the mix; better that than overworked meatballs.

    Form the meatballs:
    Wet your hands and form the meatballs. A traditional size for this sort of meatball is 2 to 3 inches across, but you can make them any size you want.

    Once you roll the meatball in your hands, roll it in the flour to give it a good coating. Set each one on a baking sheet as you work. You might need to rinse your hands a few times as you make the meatballs.
    Shape homemade meatballs with your hands Shape homemade meatballs with your hands
    Coat homemade italian meatballs in flour Coat homemade italian meatballs in flour
    Brown the meatballs:

    When all the meatballs are formed, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Brown the meatballs on at least 2 sides. Don't worry about the center getting cooked through, as you will finish these in the sauce.
    Brown both sides of the meatballs in a skillet Brown both sides of the meatballs in a skillet
    Brown the italian meatballs in a skillet Brown the italian meatballs in a skillet
    Finish cooking the meatballs in tomato sauce:

    Once all the meatballs are browned, arrange them in the sauce, turning each one over in the sauce to coat.

    Cover the pot and simmer gently for 15 to 20 minutes. Serve with the sauce and pasta or crusty bread. Sprinkle with a little chopped parsley for garnish if you want.

Rice flour, or legumes such as beans or lentils, are sometimes used in place of wheat flour to yield a different taste and texture, or as a gluten-free alternative. Pasta is a staple food of Italian cuisine.[1][2]

Pastas are divided into two broad categories: dried (pasta secca) and fresh (pasta fresca). Most dried pasta is produced commercially via an extrusion process, although it can be produced at home. Fresh pasta is traditionally produced by hand, sometimes with the aid of simple machines.[3] Fresh pastas available in grocery stores are produced commercially by large-scale machines.

Both dried and fresh pastas come in a number of shapes and varieties, with 310 specific forms known by over 1,300 documented names.[4] In Italy, the names of specific pasta shapes or types often vary by locale. For example, the pasta form cavatelli is known by 28 different names depending upon the town and region. Common forms of pasta include long and short shapes, tubes, flat shapes or sheets, miniature shapes for soup, those meant to be filled or stuffed, and specialty or decorative shapes.[5]

As a category in Italian cuisine, both fresh and dried pastas are classically used in one of three kinds of prepared dishes: as pasta asciutta (or pastasciutta), cooked pasta is plated and served with a complementary sauce or condiment; a second classification of pasta dishes is pasta in brodo, in which the pasta is part of a soup-type dish. A third category is pasta al forno, in which the pasta is incorporated into a dish that is subsequently baked in the oven.[6] Pasta dishes are generally simple, but individual dishes vary in preparation. Some pasta dishes are served as a small first course or for light lunches, such as pasta salads. Other dishes may be portioned larger and used for dinner. Pasta sauces similarly may vary in taste, color and texture.[7]

In terms of nutrition, cooked plain pasta is 31% carbohydrates (mostly starch), 6% protein, and low in fat, with moderate amounts of manganese, but pasta generally has low micronutrient content. Pasta may be enriched or fortified, or made from whole grains.

Etymology
First attested in English in 1874, the word pasta comes from Italian pasta, in turn from Latin pasta, latinisation of the Greek παστά, pasta, 'barley porridge'.",1680813183,1680813183,True,0,0,0.405515015125274658,0,True,False,False

This was the perfect opportunity to be able to play one of the classics I've been waiting years to play [Been wanting to play Mafia 1 since 2018] because I love the setting, the characters, etc. [Experienced Mafia 2 first, and then Crapia 3]

Instead, i'm filled with disappointment, Shooting feels off and weird. Enemies so bullshit that you just can't take it anymore. Tons of bugs. Etc. 

I've had 2 missions in which I had to switch my difficulty from Classic down to Easy due to how fucking crap they were.

1st- The Race Mission, I've heard it was crap and hard af so I just gave up and lowered the difficulty as I am a busy man and don't have time to play something that doesn't interest me [In this case the Race itself]

2nd- The Truck Mission after the Barn Shootout, this was because it was buggy af, they could shoot me from angles where I couldn't even see them, damaged the car absurdly fast, and because of the dogshit graphics that try to be as incredible and gorgeous as possible I couldn't see dogshit.

As for aspects of the game itself
Driving, although realistic, feels like you're on ice all the time
Enemies give you double the damage they take, you die in like 3 Thompson shots, they die in like 6 sometimes. Its fucking nuts
Countless bugs that just ruin the experience

As much as I love this game for its Story and Setting
The game itself is another dogshit AAA release.

This hurts to say but.

They did change some of the story detail on this new version so for old OG Mafia players like me didnt feel bored or feel just a 100% copy and paste story from the original one.

They also give many new collectible item and mission, just like Free Ride Extreme mode on the OG version, so even after we completed the story mission we can still playing it and roaming through the city to complete the collection/challenge mission.

Even if there was a fix, my opinion is that games should run properly out of the box, at least on modern systems.

Won't say anything else about the game since I only played it for 30 minutes. Only thing that was positive for me was the lack of ""leftist"" propaganda in the first 30 minutes of the game.

I finished the story a few minutes ago and I gotta say. This is one of the best made games I've ever played. The story will keep you on edge and wanting more. You will come to like a lot of characters, Especially the main one.

I ran and bought Mafia II & Mafia III Definitive Editions which I have also beat back when they were released. The reason I went back and bought them again for PC and plan to beat them both is 100% based off of how amazing this one was. The graphics on my 2K Monitor were amazing. The shooting feels very good. The fighting is a little whack but the game did come out in like 2002 originally so thats expected. I still loved every moment of this game and didn't want it to end. 

If you're looking for a very well done story, With amazing actors/voice actors . Buy this game! 10/10.

1 - Despite this game is called ""open world"" the main structure of this game is around your campaign, you will start at ""mission 1"" and when you complete you will complete ""chapter 1"" and straight forward you will enter in ""chapter 2"" at starting of mission 2 that you must do something to complete, at first it does not looks bad but you don't fell the freedon to explore the world since you are always on mission.

2 - Campaign, it's TOO SHORT. i completed this game in 8 hours and i felt that i could complete these 25~35 missions in a few hours less if i wasn't too much attached in dialogs and looking the graphics of this game xD

3 - There is nothing to do after you complete the game, unless you want to run around the city collecting stuff to get an achievement.

4 - Small quantity of vehicles.

5 - Just 2 radios, which one is mostly talking about news regarding what happens in the world as you progress in your campaign.

I felt that i could still pontuate some issues in this game but as i said in overall it's a good game to buy and your first impression when you enter in this mafia 1 world is like ""whoa, i'm in the 30's, and graphics as i said is very good.
There was just a few bugs in my gameplay like once i saw a car kinda flying in the street for some weird bug but they aren't recurring.

I JUST FINISHED THIS GAME 3 MINUTES AGO AND ALL I CAN SAY IS HOLY SHIT WHAT AN EXPERIENCE, NOT A GAME, AN EXPERIENCE.

It was like I was playing through a super well-written, well-acted, and well-executed mafia movie. This game DID NOT bore me once and even my most loved games has some moments where I say boringggg. But this??? HELL NAWWWWWW.

The CUTSCENES were so amazing I keep getting amused how good everything is acted, from the mannerisms and the dialogue and the camera angles, just like a high budget movie! The graphics is crazy good and I run this game at power-saver mode so my lappie does not get hot, 60FPS stable on max sets! 

The story, dare I say, is on par with RDR2. A story about family, friendships, betrayal. From blowing out dirty blood money, to looking out for your family. I sat straight the whole time every mission. And the missions too! Despite no side-content, this game is mostly linear with open-world mechanics, and holy shit did they do it really good. It is like following through a well-written book.

I cannot wait to play Mafia 2, and 3 (they say Mafia 2 has a better story, which makes me pumped knowing how amazing Mafia 1 is)

Everyone knows the first Mafia game is the best. The definitive edition makes it even better. It's all so beautiful. The detail in the game is amazing. From the way the characters move to the way the city looks, it's all so realistic. Every time you play the game, you feel like you're in a real mafia. The first game set the standard for all the others. and they just keep getting better and better.

Ambience: Great (as far as I played it)

Fights: Very bad (with mouse and keyboard)
Driving: Oh lord it's f*ng bad.

This game has a high production quality overall. It's very clear that it has had a large budget. However, when it comes to the game mechanics and the design itself, it is very apparent that this is not a product that has had any playtesting or Quality Assurance at all. Several missions are pure, distilled cancer. The race and the turret missions are hated for a reason. I cannot think of a game that has worse missions.

Let me say it again: If it wasn't for the GTA film noir premise, no one would have given the game a thumbs up. All those of us who downvoted absolutely love the idea of the game, but the game itself is pure garbage. The missions aren't hard as in you need to git gud. You need to memorise everything and learn to do what the game devs intended for you, when they intended it for you. It is pure cancer. Most of the fights will have you start already with a cover chosen for you. The most cancerous missions aren't helping the story either. They completely rip you out of the immersion because of how stupid they are. If you google ""how to beat the turret mission"", the most common advice will be ""switch on target locking and set it to max"", followed by ""set your mouse sensitivity to 1"" and ""set your graphics settings to high to slow the game down"".

Oh, and completely disregard the ""open world"" aspect of the game. You are ALWAYS in a mission. There is no side content. The only ""open world"" happens as you drive from A to B, where you'll have absolutely no choice and are demanded to approach the game in the most linear way possible. Health and ammo btw. aren't placed where it makes sense. Nor are they placed in a realistic way. If you play the game on classic, you'll have no chance of knowing when and where the health and ammo re up will be. The game will save the latest checkpoint for you. Congratulations, you can start the same shit again with 5% health and no ammo.
The game devs, in their infinite wisdom, have however decided to include the cut scenes so that you can watch or skip them five million times.

So no, this is not a game that I'd recommend to anyone. It is not a playable game in that you have zero autonomy, stories in the mission are often ridiculously stupid to justify the most cancerous missions possible. The most enjoyable parts of the missions are the part where you drive from your hideout to the mission.",1679169474,1679216289,False,6,3,0.517210781574249268,0,True,False,False
1030840,134936336,76561197970531340,0,45,620,0,620,1679195384,"The Definitive Edition is Hangar 13's complete remake and rebuild of 2002's ""Mafia"", the very first title in the franchise's history. Developed on the Mafia III engine, The Definitive Edition boasts modern visuals, controls, story content, and a plethora of features including a mode allowing the player to experience the game in black-and-white. Set in the 1930s, the story follows the rise of Tommy Angelo through the ranks of the Italian American mafia. 

The story is very much influenced by classic mafia films including The Godfather, Goodfellas, Once Upon A Time In America, A Bronx Tale, and The Untouchables. While action heavy, the game does its best to match the pacing and tone of those films with its aesthetics, soundtrack, dialogue and 'rise to power' narrative. But, it is an action game so The Definitive Edition doesn't truly capture the essence of a classic mob film. 

Instead of faithfulness to source material, The Definitive Edition offers a lot of heart by way of direct nods and tributes to moments from those classic films. This also means that the gameplay style is very linear. Although the option of a more stealth oriented approach is available to the player, the gameplay is limited to shooting, sneaking, and fists. Additionally, while there is a free roam mode in the game which allows the player to explore the fictitious world of New Heaven, the player won't be spending much time exploring within the campaign itself given the script-heavy nature of the narrative. 

Despite these flaws, The Definitive Edition is still a lot of fun and the narrative, while predictable, is fun to see play out. The visuals are stunning and well optimised, voice acting is superb, and the overall inspiration for the project is evident. Best of all, the malady of stiff and wooden controllers of the original game (driving in particular) have been drastically improved. 

The Definitive Edition may offer significant improvements over the original title, but it offers little incentive for the player to revisit given the extremely linear nature of the game. But, it's worth journey at least once.

There are several missions where how to win the mission is only known by googling. The race, the board fight with the goon,  and now I'm on the truck chase scene. It's impossible to beat, I've tried literally 40 times, some say shoot only when not being shot at, some say stay stood up so the truck doesn't take damage and you do instead, so many tips and none of them work,  The guy in the game just yells at you to shoot when they are reloading. but the truck dies in 3-4 bursts from the enemy, and the M1928 SMG they force you to use has 50 rounds. so you got to choose to shoot, wait to shoot, duck or stand up. those are the only options.  The aim assist is BS so i turn it off but then the game punishes you by flying you around and purposely moving your aim, so you turn the aim assist on but the bullets go to the main vehicle instead of the target (the turret on top), It's the dumbest mechanic.

To give credit, the cutscenes and the story direction of the game is pretty great, and I'd like to know the story. But I just don't have the willpower to bang my head against the wall 8000 times to figure out the idiotic mechanics. 

I will also say the revamp and update of the game graphics looks actually pretty good for such an old title.  Great job and I'm sure whomever updated the game had a passion for this.  

I'm playing on Mouse/KB on PC just for anyone who reads this.  It's a don't buy for me because of the F******* INFURIATING mechanics. They got my money I guess good on them. Play Mafia 3 it's much more fun and you can actually beat it.

I was playing on normal and finally gave in and swapped to ""easy"" and didn't make any difference at all in passing this mission.  I am giving up on this title and good luck to anyone else who tries it. I hope if by some chance of whatever diety you like that you pass this mission you can enjoy this game more than my blood pressure rose.

I feel bad for the devs, maybe this was a great game in 2002 but I can't play it in 2023. I am a big fan of Mafia 3.  I'm more than 5 hours in and can't ask for a refund or I would. :|",1679183000,1679183000,False,2,0,0.442973792552947998,0,True,False,False

I actually beat it back in January, and I have to say, I really loved it. One of the main things that drew me in was the main character, Tommy. He was so relatable from the start, and his story was really well written. The choices Tommy made throughout the game actually impacted his character development, where as some games treat it as just a layer. Plus the Don was just incredible.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2886499878

The graphics, sound, and physics were all really good too, and a huge improvement over the original game. But what really kept me hooked were the twists and turns of the story. I was constantly guessing who the mole was, and there were even moments when certain character deaths impacted me emotionally, which doesn't happen often.

There were a few things that were a bit neutral for me, like the movement feeling a bit unpolished at times and the dialogue overlapping occasionally. But it wasn't a big deal for me overall.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2886475020

There were a few things I didn't like too though. For one, the world felt kind of empty despite being full, which made it feel fake sometimes. Also, the non-playable characters would sometimes react strangely to me driving down the road, and even jump out at me! And for some reason, the simulation driving wasn't on by default, which was weird.

But honestly, the good outweighed the bad for me. I really enjoyed playing Mafia and was emotionally invested in the story and characters throughout the game. Oh, and one more thing - I would have loved to play at least one mission as old man Tommy, to see the life he had built for himself.

Developed by Hangar 13, the game is a faithful recreation of the classic 2002 title with modernized graphics, refined gameplay mechanics, and a reimagined storyline.

The graphics in Mafia: Definitive Edition are simply stunning. The city of Lost Heaven is beautifully realized, with highly detailed textures and lighting effects that create a truly immersive atmosphere. The game also features an impressive cast of characters, each with their own distinct personalities and mannerisms, brought to life with excellent voice acting and motion capture.

But Mafia: Definitive Edition isn't just a visual upgrade. The gameplay has been refined to be more modern and engaging, with improved shooting mechanics, more responsive driving controls, and an expanded open-world that encourages exploration. The game's missions are expertly crafted, blending action, stealth, and storytelling in a way that keeps players engaged from start to finish.

One of the standout features of Mafia: Definitive Edition is its story. The game follows the rise of Tommy Angelo, a cab driver who becomes embroiled in the criminal underworld of Lost Heaven. The narrative is expertly paced, with twists and turns that keep players guessing until the very end. The characters are well-written and believable, with relationships that feel real and meaningful.

Overall, Mafia: Definitive Edition is an outstanding remake that surpasses the original in every way. The attention to detail, refined gameplay mechanics, and reimagined storyline all come together to create a truly unforgettable experience. If you're a fan of the original game or just a fan of open-world action games in general, then Mafia: Definitive Edition is a must-play.",1678822222,1678822222,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Temat przestępczości w grach wideo istnieje od dawien dawna, kiedy myślę o fantastycznych scenariuszach i światach które można utworzyć dla setek graczy na całym świecie do ogrywania i podziwiania, pierwsze co mi wpada do głowy to fantasy i crime. Gothicki i San Andreasy to nostalgia w czystej postaci dla wszystkich graczy, którzy mają już dwudziestkę na karku, dla wielu z nich również oraz dla młodszych odbiorców największymi grami zeszłej dekady są Wiedźmin, GTA V czy RDR 2. Konkurencja, jeżeli chodzi o takie tytuły jest więc bardzo gęsta i za każdym razem, kiedy wpada mi do ucha, że ktoś ogrywał czy widział gierkę fantasy czy crime i jest ona “niesamowita”, “zachwycająca” czy “z***bista” przykuwa to moją uwagę natychmiastowo. Poprzeczka zawsze jest bardzo wysoko, dlatego dodatkowo imponujące jest, kiedy nowym grą uda się ją pokonać. Mafia I nie jest grą nową, a remake’iem co trzeba wziąć pod uwagę, jednakże przy przytłaczająco pozytywnych recenzjach musiałem ją sprawdzić. No i cóż, wysiadłem z tej parunastu godzinnej przejażdżki nienasycony. 

	Mafia I to stara gra, DE ma przede wszystkim wypolerować wszystkie niedociągnięcia oryginału, nałożyć nową szatę graficzną i nie zmieniać za bardzo rozgrywki co, aby nie podpalić pochodni uśpionego tłumu fanów klasyka. Ja w oryginał z 2002 nie grałem więc nie podchodzę do recenzji z myślą o zachowaniu cech poprzednika co jest główną przyczyną mojego “nienasycenia”. 

Bo Mafia I DE, to gra stara, przynajmniej nie na pierwszy rzut oka, ale im więcej godzin z nią spędziłem tym bardziej czułem, że gram w demo techniczne które miało ciekawe pomysły na niektóre mechaniki, ale ostatecznie je porzuciło. Strzelanie jest najprostszym systemem shoot&duck, arsenał broni skąpszy niż towary Nowo Jorskich bezdomnych skitrane za pazuchą, skradanie nieistotne, a świat przedstawiony zamknięty i żywy tylko powierzchownie. A szkoda, bo na przykład system prowadzenia w tej grze jest bardzo ciężki co ma oddawać klimat pierwszych samochodów, przez co pościgi wykonywane w zawrotnej prędkości 50 km/h co bardzo oryginalne i klimatyczne. Twórcy zdają sobie sprawę, bo jeżdżenia w tej grze jest bardzo dużo i dobrze. Poza fabułą w tej grze właśnie jeżdżenie coraz to różniejszymi furkami do jazzowych nut lat 30 jest najbardziej przyjemną częścią gry. Warto też wspomnieć o systemie policji który ma jakiś zalążek w stosowanych ograniczeniach prędkości, upomnieniach czy mandatach, szkoda, że nie ma z tym więcej, bo czuć tu potęciał. 

	Ostatecznie dla mnie to co Mafia oferuje to fabułę i klimat i jest to rzecz, za którą fani oryginału kochają tą grę jak i rzecz, która przyciąga najbardziej nowych graczy. W moim uznaniu jednak jest po pierwsze niedostateczne a po drugie nieciekawe. Postacie i fabuła z jednej strony wpadają we wszystkie możliwe trope’y aby wytworzyć typową symulację świata gangsterskiego w czasach prohibicji co jest powierzchowne i nudne przy ogromie innych dzieł zakrawających o temat kryminału, a z drugiej tworzy pewien lunapark mafijny który niezaprzeczalnie jest przyjemny. Dla mnie jednak, jeżeli gra zamierza się bronić przede mną tylko i wyłącznie fabułą, posiadając nieinteraktywny świat oraz znikomy gameplay ma to robić na najwyższym poziomie. Tutejszy poziom jest jednak importowanego kanadyjskiego bimbru, z jednej strony pyszny i jak najbardziej mile widziany, z drugiej strony jak mam pić whiskey to wolałbym mieć prawdziwy Kentucky blend. 

Dla mnie 6/10, dla fanów klimatów mafijnych trochę więcej, dla fanów Mafii Classic z 2002 roku jeszcze więcej  

Czy jest dla fanów dobrej zabawy? 

Jeśli macie dużą ochotę to pewnie, ale raczej szukałbym innych tytułów. I tylko wyłącznie na promocji.",1678710584,1678710584,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I never played the original so I am not blinded by nostalgia, although I did play Mafia 2 which I thoroughly enjoyed.

The game’s storyline is very well made and holds a sense of structure and progression. Without spoiling anything however, I will say that I was slightly disappointed by the ending. However, I don’t think that that should take away from the great game that it is. The city of New York is successfully created, with vehicles being driven throughout the streets and people walking across roads. The ‘noir mode’ is an option that I would advise turning on. This makes the game black and white, which convincingly makes you feel as if you’re living in the 1930s. I won’t say too much more, as I think you should experience it for yourself, but I definitely recommend the game.

The game is developed by Hangar 13 and published by 2K Games. It is a story-driven, third-person action-adventure game set in the 1930s, where players take on the role of Tommy Angelo, a taxi driver who gets caught up in the world of organized crime in the fictional city of Lost Heaven.

The game features an open world environment where players can explore the city, engage in various missions, and interact with the characters. The game's storyline is divided into chapters, each with its own set of missions and objectives. The gameplay includes driving, shooting, and hand-to-hand combat.

Overall, Mafia: Definitive Edition has received good rating from myself. Also other players have praised the game for its engaging storyline, immersive gameplay, and stunning graphics. The game has been praised for its attention to detail and for faithfully recreating the 1930s setting.

I and maybe some players have criticized the game's controls, particularly the driving mechanics, as being clunky and difficult to master. Some players have also found the game's combat mechanics to be repetitive and lacking in depth.

In conclusion, Mafia: Definitive Edition is a well-received remake of a classic game that offers an immersive, story-driven experience set in the world of organized crime. While the game's controls and combat mechanics may not be perfect, its engaging storyline, attention to detail, and stunning graphics make it a worthwhile experience for fans of the genre.",1677920557,1677920557,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story, the graphics, the voice acting, the characters, most of the missions, shootouts, driving. I like the cars, the city feels alive but im kinda sad that there arent shops and stuff like that like in mafia II.

Its almost a faithful recreation of the original game
what i didnt like at all was tommys final line compared to the original though. lame. 

ALSO.

Fair play, trip to the country
absolutely fucking stupid difficulty inconsistencies that make no fucking sense. i want to experience the fucking story not spend 3 hours shooting at a fucking turret. Fuck you, this isnt worth my time.

This is quite a well done remake of the original game. It is a beautiful visual experience, with lovely graphics, lighting, environments, and motion capture for face acting. Of particular note here is the driving experience, the game manages to make driving nearly 100 year old cars exciting while also retaining a sense of the clunky feel of early automobiles. Rattling around in a straight-six Chevrolet or a Model T while being chased by the police is incredibly fun.

The biggest downside of this game for me lays with the writing. While the story is largely unchanged, much of the writing has changed a fair bit. While a lot of the clunky dialogue has been redone with dialogue that feels more natural and flowing, some of the message the original game was trying to convey has been simplified or removed in favour of a different message entirely. Of particular note here is the epilogue.

Another note with the writing is the pacing. While I cannot entirely blame this game itself as these story beats were laid out by the original game, the issue persists that many major plot points sort of just unceremoniously happen, or we are told things have happened instead of being shown this which is more engaging. For example, your syndicate has grown much more powerful than your rivals, and this is mostly just conveyed by us hearing about it. Several characters shift trajectory from their established positions with little build up to this happening, it never really sets up something to happen, it just sort of happens.",1677711418,1677711418,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Played the original one back in PS2 days, but since i was just a child i never got to understand or appreciate it, fast forward to recent times i've finished mafia 2 years ago, was expecting to have the same experience, the reality is there's no reason for the open world because all of the gameplay are linear that doesn't even fun because somehow the enemies feels like having an armor despite it's happening in the old times, and somehow the game feels rushed and dragged at the same time. 

graphics are good and beautiful but probably my expectations let me down, oh and the racing is not that hard coming from a simracing casual.

Hangar 13's somehow captured the exact same feels and themes of 2002's Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven while improving upon everything that made the original Mafia a decent story-focused crime game. It's the same engaging crime story, told in an even better way than the original could, with an entirely new cast, rewritten dialogue, and some plot details changed slightly in ways that make the twists more believable and add more weight to the game's final act. All set in a gorgeous 1930s Chicago analogue that effectively immerses the player in the era of Prohibition and later on, the tense atmosphere of pre-WWII America. This is not a Yakuza Kiwami/Kiwami 2 situation where RGG Studio added more to the games in terms of side content while retelling the exact same stories almost 1-to-1. With Mafia DE, Hangar 13 went the route of rebuilding everything from the ground up, including the story, and I think they succeed just as much as Yakuza Kiwami 1 and 2 do, but with vastly different techniques.

For anyone who never got to play the original Mafia, I'm gonna say that you certainly missed out, zoomer, but getting this remake instead is gonna take you for the same emotional ride the moment you step into the shoes of cabbie-turned-mob muscle Tommy Angelo, but said ride's gonna be way smoother and more polished. It's not gonna give you any of the insanely difficult moments from the original that are more the result of early 2000s jank rather than actually smart AI and great mechanics. But if you do want these modern mechanics and QOL improvements with the same intense challenge provided by the original Mafia, then choose Classic Difficulty. But take note: if you choose Classic, with its tighter timers, Simulation driving, rubber-banding race and cop chase AI, and both Tommy and your vehicles being made of paper... Guess what: the racing mission that everyone's talking about in the reviews? Heh. Lotta folks with nostalgia goggles on might be criticizing this game's other aspects, but not many of them can say that the racing mission on Classic is in any way less of a headache than the original. You better pray to God that you got the stones to drive a 1930s racecar at 120mph without spinning out, cafone.

Mafia DE, to the horror of some folks I've seen before this game was released, is in the same engine as Mafia III. So expect a lot of the same shooting, movement, and driving from that game, just with 1930s weapons and vehicles. But fear not. Seems with this game, Hangar 13's finally got a handle of many of the issues that plagued Lincoln Clay's romp through New Bordeaux. I've never once had this game stutter on my system, never crashed throughout the story mode, and I've only ever had two or three instances of any visual glitches in Free Ride mode, and only in the most remote areas. These problems were far too commonplace in Mafia III, yet almost don't exist here at all. It's a significantly smoother experience.

And unlike Mafia III, this game still follows the original Mafia's story structure, where it's cut into chapters rather than the bloated district and hitlist system that Mafia III had. So it's a huge improvement to the third game gameplay-wise by way of cutting out the fat, while also taking cues from Mafia III in terms of voice and mocap performances to be an even bigger improvement over the first game in its storytelling. There's also chapter replays in case you missed any collectibles, want to try for higher difficulty, or just wanna experience a certain set piece again. That one's less a compliment to this game, more of a nitpick for others. I'm still surprised that not every modern game has this feature, man.

And then there's Free Ride mode. Upon learning that there was only one Free Ride mode in this game, I was concerned as to weather or not Hangar 13 would include some of the wacky elements that were in the original Mafia's Free Ride Extreme. Turns out, I had no cause for alarm. Instead of having two separate Free Ride modes, they just let you do everything in one. And that's great. You wanna just tour around Lost Heaven? See it for the first time, or if you're a series veteran, see how the devs remade the city? You can do that. You wanna unlock stupid, crazy cars and do missions that unlock new vehicles and weird costumes? You can do that, too. And there's a TON of secrets and artwork collectibles to find throughout both the city, and the vast northern countryside, with progress carrying over into and from the story mode. I'm glad that they brought this mode back and even added to it. I dunno if they'll have my favorite stoner van in this game yet, but hey, they did bring that back in some form in Mafia III, and there's other more tantalizing stuff to unlock now that I've finished the story.

There's one detail I miss from the original Mafia that didn't make it here: Lucas Bertone's optional missions. It was nice to get new cars from that guy by doing him favors, some of which had unique objectives like crashing a hot car into the ocean just beyond the lighthouse, or taking a guy bleeding out in your car to a doctor, after which you get to see Lucas cleaning out the blood from the car as a freebie. In the remake, he just gives you photographs to hunt down hidden vehicles, which was a nice way to get you exploring the world without an objective marker, but it's such a waste to see Lucas sidelined like this, especially since I like that he's recast as a younger, shiftier mechanic now.

I can easily recommend this game to anyone who's itching for a great mobster story packaged in a fun third-person open world game in a gorgeously rendered 1930s American city. Hell, I'm gonna be crucified by some fans of the series for saying this, but this retelling of the original Mafia is even better to me than the fan favorite Mafia II was. Yeah, I said it. Sue me. The performances were stellar. The world-building adds to the tension and weight of Tommy's actions, from newspaper clippings to radio news broadcasts. The atmosphere of the most memorable levels are made better by this game's gorgeous weather effects and a skybox that's SO much better than ugly one we got in Mafia III. Mafia Definitive Edition feels to me like a culmination of everything that Hangar 13 learned from previous entries in the series, improving upon what made 2K Czech's games great, and learning from their own missteps in Mafia III. If there's ever going to be a Mafia IV, it has to be from them. I don't see it being made well by any other studio.

I take back what I said about New Bordeaux in my Mafia III review. I'd love to go back to the bayou in Lincoln's Drifter at some point. But I'll definitely be spending more time in this beautiful recreation of Lost Heaven. I was hooked on just driving around this city when I played the original Mafia.

And I don't like how they slightly changed some characters' motivations. In the remake, you can easily tell who's bad and who's good. But, for example, Sam was not a piece of shit as they made him in a remake. He was loyal but not a coward.

Shooting mechanics are mid.

This remaster builds on this principle by maintaining and updating the graphical fidelity of the game while retaining most of the aspects of the story and above all else, the concepts and ideas of the original game’s missions. 

In turn, this remake also chooses to update the gameplay, adding multiple difficulty options that both provide the challenging experience from the original game, as well as a balanced and easier challenge more akin to the contemporary standards that players expect out of a game’s level of difficulty. 

This is a welcome addition as it is all of the different added upgrades to the visuals, Lost Haven is a beautifully recreated city based around Chicago, New York, and the San Francisco of the 1930’s, the city is brimming with detail, as I drove in the multiple missions of the game I could witness a strike outside of an auto shop, a sign departing my stay from the city as I neared the airport, and a fully functional set of bridges with even an area, in one mission -that remains optional-, where you take one of your companions to a brothel near the docks. 

There are also some pretty welcome additions, the game is fairly linear in its story using the open world more like a stage in which to present it, but there’s also the unlockable bonus mode “Free Ride” which serves as a sandbox open world mode allowing you to explore and play with complete liberty in the city. During the campaign and this additional mode, there are also period comics, from detective novels, to science fiction ones, they serve and contribute in creating the atmosphere of the time. On a later update after launch there was also an alternate visual mode added to Mafia; “The Noir Mode” as the name suggest, turns the picture into a black and white representation akin to classic gangster movies; thanks to the updated graphical fidelity in conjunction with this mode, this offers a unique way of playing through the campaign, truly enhancing in an alternate way both cutscenes and gameplay, capturing beautifully the atmosphere of the time and succeeding in the intentional, of making the game look -for the most part-, like a motion picture. 

If there are complaints for me, they arise with two aspects: one is the fact that when you shoot the enemies, they enter into a very exaggerated death animation that gives you the illusion you can keep damaging them, when in reality you can’t; if you try, your bullets will go right past them. My second complain also stems from the voice acting; you can get used to it (like I did) after a while, but at the beginning it was difficult for me to truly take the dialog seriously because of how exaggerated some of the accents were, especially the character of Paulie which is a fairly important character in the game.

[h1] Review [/h1]
Well, the game is actually good. The graphic is really nice and devs didn't forget about us, Czechs, so they didn't forget about czech dub. 

At the start game looks like a copy with better graphics and with some minority tweaks. As longer as you play, you start discovering that game has some really annoying mechanics. I've been playing entire game on classic difficulty and I have to say that for example driving was really annoying. It's not RTS, simulation... honestly, I have no idea what that crap is. I just know it's really annoying and despite my experience in many driving games with different driving models, after 12 hours I wasn't able to get used to it. I wasn't able to predict movement of the car in some situations, sometimes the road felt like it was pure ice. However, it was annoying but I can't really say I dislike it. I honestly don't know, it was just really weird but I can't say it was nightmare and it flushed my joy from the game.

However another annoying thing really stabbed my enjoyment. And that's death screen. Like you wait every time about 5-8 seconds till you can reset your game to last checkpoint? And as bonus, that loading isn't fast enough too. I have fast computer and don't have issues while gaming but I still had to wait around 15 sec after every death to continue playing. And on classic difficulty you die a lot (unless you really tryhard it). That's really big disadvantage of this game.

Regarding story, it's almost the same as in original game, only the end is a bit weird, like triple camouflage of everything, it's more boring honestly and annoying, nothing more, nothing less... 

About gameplay I can't say in general anything really wrong, I expected this game to be trash but it really surprised me and it was a good game. However some parts were really boring and honestly, when you make remake of something, you should at least try to make it better. Jokes are funny and good but the old ones were better I think... Also some tweaks in gameplay and story are more annoying than helpful. For example streets all look almost the same, in the original game you are able to memorize most of the city without any issues on first play, here I had no idea where I am without map. In the end, you can't really say this game is horrible, but it isn't great either. Can't imagine I would buy this game for full price, it's not worth it.

I would rate it 6,5/10, as it's good and you can have fun and enjoy it, but in comparison with original it lacks a lot of ideas and maybe the feeling of entire situation? If you didn't play original game, it might be better for you and you will enjoy it more I guess. But my opinion is that original game had better atmosphere, idea and they did really good job in their year. This is almost like Chinese copy-paste with some tweaks. It's good but could be definitely better.",1677250857,1677250857,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b] it is a new representation and not really a remake That's exactly what many empty heads don't understand 
similar to resident evil 3 (April 3, 2020). don't expect a 1:1 remake here! what really got on my nerves was this 2k launcher Well, you could look away from that, but it didn't stop there even after that I was annoyed with some long terms and conditions that couldn't be skipped away! WTF it felt like a challenge! as if you get an achievement unlocked for it as soon as you have mastered it, You will be harassed with a account request when you launch the game for the first time 
is my steam account and the 2k launcher not enough? why are the terms and conditions so long and why can you only scroll them down in slow motion omg !I bought the game on sale for 14 euros but when i could finally start to play and i couldn't get any feeling for driving the damn taxi i gave up one of the two who blackmailed me to flee with them has such an annoying voice that i would like to play without sound! so even for this cheap price, I don't do that to myself, I got it refunded and will buy something else nice for it. as a respect for the original version i still give it a thumbs up 
I'm not saying it's a bad game just because I didn't like it maybe I'm too old fashioned How many hidden backdoors I have to go through to finally start really annoyed me and the driving feeling is terrible and the engine used still has difficulties the performance is sluggish from time to time I have a short still image for 1 to 2 seconds you would need good hardware to be able to compensate for this a bit but I am sure that this would not completely eliminate the diseases. gaming these days has gotten complicated and a few reflections on the streets at night don't compensate for the problems. stupid gaming industry, get back to the roots NOW [/b]",1677230454,1677230454,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

A  game, with some flaws, and some aspects that could have been implemented better. Not the best game I've played, but by far not the worst.  7.5 / 10


Now to the review...
There are a few bugs that while immersion killing, not game breaking:
1. [spoiler] if you lose the cop cars at the beginning mission, they will spawn right behind you when you break a barrier to continue the mission...[/spoiler]
2.  2 cut-scenes that had no audio at all, and I had to replay the chapter cut-scene just to see what the mission details were...
3.  killing enemies may or may not have them stuck to what ever they were next to when they died.  Many an enemy died floating in air, or leaning next to a wall standing up.  R.I.P.
4.  I did have graphics freeze on me during cut-scenes.  At first I thought they were for dramatic effect, but then the characters spoke.  I needed to use Task Manager to close the game, but starting the game up again it did put me back in the cut-scene, without having to replay a mission (so +1 for the auto saves).

The game does not care that you have no idea who these characters are.  There is no back story, except through the eyes of your character in flashback form and only so many years back.  This is the Mafia.  You do Mafia things, and if you aren't loyal, you stop doing Mafia things.  The voice acting, while passable, is definitely forced, and you can tell that some of the voice actors tried really hard to portray a gangster, but couldn't figure out what direction they wanted to go.  But some sold it well.
Also, a given in this type of game:  the character that stutters and seems like he never passed 4th grade.

I played in Noir mode, which is black and white for the entire game (should be an achievement).  The reviews talking about the video quality, my opinion is the designers probably wanted to replicate what a colorized version of a movie in the 30s would look like.  That's why I played it in BW.  I wanted to put myself in what 2023 me would watch on something made 90 years ago.
I definitely agree that the racing mission is one of the hardest missions (but I finished it in a spectacular fashion, as the 1st place guy wrecked on the final turn, and the 3rd place guy in an attempt to pass me slammed into him, and I split them down the middle and won).  But playing in classic mode, where if you reload you lose ammo, 4 hits from others you are dead, while head-shots are guarantee kills on enemies, body shots could be 5-10, the game by that definition is very hard, but it is definitely the way to play.  You can find the medkits, but in this mode your health drops like crazy.  Sure I got frustrated, a lot, but it was pleasure-filled once I knew I completed the mission.

I did feel that some of the aspects of the game weren't thought about as needing to be a necessity to play the game. Like, what is the point of having a garage, when they give you a car to use every time you start a mission? Unless it goes fast, they all drive the same.  The armory, unless the game wants you to talk to him, there is no reason to go there.  And where the 4th grader works on cars, unless again you need to see him there isn't a reason.  Many things could have been more, but it wasn't implemented very well. (by the way, because there isn't a backstory, you don't really find the need to care about a lot of the characters, besides yourself, and as I'm writing this review, many names have been forgotten, but this isn't a bad thing.  It's the Mafia after all.  Forgettable characters, to be replaced by others).

The one thing that does suck is that the collectibles are scattered throughout the map, in places you will not have been to in the story line.  I know this because I didn't complete those achievements, and [spoiler] in the mission where you rob the bank and drive Pauly out of there, where you end up has a collectible.  You see it, but after the cut-scene you are thrown to another part of the map, and unless you made notes, you won't find where you were with him.[/spoiler]  You will probably not want to play the game a second time to try to get these, unless you have the time to roam and really want those achievements.
With that, there really isn't a reason to play this game after you finish it.  There would be nothing new, except maybe to try new cars, or do the ""lockpick"" quest. ( I just busted the windows out of cars if I wanted to steal them).  Its just called free mode (roam) at that point, but I would just play another game, instead of driving around in a city with nothing to do.

All in all, I wish I saw and played this game when it first came out, but it holds itself well, and with all the profanity and violence [spoiler] what about the one with the tire iron on the street huh?? [/spoiler] I didn't regret playing this game now and am very much so looking forward to playing Mafia 2.  Some of the monologues I forgot I was playing a game and thought I was watching a old nostalgic movie.

Story: 

you get to play as Tommy Angelo who's a typical cab driver on streets of Lost Heaven and finds his way through a mafia family, its a typical mafia story you get to see in movies but its a great one and its worth playing it. The settings is 1930 the whole vibe and environment to it is really great and feels good to be in it. The Cut scenes through out the story are great.

Gameplay:

in terms of gameplay this is not the game where you get skill tree and better upgrades as you progress through it's all about shooting which is closely tied in a same loop. However the engagements are pretty fun which makes the whole gunplay interesting and refreshing.

The missions has some variety like there are car chases, some stealth missions and sometimes you have to make your way out.

FreeRide Mode: 
it is unlocked after completing 1st mission, here you can play free ride missions which are 12 in total, you can do typical taxi missions, complete collections and explore the map of the game at your own pace.

Noire Mode: 
The game features a noire mode which is a old B/W filter its a nice touch and looks great as well.  

Graphics and Sound: 
The games phenomenal specially in night there are some visual glitches but nothing game breaking, i just love the way this game looks this is probably where it shines the most. 
The Voice acting is excellent as well, it feels like watching a mob movie.

Cons:

The game is purely dead in terms of open world factors, minimal to zero npc interaction, no interactive buildings, no side quests , no post campaign content and the worst is they have removed the radio music of OG MAFIA.


Final Thoughts:

the game is fairly short but enjoyable one, you can finish the game in about 10 hours, there are no side missions etc stuff there is separate mode for it if you wanna play those missions 12 in total. it looks great, has mission variety tightly focused on story. overall a fine game to look after.",1677172808,1677172869,True,3,0,0.487785279750823975,0,True,False,False

I don't do a lot of reviews, however, this game deserves a review.

The game doesn't have a very complicated system to conduct combat. I found it very easy to beat the hell out of someone in a fist fight. As for guns there are pretty much four guns; Pistols, Tommy Guns, Shotguns and a Rifle. This is consistent with the period. Aiming the guns and shooting them is also not complicated. Some reviewers have commented  the pistols don't seem to hit their target accurately. Pistol accuracy in real life is most effective from 3-5 feet. As distance becomes greater pistols can become wildly inaccurate. The game reflects this in a very real way. My only complaint is when I obviously hit a target (evident from the targets reaction) two to three times and they are still standing and evading as if they didn't just take two bullets to the chest! 

Although the combat system isn't complicated I did find it to be extremely satisfying. 

So many games try to tell a story with cut scenes. Many of them fail to make the cut scenes blend with the game resulting in them feeling like a sideline story and not part of the game. MAFIA does an excellent job with the story. I feel like I'm in a Mafia movie! The creators did a great job of depicting the brutality of gang violence. Cut scenes, game play and story line all blend together to create a wonderful experience.

The infamous race: No one likes it. Myself included. How did I win? Over and over and over...because I refused to give up.

I read a lot of reviews from players having serious performance issues. I'm eighteen hours into the game and haven't experienced a single issue. TBH, my computer is a bit of a Frankenstein. It was a high end business computer that was never intended to receive upgrades due to the tower design, including the Motherboard. After some special orders from China to modify the Motherboard to upgrade the power supply and cannibalized parts from old computers, I ended up with a computer that runs games way above rated specs. I do not know why! I included my specs for reference. No pics as it looks like a junk yard dog with a lobotomy. :-)

You're the anti Joe Pesci. You're Hoe Puussay. I guess there's some type of story that you become a made man. You have some love interest that the game maybe spends five minutes on.

Ремейк создан студией Hangar 13, разработавшей Mafia III, и издан американской компанией 2K. Как и в оригинале, действие игры происходит в вымышленном городе Лост-Хэвен, а главным героем является таксист Томми Анджело, ставший гангстером в одной из мафиозных группировок города.💸
                         МОЙ ОТЗЫВ:
——————————————————————
1.В original я не играл ,но definitive пропустить никак не мог!!!
2.купил за 20$ и даже не жалею потраченным деньгам.
3.Хочу подметить прекраснейший soundtrack, великолепную озвучку героев их проработку эмоций и других их чертей.
4.Замечательно проработан город ,красивейшая архитектура ,на которую смотрю на одном дыхании .Каждый квадратный метр заслуживает своего внимания !
5.Сюжет я проходил на одном дыхании ,очень продуманный сюжет ,где все оборачивается против главных героев !
6.Есть один минус ,что некоторые задание ,которые в оригинале ,вырезали из дефинити.Очень короткая сюжетка,любой человек не торопясь пройдёт ее за 9 часов ,увы это слишком мало для этой шикарной игры …
Обычный человек ,жизнь таксиста не обычно обернулась ему криминалом!)
Подведем выводы :Если вдруг у вас на Балике есть лишние 20 $,берите ее обязательно ,вы не пожалеете !!!А может в будущем она будет подешевле стоить ,то берите ее на все 100%.
Разработчиком этой игры мое почтение🫡

Eski bir oyun olduğu için beraberinde getirdiği bir sürü hata ve günümüz teknolojisine göre oldukça eski ve rahatsız edici mekanikler ve oynanış yüzünden epey zorluk yaşadım ve sinir atakları geçirdim fakat hikayesinin iyi oluşu, çıkış yılına göre gerçekçiliği yansıtabilmesi ve anlatmak istediği hikayenin ağırlığını iyi verebilmesi oldukça tatmin ediciydi. Gerçekten keyif alınarak oynanabilecek bir konsept, hikaye ve atmosfer sunabilmişti. Günümüze uyarlanırsa nasıl olabilir diye düşünüyordum ve bunun haberini aldığımda heyecanlanmıştım. Bir kaç saat oynadıktan sonra beceremediklerini görebildim. Eski oyuna nazaran bütün havasını mahvetmişler. Hikayenin ve oyunun hiç bir havası kalmamış. Ne ağırlığı ne ne de kasveti kalmış. Silah ve dövüş mekaniği berbat. Ateşlediğiniz silahın su tabancasından farkı yok. Düşmanların hasar almaya verdiği tepki inanılmaz kötü ve terminatör gibi yürüyebilmeleri gülünç. Ekstra ekledikleri sahneler ve diyaloglar bazı noktalarda çok sırıtıyor. Karakter modellemelerini pek beğenmedim. Grafikler orta-alt denilebilir.

The game does look good, and there are moments that I have enjoyed like the driving mechanic and the reflection quality, but a shooter needs to have good gun play. I found that I could not enjoy myself with a controller when outside of a vehicle so I would try and switch to keyboard when I could, this however did not work because neither really delivers when it comes to a firefight. Aim assist only works when it chooses to so I am constantly getting moved back to checkpoints that are further back than they should be, and to make things worse there is no first person mode to make knowing where you are shooting just a little bit more manageable. Overall there would be a decent game here if it were a crazy taxi remake, but until there are some serious changes to the core game play this is not a fluid game. 6/10

From the moment I started playing, I was drawn into the world of Lost Heaven, and the characters and story kept me hooked until the very end. The graphics are stunning, with a level of detail that brings the 1930s to life in a way that is both beautiful and immersive. The voice acting is top-notch, and the music sets the perfect tone for each scene.

One thing I particularly appreciated about the game was the attention to detail in the recreation of the era. The cars, clothing, and architecture all felt authentic, and it was clear that a lot of care was taken to make sure the player felt like they were really living in that time period.

The gameplay is smooth and satisfying, with a mix of action and puzzle-solving that keeps things interesting. The missions are well designed, with just the right level of challenge, and the controls are intuitive and responsive.

Overall, I would highly recommend Mafia: Definitive Edition to anyone who is a fan of the original game or who is looking for a well-crafted, immersive crime drama. It's a must-play for anyone who loves action-adventure games or who wants to experience a piece of gaming history. 5 stars!""",1676186540,1676186540,True,9,0,0.633114457130432129,0,True,False,False

And it ain't as simple as they tell you in grade school. But it is good to have strong values and to maintain them. In marriage, in crime, in war, always and everywhere. I messed up. So did Paulie and Sam. We wanted a better life, but in the end we were a lot worse off than most other people. You know, I think it's important to keep a balance in things. Yeah, balance, that's the right word. Because the guy who wants too much risks losing absolutely everything.

Game looks shiny and buttoned up. Lost heaven is a great depiction of a bustling 30s American city and every corner was put together with care and attention. I specially liked and remembered the mansion and country side settings as they looked spectacular. 
Another point of strength of the game is characters and decent voice acting although Pauli face and voice acting seemed a little out of place. Story is very intriguing and feels like watching a Scorsese movie.

But too bad presentation is not enough to make a game other wise this would be a great game.
Gameplay is where Mafia Definitive edition falls apart.

It plays like at least a 10 years old title. Gun play is clunky and unresponsive. Pulling trigger in this game has no feedback whatsoever. Tommy moves like a tank, slows down at every corner, I struggled to make it go and do what I wanted for most of the game.

It's a movie game (interactive film). The main story consists of chapters of an up-and-comer mafioso's life in a mafia family, throughout the 1930s. Post story there's the ""Free Ride"" mode featuring taxi fares, track races and a series of fun extra missions accessed through notes left around the safehouse by a mysterious figure.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
You're first introduced to driving, which is bad but you slowly get used to it until the race mission, which forces you to become a good driver through failing. What you won't be told is there's a fuel gauge that you should always keep track of when driving personal cars. Refilling is done manually by driving to gas stations and if you run out, your car becomes useless until you refill it. There's also two radio stations featuring newscasts and songs of that era. Combat is mostly shooting / peeking from cover, throwables and the infrequent shooting while driving. Cars are easily destroyed by bullets. While the map is surrounded by docks and features an airport, planes  and boats aren't accessible. There's no swimming, but neither is there a need for it. The game's design shows its age by lacking any form of fast travel.

[h1]Completion[/h1]
One achievement requires the story to be completed on the highest difficulty, ""classic"", and without ever changing it, which took me 14 hours at an average pace. There are varying collectables spread separately across both story and free ride and combined with the lack of fast travel it really drags out the collectathon to over 10 hours. It's fine to miss them during the story as to not break immersion. After finishing the story, chapters can be replayed on a lower difficulty and you're not required to recomplete them. Quitting right after picking up a collectable will save it. As for completion unrelated to Steam achievements, Carcyclopedia's car counter is bugged (52/53) because of an unobtainable car cut from the game, but still existing in the files. There's also the Chicago Pack DLC which doesn't come with the game but can be picked up from resellers for about 1 euro.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
It's an old classic, beautifully remade into an immersive experience. While lacking any in-depth systems, it masters it's theme, storytelling and visuals.",1672881915,1675209057,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Strictly for people who have played the original Mafia: I wouldn't recommend this.

(And I don't mean the removed side missions, although I did miss those too) Where Mafia was simple, bleak, and coherent, Mafia DE unnecessarily tries to make it MORE coherent, more easy to understand (it wasn't hard to understand before), which ends up making it feel like narrative handholding.

I had played a lot of Mafia 2 so had an idea on what to expect with the design/story of this one. 

It's great to have it remade. The story is great. The gameplay is very good. 
Lovely atmosphere- the game feels alive, which is what you want in a game like this. 

There are quite a few issues with this game in the technical department due to HANGER13.
The game freezes a lot. Some forums said to play in windowed mode which didn't really help at all. 
Although the game feels alive, the AI don't really react to the player. They're just living their life as if you don't really exist. 

Example: AI walk out in front of cars willy nilly. Cars pull out in front of the player all the time. Sometimes cars just stop moving while on the road, where they should be mobile. Same goes for the trams. 

I think the voice acting is an upscale of the original? I think? Anyway, some scenes-particularly early in the game- the audio is awful, I don't know what happened but it sounds hella decompressed and atrocious. 

Leafs can flow through the characters body. 

Objects don't render in correctly in some cases. 

This is all down to Hanger 13, really. I found similar issues in Mafia 3, too. At least in Mafia Definitive Edition, the cops will actually recognize when you break the law... unlike in Mafia 3 where the cops are literally just an image walking around the map with no commands at all. 

Overall, it's a really good game. I was going to play the original eventually, but, glad I got the chance to play the remake. Just... it has a fair few flaws but it can be overlooked. The freezing is annoying as hell. Especially when you're almost finished a mission and the game freezes.

Like some of the missions are just almost impossible compared to others. Shooting tends to stay bit similar but then there's these super hard driving missions that made me change difficulty from classic to just hard for some missions because it just wasn't fun anymore. Like the race you have to complete, I tried to complete that on classic for over 2 hours until I finally gave up, changed to hard and I got it on first try. then again classic is supposed to be super hard but it's a bit annoying that you have to be so good at driving in a game that is meant as an action game and not a racing game, even though the storyline is about the main character being a good driver.

The original game was released right after GTA 3, which, of course, elicited comparisons between both titles, which was a bit unfair, given the different scopes. GTA 3 was an open-world game (one of the first, and certainly the most popular at the time), while Mafia was more story-driven and completely linear. I played de OG at the time, and had fun with it, but I never though it was on the same level as GTA.

For starters, let's say that Mafia Definitive Edition is a good game, featuring beautiful graphics and a very nice rendition of a 1930's American big city. The atmosphere is very well done, and story is well told, although a bit bland by today's standards. The presentation is definitely good, but the game lacks more depth. Gameplay, for example, suffers from decision of making a linear game. It feels like there's wasted potential here, with a very big city, but not a lot to see or visit. There is a free roaming mode, but it definitely doesn't add sufficiently to content.

a once honest cab driver making his life in Empire Bay, but for it to be spun on its head one day when two members of one of the local crime families to hold him at gun point and make a daring escape in a high speed shoot out in the streets of Empire Bay.

it is as ""human"" as it gets to be a mobster the honor and respect one would expect to see as a member of a mob family. gunnin down rival families with tommy guns like a Hollywood movie, but at the same time have moments of genuine mob work.

Things to note.  It's semi open-world, meaning there are times you can explore but it's mostly narrative driven. Your character, Tommy Angelo, is an ex taxi car driver so plan on doing a lot of driving as part of the story.  It's the 1930's so don't plan on the cars handling like they do these days.

I enjoyed the scenery most in this game, along with the Mafia aesthetic. The characters and charm of the world are all fairly authentic to what you want to see in a game about a mobster in the 30's. Graphically beautiful and satisfying to play in. The cars are really nicely done.

The game consists of mostly driving and shooting with a few stealth segments. Nothing really amazing that makes any of those three things stand out, but it's all pretty polished and refined. I played on hard difficulty and I did die quite a bit, but never to bugs or glitches or anything like that.

The checkpoint system is nice. You won't have to deal with very many instances of having to redo entire segments because you failed. There are a couple exceptions you may feel differently about, but overall it's fine.

Story-wise, the game keeps pace with what its telling. Towards the end, things move a little quickly IMO. Kinda wish they'd fleshed out the end a bit more if anything.

From my experience i'm new to the Mafia franchise and had no idea if theses games were good or not until I played mafia definitive edition. It was interesting to see how the main character Tommy became part of the mafia family and his journey with Paulie and Sam which made me feel very emotional towards how things ended. The graphics in this game were amazing and was able to show emotions which they wasn't able to 20 years ago in the first mafia. The story and the character development of not just the main but side character was very interesting to see. The 1930's atmosphere the game created was very accurate coming from someone who was never born in that time. But overall message of the game about how ""money, jobs and best pals come and go...but family last forever"" was a very deep message to hear.

Of course the game is about the mafia and in the city of Lost Haven their are two major bosses that own the city Don Salieri and Don Morello. The two dons were childhood friends working under Don Peppone's rule but Morello wanted more power so he killed the Don and split the city into two different factions Salieri's Faction and his faction. In this game you work for Salieri and his family who are the underdog gang. Even though the city was ""split up evenly"" Morello pretty much has a full grasp around the city, paying off cops and politicians so he can do whatever he wants. This man literally beat up one of his most profitable fighters with a wrench in the middle of the street and the cops didn't even bat an eye. Morello is such a cool antagonist in this game and I like how he is the complete opposite of Salieri in the since that he is always getting angry and beating people to death with his strength while Salieri always stays composed having some sort of strategy. You (the player) play as Tommy Angelo a cab driver who is simply just driving around normal people until suddenly two of Salieri's men Sam and Paulie put a gun to your head and you aid them in escaping Morello's men. Don Salieri is very pleased with you for this and you join his family. The game only picks up from here and I highly suggest you play it everything from the antagonist to the story is super good, god damn this game slaps. The gameplay plays just like gta or saints row classic hide behind something shoot guys or drive after man escaping (like gta 5 with the stolen boat) this may sound lame but Mafia Definitive Edition actually makes this fun and does very unique things. For example in the 5th mission ""Fairplay"" you get to race in 1940s race cars and zoom at super sonic speeds (yes this mission is kinda terrible because its hard to win but it's still unique). Overall Mafia 8/10 very very very very good video game and an enjoyable experience. *SPOLIERS* Now my favorite mission in the game is Bon Appétit what a fire mission, eating with Don Salieri when the whole place suddenly gets shot down in blazing gunfire then after you kill all Morello's men you pull up on the man who snitches on you and smash his head like a watermelon starting a war between the Salieri family and the Morello family.

The story is great along with the characters. Paulie is an absolute savage. 

The audio and cut scenes break after alt-tabbing once which is so annoying its unreal. Bushes are also indestructible which is almost as frustrating as driving on grass. 
There is no way to place a waypoint on the map which is bad. The death screen is too long. 
After shooting Billy in the head he has no head wound? The cars break way to fast to bullets. In at least two missions the car would break to gunfire before I entered it. Kinda crazy. 


Rage Review: Am I playing a racing game? 

If I choose the hardest difficulty in a game about the mafia I expect bullets to do alot of damage and so on. Why on gods green earth is the hardest mission in the game a race?? I'm here to **** some guys up not spend an hour on a stupid race where the cars are literally faster than yours off the rip. 

Your car tires will lock with another car and only you will spin out. No one else will. Your car will also take flight off a tiny bump. Your car will spin out while accelerating on a corner. 
This is the most unfun thing I've done in a while. This taints the rest of the game for me. I'm not playing a racing simulator dude I dont like racing. 

Update: Just let off the gas on the corners. You barely have to brake at all during the whole race. Just be careful on the corners that's where you will mess up the most. Use the grass as well. It's definitely faster. 

There are also some annoying bugs in this game. Alt-tabbing at any point will break audio and cut-scenes. Validate your files every single time and it should fix.",1673346352,1673778457,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Pro's:
Graphics: The graphics are a real treat, the game was remade from the ground up with better lighting, physics, cars, sounds, etc. Although it's 100 percent different than the original you can still feel a sense of familiar , while driving throughout the new and improved Lost Heaven.

Sounds: The memorable track from the original Mafia makes it triumphant return with a new score this time around. I for one usually had the music off so i can't really quote on the music all too well.

Plot: The plot from the original is well in tact actually. You can almost play both games at the exact same time and both would play out almost the same minus different cut-scenes at certain points.

Free Ride mode: In Free Ride mode, Tommy starts at Salieri's Bar with access to his garage, wardrobe, and armory. There are options to change the time of day and weather. Free Ride mode unlocks after completing An Offer You Can't Refuse. 

There are 12 phone booth missions in Free Ride. They are activated by reading the notes in Salieri's Bar. After completing the first mission, additional ones will become available as you progress through the game. Missions are given by Herbert Baskerville, and completing each one awards a vehicle, weapon, or outfit. These end game contents are pretty much fun and challenging at the same time.

Cons: Length: The plot itself is around 10/12 hours maybe. Right when you get nice and comfortable with the game and you really start to enjoy yourself the damn credits roll. Also it's a linear story so it's chapter after chapter. This isn't a GTA game where you go to mission to mission in your own leisure. 

This game still gets a 10 out of 10, the pacing itself was good i just wish it was at least another 10 hours longer.",1673589476,1673681657,True,15,0,0.67047494649887085,0,True,False,False

I had this game on my wishlist for a while and decided to purchase while it was on sale. I gave it about 4 hours, and I unfortunately have to say I was unimpressed and could not finish the game.

I will start by saying that the storytelling, music, and voice acting really give you an immersive 1930s experience. My problem, however, is there was nothing else keeping me engaged (you meet the boss, do the jobs he gives you, you watch the plot thicken, and repeat). There's nothing urging me to explore, there are no choices I can make besides finding random dialog to listen to, and there is no growth or reward for playing the game - it's just a story. I feel like I could watch someone else play and not miss out on anything, and tbh I probably will just to know how the story ends, but overall this was boring to play for me.

Yet, my primary concern with this remake is that it is simply not well-optimized. The highs and lows with regard to FPS are all over the place, and often, downright awful. I have a damn good build, I'm VERY WELL OVER the suggested specs, and I still can find myself in single-digit frames. OOF.

Then there's the racing segment. About 2 hours into this narrative experience, you're forced to deal with an INCREDIBLY frustrating and hamfisted racing segment. I could complain about this for hours, but I respect the developers for staying true to the original game's level of difficulty here. Regardless, this segment still sucks. BAD.

Definitely felt like the grandpa days only grandpa days right before grandpa shipped off to kill hitler. Wish I had played this back in 2002 when it came out. GTA style game but don't expect GTA playthrough length or depth & breadth of mechanics.

Story-wise I wish the game got more time to do missions and explore more of the world, maybe build up more relations with the different characters and show the change in fortune and influence the mafia had in the city. Events span 8 years and it doesn't seem like much changes around the house or neighborhood or city. Overall though really good moments and feels.

This is a fairly short game, and I definitely cannot recommend it to everyone. So first I will list negatives. The gameplay, while not unfinished, is bland. It is a very typical cover shooter with only about 4 guns to choose from at any given time. Headshots instantly kill enemies, so action consists of moving to cover, shooting 3 or 4 guys in the head, and then moving and repeating. Melee fighting is fine, but also very boring. Driving is pretty good, very little bugs, but not on the level of GTA V. Also, most of the driving is just going from one place to another with no shooting or chases. When the facial animations screw up it is hilariously bad. Replayability is low, unless you are an achievement collector.

Now to the good stuff. This game is close to a Picasso painting or a Mozart concert in that it is put together as an art piece. From the beginning the way that the story is told hooks you with the animation quality on the prerendered cutscenes being some of the best I've ever seen. Everyone's face perfectly matches their emotion and changes with the conversation in a subtle but noticeable way. These cutscenes do not drop in quality throughout the whole game. The voice acting is generally amazing, you can really tell the level of communication between the actors and animators was spot on. 

The characters are incredibly well-developed, and you really get to learn about each of them. They were stereotypical for 'Italian mobsters' but also had a personal flare that made them interesting. The dialogue is really well written throughout the entire game, to the point where even the side conversations between NPCs that don't even have names is worth listening to.

Music and sound design in this game are perfect. The radio quality sounds as though it were from the 1930's, and the level of detail is such that the radio fades when you go to low service areas. Speaking of detail, they even included the Wilhelm scream in one of the opening cutscenes. The radio music is all big band, jazz and blues which really adds to the immersion factor of the game. I would sometimes just stop the game to sit in the car, look at the city and listen to the music, which is in my opinion the sign of a good open world.

The way they also tell another real historical story in the background of the main story is also fascinating. Just by using radio broadcasts and a few lines in the main story they are able to summarize the Great Depression, its instigating factors, and the way that it influenced the American political system and allowed organized crime to flourish. They used enough real world stories to add immersion to the main storyline and give history fans more to explore in the open world.

All in all, my enjoyment level reminded me a lot of Red Dead Redemption 2 in its main story. If you play video games for the story, or are just a history fan in general, you won't be disappointed.",1673243442,1673243442,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

+OG Mafia
+Very nice graphics
+Very nice town
+Decent playtime (~10h classic difficulty)
+All key factors in story are in place

-Police is ultra dumb
-I dont like how they redesign Pauli, I remeber him as a cold blooded thug, here he is.. I dont know... he has more emotions, he is more crazy, overall I dont like that change
-Few glitches here and there, mostly connected with police apperence 
-AI is ultra dumb - suicide tactics are just retarded
-Long loading screens - I dont know, maybe it is because i played on linux and proton, but loading screens take like 30 secunds, and on high difficulty where you die a lot it is annoying
-K2 Launcher It is minus outside the game - I dont know why developers adds to game that stupid launcher, it is just retarded, we have steam which is launcher by it self, we dont need yet another crap, also this launcher dont work on linux so you need to bypass it by addional parameters to launch this game...

Mafia: DE is really interesting, it brings back the original and enjoyable parts from the 18 year old Mafia 1 and adds more depth to the story, voice acting, gameplay and of course graphics. The game looks stunning (and thus requires you to have a decent PC to get good frames). I'm Running the game on 2k resolution with around stable 90fps using a good pc build, RTX3060. The animations in certain combat scenarios had it's fair share of criticism but I do not think it is that bad. The soundtrack is awesome and is composed by Jesse Harlin, who also composed the OST's for Mafia 3 (Which was one of the rare great things in that game). The story is, well, *almost* the same with Mafia 1 but I should say that there are more lore pieces and backstories and most importantly depth. The acting, mo-cap included, is insanely good. Voice acting is outta this world. The gun play is a bit too close to Mafia 3's (because of the same engine), however both the fighting and driving shapeshifts if you play the game on classic mode (Which I say you should give it a go altho' it may be hard). Driving is really unique (and has it's own challenges) as you will be driving Late 20's to Late 30's cars which come with no ABS, no Stability Control and no Traction Control (They also use bike wheels so good luck lol). The challenge is fun. There are some really good community made mods that you can download to further enhance your gameplay both in the story mode and in Freeride*

*Let's talk a little about Freeride

Freeride allows you to roam around the world that Hangar 13 team re-created, it is simple but beautiful. The main game, although has an open-world, mostly gets you places in linear story-style. Think of GTA but instead of going to the missions you have cutscenes and you get right into the story and next chapter. This is fine but if you want to travel the world, the game allows you that in a seperate from story-mode ""Freeride"". This is also an old mode in Mafia 1 that made a return. For some the freeride is totally useless and has no meaning but I disagree, especially with the mods that further enhance the mode itself (also there are minigames-challenges in vanilla freeride that can unlock secret cars, again a throwback to the original game's ""freeride extreme"" mode).

So, this game really deserves the title ""Definitive Edition"" as it sticks to the original feeling of the Mafia series, and tributes the original game, plus adds a lot on it. Graphics are great and the game feels smooth.

the game follows thomas angelo through his carreer in the mafia in the 1930s. it consists of several chapters set at different times that depict singular events. major parts of the game are driving and shooting, with some sneaking and other minor activies mixed in.

general things which apply to the original as well (which is a 9.5/10 imo):
+ great characters
+ great story
+ great narrative arch
+ perfect mix of story and action sequences
+ dope vibe, great music and city background

~ there's little to do outside the missions, which i like because it means there's no grind involved and you can focus on the story. while the city is detailed and varied, it's not an open world, i.e. you can't talk with npcs and take stuff from their houses etc. there are some collectibles if you're into that

It came at a time around the launch of GTA VC while technically superior in every way with a great cast and writing. I was hesitant to try the Remake, but today I got it on a sale to give it a try and I was shocked at some of the changes they made. 

The original came out a long time ago so I can understand the changes to the character's faces, even though personally I don't like them at all. Original had some distinction between the faces of the major characters like Sam and Paulie, while in this game they look almost the same to me. The voice acting is another area which new remake let me down. The original was A tier, this is B tier at best with a different direction and tone to the characters which I do not like. The writing is even changed to the point the remake makes the characters come off very different and changes to the point it does not feel like the original game anymore. 

Finally the game itself is simplified and dumed down. Cars have arcade physics which makes them feel like they have no heft to them like they did, there is almost no repercussion to speeding and the animations are also simplified and copied from Mafia 3 (which were terrible btw). Car chases were thrilling in the original because you have to use your skills to evade the chasers, pick roads which would allow you to speed up because the cars were slower back then. Over here,  you simply drive through a marker and a small cutscene maps and the chaser crashes into a roadblock. 

Granted this is a remake, however the a good remake should honor the original vision of the game and improve on the aspects which needs updating like visuals and quality of life. However, this game touched way too many things which did not need changing at all. Original is a fantastic game still, with some assists with mods, it is a much better option than this game.

While it may be more hand holding and long. uneventful driving sequences it still contains a really enjoyable crime game set in the golden years of American gangsters.

PRO
- The story is great of the criminal life of Tommy Angelo. You meet some great characters and really feel for them as things just get deeper and deeper in the life.
- Gun play and action sequences all feel really fun.
- There's very little filler (aside from driving) so each mission has a purpose and you're thrown right in.
- The ending is made better that connects it to Mafia II.
- The game itself looks amazing and the cutscenes look really, really nice.
- Soundtrack has that 1930s feel which works perfectly.
- It feels very cinematic.

NEUTRAL
- If you don't want to drive around all the time you can skip the uneventful driving sequences. This will however cut your game time down by about 30-40%.
- There's nothing else to really do besides the main game, free roam is just driving round the city and collecting cars. For me that's pretty useless so the main game is all there is.

CON
- It is unclear sometimes of what you actually need to do. E.g. I had to stop a guy from escaping to his hideout but I couldn't shoot his car otherwise it would explode but no matter how many times I rammed him he always escaped.
- I got a ""You died"" game over screen after a cut scene where I had already finished the mission so there's some odd bugs.
- The infamous race segment is still terrible and it doesn't help that your car can get bounced around with light taps on other objects.

If you're a fan of crime based games or just a good story then this is definately one to play. I wouldn't say it's worth the money at full price as you'll have done it in 10 hours or less but grabbing it on a sale (which it is quite often) is your best bet.

The game looks wonderful, to be sure.  I had no crashes during my play through and it ran relatively well.  

This is no GTA.  It is similar in many ways, but does not afford the same open world ""do-what-you-want-when-you-want"" style of gameplay, and that is not necessarily a bad thing, I'm just pointing it out.

Instead, it is a linear, story driven title that has a good story, good voice acting and decent visuals.

The problem is that the game feels empty.  It is also very short.  I enjoyed my time playing through the game but its not wow.  Just okay.

If you like third person, story driven adventure shooters, this is a good one.  Its worth it for $15 or less.",1672825992,1672825992,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros : 
•	starting from the story I really like that, depicting the 80s era mafia with a very thick culture and a very striking vintage atmosphere
•	the world is very beautiful, really describes life in the combined era of chicago and new york in the 1900s.
•	tommy angelo the main character really describes people who lived in that era, he was very brave and had his own ideals. he is also loyal to friends and superiors which depicts a very strong against the mafia family
•	the graphics in this world are also very beautiful, neon lights in every capital city, vintage vehicles that pass by, rainfall and twilight are very beautiful, between morning and night which are very beautiful and the reflections of water on the beautiful streets make me feel at home around the city use a car
•	vehicles of that era are also described accurately in this game, where the weight and torque are very different in this era. which is very impressive for depicting cars in the vintage mafia era
•	the voice filling is very good and detailed, the storytelling and talking from one character to another is very pleasant to listen to and easy to understand
•	The cinematic of every scene in this game is also very good and feels like a mafia movie
•	the ending is satisfying enough to close Tommy's story as a retired mafia

cons : 
•	Of the many good remakes of this game, the shooting battles are actually really bad. the shots in this game are very clunky like games in 2010 and down not like modern games. then the melee fighting mechanism is also very clunky, there is no satisfying feeling to hit, the stealth killing animation is also very boring and not varied
•	This open world game should provide a lot of side activities, not just the main mission, I'm surprised I only do the main mission and there are no side missions or other activities as a break to take time after the main mission
•	healing and health bars on characters and vehicles are also very low, I don't understand why a very low health bar is given, especially for characters where healing is in random places
conclusion : this game is very good and beautiful, there are lots of good spots and stories that describe the mafia of that era. the vehicles and atmosphere are very thick with the 80s era, unfortunately there are some deficiencies that are quite contrasting in the gameplay mechanics such as fighting and shooting.
The score : 8/10

This game is a massive downgrade over Mafia 3 in anything other than graphics, the gameplay is simply atrocious, the driving mechanics are horrendous, it feels like driving on ice all the time, the shooting sucks, it's frustratingly slow and inaccurate, it feels even worse than the original game from 2002 (this is not an exaggeration, try the OG for yourself) whereas it was one of the best parts of Mafia 3.

The sound design seem to have generally improved from Mafia 3 albeit still pretty lackluster (guns lack punch, cars seem 'whiny') the soundtrack is good but 30s to 50s music pales in comparison to 60s and 70s music in Mafia 3.

And then there's the storyline, I used to be on the ""Mafia 3 sucks"" bandwagon mainly because I never played it (like most of those people I'm sure), but after actually playing the game I genuinely think that Mafia 3 has a better storyline and characters than Mafia 1 and 2, the story here is still good mind you but it's just not as good as I remembered it being.

Overall I think this game is ok, if it wasn't for nostalgia and ""OMG LOOK AT THE GRAPHICS!!!!"" this game would be much lower rated than it is, wish there was a middle ground between thumbs up and down.

Yes, this is a remake from the ground up. Not a ""re-imagining"" or a ""remaster"", as those things have developed overlapping (and outright wrong) definitions over time. 

The script is nearly identical to to original, and everything looks amazing. So, if you enjoyed the story & suspense of that game, and you're willing to experience it again with improved graphics and handling tweaks, you'll like this game.

However; if you're new to Mafia, and looking for an open world game like GTA set in the 1930's, you might be disappointed.  Yes, there is a beautiful open world brought to life in the creation of Lost Heaven, but there really is no need to explore. In fact, I believe you can choose to skip any non mission essential driving portions of the game altogether. This is kind of a shame, because the map is beautiful, and it looks as though a lot of work went into the overall design.

The real strength of this game is it's narrative and presentation. It's like a mobster movie that you play out and interact with a little. Much like a movie, there's no alternate endings or events. Decisions do not have an effect on the outcome, there aren't any side quests or activities, or any RPG elements like upgrading or leveling up. Some might see this as ""bare bones"" relative to other games but, for me, it's a breath of fresh air.

Mafia II was amazing, and Mafia III had a great story, but the first Mafia was always my favourite release. Set right in the middle of Prohibition and the rise of the Italian Mafia, everything about the game appealed to me as a huge history buff; I can recall spending hours driving around Lost Heaven taking in the sights, and beating the spectacular campaign over and over again. I had long hoped that one day this gem of a game would get a remaster, and when I heard the news of Hangar 13 remaking it, I was elated.

Hangar 13 really outdid themselves here, as this remake truly is accurate in replicating the original in almost every way. Not only did they keep everything that made the original a unique, unforgettable experience, they brought the city of New Heaven to life in ways one could only dream of back in 2001. The map is filled with historically accurate details that were lacking in the original due to hardware limitations, and while driving through the city, you'll see busy streets brimming with beautiful classic cars and trucks, and sidewalks full of people and vendors going about their daily life. The graphics have also been completely overhauled utilizing the Mafia 3 engine, improving every visual aspect of the original game above and beyond what was capable in the original. Dynamic lighting with accurate reflections, shadows, and god rays, high-quality textures, better anti-aliasing; everything comes together to create a truly believable, living, breathing city of the 1930's.

Despite the all-around improvements in every area of the game, I would be lying if I said this game was completely faithful to the first game. Not quite a 1:1 recreation, subtle changes have been made in many areas, which really isn't a big deal overall, but someone who has played both titles would absolutely notice. 
-The original voice actors are gone, which was quite a disappointment to myself and many others on the first playthrough. The original voice actors are simply iconic to me, and while the new ones are great, I can't help but miss the old ones.
-Quite a few cars are missing from the lineup, limiting the variety of vehicles that can be found on the street at any given point in the storyline or in Free Ride. Not a huge deal, but as someone who truly loves classic cars, I do wish they included every vehicle available.
-Some missions are slightly altered. In most cases this was done to improve the flow of the story, but some alterations I would prefer to be left out.
There are more changes, but I feel that these are the biggest ones to me that I find to break from the first game in any big way.

All in all, this is a great way to experience the beauty and tragedy of Thomas Angelo's story, and that of the city of Lost Heaven. I would definitely recommend playing the original first, but this is a great way to get that same experience in a modernized fashion.",1672552303,1672552303,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

my biggest peeve is still the soundtrack and sound design generally. in games like these where the main goal is the narrative and storytelling i think soundtrack goes a long way, especially in mafia themes but i felt like the whole playthrough the same generic ass thriller enstrumental kept playing non stop. also guns sound like peashooters and are extremely silent. maybe i just had big expectations, since i loved mafia 2 and heard great things about the game.",1672174718,1672174928,False,0,0,0.47413790225982666,0,True,False,False

It is perhaps just a shame there is little reason to go exploring the city and surrounding areas as the amount of detail put into this seems like a wasted effort.

Graphics are great. The voice acting is great. The dialogue and story is well written for a video game. If this were a film I'd say it was a bit cliché and just a melting pot of other gangster films, but compared to other games I'd say it's strong. (The fact that I even make the comparison to film says a lo about the quality of the writing compared to most games). The game does a great job of making me care for the characters.
When it comes to the missions I don't have much to complain about except the racing mission that is almost as annoying as in the original. They have the same structure as the original and the GTA series, with which I mean that you spend a lot of time in cars driving to and from missions listening to the characters discuss things. It adds a lot to the immersion and fleshes out the characters while also giving the player plenty of opportunity to admire the atmospere and city.

To even play the game you have to run it in the third-party 2K launcher, that even if you set to skip in the game settings will still boot up. Already a bad sign when you are forced to install bloatware onto your computer and be asked to agree to some stupid EULA.
The game is ugly even on the highest quality settings, the V-sync option locks your framerate to 60fps regardless of what refresh rate your monitor has. Everything looks pixelated and blurred at short distances. I expected an experience similiar to what Steam's screenshots represented.
Mouse and Keyboard controls are scuffed. Walking is always a jog where friendly NPCs walk, driving feels overly sensitive, which [b]proved my suspicions that this is a lazily made console port instead of a quality product.[/b]

But the icing on the cake was the ""Fair Play"" mission - a graphically buggy mess. The game gets stuck on loading the race, so you have to manually shut down the game process and run the game again in order to play it. If you want to reload a checkpoint there you'll be stuck on this same loading bug again. Parts of the race track don't render properly, making 3/4th of the whole race an ugly, unsatisfying crapshoot. Then after finishing the race the game soft-locked. [b]I'm getting a refund. Don't buy this heap of trash.[/b]",1671990613,1671990613,False,1,0,0.442211061716079712,0,True,False,False

Mafia is no remake, it is a reboot - rewriting the main characters to be more fun while at the same time making the player character more interested in revenge. It is the single worst remake ever due to the high hopes and standards being chased. Racing got 100 times worse due to the broken steering. Gunplay is slowmotion camera aim when pressing the aim button which again signalises the console players have no integrity given by the devs to think freely. No good controls, No aim with weapons due to lack of free aim but super slow aim when pressing the aim button and with keyboard many cutscenes with a running or driving animation block player inputs till unpressed at a random time like the first chase on foot and first drive from the boss' bar.

This game is pure trash when the budget was THIS high, worse than THE SABOTEUR by EA in 2010 and Original Mafia 1 and 2 are better. It is a shame and only HL Alyx made me this angry to see cheap scripts be used to do easier things like the racing being rigged by pre-defined car handling and paths.
Do not get blinded by the graphics. Most people below the age of 26 do not even know how much better basic games can be. So much can break when people try to cheese gameplay to work like alert states in many games since Ubisofts Ghost Recon Future Soldier which invented map-wide alerts. What I want to say is the graphics are great but the game is so poorly made I would even go as far as to say Mafia 3 is equally as bad. If they would have kept the game unshortend, reexplained in areas where story was thin which they do at least twice till the race event and proper gun and car mechanics based on Mafia 2 this game would be a game of the decade but in the end it shares the ""It is like a Unity 3D game like The Thief Simulator""- title while not beeing Unity but it's own custom engine from the Mafia 2 days.

Do not get blinded by graphics and get some old games on an emulator ""legally"" when the PC version is hard to get run (Mafia 1 runs flawlessly. Try [B]Mafia Community Modpack 17-2-1[/B] which adds view range, better gameplay, cut content and real companies. Only 3 bad missions vs Mafia DE which has 50% bad mechanics.
Old is gold. But most oldies are only available as physical games sadly. I look at you DOS C-RPGs.

[U]Main Review[/U]
I want to love this but it is the SINGLE MOST BROKEN NON PC GAME EVER. Cyberpunk 77 is a PC game as a comparison. Broken Cutscenes showing T posing characters while the movie is not working when you tabbed out on the mission completion screen. THIS will never make the original devs proud nor any proper PC gamer from the early days who is not just consuming games but living it with passion. If I can not rewind to rewatch the cutscenes the game is DONE. I AM ALREADY DONE WITH THIS GAME. It is still way worse than the original.

[u]Gripes:[/u]
-Restrictive movement like no running in specified areas. This means the developer do not trust the player and takes away [b]integrity[/b]!

-First mission grants the player no [b]Integrity[/b] by using cut-scenes to destroy cars.

-[b]worst[/b] controller implementation period. After 2016 something started to happen. Unity game are trash on average excluding 2D games where control schemes are badly implemented and aiming bad. Unreal Engine has more chances to shine. This game is the 3rd type, custom engine and or unique game series which fans value. Here the driving is unique. Control scheme on controller strange. [b]Steam Deck[/b] NOT supported due to missing button prompts AGAIN as many native Steam Input games. And last AIMING IS SLOW [b]HOW IS AIMING SLOW[/b]. This is literally why console gaming has no value. ALL PS1 and PS2 games are good. Many offer custom control scheme settings. Spongy input is far from bad compared to many modern games. Mafia DE offers the worst slow aiming I have ever seen. Then Thief Sim is god awful and lastly I tried RE5 on Switch where they changed controls from just switching A and B / X and Y.

-Controls on PC keyboard are seriously bad.

-Molotovs do not have a proper animation so that I can throw these from any stance.

-Characters do not have a realistic animation system. Everything is stitched together like jumping over obstetrical. 

-Misinterpreted / misrecreated missions: It already starts with a less anti-violence Tommy and continues with the 3rd mission trying to get money from the Motel where the combat encounters got cut down, AI moves wrongly, building is wrong and the driving after the money, pursuit is silly with no aimable vehicle combat.

-One last gripe: The game changed the combat / health system from something akin to Max Payne minus easy health recovery to regenerative. Cover-Based shooting got added but not sure yet how far this impacts the original vs DE and lastly the feel of traversing the world including fighting seems to light hearted as if it tries to cheaply copy ORIGINAL MODE -> no health recovery without First Aid pickups.

[b]Do not buy this game if you play on controller. Controllers are great especially with pedals. Steam Deck controller prompts are broken with no icons. This game has no setting to disable the integrity denying slow aim when having a gun in your hand and also while aiming. SLOWEST AIM EVER[/b]

Good bargain bin game, 3rd Class-ing consoles and controller players with no choice to get direct aim with no low sensitivity ADS. It is no PC game nor console game viewed from a PS1-3 perspective. Mafia 2 original which is also better than M2DE is far more well crafted than the M1DE.",1669034212,1671963898,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I played the original as a kid but this new graphics ""Oh my!"" it's truly captivating and helps the story shine even more. Although I find the voice acting a little weak or not fitting for some of the characters like Sam. Don't get me wrong, Sam's part of the story was still great, just his voice - maybe it's simply because his voice sounds high-pitched or many times sarcastic. Also, the controls aren't the best - driving can sometimes feel clunky. The gun-play cover and shoot physics can be annoying sometimes as well. Although a few flaws about the game, yet I'd say this is a very good game, with a really nice story, and graphics. If you enjoy TV shows or movies about the Mafia such as ""The Godfather or Sopranos"", then you'll love this game.

Music is way worse than in original Mafia, sounds like it was drafts given them from L.A. Noire developers, because in this setting it is great but for italian gangster story music is no good .Animations from mafia III are not looking natural on a yesterday cabbie and it shows how much attention to this game was made. 
[h1] As a Mafia remake it's mediocre at best. [/h1] Tom is a different person, it's way harder to sympathize with him. In original game he made decisions based on his moral compass and he had empathy to other people,[b] he was a real person [/b] that changes through the story. It can be seen in this game too, but not this much. He wasn't a good person in the original, but he made you think and reflect and in the remake... he is just meh.
And ending just made it worse. In the first game he had a really intresting thought that is relevant to this story, in the remake he is ***** Dominic Toretto talking about family. Yea, his relationship with Sarah was getting more attention and that's good, but other parts of this story was getting really simplified.
So, this is a good game if you want to introduce yourself to this franchise or you did not played the original game and remake can make you play 2002 Mafia, because this game is better than 2nd or 3rd Mafia(Thanks to the great original story). But if you are a fan of the first Mafia there's a good chance you will be really dissapointed like me. Don't get me wrong, Hangar 13 were trying but i don't think they understood what the original game was about.

Compelling story, good gameplay, beautiful graphics for that time and so on. The remake does the original game justice by capturing most of what made the original game. But not all. The new visuals of the characters are good, but they are a bit to far from the originals. The don is not really a nice looking older guys anymore, but more the typical mafia boss. Same for Sam and Pauli (who'm I had trouble recognizing from one another for the first few scenes). So for someone who played the original a lot and has a good memory of how they looked, it's a bit annoying they didn't keep the characters closer to the originals.

Story and missions wise, those are still the same (mostly, apart from some small differences from the original) and are still fun to play and interesting to play. Gunplay is good, driving is a bit easier than in the original and so on. They modernized the game further by having very good cover mechanics that really work well and are fun to play with (all though it makes things a bit to easy i think).

There are however some things that were cut. The drives home after a mission, the fact that you had to learn to boost certain cars and in doing so you could make your car collection bigger. I mean, you can still do that, but the little side missions are not present anymore. The fact you could drive around in the city much more is gone now (don't stray to far during a mission or you fail after 10 seconds). The chat with Ralphy is mostly gone.  And with that the incentive to drive around town, find a better car for the garage, so you have a good car to drive during your future missions. Is that bad... not really, but I did enjoy those things in the original. It made the map feel more alive, it made it so you saw more of the city itself and it made it feel like you had a life in between the missions.

So all in all it's a fun and good game to play. I really enjoyed it, even with the shorter missions (over in 12 hour) since you don't have to drive home anymore.",1671202882,1671202882,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The game is narative drived, which is you are strictly follow the main objective without wandering around so there's not much of freedom.

It's very not balanced in gameplay, for example in mission car chase if I unintentionally off course like hitting of stree lamp or building there's a time limit to chase the 'objective' or the mission will fail, and thats the problem even though I try to chase the 'objective' it will always fail.

The Good
Story is amazing
Good characters
You can turn off the 2k launcher ingame and can start the game from the exe in the folder and it still keeps your save.
Graphics are really good
Rain effects were really good and there’s variation to the rain where one is heavy and misty-like
Rain is lit through neon lights and lights in general
Water pools and blood on the ground reflect the actual overworld
Easy game
Good music
The radio becomes worse when driving into tunnels which was realistic
Can freely drive and collect collectables that you’ve missed in the world in the freeworld menu option.
The facial animations and face models are really good.
You can take your time and explore in the levels that you are in even though the scene sounds very dangerous.
The city was too detailed and it was hard for me to look at everything
Driving over brick roads make your tires bump
When getting out of the car, you can still hear it rattle before completely turning off like a real car.
Cover art for the comic books were really really good. And you can zoom in really close too.


The Bad
I had to update to windows 10 to play the game

Once in a while when you kill someone their body won’t completely fall to the ground so they’re half up but dead and you can’t move them.

Game ran kinda bad at one part of the game, probably near mid to late game.

Can only use one save

There was one line when the Don talked on the bench, where his voice over sounded low quality like it was a line from the old game but they couldn’t find a higher quality sample or have the original guy redo the line.


Conclusion
I know that there is a second and third game in this series but I highly doubt it would be anywhere as good as this. Knowing that this was a ps2 game, I’m betting that the writers and people who worked on the old game are long gone. Though there is always a possibility of those games being actually good. Personally, I would prefer to play another crime noir game that’s set in a 1930’s world that looks like this. If there ever is a mafia 4, I’d be interested.",1670903615,1670925151,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game uses an RNG mechanic for determine accuracy instead of using a spread. So it forces you to wait 1-2 seconds after you aim to increase your accuracy, If it's a miss, the bullet completely disappears even if you clearly see it hit the enemy.  If XCOM is a action shooter, it would be this. The movement and ducking mechanic is your typical cover system but it's extremely clunky  and often times doesn't what you expect it to. Instead of having a button that make you exit cover, you have to move away from the cover far enough for it to happen.

Side missions in my opinion are out of place.

The game continues the storyline of the original and takes the player to the city of Lost Heaven, a fictional town in 1930s America.

In Mafia: Definitive Edition, the player takes on the role of the protagonist Tommy Angelo, a humble taxi driver who accidentally gets involved in the Mafia's criminal activities. The action of the game is characterized by a gripping storyline that draws the player in from the start.

Mafia: Definitive Edition gameplay is extremely realistic and detailed. The city of Lost Heaven has been recreated with great attention to detail and offers the player an authentic atmosphere reminiscent of the films of the 1930s. The characters are well thought out and have depth and personality. The game's driving physics are also impressive and feel realistic.

A special highlight of Mafia: Definitive Edition are the action-packed and exciting missions that involve the player in various criminal activities. Whether it's transporting money or taking out opposing gangsters, there's always something to do and the missions are varied and challenging.

All in all, Mafia: Definitive Edition is a successful remake of the classic mafia game, which takes up the strengths of the original and has optimized it for the current consoles and PCs. The realistic city of Lost Heaven, the gripping storyline and the action-packed missions make the game a must for fans of the genre as well as for those looking for a realistic and exciting action-adventure.",1670546633,1670616899,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False

Mafia: Definitive Editon is a mob story delivered into the player's hands. Find yourself immersed in the 1930s prohibition era where the two station radio plays while you make your drive from point A to B. The structure and the missions of the game are linear. This mob story is the creme de la creme, but it is worth the ride. See the life of Tommy Angelo, from driving a cab to driving the Mafia. 

This game is about story and atmosphere. Mainly, the player will be completing missions and driving from point A to B. Shooting can be wonky at times, but it fits the aesthetic of the game. Melee combat is clunky and probably the most disliked aspect of the game. Collectibles can be found throughout the world and even during missions, but to gain them all, the player might use the Free Ride mode of the game to freely explore the open world and collect.
For the amount of driving there is in the game, that means driving has to work. Luckily, the driving in this game is solid when you factor in what type of model and year the cars are from. 
The game has a phenomenal checkpoint system that resumes the player where ever their last played story beat is. The player is able to make the tale as easy or hard as they would like with difficulties ranging from Easy to Classic. The police response can be changed as well as driving methods and modes. For example, police can attempt to stop the player when they cause trouble, or they can make more of an effort for the player if they are not following traffic laws (Running red lights, stop signs, speeding, or driving on the wrong side of the road). The player can decide if an automatic or manual transmission is preferred when driving and if simulated driving is more natural than an arcade-y feel.

in Germany. It felt like it was 1930.

The way the story was all told and intertwined with the game play made it really enjoyable for me.
Though everything was quite good for me, I only felt a lack of freedom between missions. From mission to mission the game felt quite linear in motion and left little for me to want to explore before/after any mission or even at the end of the game.
I'm on to Mafia II and having a harder time connecting with everything there but it is still a good enough continuation of the Mafia story to keep me going.
