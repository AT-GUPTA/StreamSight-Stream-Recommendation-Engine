The gameplay is not for everyone. Personally, I'm a big fan of turn based RPG, and Darkest Dungeon interprets the genre flawlessly.

It's addictive without feeling rewarding. It's kinda not respectful of your time. I don't mean the fact that characters have permadeath. I love roguelikes. My issue is that 18 hours into the game, I have a set of level 4 characters, which is not even enough to enter the late game.

While I love the game's combat system, I didn't really feel like in those 18 hours the game pushed me to explore its huge selection of classes; I stuck to the 4 starter classes almost exclusively, and was almost always disappointed when experimenting with others. I also didn't find that the classes are super flexible, or that they have interesting synergies. Everything just kinda works like you expect it to. There are no cool hidden combos to discover. Once you've learned the combat system, it becomes a chore. And the fact that you can't skip animations makes this an even bigger problem.

The way Curios punish you for feeding them the wrong item made me look up the correct items on the wiki. I didn't like that... It made me feel guilty for cheating, while the alternative felt like unnecessary self-punishment and time wasting in trial and error, that could also result in a character death. It also made the game too easy and repetitive. I think the curios are a poorly designed discovery mechanic.

I enjoyed my 18 hours with this game, especially the early hours where I was losing characters, managing stress felt... stressful, and I had this sense that I'm overcoming an oppressively dark world through trials and tribulations.

I'm 250+ hours in, but these are hours that come with some serious gripes with the game. I would like to recommend it, but it has serious issues and I've never finished it. It's a grindfest with serious mechanical issues. Feel free to read through and get the game at your own peril.

PROS: Some of the best mechanics when it comes to nail-biting turn based combat where death is but a few bad rolls away. Interesting heroes and hero abilities and being able to come up with your own groups is a real treat. Fantastic out of combat abilities and choices. A great sanity mechanic. Amazing art. Quality progression mechanics for both base building and heroes.

CONS: Tedious parts in the game such as having to slowly backtrack several rooms in dungeons. Why can't we fast travel to previously visited rooms? Progression while really fun can take a LONG time and can feel a bit grindy at times - you are effectively soft locked from end game content until you grind enough upgrades, equipment, etc until you can actually take on the challenge. This grind isn't bad intrinsically, but it can be a bit much of the same thing over and over with not real way to speed it up. Grinds often extenuate bad QoL and gameplay mechanics, which DD has more that it's fair share of. 

Which heroes are good in which regions? What hero has quirks that help them in a region? Or against certain enemies? I Don't know, and the benefits you get from paying attention to these ""soft-hidden"" mechanics are so slight that they are hardly worth keeping track of. I have a roster of 20+ heroes, how am I supposed to remember one of them gets a boon for visiting the catacombs? Why should I care when simply selecting strong heroes with good group synergy is 90% of what will carry me through a dungeon run. The positive quirks I feel need an overhaul to make them more visible at a glance, and more impactful.

Lastly I'll talk about my biggest gripe, and yes it deserves its own paragraph (several in fact). The healing in this game is completely and utterly janked and ruins both the experience and the immersion. For context: in DD your adventure can involve several battles with downtime in-between to explore. Healing can occur within a battle, and it is very effective. Healing can also occur outside of battles, but it is either a campfire (which is extremely limited use and healing HP comes at the opportunity cost of getting buffs) or it's healing items, that cost money & offer extremely low health regen & take up valuable inventory space & is capped at a total amount. Due to this, you'll want to run a group with a healer who is able to heal during the battle. Running a group without a healer is strongly discouraged, as any health lost is extremely costly/difficult to get back without one. And you cannot guarantee you'll be able to avoid damage, the game is just too swingy.

So you're forced to run a healer. How many are there to choose from in the game? Well... two? I guess. (Perhaps 3 now, but I'm going off of when I played it mostp) One is effective, the other is less effective. All other healing is either terrible beyond usefulness or self heals which is a lovely complement in a group, but doesn't really help when a party member who can't self heal takes hits... So suddenly to play optimally, my party comps pretty much always include a Vestal. This leads to extremely boring team coms and monotonous game play. Why in the sweet **** is the healing balanced this way when everything else is so much better balanced. It's horrendous game design effectively punishing the player for trying to enjoy other fantastic elements of this game. Want to make a cool party comp of four party members? PSYCH! You get 3 options and you better take the Vestal or you're going to have a bad time. A simple fix would be to allow for much better out of combat healing - if it came at a cost that's fine, you're running a higher DPS comp anywho, it should have a downside. As it stands however, and comp without a healer just isn't viable.

But we've not even got to the best bit. Since healing out of combat is so restrictive and expensive, you're highly incentivised to heal within combat. So a battle is best played out where you kill all the enemies except one, then you keep them alive but in a weakened state by stunning and debuffing them, whilst you use your healer to patch up your heros back to full.... It completely disrupts the flow and immersion of the game, turning it into a frustrating experience beyond comprehension. It is by far my least liked aspect of this game. It takes an already grindy game and makes it even more tedious. And did I mention it ruins the immersion? Because it really does. Do I want to have fun, or do I want to min max and play out the worlds most S****y mechanic in order to stand a chance in the next combat. Woe is me.

I don't understand how a game studio can be so close to hitting the mark can publish several DLCs for their product and yet never resolve some of these glaring issues... Some of the updates have seen ever so slight improvements to my gripes here, as I'm sure any astute fan & reader will point out, but it's a drop in the bucket to what's required.

I'm not sure if I've ever experienced such disappointment in a game that had such promising potential, only to see it squandered.",1707341901,1708655924,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Up against the 86 week time limit and with 8 heroes already dead, I wiped on the final boss of the very last dungeon and 86 weeks of game-playtime - many days of real time - went down the drain. It took me seven years to recover my morale enough to try again.

You start the game with two heroes, always the same two guys, Reynauld the kleptomaniac crusader and Dismas the cheating highwayman. In other games of this sort your heroes are always straight-backed courageous fellows who are in it to the end, but in this game your adventurers have ""quirks"" which are sometimes good, and sometimes bad (like being a kleptomaniac, or a known cheat). As they adventure through the dungeon they get stressed out and sometimes they'll crack and develop afflictions which cause them to behave strangely (and poorly) in combat. (Occasionally the stress will make them true heroes. But not very often.)

If they survive, they can perform stress relief activities like grabbing a drink, gambling at the bar, praying to their gods, other things of that nature, and recover enough to maybe go back and try again. New heroes will come to your Hamlet on the stage coach, ready to fight and die for you, and you will build parties of four and send them out every week to explore the dungeons, get gold and trinkets, level up, and upgrade their equipment at the Hamlet (which you also upgrade to get better heroes, better equipment, better skills, and better stress relief activities). Ultimately your final goal is to go into the Darkest Dungeon, four times, to stop the unspeakable horrors that dwell there from taking over your world.

Death of a hero is almost always permanent, and on Stygian difficulty if you lose 12 heroes the game is over, or if you take more than the 86 weeks the game gives you the game is over. (You can play on lower difficulties which have no time or death limits, if you want. That turns the game more into a rogue-lite than a rogue-like. That might be your cup of tea.)

On my latest playthrough, I triumphed against the final boss with 2 weeks to spare. It felt good. Really good. On the old road, I found redemption.

Excellent game, stressful, but it is great fun to work your way through the combat puzzles, so to speak, and slowly get better and better at finding hero and skill combinations that let you tear through the inhabitants of the various dungeons. The dungeons ramp up in difficulty as your heroes level up, and they will refuse to go back to dungeons that are too easy for them, so you have to get better. The champion difficulty dungeons, for level 5-6 heroes, are very, very tough, especially the bosses. I tend to lose my heroes at the beginning, when they are level 0 nobodies, and at the end, when the highest level bosses expose the weaknesses in my old strategies.

The original game with its two difficulties (normal and hard) and several old and newly added areas is very well balanced, challenging and rewarding for planning and experience.

Since then the balance values have been tweaked making stress a more abundant problem, the PvP circus annoys the player every step of the week to play it in a giant glowing icon even though the servers are down and thus several achievements impossible.

Combine that with two new mechanics, the blood curse and the farmstead. Both of these are optional and should be challenged mid to lategame. Ingame both tell the player to do it on ""Resolve 1-2"". This is wrong. The Farmstead endless run will overwhelm early groups and will set stress and money back alot. Doing it on hardmode is akin to suicide as it saps precious resources for early build up.

The blood curse dungeon is a similar trap, spawning new ways to slow you down and to kill your people all over the map once it has been triggered. It should be avoided on hardmode runs if possible.

This game is not as well balanced as it was up to 2020, the game is not rewarding as it was up to 2020 and the game annoys you like nothing else with a feature that is DEAD. A dead feature that makes this game a nightmare for completionists. It is 100% incompleteable.

If you are a completionist, do not buy this game. If you dislike mobile game ""info"" terror... avoid it too. Although some mods remove that nuisance.

For a slow-paced genre that relies on strategy to be fun, it can be hard to avoid situations where it's best to just use whatever move has the biggest numbers over and over. I feel this issue is best highlighted in pokemon, where casual players can get by pretty easily just by using a big move repeatedly and one-shotting everything. Darkest Dungeon completely circumvents all of the genre's usual flaws and forces you to think. It took me like 4 party-wipes to grasp that this game was something special, something that required a deep understanding of different synergies, combos, and mechanics, but once I started to put the pieces together, it became a blast. As of the writing of this review, my learning curve is only beginning to tread upward, but I can already say that DD has one of the best, if not the single best, turn-based RPG combat systems that I've ever seen. It doesn't need a grid map like fire emblem to introduce positioning elements. Even with its deceptively simple positioning system and the way it follows pokemon's formula of only allowing each character to know four moves at any given time, the synergies between different characters and the way their abilities compliment each other is truly a sight to behold. If you enjoy turn-based strategy, this game is a necessity. Plus, it's got workshop support, and it's one of those games with really cool devs who look at the awesome in-depth mods made by their community and make them into official content, or even publish them on the steam store as entirely new games in their own right like they did with Black Reliquary. As far as DLC goes, crimson court is basically more of the Darkest Dungeon you know and love. It has new mechanics, enemies, and some really cool bosses (I've only fought the crocodile so far, but the battle was very difficult in a very fun way, and beating it felt extremely rewarding), but it doesn't reinvent the wheel. The best part, however, is probably the Flagellant, a new class that damages and applies bleed to itself in exchange for healing other party members, doing big attacks, and otherwise helping the rest of the team. The Flagellant also has a few big moves that he can perform only at low HP, synergizing with his self-damage mechanic and making the class feel way more involved. The mission structure is much the same as ever. Color of madness and butcher's circus are a bit further removed from the base game, offering new game modes. Color of madness adds a new area, the farmstead, that acts like a sort of gauntlet mode. There's no torch, no food or camping, no corridors to traverse or objects to interact with. It's just back-to-back battles. Personally, I really enjoy the mode. It gives you constant action and simplifies the game a bit, tearing away some of the fluff and extra mechanics to give way to the game's phenomenal combat system. It also rewards you with unique trinkets to bring into normal missions, tying it nicely back into the main game's progression. Butcher's Circus, unlike the previous two DLCs, doesn't really contribute to the main game. It's a mode that's mostly independent of your estate's progression (you only need to unlock everything in this mode once, even if you complete your estate save file) which lets you partake in multiplayer battles. It doesn't really add to the base game in any way, but I don't care, because this mode fucking slaps. I absolutely love butcher's circus. It's a bit sandboxy, since you can customize your trinkets and heroes in any way you choose without risking the loss of those trinkets or heroes, which makes it a great proving ground to test a cool build. It's also just a ton of fun to put your strategies head to head against real people. The final paid DLC, the shieldbreaker class, doesn't add as much as the other two, but in my experience the shieldbreaker is busted as hell so I'd say it's worth it anyway. She's a dancer who plays a bit like the jester and has some nice hard-hitting attacks plus a little bit of bleed and blight. The other DLC hero, musketeer, is kinda mid, but she's also free so it doesn't matter.",1708242977,1708242977,True,2,0,0.524986922740936279,0,True,False,False

The game is simple, 'out-stat your opponent' regaeding one key implementation- resistance percentages. But without a compelling dungeon crawl to get there. Most enemies have 10 to 20% resistance to a few damage types, then 30% resistance to just about all damage types, then 45%, 65%. It is just a plain increase with progress. And you counter that by increasing your own damage% above 100%. Like 150% against a resistance of 65% (this only means is you'll deal 85% of the weapon damage. This is as deep as you will find in game systems). Or chance% and resistance% for hit/dodge and status inflict/resist. The game is lacking substance. It is bland, with only visuals as the real feature along with subpar horror theatrics, while plastering 'horror' around which would usually just be a setting to lay out the event of horror. Here, the presence of 'twisted creatures with horrifying shreiks' is supposedly enough. From my point of view they might as well well normal creatures like lions doing what they do, surviving, along with a hint of perverted necromancers and witches doing their thing just because.

The fights are seemingly deep till you are hit with this revelation and just start playing properly. Then you see that 99% battles are a breeze because there is just one thing you need to consider, and other times there is just no way you will win except for example the enemies miss 5 times in a row and you crit 5 times in a row. The retreat and stress mechanic is just a time sink, and resultant of combat mechanics will be caused not by your fault, while on stygian it is a near guaranteed loss of the entire game (caused not by your fault). It is hard to mess up when you only have to keep track of one thing, which will give you a premonition of which fights are going to play out how without even a serious glance. The whole loop became… boring.

Might and Magic Book One (1986) has most of this game's mechanics. And 20 times more possibility. Yet very hard, but only in the sense you do not understand the game enough yet, or decline to use the various solutions available readily at all points of time before the party member making such solution possible dies.",1639631136,1708011778,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My daughter likes watching me play this game and cheering me when my heroes do crits and kill the bosses.

There are so many memorable moments I had with this game. My first encounter with the Shambler nearly gave me a heart attack. [spoiler]I was just placing a torch on the altar and didn’t expect to be pulled into a domain expansion like that.[/spoiler]

Storytime…

So, I had this mission where my Flagellant and Vestal both caught the Crimson Curse. And during battles, they were practically healing each other. Later on, I kinda ship them, gf and bf, forbidden love between a nun and a madman kind of stuff. Ngl, the vestal gave “I can fix him” vibes, lol... I even started dressing them in matching red outfits and gave them cute nicknames.

Then, one day, when they went on a mission together, my flagellant got afflicted and craving for blood (which I ran out of). He went batshit crazy and stabbed the poor Vestal, leaving her bleeding out. I was pretty ticked off, so I didn’t give the Flagellant any food for the rest of the mission. They survived, and the party completed the mission, but I was still mad and disappointed with the Flagellant.

So, I didn’t send them together for a mission for a while.

Anyway, I eventually decided to give them another shot together. I sent them to the 2nd mission of the Dungeon. Long story short, The Flagellant got wrecked, I ran out of bandages, and then he bled out to death in the dungeon.

For example, Malvallet the Crusader. Joined us around week 10 and was a capable warrior from the beginning who was often the most useful member of the team. Eventually he died in a brutal wipeout of my A team at the hands of the Siren when I had no light and had ran out of torches (didn't realise it was a boss and yes I was dumb and had never fought a boss before). I moved on and took in another Crusader, Hauville, who eventually surpassed Malvallet and became my new best front liner. Then one fateful, day, Malvallet was miraculously brought back to life! To learn from the now veteran Hauville, alongside a newly acquired Crusader named Bose, who had a drinking problem. Malvallet and Bose would become good friends as they went on several missions together, drank together, and trained alongside one another, while Hauville was drafted for the more elite missions. Malvallet has been in several scrapes since then. Such as a desperate battle against the Brigand 12 Pounder, in which Osmond the Bounty Hunter, whom Malvallet had known before his own death, was knocked to the ground by a cannonball and then stabbed to death by a cutthroat. All three crusaders are still alive, and Malvallet is now a legendary crusader alongside Hauville, with Bose not far behind. However there is still a long way to go. If I was ever to write a story about Malvallet, it would be from the perspective of Caunter, an abomination who loves being whipped and has survived since even before Malvallet joined.

This is a review for the base game, not either DLC expansion or the PVP mode.

Darkest Dungeon takes the atmosphere of spelunking in decrepit and damnable caverns for loot, riches and glory and boils it down to basic principles. The art, music and narration are all fantastic. While the mechanics relating to party comp, provisioning, and meter management are all fun, the AI is where this game gets tedious. Even when you load up overleveled heroes with your best equipment and employ use of abilities that are the counter pick to the horrors you face, the AI still hyper fixates in ways that you really aren't given tools to do anything about. 

Have low health? You will receive a DoT that will pick off that party member. Have high stress? literally any enemy that can inflict stress will solely target that character to induce a heart attack. Spreading your food out evenly after each battle? too bad, you proc'd a food check three steps later and lost twice the health you gained. 

At its core, its a solid game that scratches the itches I have for things like Ironman mode in XCOM, but the sheer inability to avoid half the detrimental mechanics makes it more annoying that regretful when you lose a character to RNG.

- It's repetitive.
- Strategize and be cautious as much as you want, the game is simply cruel and punishes you indiscriminately for every decision you make - good or bad.
- For every step you take forward the game slaps you 10 backwards for no reason.
- Despite my best efforts, after 3 or 4 days I ran out of money, my 9 or so characters were so afflicted with debufs and stress that they basically were a gibbering mess, incapable of fighting, and I have no means to to heal/treat them. 
- RNG sh**s on you even if you somehow manager to get one of your debilitated characters to actually make a strike.
- I didn't even bother with character customisation, because what's the point, they will die within a few day.

This game obviously panders to the sadistic, self punishing types or to those who enjoy mind-numbing grind. I've been on the wikis and discussion boards, and I categorically reject anyone's claim that you have to strategies to win - I usually excel at strategy games that require careful planning (resource/stat management, proceed/retreat mechanics etc), but this is sadism. I played this on the normal mode, and its unplayable difficulty wise.

I know I'm in the minority, and I guess I probably just ought to ""stay in my lane"" and ""not be a n00b""; It's not fun, it's enjoyable. If I want to spend what minuscule free time I have getting attempting to grind some sort of survival, whilst running out of money, dealing with stress, and unfair conditions, I might as well put in another shift at work. 

I don't understand this trend of creating nasty games that are sadistic in nature. Life is fucked up and stressful enough. There's a story I wanted to experience here, with some interesting lore. Is it relay too hard for the devs to make this game accessible for those who don't have infinite gaming hours to ""grind and get good"" and just enjoy the game in an easier ""story mode""? 

I guess not.

TL;DR: If your into Dark Souls like repetitive sadism, do for it. Otherwise, move along.

The game has the best in class writing, great sound design, fantastic art direction, yet manages to fumble the full package with really, really bad gameplay.

Two of the greatest hurdles of good game design are avoiding RNG and grind, and Darkest Dungeon fails both hurdles spectacularly.

The core gameplay loop is not fundamentally broken. It’s actually quite fun at first. But it quickly devolves into an unfair grind-fest.

Randomness is maximized to the point that even on easy difficulty a single missed or hit attack can be the difference between winning or losing. If that sounds fun, it’s not.

One of the worst design features of the game is the fact that mercs refuse to fight in dungeons they perceive as being ‘too easy’. It feels so artificially imposed to just make the game even more unfairly hard than it already is.

A timer might make sense, or an 'arrogance' trait, but nope, every single mercenary refuses to make your life even remotely easier, simply arbitrarily deciding not to try lower level dungeons in a textbook example of ridiculously artificial difficulty.

The game, while very difficult even on the easiest difficulty, is still tolerable up to the ‘darkest dungeon’, or the hardest location in the game, where things get truly ridiculous, with even the basic enemies able to basically wipe your party. And better yet, if you try to run away, you will be guaranteed to lose one of your party members.

Worse yet, the final dungeon has to be beaten four separate times.

This is already silly enough, but what somehow makes things even worse is that any hero that goes in refuses to go back, meaning that character is rendered almost useless. This is such bad design that it breaks my brain. Again, maybe make it a trait or a timer--but no. The character will never go back in again, period, and no positive traits or items can in anyway prevent or reverse this.

What this means is that you have to grind a total of 16 characters to level 6 just to beat the game, which is an insane amount of grind. And if you ever get party-wiped once, that’s yet another 4 characters you’ll have to grind to level 6 just to be able to have another chance at beating the dungeon.

The game would not only be much fairer but much more effective if the darkest dungeon was a single, final, climactic fight. You can lose, but if you win, its over.

To get an idea of how unenjoyable DD’s gameplay is, 6.4% completed the game on easy mode. That is a crazy low number for a game of the quality that Darkest Dungeon is in so many regards.

Pretty damningly, Dark Souls 3, meanwhile, which is supposedly famous for its difficulty, has been beaten by at least a full 25% of all players. Of course, DS3 is difficult in a fair and rewarding way, while Darkest Dungeon is just punishing.

Meanwhile, 4.2% completed the game on normal. Finally, only a laughably, embarrassingly small 1.2% completed the game on Stygian, the hardest difficulty. For the record, 2.2% completed XCOM 2 on the hardest difficulty, legendary mode, which is famously very, very hard and very, very long for most to complete.

As another comparison, 2.8% of people defeated Cuphead on the hardest difficulty, which is also known for its very high difficulty.

For the record, the fact that DD was a huge grindfest has been reiterated for many years by many people. If you go to the negative reviews of this game, the reviews are extremely consistent--there is not a single criticism of anything but one thing, the gameplay, and more specifically, that the game has a good early game and decent to poor mid-game which leads to a godawful, insufferable grindfest and RNG hell of an end-game that basically no one, and I mean no one-- even most of the positive reviewers--seem to like.

When the criticisms of the game are this consistent across the board, it’s not a matter of subjective opinion, or not being good enough, you are doing something wrong with your game.

Whoever designed the aesthetic, did the writing, and so on, is a genius. But whoever made the gameplay is, without any exaggeration, an idiot, and an extremely egotistical idiot on top of it.

The grim aesthetic does a great job of staying safely oblique while implying horror that is deeper, more morbid, more cosmically unhinged. In this sense, the game is primarily an artistic experience. The sound design complements gameplay beautifully - the voice actor for the narrator has a presence in my internal dialogue.

Before I move onto gameplay, it is important to note that I am not a skilled gamer. I can spend hundreds of hours grinding, making the same dumb mistakes and never getting to enjoy later-game content in some of the more brutal titles.

This is a hard game.

I recall that I bought this game the year that it released and I have logged 200+ hours. I have not beat this game. Darkest Dungeon 2 is out. I will still play this game (in addition to Darkest Dungeon 2).

Like many roguelikes, a good DD run will have you invested in your favorite heroes - and one bad dungeon can have you wailing at your monitor over the loss of a cherished asset. It feels a bit like XCOM in this way. Training up a strong team, collecting powerful relics and careful planning will get you to the final room - but then the real fight begins!

When you consider the rich modding community and all the DLC you can layer onto an already intense strategic experience... it is very easy to recommend this title.

Contrary to the title of this review, if you're not into overwhelmingly and seemingly unfairly difficult games then this one may be a pass. As a diehard fan of the XCOM strategy genre (Red Hook took inspiration from XCOM according to the devs), I fit right into the ""win against all odds"" demographic but I understand this isn't for everyone. If you enjoy strategy games and (especially) have an interest in D&D then this game will be damn close to perfection.

If I could pick one thing to highlight (because otherwise this review would be very long) it would be the voice acting. It is by far the best and most iconic voice acting I have EVER heard in a video game. The game simply would not be what it is without Wayne June.

This game will test your ability to keep your cool. Go in with the right mindset. You WILL get beaten down. You WILL get screwed over by bad RNG. The highs are high but the lows are crushing. That is part of the experience. The campaign is long - but victory will come.

After playing some more, I still stand by my review. The RNG is stacked in every way imaginable against you. Enemies get GUARANTEED crits even when debuffed. Surprising the enemy is actually WORSE than fighting them normally (unless you get extremely lucky and actually get your moves out and not miss everything with 90+ ACC). Whatever SPD you have, the enemy is GUARANTEED at least +2 over that at any given point. PROT means absolutely nothing. Marked means nothing. Your guys get hungry literally right after eating.
Like I said, everything conceivable is done against you. 

This is not ""you're making the best out of a bad situation"" this is ""we can't make a proper system so we decided cheating and pretending that we're deep and edgy is what we're gonna do"". 
You know what makes a bad situation? When I make a mistake and I'm punished for it. Like stunning a Bone Rabble instead of the Stress Witch while you got a guy at 190 stress. You know what's a cheap and completely forced situation? Your attempt at a rogue-like by giving the enemies you face BLATANT cheats that completely disregard the game's rules. Don't worry, the rules apply tenfold to you though. 

Go feck yourselves you reddit-tier smoothbrains. You got lucky with this awesome idea that probably wasn't entirely yours to begin with. The fact the sequel blows in-comparison is all the vindication I need to know that you're a bunch of incompetent dimwits that had greatness fall on your lap and you decided to just ""make another rogue-like InsPirEd bY dArK SOuLs!!11 muh diFuhkuhltee"".

The Ancestor, driven mad by fervent curiosity, grew obsessed with uncovering the secrets slumbering beneath the family manor.

So too, was I. Obsessed, I played this game relentlessly until completion like it was my day job.

I found Darkest Dungeon to be an excellent turn-based party RPG that proved enthralling to the very end. It is a game that heavily rewards game knowledge and mastery to minimize the risk to the heroes that matter, and to know when to discard the heroes who do not.

--Well-built RNG and uneasiness--

There's already a top Steam review that perfectly addresses how the mechanics inform the feel of the game. I would suggest you go see it too, if you're looking to purchase this game; it's eloquently writen.

The underlying RNG tolerances of the game create a fundamental sense of uneasiness that keeps players on their toes. The incredible lows, like the panic that sets in when one of your heroes goes from full HP to Death's Door in a single stray crit, provide a sharp contrast with the highs, like when a hero unexpectedly turns virtuous and manages to rally the party to victory.

Once you've built a solid foundation of game knowledge, you can mitigate most of the RNG through thorough preparation. Knowing which heroes thrive in which areas, familiarizing yourself with the enemy movesets, and watching your carefully built strategies unfold is extremely satisfying, because all of this gets you 90% of the way to success. Even the most experienced players are kept on their toes, because in that remaining 10%, you are left with nothing but a lot of prayers to RNGesus. Even then, with enough preparation, close calls can almost always be averted with quick thinking (speed. up. your. healers). Every victory feels meticulously earned, and that is a glorious feeling.

--Excellent Horror Aesthetics--

One would be remiss to not compliment the sheer craftsmanship of the game's aesthetics. Every visual is delightfully horrifying; many attack animations reveal new depths of corruption lurking behind the already grotesque gallery of enemies.

The narration deserves special mention here, because narrators are often hit or miss in games due to their potential for repetition. A bad narrator quickly becomes exhausting to listen to. The Ancestor is an excellent narrator, and the voice actor delivers his lines perfectly. I am always impressed by how much sadistic pleasure he conjures up for his torment of the Miller; I can practically feel the Ancestor's spittle as he revels in his dark deed. Even knowing the Ancestor is an awful person in-lore, his triumphant declaration of ""The flesh is knit!"" on a critical heal feels like an earnest celebration. Many of the Ancestor's lines have quickly become endlessly quotable earworms.

--Good DLCs, but avoid on first playthrough--

For my first playthrough, I kind of blithely turned on all of the DLCs I had available, which was all of them. Crimson Court, Shieldbreaker, The Color of Madness, Musketeer, and Butcher's Circus. While I don't regret this decision, had I known more up front I would've saved these DLCs for a second, or even third playthrough. The major issue with the DLCs is that while they provide an absolutely wonderful amount of awesome content, they also bring a very noticeable amount of power creep that can throw off the balance of the game.

First off, The Flagellant (which comes with the Crimson Court) and Shieldbreaker classes are both incredibly versatile and powerful. The Flagellant absolutely dominates in three of the in-game regions, and the Shieldbreaker decimates the other two as well as the endless mode. Both classes come with unusual drawbacks that hint at their clearly overpowered nature. The Flagellant is limited in that you can only have one per team, as multiple would be too strong. The Shieldbreaker comes attached with a series of ""nightmares"" that serve as a kind of unpleasant surprise sidequest for her, making her a potential liability until you've won all of the nightmare battles.

The Crimson Court DLC also adds the ""District"" in-game system, which gives a significant number of permanent in-game buffs and changes the player economy entirely. This, too, is something that might've made the game ever so slightly easier.

Two DLCS (Crimson Court and Color of Madness) also add a large number of new trinkets that are often far stronger than base game trinkets.

Finally, The Color of Madness DLC adds a new consumable item called Shard Dust that can very quickly derail the difficulty of many bosses. I was able to two shot the final boss this way, and although it was very amusing to do so, I imagine that the original battle would've proven far more epic and fitting as the climax of the game.

Overall, I feel the DLCs provide a lot of opportunities for experienced players to experiment, theorycraft, and break the game, but that they aren't really suitable for a new player.

--One Downside: a little Grindy--

That's all there is to really say about it. Some parts of Darkest Dungeon can feel a bit grindy and tedious at times: you're constantly wanting for certain key resources in the early game, and you don't really stop needing them until the late game mark. I wouldn't have minded if some of the resources were easier to stack in inventory during longer quests. This is about the only thing in Darkest Dungeon that I feel was genuinely a little off.

--Conclusion--

It's quite late, so I'm going to wrap this review up a little unceremoniously as my writing quality has been steadily dropping for the past hour. If you're a fan of turn-based RPGs, I would very strongly recommend Darkest Dungeon. It is a finely calibrated and excellent crafted experience that offers a hearty but reasonable challenge.",1705146843,1705146843,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is well polished and well done, with few if any bugs. AI is smart, although as with any game it can get repetitive over time. 

Voice acting is the best in any game ive played hands down. excellent voice actor! 

Classes are fun to play with and pushes you to come up with different party compositions. Every single class can be used at least 2 ways, most alot more. Some you wouldnt think using them in a certain manner until you need a back liner or gap filler and have none to choose from. It forces you to utilize the classes in a different way than optimal and helps you learn all their skills and capabilities. Very well done in that regard. 

Stays challenging until the end. I love all the various quirks and diseases one can get. Really makes you think and prioritize different combos of party members in the different locations. Helps the game feel 'real' constantly juggling the best and worst quirks and party members to tackle the task at hand. 

Random wandering mini bosses adds so much to the game and helps 'fill in the chinks' imo. Alot of neat little hidden things here and there that keep you on your toes.

Finances stay a constant need until the end, which i love. It really makes you think about which buildings to upgrade, which skills and abilities to unlock and which blueprints to go after. nicely done and give you a small break from dungeon delving.

By far the best way to play is with the Crimson Court dlc. it adds alot to the game and i wish the other locations had some of the same mechanics that it provides. especially the epic quests part. really nicely done. the music in CC is awesome as well.

The downside to me is a little repetitive, of course, the Color of Madness dlc is not fun at all IMO. i usually play with it off nowdays. just dont like the grind and no maps. not for me, although the bosses are quite the challenge.

Bring a change of pants.

It’s not often you come across something unique or different amongst Steam’s infinite collection of games. 

DD combines dungeon crawling and town management and adds a dash of Gothic and HP Lovecraft. If that was not enough, once simmering in your pot, the developers add turn-based combat and serve you the complete game with added stress management.

It has a unique art style which would not look out of place in a Dracula comic and the narrator must have enjoyed his work. That guy is called Wayne June and almost worth the price of admission on his own. It’s almost Rocky Horror Picture Show time. Or Transylvania. 

The developers, Red Hook Studios, do a decent job introducing the player to the game’s systems and mechanics. How to navigate dungeons. Win in combat. Build your ancestors estate so you can attract heroes to join your fight and sooth their woes after each journey into the depths.

However, don’t think Red Hook are kind folks. The game quickly gets diabolically harder and if there are any people playing on the higher difficulties, well. Those people must be eating iron nails for breakfast.

Now, I do like the dungeon exploration and combat. It is complex enough for an old-time gamer to appreciate with so many combinations and strategies you could start a new chapter of encyclopaedia Britannia. 

Every time you venture into the depths you should organise four heroes. Equipment, amulets and trinkets. Torches and food. In real life I expect these guys to scarper off as soon as you turn your back. However, in the game, I almost feel sorry for them. They might return but they won’t be unscathed. Some of them might even go mad. You really must grow your band of heroes as most won't survive two ventures in a row.

I particularly like the Plague Doctor and Jester Class. The former can throw poison bombs from the back line causing damage over several rounds. The Jester has a guitar and knows how to use it. We also have a Knight Crusader, and a Werewolf. There are many heroes, each with their own unique skills and unique equipment.

This leads me to explain some of the signature features of the game that makes it stand out from its competitors. Your torch will go out slowly and in the increasing darkness your heroes might be ambushed. Or worse. They might get stressed. 

Stress management is very important as your characters might stop following your orders. Hit out at their companions. Technically they might join the other side. If you make the wrong choices they might die of a heart attack.

There are a lot of factors here to consider and those players that like complicated, rogue-like, turn based combat, games with a deep satisfying narrator, you can’t do much better.

To counterbalance the Gods of Random and difficulties, Steam has several Workshop mods.

Yes, I like it. Yes, I am scared of it. Yes, it is quite difficult. 

Yes, I fully recommend it.

Though what brings it down for me is the rng factor. You will hear people say that everyone overexaggerates the rng of the game, and that you just need some knowledge and skill. I highly disagree, this game is 50/50 skill and luck. A hero can die on their first deaths door check, you can go the entire game without seeing a virtue, an enemy can repeatedly crit your group, a group of enemies can spontaneously target a single hero, your attacks can miss, your status effects can be resisted, you can get hunger checked over and over again, the game can spawn more blockades than you should usually prepare for, your attacks can miss, you can have a character keep accumulating stress and damage from traps because you didnt get any scouts, your party can shuffle at an enemy encounter with max torch, your attacks can miss, etc, etc, etc. EVERYTHING in the game has an rng factor, you can use trinkets to lower that factor a bit (if you find them), but it will always be there. Its clear the developers intended for deaths to be a big part of the game, and its hard for me to say if that was the right move? Losing somebody is frustrating no matter what, and it can and will lead to quit moments. For me, the game has become more stressful than fun, so whats the point of playing? 

If you can handle these rng factors, I very much recommend the game, but losing heroes is incredibly frustrating, and it will happen.

It's been out a while so I'm not going to say anything that hasn't already been said. If you're wondering if you should get it, the answer is yes as long as a couple of things are true for you. 

- You don't mind the very real possibility of having an entire save file (sometimes dozens of hours) borked because you lost some of your best people on a late game dungeon run. 

- You find the idea of your units actively working against you (stealing loot, harming each other, refusing your directions) a really fun and innovative concept. 

- You love turn based combat and long term resource management so much that you don't mind if a game is those two things and basically nothing else. 

If all of that is true for you, you'll love this game. If you're not sure, try it anyways. This game is worth your time, even if it will make you want to put your head through a wall sometimes.

It was a breath of fresh air and I felt desperation like I did the first time I tried it. As a community item, it went beyond my expectations.

Update 2:
I have all 100% achivements of the game and I am still coming back to play it. Below is my oh-so-nice-summer-child review (back in winter 2016) when I first beat it. Makes me nostalgic. It is January 2024 now.

After my 100th hour, I have finally put an end to the Darkest Dungeon.

As the leper says, a tide rises and a tide falls - I made triumph and I faced defeat, with the latter being the most common. I have forsaken favourite heroes, lost valuable trinkets and relics at the cost of gold and progress. In the end, I found out that I was at a stalemate. ""This isn't fair."" I said that to myself multiple times, yet I continued to struggle. The feeling of accomplishment drove me. The feeling of success over such a huge crowd of people like me. I didn't give up, despite the stressful and desperate times. And now, I hold the spoils of victory. At what cost...?

Hats off to the developers. At first I saw the game as everyone else sees it - a game. I ignored the story - thought it was some universe where monsters just exist - came out of nowhere, being a trivial thing. On the contrary,  with the journals found and the bosses slain, I find out that the reason for these abominations' existance isn't a given. Someone is behind all of this, and the reason for all of these horrors. 

Of course, people are and will be complaining about the RNG or grinding of it but the game is meant to be like that. I haven't seen a game so punishing and unfair before. But here I am, unscathed, actually pretty broken after the final quests, but at least the game teaches you not to falter in front of difficult challenges and situations. You will lose, of course, multiple times at that. But the trick is to keep on trying. And take note from this game and apply it in life.(cliche but a reality)

A note: the devs are working on a comic series about the characters' backstory. So far my favourite one is about the Crusader. You can check them out at the Darkest Dungeon Wiki.

Darkest Dungeon's difficulty curve lies within learning the game and its RNG. Both of these are also what keeps the game fresh and exciting. It's not a mechanically hard game, and frankly could use a bit more depth in some of its parts. As it is, all it asks from you is to learn through playing it, and then think about your decisions in the future. In all honesty, this isn't that hard to do. Sure, RNG can always screw you over, but with the right mindset and preparation, you can play around it most of the time, so it's not like your knowledge and strategy are out the window thanks to a roll of the dice. 

Demanding? Sure. ""Hardest game ever?"" Not by a long shot.

Other aspects of the game include the artstyle, which alone is enough to pique interest. That's not to say that what lies underneath isn't up to par. The story and theme of the game are cryptic, told through stylized cutscenes and by an excellent narrator, whose voice makes you shiver to the bone. As I said, the gameplay could use a bit more depth to it, but it's tactical enough to keep you engaged and requires you to think about your next move. There's 15 hero classes, each of them having 7 abilities, 4 of which can be used at a time. They do a decent job of preventing the game from getting stale in its grindier parts and encourage experimentation, though I'd lie if I said that I never just wanted to be over with a dungeon already. Customization, from a purely aesthetical standpoint,  is what I consider the game's biggest missed opportunity, as it's almost non-existent. Other than selecting one of the 4 premade colour palettes for each hero class and changing their name, there's nothing you can do. Not even their armour changes in appearance as you upgrade it, which is a damn shame.

Going through my most played games on Steam, one thing is certain: I'm not the type of person that gets hung up on individual games for too long. I'll play a game, beat it, and despite having the time of my life, wont touch it for another year or two, until the time is right to replay it. It's been years since a game has gripped me so much that I just couldn't put it down, even resorting to multiple playthroughs if necessary. The last time that happened was when I played Mass Effect 2 for the first time, back in 2011. And although my infatuation with that game has long since waned, here I am in 2018, playing my heart out with Darkest Dungeon.

Boasting a rich array of classes, skills, and trinkets, there is tons of freedom to craft diverse party compositions, in a distinctive turn-based combat framework unique to Darkest Dungeon. Not to mention the atmospheric depth, complemented by the stellar voice acting for the narrator, it pulled me in so hard that I was utterly engrossed, almost to an excessive degree.

The difficulty of this game is hard... even unfair sometimes. As many have said before, RNG is a huge factor in this game that can absolutely make or break your runs. But If you keep playing you'll eventually learn all the mechanics and it begins to get a lot ""easier"" as you can use your knowledge to effectively remove the RNG or sway it heavily in your favour. People seem to overshadow that RNG can be beneficial to the player too!

However, a significant drawback is that [b] THIS GAME DOES NOT RESPECT YOUR TIME.[/b]

One piece of advice towards enjoying this game I'd say is to leave behind the Vestal and Jester, at least for the most part. Those are crutch characters that somewhat subvert the game's systems. 

So how do you heal without a Vestal? Easy:
1) Learn to use the small heals many characters have, like Musketeer and Flagellant. Even Antiquarian can help.
2) Learn to use self heals, like Leper and Abomination.
3) Always be stunning. Create time to heal in battle by stunning and debuffing enemies. Every fight you should take 1-2 turns to recover.
4) Learn which enemies you can bully by debuffing and dragging the fight out so you can recover.
5) Make the most of your camping time. Bring plenty of food so you can have a feast. Select camping abilities carefully.
6) Food can help heal between battles, but use sparingly, mainly to keep people off of death's door (DD).
7) Speaking of DD, if you are in a tough fight and constantly low HP, just get off of DD, don't bother healing properly.
8) It's okay to be at low health sometimes. You are healed between missions, go ahead and finish on DD.

Managing stress:
1) Crusader and Houndmaster are great for stress healing during battle.
2) Mainly stress heal at camp. Stress is more important to heal than HP if you have to choose.
3) Build Crit items over raw damage. In 90% of cases Crit is better, partially due to the stress heal. It really adds up.
4) Build Dodge items over raw protection. In 90% of cases, Dodge is better, partially due to avoiding incoming stress.
5) Bring lots of torches, keep it on full light at all times. Don't light a new torch too early, or before camp.",1704305939,1704305981,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As a disclaimer, I played this with and without mods over the years, so this isn't a pure opinion and I'll focus on what is consistent with the standard content.

The gameplay loop is set between managing the health and sanity of your teams and fighting a host of very angry cunts for every inch of progress, gold, items and literally anything you have space to take. The game is somewhat a rarity in that it doesn't give pardons for failure: heroes' deaths are (essentially) permanent, recovery is both slim and costly, and enemies are given no small amount of advantages that will overcome your own. Top that off with a brutal RNG that may see you fail no matter your strategy, and you've got a pretty intense cycle.

Don't be discouraged by DD1's many frustrating elements: experiencing loss and anger and despair are intrinsic elements of the game. You can never fully lose, save for on the highest difficulty, but winning will always cost you. And that's not to excuse any conniptions you may rightfully have about it; I myself resent how tediously dull it gets fighting the same enemies in the same backdrops with the same heroes. Alas, the power of mods does address this readily.

Not much storywise, as the core of the entire plot is directly shown in the opening cutscene. But every little lorebit you do scrounge about the game does give context to the 'Why' of it. Spoilers: [spoiler]the Ancestor is a fucking prick[/spoiler]


Anyway, it's a great game overall, even if you don't have the stomach to finish it-- I myself did it on the most forgiving difficulty, and it still took some 60 hours thereabout. I recommend it if you can get it on sale, or to anyone who's prone to cosmic horror and gambling people's lives like pennies.",1704019987,1704019987,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The gameplay is awesome - there's enough complexity to make the tactical and sometimes strategical decisions interesting for a long time. 
The lovecraftian grim atmosphere is great. Every part of the game supports it. The great music, the art, the narration and voice acting, and the gameplay where it's often optimal to use and then dismiss heroes, leaving them insane, battered and broken. 

I have a few serious issues with the game though. On easy and normal difficulty, the game heavily incentivizes you to play in a boring, slow way. It's safer to take many easier missions with lower rewards, but also lower risk of losing your heroes. This way, the game becomes a grinding slog. After playing for a long time, I've completely solved this problem by switching to only playing on Stygian - the hardest difficulty. It introduces the time limit. You don't finish the game in a limited amount of missions - your save file is done, you've lost. The whole campaign. This forces you to actually play in a fun way, forces you to take interesting risks - now you can't optimize the fun out of the game. 

But this ""fix"" of mine only works once you've learned the game and are so good at it that you can actually finish it on Stygian. Which I don't really think is a good experience for a first playthrough. 

So, this game is just too grindy.

Another problem I have with this game is the recycled bosses. You fight each boss three times, and it just kinda feels too long.

The narrator is honestly a big part of the experience, and it's great.
I think for this one it's better to see gameplay footage and figure out for yourself if this is your kind of game. You will suffer. A lot. But for some, figuring out how to deal with that is part of the fun.
The game has solid mod support, so you can also tweak the experience to your liking, which is a big plus.
It has a very oppressive and depressing vibe to it, which is exactly what it should do. Art and soundtrack are fantastic.

Loosely interconnected story and lore, dangerous exploration, deadly combat, resource management, simple character design, it's as close to a classic D&D style RPG campaign for a video game as you'll get. Most video games, or games in general, there's always a sense that you can ""win"" or at least they're designed for the players to ""win"".  Not the Darkest Dungeon. It has an Old School Renaissance (OSR) philosophy in that there are definitely fights you can't win and some that even if you could win most of the time, today is not your day and you're not going to survive.

I discovered Darkest Dungeon after playing Shadowdark RPG and they're remarkably similar, despite being created independently by two groups of people who couldn't be more different.  It speaks to the need for a style of gaming that has been lost and forgotten but is sorely needed.  With both of these games there is very limited ""gear slots"" and often you'll have to leave loot behind, just drop it on the ground and run back to the safety of your Hamlet.

If you enjoy extreme, grinding challenges; if you can handle watching your favorite heroes die instantly (I was surprised when my favorite Hellion ""Griffin"" came back to life and she helped me win the game); and if you want to explore forsaken places where all hope is long gone, play Darkest Dungeon.",1703396489,1703428685,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First of all, it is undeniably a stress-inducing game. I purchased it in 2019 and I believe that it wouldn't be too challenging. Oh, how naive I was.

In terms of game play, it aligns with what one would expect from any turn-based game. You attack the enemy, and they counterattack, basic stuff. What sets this game apart is the need to pay attention to the mechanics like DODGE, ACC, SPD, etc. While some criticize the RNG aspect, I disagree. Most defeats result from my own greed rather than unfair game mechanics. The fact that the game always remind you of that every time you open up the game.

The combat system isn't the only important aspect since there are numerous events unfold. Managing gold income, upgrading buildings, and overseeing your crew are also essential elements.

Beyond gameplay, the art style captivates me. The dark atmosphere and ominous feelings, coupled with the OST, create a fitting ambiance (unless you're using mods). And who could forget the narrator? I'd go so far as to say the narrator elevates the game at least tenfold. I've even memorized some of the iconic lines.

In conclusion, it's a challenging game. However, let that not be a deterrent from purchasing it. Give it a try, so I don't have to endure this experience alone.

This game has everything: fantastic turn-based combat, awesome characters, amazingly written story, and the atmosphere is unlike anything I have ever seen. The way the game progresses, team building, and exploration of the different dungeons hooks me into many hour long sessions every single time I even open the game. This game is so addictive to me and there are so many different kinds of runs that you can do that the game always feels fresh. Speaking of feeling fresh, there is no other game that I have felt as much of an emotional roller coaster while playing before. The way that your runs can suddenly take a dark twist at any time really makes everything pressure you into really trying to figure out what is the best possible move in any turn or at any time, even when making this move you are screaming at your screen. The more you play this game, the more lessons you learn, the more you learn about what is best and what enemies to focus down, and what trinkets to go fore. It is incredibly satisfying to do well in this game because of how much all odds feel to be against you at all times, as it is usually because you had chosen the best possible option for any scenario. Besides the gameplay, as I mentioned earlier, the atmosphere in this game is fantastic. Everything including the ambient noise, the music, and of course, the ancestor's narration, make this game's atmosphere just unlike any other game I have ever played.

(pros and cons below)
If I should mention the technical side of things, I have nothing to complain about. The audio-visual side, along with the rouge-like medieval setting of the game, is so breathtaking to me that words cannot describe it. 
In terms of story and gameplay, the game is very RNG, recruiting and gradually upgrading heroes, along with new abilities and trinkets are very intuitive, but also quite grindy. Especially when they don't hit anything afterwards.  Of course, you'll love the heroes and their irreversible deaths will hit you pretty hard, as there's no respawn. 
If you're tired of just playing in dungeons, killing very difficult bosses and you've finished the game after a few dozen (or hundreds) of hours, there are DLCs wich do not cost much, all under 10$.

Pros:
+++absolutely beautiful graphics and audio
+++great heroes you'll fall in love with and hate at the same time
++you'll enjoy the fights and they'll be just as stressful after hundreds of hours
+challenge your friends in the ""Butcher's Circus""
++You'll be jumping with excitement as you defeat the toughest bosses

Cons:
-all attacks and the entire game is based on chance and percentage chances that can be influenced, but at times the game feels completely random
- you will have played this game for hundreds of hours without finishing it :)

Try this game out, it really deservs it + there's a sequel

I have looked at guides and tips and tried different things but honestly this game is stupidly unbalanced to the point where overcoming it feels more like a chore than a challenge of skill and strategy.

in the very beginning you are already onslaught-ed by stress enemies with high dodge so you cant get out of the fight with out one or more characters getting at LEAST close to 100 stress, and this is at the second or third dungeon. I haven't even unlocked the blacksmith or guild yet in some cases let alone use them. after nearly every dungeon i have to send the whole party into recovery for multiple things. literally after the second dungeon one of my characters negative traits, which they got IN THAT DUNGEON already became re-enforced with the skull just so it could give me the tutorial. this was on radiant.

its not that I'm terribly upset with rng really. I do think that could use a little tweaking but this is more a matter of pacing difficulty and allowing the player to even begin enjoying the game before they feel they need to watch hours of guides and restart multiple times. its sad as i think if it were just a tad different I would love this game but honestly at this point I just ask myself why frustrate myself trying to play this when I could play something else.",1702440061,1702440061,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is about a 4-6 on a scale of 1-10 for me, with it leaning towards the 4 after about 70 hours of playtime, but the first 40 hours or so were leaning more towards a 6.

Positive- Great voice acting from the main narrator, also about the only voice acting in the game.
Original concept with a fresh take on the turn based battle format by adding in a ""stress"" factor that can really steamroll your party if left unchecked. 
Originality is the main attribute for this game, it does not have wizards, warriors, rogues and elves.
It has Crusaders,Antiquarians,Bounty Hunters, Occultists, and many more.
While some of these might be similar to the classical tropes (Crusader=warrior) they all have fairly unique abilities and mechanics, mostly based on various buffs and de-buffs. 
So while the dot effects like Blight and Bleeding have been done before I think that the combination of them and how they are used is very original and if you want an original game in this genre this will definitely scratch that itch.

Negative- Where the game failed for me is in the RNG roguelike mechanics. 
So RNG is to be expected in a roguelike, the very game itself states that heroes will die and it is a game about adversity and recovering in the face of unfairness. 
I feel though that the game very much overdoes the adversity. After a few times of having my champion level party wiped out I have just decided that the grind is not going to be worth the reward, especially since even at max buffs and gear the party can still be completely wiped out due to a battle going wrong due to the RNG.
I definitely could finish the game and play it some more but I am just not willing to level up another group at this point.
Once you hit the red dungeons the tide turns well against you. While I could make easy runs with orange and green with my buffs, the red dungeons are basically just a roll of the dice at this point and it is not due to a skill or learning curve but only to the fact that there are so many things that can go wrong in a single battle.
So while it has its moments and has a unique system, the rng is just way too punishing once you hit red and above no matter how well you know the game.
So I am going to go against the grain on this and give it a no, not recommended. 
Too long of a grind and the roguelike element means basically starting over again and again with a few slight buffs like being able to draft lvl 2 heroes, but it does not make up for the tediousness of starting over again and again and again.

I am also basing this review on the base game, I have not used or purchased any of the Add-ons and never review a game based on add ons. If the game is not good in its base state then it is not good, nobody should be required to purchase an add on in order to make the game playable. I love roguelikes and cannot recall a single one where I pointed out bad rng as a factor, having random bad events can be expected and even game ending ones, but this game makes bad rng front and center intentionally so maybe this will be something certain people like, I am just not one of them.

Short version: I adore this game

Long version: The visuals and gameplay are simply phenomenal. Red Hook has done a fantastic job to bring the turn-based RPG genre into relevancy with its own flavour. Now for the big points, the stress system. It may be one of the first games to introduce such a system (it's at least the first one for me) and it's very immersive (albeit a bit bullshit at times). It's a very simple game with simple mechanics but that makes the depth and experiments you can do so much more accessible and enjoyable, every stats feel like it matters and easy to understand.

I will warn newcomers to the game however, this game is not easy and will punish you if you are overconfident or unprepared. Get used to things not going your way, it's all about decisions in the action, the game is not going to hold your hand.

But once you get used to the loop, the mechanics and understand what's going, what to do, it is a great experience every time for me. And that's not even mentioning this game has Steam workshop compatibility which means the possibilities to spice and change your experience are endless. Absolutely recommend for anyone interested.

[strike] Neat game, but it isn't really a roguelike/roguelite.

It's pretty much an RPG really.

There's roguelike-ish elements in that you can take risks discovering stuff in the dungeons, you can build a party with a bunch of different classes (there's legit like 16 of them), different accessories for the classes, a currency you use to upgrade a ""base"" (meta progression in the estate itself), risk vs reward with the light/dark mechanic, etc.

But I don't really qualify it as a roguelike. There are no runs and every quest you go on WILL have an affect on your next one. Whether it be a character getting stressed out and needing to unwind back at the estate, having a party die in a dungeon and losing all them AND their equipment, getting a negative quirk, etc.

Honestly, I love this game's aesthetics and battle systems, but oh my god does management of the estate and the long-term consequences of runs suck. I honestly love the idea, but it makes bad RNG and experimentation so much more punishing.

The fun of roguelikes is being able to fail a run due to your mistakes, yet being able to come out of it stronger for the next run because you learned something new from your past mistakes. Here it feels like you have all the downsides of a loss in any other roguelike and MORE without any of the plus sides of it (okay fine, maybe you'll learn/discover a new thing or two in a run, but it may not be enough to leave you wanting more). 

This game is waaaaay too punishing. Some of you may like it, but believe me when I say, that if you don't have much time on your hands, this game will do nothing but make you want to tear your hair out.

Honestly, if you like something like X-com and want something like that, but the characters can go insane, the combat is turn-based and on a way smaller grid, and you personally don't care if a game repeatedly kicks you when you're down and occasionally spits on you while it's at it, I think you'll definitely enjoy this game.

Everyone else though, proceed with risk. They murdered some of my favorite characters in the blink of an eye and left one party member live to tell the tale. On one hand, it wasn't like it was a scripted event, it WAS partially my fault, as I could've just left the dungeon to escape with them (even if it would've given them more stress/I would've missed out on some rewards), but dang it they all died in like one turn...

NOTE: Traits and quirks are fun, as having a character's only way to relieve stress be time in a brothel, only to then develop ""deviant tastes"" banning them from said brothels is hilarious. If I end up losing that character I'm uninstalling this game and never playing it again (i removed the quirk limiting them to brothels but left their ""deviant tastes"" just because I find it funny), though, I'm sure the devs probably know that and are probably dying laughing at the fact that the game is as punishing as it is. I just wish managing party members wasn't so tedious, though, I've heard that they've changed the second game to be MORE like a roguelike, so I can't wait to check that out some day.

I hope some day I'll come back to this review and change it into a recommendation, but for now, as someone with not as much time as they used to have to just themselves and with games that I generally just find to be more fun, I'll just leave this as a ""don't recommend"" for anyone who has heard this game is great, but not enough of the people telling them that this game is actually pretty grindy and not that much like a roguelike.

Feel free to tell me to go die in the comments though. I'd love to learn how to have more fun with this game and hate it when I see others having fun with something but feel like I can't enjoy as much myself.[/strike]

Just like this game, steam made me wanna kill myself when I was editing this review (I changed a lot in my revisions, as seen by how this review is now positive despite all my grievances with the game) and then accidentally hit ""cancel"" instead of ""save changes"" because I was in a rush. I'm not going back and fixing shit, so y'all can just have fun figuring out the fun shit for yourselves. Just know that I recommend playing on radiant mode (your heroes level faster in this mode while being less punishing in regards to how many people you can have die and farming gold), and using mods to speed up animations, walk speed, and stuff in game after you've grown tired of watching the slow battle animations (for me this was like 10 hours in).",1698812288,1701110632,True,0,0,0.461538463830947876,0,True,False,False

The gothic setting of the game is really unique and makes you wanna play more and more. The band of soldiers you have are all unique in some way, and all of their skills can be utilized one way or another in combat. It is a really well made turn-based game with a good amount of dice rolls that either go in your or opponents favor, but I'd say that tactics are still the most important. Losing well developed heroes in combat hurts like a bitch, but it makes you sure that you don't repeat the same mistakes as before. The feeling of well placed hit and carefully thought out boss runs makes this for a satisfying experience once you manage to pull out a victory. Try to slowplay your dungeon runs as it's better to analize what you do before you do it. 
The game, such as it is, require a solid amount of knowledge, and what I do is that I keep myself informed through official Wiki page about anything you can possibly need; from curios, dungeons, tactics, bosses etc.I bought the Ancestral edition just to experience the game in its entirety, it really keeps you craving for more and more.

[b]The term 'Lovecraftian' gets bandied arouund a lot these days but this is one of the few that touches on the sheer essence of Lovecraftian Horror. This games will twist even the noblest mindset into a cold, calculating fiend.[/b]

The game is a Rogue-lit dungeon crawler with a rather basic set up. YOu recruit heroes, send them into dungeons on mission and hope they survive. The missions and layouts of the dungeons are more or less randomized as are their contents. Death is permanent. And that will be counted as a mercy.

The unique mechanic of this game is the Stress (not sanity) meter, the afflictions/virtues, and quirks. Mental health is just as important as physical health and as your heroes areexposed to the terrible eldrich horros and abominations that make mockery of flesh and form, they will slowly but surely go insane.  Once a hero takes a certain amount of stress damage they will become afflicted by varuiouus conditions. This can have varying effects from causing erratic statuses, actions, and in somecases causing them to attack other heroes.

After missions your heroes will develop quirks. Some beneficial that ad bonuses, but most will be negative that make heroes weaker. The more missions a hero goes on the more experience and levels they gains but also the more of these quirks they pick up.  Stress and  these quirks can be treated of course, for a hefty fee.

Tough choices will have to be made.

One of the best things is that the devs do regullarly return to add new content. Teh most recent being the Butcher CIrcus which adds PVP.

i fucking hate this game, but i also kinda like it... i wouldnt recommend it if you're new to games with high amounts of intended difficulty, but if you're a masochist and like dungeon crawlers, this game might be a treat for you",1700921660,1700921660,True,1,0,0.497942358255386353,0,True,False,False

Additionally, it feels a bit grindy. All the dungeons have a pretty similar feel to them. And finally, the trinket management dance you have to do before each dungeon really grinded my gears.

There's a lot to like about this game: the graphics, the sound design, the satisfying gameplay loop. There's also a lot to dislike, most of which comes down to the RNG. I know this isn't a new complaint about DD by any means, but I really thought it wouldn't bother me, since I've played a lot of tactical turn-based games and roguelikes. Oh, past self, how naive you were.
The best incident to sum this whole thing up: on the easiest difficulty setting, in two not particularly challenging dungeons, I lost two grave robbers to bad RNG, back-to-back. Losing a unit in DD means losing hours of grinding and fine-tuning, not to mention the gold you've spent training that unit up. In the end it just feels like a waste of time. I understand that DD is meant to be challenging and stressful, but at a certain point it no longer seems worth the time and effort.

But when i did, it took me by surprise how visually stunning this game is. The lore, music and gameplay dont fall behind too, as someone already said in another comment, the first message that shows when u play is that u have to make the most of adverse situations, and i can assure u that those situations appear a lot. But honestly, thats something that makes this game a lot better, the feeling that your decisions really matter, when u have to choose if u want to take the chance of getting amazing loot with the risk of getting ur party wiped out.

I love the battle mechanics, the bosses look amazing and their battles encourage the player to learn their mechanics (stupid Wilbur lol) and think about the right party composition. Sometimes u get the enemies surprised and get a full wipe without getting any damage or sometimes u get ur party surprised and struggle to not get everyone dead or afflicted. The Stress mechanic sometimes is very hard to manage but it is possible, even in high difficulty dungeons, which btw are also amazing, every one of them with different types of enemies, which also have different types of mechanics and resistances that reward the player for building a good team for them.

Born from the minds of passionate people at Red Hook Studio and after going through a long development as well as an early access, which nobody has ever had gripes with in the past, Darkest Dungeon was finally released on January 2016. A 2D turn-based dark fantastic RPG which received lots of love and hate, renowned for its crushing difficulty, grim “lovecraftian” atmosphere, incredibly art style and otherwordly narrator. 

Your journey begins with two characters, a crusader and a highwayman who, after a carriage crash must make their way to the hamlet, home to tragedy and despair causrd by the Ancestor, which have inherited and must now try to salvage. From the get go the game will expose you to its combat system which, as the turn based etiquette suggests, consists of waiting for your turn to make a decision while your enemy patiently awaits that you make your mind. The same applies to you thereafter, and bis repetita. 

Although fairly simple to understand, Darkest Dungeon’s combat will take determination to conquer. Not because of the somewhat questionnable amount of damage which you can be dealt. Although you could think that. But because of all the random situations which you will have to struggle through. Welcome to the land of RNG where you will beg for mercy each time a character moves a toe into that stealthy spike trap you couldn’t disarm. 

The game mostly consists of themed dungeons where you explore long corridors filled, or not, with treasures traps and encounters, and rooms which can contain your quests’ goal as well as your downfall, or sometimes both. Your characters will have to be balanced in order to have the odds of survival. What I mean by that is that you will imperatively need to have a strategy in mind when putting together a team, unless your intention is to throw blood bags at your opponent and angrily stare them to death. Most of the time, your team can consist of a block of stone to serve as a target, one or two pesky dodgers which deal most of the damage, and a buffer or a healer, the latter being a better choice to be honest. Considering you have probably bought all the DLCs there are seventeen classes which you can choose from, if they happen to come by the hamlet. Each classes will have their own unique appearance and perks which gives them a very unique role. Their quality traits and afflictions which you can modify latter, as well as camping skills which are to be used inside the dungeon when your heroes need to rest, must be managed as to get the best out of everyone during every expedition. 

The combat itself, the basic punching and shooting executed by your meat sacks, centres around six stats which can vary depending on the class of your characters: Accuracy; Speed; Dodge; Damage; Protection and Critical Chance. I think most of these mechanics speak for themselves, damage does more damage, dodge dodges harder, and critical flips you over. What you must keep in mind is that all of these parameters are available for the enemy as well, meaning you can get a decent idea of how bad the situation can become when you will encounter a giant centaur crab which can tank 80% of the damage like a titanium sponge. 

The main mechanics you will have to take care of, aside from the obvious team composition and perk choice, are the inventory and stress mechanics. The inventory basically consists of your group's furniture’s which can help them survive in the dungeon, as well as the space available for treasures and trinkets. But the signature mechanic from Darkest Dungeon, which most people will certainly remember about, is the stress inflicted both on your character and yourself. Providing lots of insanity and loss of will to live when your best characters die from a heart attack. Simply put, each time a character gets hurt, interacts with a bad object, sees another member of the team getting hurt, or even simply walks down the corridor of life, will suffer from a certain amount of stress. Once the “stress” gauge is filled to one hundred, the character's resolve will be tested. And much like in real life, it hurts way more than you think. Your character gets a roll where they either suffer from an affliction or a blessing. But don’t count too much on the blessings being a thing as they tend to be extremely rare. Instead, pray for RNGesus to be kind enough not to put the worst afflictions on your characters when they get one, which means that they most of the time will get angry or depressed and are going to be less reliable as your adventure lingers. But don’t you think it ends here you silly brat, the metre hasn’t reached its maximum amount yet! When you get to an amount of two hundred your character will get a heart attack, which will drop their health to zero, leaving them very vulnerable. 

If you’ve made it past all the hurdles and succeeded in completing your quest, which will most of the time be exploration, fetch quest or kill the meany of the dungeon, congratulations, you made it back to the hamlet! Your characters will get some experience and crumble under newly acquired afflictions and/or positive traits. The hamlet itself serves as your headquarters, where you get to hire new heroes, treat the mental breakdown of your recently depressed employees and train them as well. All of these charming activities will of course come at a price, which you will have to comply with, until your exploration grants you enough trinkets to trade for lower inflation. Once you are finished dealing with that, do the dungeon bit a thousand times more in the various areas available and you can access the final dungeon. A realm best described as the pinnacle of “suck it” in enjoyment, with stupidly punishing outcomes if you come under-prepared, or an underwhelming experience if you’ve prepared a bit too much. 

Is the game hard? Yes, in many ways. Is it frustrating? I have to admit it got me on the verge of a mental breakdown a few times when it kept giving my enemies crit damage, and my heroes were all trying to kill themselves during the fight. But you have to understand that the, at times, almost unfair challenge is a big part of the appeal of Darkest Dungeon. It falls under the group of games which are fairly simple but also nebulous at times, and which will not hold your hand and choose to slap you instead. You can get very strategic about your playthrough and conquer the combat system, but it will take time and tears, and won’t make you invulnerable to a bad roll. 

Although I have not taken the time to mention, the art direction, music and sound design are all gorgeous and rub a sweet spot of mine. So much so that I would often come back to the game on a weekly basis just for the satisfaction of hearing those slashing, crushing, sounds or to look at my characters getting PTSD. Darkest Dungeon is a rough, painful and hopeless experience entirely worthy of your money, and whatever amount of time you are ready to invest into it. The community and Red Hook Studio have always made it a wonderful experience full of new content and kept it refreshing as far as today. And I’m sure this will keep going on and eventually repeat with Darkest Dungeon II: Mountain Edition.",1529747017,1700612418,True,25,4,0.767441868782043457,0,True,False,False

[b]... the ultimate frustration tolerance challenge![/b]


[h1]The game in a nutshell[/h1]

Darkest Dungeon is a heavy, turn-based gothic role-playing game with roguelike elements, focusing on the psychological effects of adventuring. Recruit and train a group of heroes and lead them through gloomy forests, ancient caves, infested ruins and more. In doing so, you'll not only have to confront the worst enemies, but also deal with stress, hunger, plagues, the omnipresent darkness and, above all, important decisions on which your group´s survival depends.

[h1]Visual style, gameplay and mechanics[/h1]

- Unique, dark hand-drawn quill-style graphics
- Turn-based combat against a variety of disgusting monsters
- The agony system! Deal with stress, paranoia, phobias, masochism, anxiety, delusion and many other tics that affect the game
- Camp to heal wounds or use various skills of your party
- Level up buildings, weapons and armory
- Send your exhausted, war-neurotic characters to the village tavern or monastery to recover from the stress and strain... or to the sanatorium for mental and spiritual recuperation
- Classic features of role-playing games and roguelikes - including a permadeath, procedurally generated dungeons, and therefore incredibly high replay value


[h1]Negative aspects[/h1]

Some might say, that the difficulty level and the grind (esp. in the late game) is too high, even at the ""easiest"" level. But imho it is exactly how it´s supposed to be - a challenge at the highest level!

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

This is one of those games that you either love or abysmally hate. The pressure is high, you constantly have to make decisions between plague or cholera, your characters will suffer, go insane, get unrestrained drunk to forget the horrors of the last dungeon, droolingly enter a monastery, die in horrible pain and also contract syphilis without having sex. Darkest Dungeon is like your narcissistic ex-partner... and you are the one with the co-dependency - a relationship that you know is not good for you at all, yet the toxic attraction is so strong that you can't resist the temptation. Highly recommended for part-time sociopaths, masochists, or just anyone looking for a damn good, hard as hell and extremely demanding game to sink their teeth into.",1658666012,1700491256,True,25,1,0.723797738552093506,2,True,False,False

It wasn't too bad at first, but turns out the game gets 'more difficult' as you progress by turning up the terrible game mechanics to an 11. Enemies start dodging ALL of your attacks, oneshotting or two shotting your entire party with critical hits back to back, the enemy always out speeds you later in the game and always goes first. Traditional elements of strategy you may see in other turn based rpgs becomes less and less important as you progress.

It feels absolutely helpless and there's seriously no fun in throwing your highest level heroes at certain dungeons over and over again and having them all die. You spent 15 hours and went through 10 dungeons to level up a fresh party to go after a higher level dungeon? LOL here comes some terrible rng to throw away all of your efforts. Hard games are fun when they feel fair, and you feel rewarded for overcoming the challenge. There's none of that here. Only a smidgen of relief when you finally get lucky and don't get screwed over by unlucky 'randomness'.

My gametime alone should say enough about how much i love this gem, yet it has problems. To be precise the same as literally any other rougelite dungeoncrawler or similar.

Some may be ok with that, i think it is just lazy as f... Pumping up numbers for enemies does nothing for the game but make it a drag. and sadly thats what happens here.

Nonetheless, i still can recommend the game, just skip the highest difficulty and save your nerves.

The ending left me feeling a bit unfulfilled. Not disappointed. It's like if I was eating at a buffet, and after every last crumb is swallowed, I'm not really full from it. Was I expecting something more grandiose for another rogue-like game, boasting a dark fantasy artstyle and setting? I'm going to touch on spoiler territory so here's that disclaimer. 

[u]Final thoughts[/u]

The game was enough to get a game completion, the lore was there and it had an interesting story to tell. DD is supposed to be a game that has high stakes and consequences. You suck up every failure and move on. I felt that at the end stretch the grind became the straw that broke the camel's back. Every delay made it hard to enjoy the game, and the end was just a ""finally"" to me instead of a gratifying ""momentary abatement."" I still don't want to give Red Hook the thumbs down, but I felt like the game's lore would have been better told as a comic book like Elric of Melnibone. I don't recommend this game for its stifled replayability value and mostly easy final boss (Vvulf was harder). 


[h1]End game analysis[/h1]
[spoiler]
The Darkest Dungeon quest is divided into several levels: clear each level and you will be able to challenge the final quest. The first one I recall gives you three darkest torches, trinkets that greatly reduce damage received on party members. It ended with a solo houndmaster dealing the last bit of damage, outmatched in a close call. Once the first stage is clear, you'll recognize that the party members you took who survived the encounter will have a torch next to their name. The torch means that this unit cannot be deployed into the next stage of the Darkest Dungeon. I like this feature because it means you have to adapt, but it meant spending several weeks gaining a roster of resolve six units in my playthrough because I was running thin. At the end game, I was very impatient, often spending weeks doing the same ""explore 90% of rooms"" quests on short or medium length dungeons to make time go by the quickest. Why would I want to take on a long dungeon when I was eagerly trying to finish the game? That's where I feel where DD took a giant hit to replayability. I'm not even sure I want to play the sequel, considering this. I did try to see if there was a new game plus after the game, and there is one called Bloodmoon, the hardest difficulty. It seemed interesting because there's a death counter that is used that dictates a game over, if you lose 16 party members you lose the campaign. I didn't want to sink another 300 hours into DD so I've decided against it.

The second stage of the Darkest Dungeon (don't quote me, I don't remember the chronology) is a tedious stage. In this stage the map is not revealed from the start, and the rooms procedurally reveal where the paths lead or intersect. You can camp twice. It lost a team the first time because the enemies were crit hitting frequently, but the torches were necessary. This is just RNG and not what I mean by tedious. The tedious factor in this level is that there's a creature that uses teleport [i]mid-fight[/i] and when that happens, your party gets teleported to a random location that you've explored in the dungeon. The creatures in that room are left with whatever hp your party dealt, so your efforts aren't nullified with a teleport. This paired with the unpredictability of battles you come across with the unrevealed trails makes for an artificially inflated experience. [strike]Cue the flashbacks to the Avatar encounter in XCOM 2.[/strike] All of this time is spent for a simple ""find the thing"" objective. When you find the curio, you can interact with it and that opens the portal to the last Darkest Dungeon stage.

The final Darkest Dungeon level is a direct path to the boss room. You have to listen to the Ancestor goad you into the point of no return. That ""crowning thing"" aforementioned by the Ancestor is laid bare before you. Gaze at the gruesome splendor of the - [b]Ancestor?[/b] Yes, the boss is the Ancestor, and I was astonished at this, but it made sense now how his voice echoes to you throughout the Hamlet after his suicide. The Ancestor transcended into an incorporeal being after all the atrocities he's conspired in. The first Ancestor has 5/5 hp, but he's immune to damage. He spawns different visages of himself, and you take your turns damaging them, and the key to damaging the Ancestor in this phase is killing the visages that have the eldritch skin. This phase is not so harmful, multi-target DOTs handle it well. The ancestor heals the visages, but it's not too much of a hassle. After killing the first Ancestor wave, the Ancestor morphs: same appearance but 200 hp threshold. He mostly did a high stress move or damage. This part isn't what killed my team on the first go. After annihilating the Ancestor boss form, he turns into the Heart, it had 250 hp. The heart at the beginning stays dormant, and hitting it heals but blights. I didn't have the provisions to deal with this and my party couldn't destroy the Heart when it transformed, and I was forced to pass when I was left with a solo musketeer. 

As far as the Heart's appearance goes, it looked like a malignant tumor with a bunch of beady pupils on its flesh. It has a large crack on the side of it, and a face that looks almost like a mutated peacock-humanoid with a spiked fan growing out of its head. It looked gross, more unsettling than mortifying. IMO it ranks far less on the grotesque scale than some other bosses from the other dungeons. [b][i]This[/i] is what the Ancestor ""could not look, yet could not look away"" from?[/b] 

The second time I deployed a different team composition, so I would have three units that could attack no matter their positioning: a houndmaster, an abomination, the resurrected warrior mentioned before, and a vestal. I equipped the three darkest torches, three martyrs seals and the ancestral ring. I was deliberating if I should even bring the MAA because he was at 70 stress in the Hamlet. Again, I was in a haste to beat the game, and brought him for better or worse. It was a stroke of luck that he got virtued in the Ancestor phase, and his crits were making him an MVP. Things were going smoothly, no one reached 100 stress. The Heart appeared again and I had the unthinkable happen: [b]I was forced to kill two of my units.[/b] The Heart took a turn to have me strike my units. I thought this was some kind of new debuff. No. Deathblow. Not deathblow chance [i]because screw your martyr seal.[/i] I clicked on MAA and he was killed outright. The final battle was a triumph, the blight and bleed stacked enough to shred the hp bar enough so that the lonely vestal blinked and it was over. 

The ending animated sequence was an affirmation of what I already knew, much less of a subversion of expectations. The Heart can't be killed; it's a rogue like. I know that the end isn't really the end. I suppose this was the way the story had to be concluded. [b][i]The broken place you found is left broken, no matter how much the buildings are renovated, or how pretty they look in the brightest sunlight.[/i] Your role in this story is the listener and observer, not the rising hero.

This is a fun game if you actively try to win in your strategy, if you don't play with team comp, rng mitigation, long term in mind, you'll feel like your getting fucked by rng and there was nothing you could do, but you could have done something you just should have done something different an hour ago.
I'm still not very good at the game and I don't think rng in DD is good general, look at slay the spire it doesn't need rng 6-13 damage, and accuracy and resist yada yada, these things just feel like a chance to get scammed, you can scam your opponent as well but I don't think it evens out in terms of enjoyment. People proficient at will tell you: you can mitigate the rng, and they are correct, staying at 100 light all the time totally changes the game but I'm still not convinced it's great design as rng limits tactics though I can see the benefits as well for tone.
I think the games main failure is with communication and it doesn't lend well to playing casually, if you watch a youtube video about DD there seems to be an assumption that when fighting a boss you would know what the boss does before hand, why would you know this? Would you even want to know this? I'm not trying to go on the wiki and find the meta strategy for everything in the game that's never fun in a single player experience, I don't think there's anything wrong with an initial lack of info but why not have the player go fight the boss, and if the win or have and survivors then you could have glossary entry for the info available in that fight, that would add some interesting gameplay that could reduce wiki use and reinforce the themes of the game as players might want to send in bad employees to scout with little concern for their lives. Some other things I'd like are in the description of areas showing the common enemy types yada yada... I don't really want to play a game with a guide or keep a notebook, this is what I mean by playing casually. But overall I'm having a lot of fun with the game since giving it a second chance my tips for any others who want to try the game for a 2nd time is:
Keep torch at 100-76 (you can drop it down at the end of fights or save all the curios until the end and loot them in the dark but watch out for wandering monsters)
acc > dmg
kill > stun > dmg
spd is great
kill the stress casters in the back line first, heal is all restore at the end of the mission, stress limits you game play and spirals way harder.
dots are stronger than you think, delayed damage doesn't feel great for action economy but if you don't expect to kill an enemy before they acted then you will get 2 damage procs which generally makes dots very high damage plus it gets over prot.
Old Review:
This game is incredibly annoying. There are just too many chances to get fucked by rng, basically the entire experience is slowly trudging along waiting to get fucked by something completely out of your control. I'm sure you could get good at the game but why would you bother...

*SPOILERS* You find yourself before the final boss, as prepared as you can be. Your Man-At-Arms has given two strong camp buffs to allow you to dodge attacks and deal more damage, and your Houndmaster has given reduced Stress, the mechanic that acts as a strange and flavourful second ""health bar"". You battle said boss, with all of your might, you come down to the last moments, all of your heroes but two are dead, and you have a full party wipe on your hands. The boss is low, but how could you bring down a quarter of its HP with only two heroes left? You are ready to fall, when you land a luck critical hit with your Leper, and follow up with a solid strike from your Houndmaster to defeat the boss. The relief as you finish that boss is worth all of the stress you received, both in, and outside of the game.

I highly recommend it for those that enjoy a mild grind with amazing gameplay, with a steep learning curve that really rewards planning your mission ahead of time, actually learning the various intricacies of the game, and mastering the game through practice and reading.

The hand-drawn art style is not only visually stunning but also contributes to the game's immersive atmosphere. As you lead a roster of adventurers through treacherous dungeons, the stress mechanic brilliantly mirrors the psychological toll of their harrowing experiences, making every decision feel weighty and meaningful.

The strategic depth of party composition, skill management, and resource allocation keeps you on your toes, ensuring that each dungeon dive is a unique challenge. The unforgiving nature of the game, coupled with the ever-looming threat of permadeath, adds a level of tension that's both exhilarating and nerve-wracking.

- You finished your mission with 0 stress on anyone? Nice, here take a bunch of negative quirks and diseases out of nowhere;
- You put a mark on yourself hoping that enemies will attack this character? Nah, they will decide to attack random targets anyway:
- You boosted your dodge to ridiculous numbers like 140 dodge? It's fine, but you will be hit anyway. Probably it is unfair talking about it, because the game doesn't show us accuracy of enemies in percentage, but I suppose that here is a fixed chance to land a hit in any case;
- You also can crit almost every hit even if your crit chance is lower than 20%, same goes for enemies. And you can easily do misses the entire round even if the chance to hit is more than 80%. This game, similar to XCOM, often makes you doubt what real chances actually are. Same goes with Death Blow resist, where 87% (cap) is nothing. and where you can send 0 level rookies to their death, and they just won't die for few rounds.
- The dice roll that is added to character's speed (1d8, I believe) is just straight RNG trash, it makes you to not care about speed stat at all, because it doesn't matter. 

Another annoying thing is the Shrieker. If you will lose randomly 1 hero with ancestor relic, without possibility to recover it, it will be not lost, but insteat stolen by Shrieker. And you can't take it back until it steals 8 of your trinkets (which is silly), so you HAVE to give 6 trash trinkets to rookies and send them to death in order to trigger Shrieker event. Otherwise you will just finish the game and still will never regain your items. It is tedious to say the least. Before Shrieker was implemented, you just lost those items and had to obtain it in another long 5 lvl dungeon.
Also, there is a smaller bug where the number of week in graveyard will be always incorrect if the person dies after you already was in Farmstead at least once. Annoying, but it wasn't fixed in years, and seems like players don't care either.

As an old player in this game, I also miss times when Jester wasn't so finale-oriented, where his solo was actually useful, where Grave Robber didn't have useless stealth and instead she had her dodge boost with ONE step back, where Leper/Plague Doctor/Man-at-Arms didn't have one-time-use skills and could stack them... Also, in Farmstead one-time skills don't work properly, because game thinks that the entire bar at the top - is one battle, so you end up never using them.

As for Endless harvest... Man, I feel so many missed opportunities. It could be something similar to Torghast from WoW, or Simulated Universe from Star Rail... Or it could be even difficulty that increases itself with every iteration, like in Diablo 3. But instead there is just a path to Sleeper, and after that there is nothing interesting at all, you just can leave. And if at the start you still could try to go as far as you can, for curiosity, then they implemented ""endgame conditions"", which killed this potentially great game mode completely.",1699614606,1699615258,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Found the game enjoyable and hard, but not overwhelmingly difficult that a defeatist attitude set in and I didn't want to play anymore.  I had read about the difficulty and random dice being what many others disliked about the game, but I didn't have that experience.  For me, it seemed that if you leveled your characters and played smart, it was usually not too hard to overcome what obstacles were in your path.  The few times it was quite rough were the best actually, in that victory felt very satisfying.  

There are a diverse group of 'heroes' that you can have in your party, with a max of 4 going into a dungeon.  This gives you a lot of room to experiment with the different pros and cons of each hero, and find out who works best together in a group.  

I have beaten the game several times now, the last on the hardest difficulty.  While there were times things went south, mostly it proceeded smoothly as long as I had the right team with good trinkets going in there.

Fun: 6/10 - occasionally straddles the line between fun and infuriating

Gameplay: 7/10 - gameplay is pretty good, a nice throwback to old turn-by-turns and dungeon crawlers

Graphics: 10/10 - haunting and gorgeous artwork

Extras: 9/10 - good DLCs that adds a multiplayer mode and new storylines

Playtime: 7/10 - long playtime, but the difficulty and grindiness can lead to frequent rage-quits

Darkest Dungeon is my favourite game to vehemently despise. The base game is incredible, the DLCs are incredible, John Wayne's narration, the art direction, the Lovecraftian themes, the modding scene; it's all incredible. But it's punishing. Really, really punishing, regardless of skill level. You'll lose heroes more if you're not cautious, of course, but sometimes you'll lose your best Crusader on his first death save after four crits in a row.

If a hero dies, they don't come back, and training a replacement takes gold and hours of work. I find saying 'use the wiki' is an excuse for poor game design, but... well, use the wiki. The retraining aspect is poor game design. Darkest Companion is a great tool, install some QoL mods like Faster Combat and Faster Walking, and research party comps in advance. Here are some I use to start you off:

Ruins: Plague Doctor / Vestal / Crusader / Crusader
Warrens: Houndmaster / Jester / Occultist / Hellion
Weald: Houndmaster / Occultist / Highwayman / Bounty Hunter (or Crusader)
Cove: Plague Doctor / Jester / Occultist / Hellion

Level in the Ruins since it's safest, use Highwayman if you're missing a hero, and buy the DLCs if you can. Respect the game, don't try modded content until you've beaten the game once, and have fun.",1650470663,1699052574,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The gameplay itself is addictive as hell (I'm 20 hrs in, and I literally can't stop playing). It has interesting combat mechanics, and a huge amount of different character classes to choose from. The game encourages you to try different party combinations as quite often your characters become stressed out and need to take time off, forcing you to try other character combinations instead, so it keeps the combat interesting. There's no SAVE feature here either, so if one of your characters die, they are dead for good, which really adds to the tension when you are exploring the dungeons. When it comes to investigating objects in the dungeons, like opening treasure chests or looking inside a bag, there's a risk that investigating something might harm you, but it could potentially benefit you too.

You will experience loss that will set you back a couple hours and then some.  The heroes come in by the caravan load and many enter the dungeons never to return.  There are some nasty surprises in store in the early game, and nastier still in the late game that will have you pulling your hair out.  RNG-sus will drive your party to madness and mutilate them one by one.  It's hard.

You can get good, though.  Your growing roster of varied heroes will improve in skill and through careful management of their afflictions and quirks.  Trinkets and baubles in careful measure will pull the party through the tightest situations.  Your decisions in supplying the party will make or break each foray into the darkest dungeons, and you will learn to mitigate the losses.

Holy shoot, it looks good.  All the grisly beasts, fungal growths, bloodthirsty marauders, shadowy shamblers, and spooky scary skeletons are illustrated and animated just right in a sharp comic book style that just oozes with that eldritch charm one might seek out on the brink of madness.  Our heroes look just as good whether they're losing their minds or experiencing a sudden pulse of courage, and in your respective rage or relief you'll feel those swings personally.  The level design visually fits right in, against the backdrop of a rundown hamlet to serve as your upgrade-able base camp, as your parties delve into a handful of impressively oppressive areas, all beautifully rendered, each with their own slew of specialized hordes.

Story's got some good spook to it.  Check out the trailers for a taste, though I would have liked to see some more storied animation within the game, it's still a great tale, mostly delivered through our ancestor's narration during the occasional loading screen.

I won't write what others already have written about the game - instead I'll write my last dungeon venture as it ended the game for me. On good terms.

Well, it's been the one of the greatest 37 hours of my life. Haven't had so much fun since the last winter.

Man, what a game! I really loved leveling up characters, finding optimal builds and parties for specific bosses. Pity though that I've lost my strongest party on the first Darkest Dungeon.

I've had Vestal, Bounty Hunter, Occultist and Crusader. Made a camp as soon as I got scared -- did not know how long till the boss so I decided not to waste the firewood. I think it's pretty unfortunate that there's no way of telling how long before the boss.

Got up to the boss and decided to get rid of the Cultist first. I killed it, but did not remove the corpse - I thought that way the boss could not send reinforcements. But it did! And I thought -- alright, gotta kill the corpse this time.

And...it got another cultist. So here I am -- my four AFFLICTED heroes, wasted amount of damage around 60 or 80 dmg; and I lost bounty hunter with crusader - no deal damagers anymore.

What do you think? The boss got exactly HP left enough for the two cultists that I've killed. Man...I feel embarassed, empty and at the same time respected. That I COULD finish the fight and emerge victorious, but from what I've read - this party could not enter the dungeon anymore? Looks like either way I'd need to come up with a better lineup and this I can't do.

Anyway, I decide to leave the fight and then the quest. Prompt tells me that I'd lose a random hero - I'm like ""Oh come on. There's already two dead! Crap."" So I went back to the boss that GOT FULL HP (man I wish my party could heal so fast and not in a fight), and let the rest face the death.

Now they all rest in peace with all the gold, the hours, the relics I spent on them. And I think that's ""finished game"" for me alright. I've got the lesson, I've enjoyed the game. And I've got neither the desire nor the time to grind another party of four exactly the same 6 leveled heroes with good relics.

Thank you, Darkest Dungeon, for the great time. But I won't be ""finishing"" you as in ""Complete the game"". Instead I'm finished with you, but I have only love. It's like breakup? Haha. I let you go and will save other heroes.

Maybe someday I'll pick it up again and retry the dungeon with another party, but we'll see.

UPD: Scratch all that vanilla femmey nonsense above. I finished the game with mods for +9000 damage a little time after the review. Got disappointed in the game. Felt that it all was for naught. But later I played a lot of roguelikes and roguelites and this game shines in a new light after that.

As a rogue(like | lite) this is a great game. Playing my second playthrough and except for Necromancer Lord I got all of the bosses on the first try. First Darkest Dungeon quest required a retry resulting in a two heroes loss but there was a lot of reinforcements coming through. After 60 hours I got great pleasure of the game, gaining all of the Boss Trinkets and Ancestor Trinkets. Completing the game. It all feels great. A great journey, a great experience.

This game is not GRINDY. Because it has style, flair, great experience of farming heroes and loot. The emotions of the fights are unique every time. Take pleasure in playing the game - it will reward you.

PS. Second playthrought was with wiki as to avoid unnecessary takes. Might count as a cheat somewhat and hijacking the grindy nature of the game, but in my case it only simplified things, not overriden them. I still got my share of discovery, experimentation and farming. Not everything in wiki/guides is true, mind you. You still can get pointers from wiki but apply your personal touch as I did.",1636850551,1698500153,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

Every ""sortie"" in to the dungeon allows you to bring 4 party members. Do you bring the tank? the melee dps? The healer? The ranged dps? The mage? The other kind of mage (yes, there's a few different types that I'm grouping in to the ""mage"" category for this game)? Your experienced members? The less experienced? 
Do you put the dps in front, or the tank? What if that's not their favorite spot? What if they only have the skills unlocked for the middle 2 spots?! WHAT IF I MAKE A MISTAKE?!?!
Well...now that I've spent 15 minutes arguing with myself over the perfect party setup, now I decide on the supplies...
Should I buy antivenom? How many torches should I bring? I only need 4 units of food because they'll probably only want to eat once on the expedition...or should I spend the money on the extra 4 just in case? AHHHHH
Ok, now we're in the dungeon...as easy as encountering enemies, killing them, and escaping with the loot. Nope! The choices don't stop there! Especially with the larger dungeons.
Generally, about a few rooms in, some common decisions are...
Do I let the torch flicker out a little bit before relighting it? Sure, I'll be more likely to die but that sweet sweet loot though...Do I play it safe and keep the torch as bright as possible? Do I attack the enemies in front that are doling out all kinds of damage? Do I attack the ones in back because they're stressing out my characters and causing them to go mentally insane? Screw it, do I just run now and get back home with the loot I have? Do I push my characters farther in hopes for better loot? What..the heck is this? A statue, do I touch it? Crap, I touched it and made a boss appear...time to gtfo!
Ok, out of the dungeon and I'm about 5k gold richer. Just enough to upgrade 1 character's skills and MAYBE one of their pieces of equipment. ORRRRR...upgrade a building. Which do I choose? 
The choices and decision making are endless. And sometimes the consequences are BRUTAL. 
Worth a buy, or not? I'd choose to buy on this one. If you get it...don't get too attached to that character you're starting to favor.",1501451622,1698401832,True,7,0,0.544715344905853271,0,True,False,False

The difficulty curve on the experience can be rough at the start and smooths out over the course of many estates. Each character feels unique in its archetype and sub-archetypes that form from the combination of various skill, other champions, and trinkets that you discover over the course of a run. Risk often translates to a tangible reward in the dungeons where ""push you luck"" can line your pockets with gold, trinkets, or crests, or you may wind up with four fresh graves in the graveyard. After a few estates, it can be a wholly different experience upping the difficult from Radiant to Darkest to Stygian (Bloodmoon with the Crimson Court DLC). You may have to re-imagine how you fought previous encounters when life limits, darkness increases. or a time limit are imposed. All of these factors helped shape Darkest Dungeon into a memorable experience that I come back to every year.

In addition to the base game, I suggest grabbing [in order] The Shield Breaker, Color of Madness, and Crimson Court DLCs. Shield breaker adds an incredibly useful and powerful companion that has a unique interaction in the dungeons. Color of Madness adds an optional 'endless' dungeon grind that pauses the normal time progression while keeping some of the risks. And finally Crimson Court adds in the powerful Flagellant companion, multi level mega dungeon encounters, and a ramping difficulty to the base game with bloodsucker infestations and the withering crimson curse itself. I think this order provides the best evolving gameplay experience in difficulty; however, this is not the order of my personal enjoyment. Above and beyond I personally enjoy the difficulty added by the Crimson Court the most. However it is very much not new player friendly. If engaged with too early you can feel overwhelmed with wasting champions and the punishing mega dungeons. And if engaged with too late you will miss out on incredibly powerful trinkets and be bogged down by repeated stress relieving activity reduction events in town. Color of Madness feels lacking to me, but I enjoy the trinkets before I get to the mid game. And the Shield Breaker can sometimes feel borderline busted near the mid game to late game. 

You will lose. The game will feel like it is picking on you. You will get overwhelmed. This gameplay style isn't for everyone and its okay if its not for you. But if you like this kind of challenge I promise that when its all said and done and the last champions head into the final layer of the Darkest Dungeon, you will feel rewarded.",1698267191,1698267191,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The aesthetics and artstyle alone are nearly enough to carry it for me, and it so sincerely captures the feeling of the games opening statement. Darkest Dungeon is a game about making the best out of bad situations. You will almost always be fighting an uphill battle, combat is stacked completely against you and you're likely to get completely screwed over by something you couldn't account for. 

This might sound absolutely terrible, and undoubtedly for some people this will be a frustrating and completely unfair game that is only hailed as ""Difficult"" because of the RNG involved in combat, etc. This is what I love about the game though.

It's total die roll if they do or not. Entire teams will be wiped in the first dungeon by the weakest enemies in the game on a regular basis, you will be starting over repeatedly. Doesn't matter if you get a few levels or equipment upgrades, characters will just die, and things will be completely out of your control, which lead to me not giving a fck about any of my characters, or the game as a whole, and falling asleep in the middle of battles because of this.

A near masterpiece of eldritch, Gothic horror. Dread and hopelessness without the generic horror genre cheese. Wayne June, you are a god, ‘nuf said. Expect several runs figuring out how to build good parties, and that thrill of victory when you win…on easy. Strategy and planning will carry you a long way, but the excessive randomness is why I need to put this game down now for good. It was a great run though.
[hr][/hr]
I hate to start off by calling [i]Darkest Dungeon[/i] a wonderful thematic experience because that [i]usually[/i] implies other elements are mediocre at best. [i]Darkest Dungeon[/i] is a near masterpiece because it is a great game that is [b]also[/b] deeply entrenched in Gothic horror.   It’s dark, moody, filled with your nightmares…and yet never relies on gore or cheesy jump scares to make you feel hopeless, desperate, and out of your depth. Surely this must be a full immersion VR, right? Nope…side-scrolling exploration with turn-based combat and town management. The thematic elements are simply [b]*Chef’s Kiss*[/b].

Wayne June as the Narrator also needs a special shoutout. He is the *[i][b]perfect[/b][/i]* voice to set the game’s mood. The Narrator is the only voice in the game and he is your dead ancestor, heralds your accomplishments and failures, and even narrates combat. Despite being the only voice in the game, playing for over 200 h, and having only 3-ish dozen routine lines…I will literally [b]never[/b] tire of hearing Wayne June shout [i]“Executed with impunity!”[/i].

Gameplay is overall good, but very hard…at first. Be prepared to lose several games just figuring out the system. But this is eldritch, Gothic horror set in an ironman style roguelike game. If you are getting into the setting, it wouldn’t be right if you beat the game on the first go…or second…or fifth. Also, you have to know when, and be willing, to abandon the dungeon because things just went really badly. And you will feel that loss, because you won’t come back with the resources to recover…much less make any improvements.

I put 40 h into the game before I had figured enough out to take my first real crack at it. Even then, I was still missing some key pieces. There are lots of ways to build fun and very effective adventuring parties. Once you understand how all the pieces come together, the roles your different party members can take on, the game becomes…not easy, but winnable.  

You are constantly trying to make the best of a bad situation. Heroes are frequently stressed to the edge of insanity, and you still have to put together an effective roster for the next dungeon. After you pay to give your heroes some much needed downtime (they can’t adventure), you have to make hard decisions about what to do with the little remaining gold. Buy one hero better armor? Upgrade a few skills? Make future healing cheaper? I love it.

[i]Darkest Dungeon[/i] isn’t perfect. There are a handful of minor gripes about mechanics I don’t like. Ambush, for example. If you get ambushed, it’s super bad…especially when you are still learning, avoid it [b]at all costs![/b] Then when you ambush baddies you go first, which seems good…but then they get 2 turns in a row. To me, that is a penalty. I would rather manage spread out damage versus spending the rest of the fight recovering from getting the ever-living shit kicked out of me (ambush fights frequently take [i]longer[/i] than regular fights because of this).

The game also indexes [b]very[/b] heavily into randomness…and virtually everything in the game has a random element. Want a Jester so you can reduce dungeon stress? You might not get one for 6…12…20 weeks (week = game turn, one dungeon per week). Need your Crusader to come back from the bar for the next run because he’s your only tank? Too bad…no telling when he will get back from his bender. Randomness is what ends up being [i]Darkest Dungeon’s[/i] Achilles’s heel, and prevents me from putting it in my top tier of games.

Once you are an expert or master of the game, you figure out how to cope with the randomness. Mostly by making sure the worst situation is still within the capability of your party. And if you chose to take a risky run into a high-level dungeon, you do it knowing that you already have the resources to recover. At this point I can guarantee a finish on Darkest difficulty run within a reasonable time frame, and without much angst or hand wringing…and because of that the game has lost a bit of magic for me.

And this is where the biggest problem comes in.  To increase the difficulty, you not only get tougher dungeons, but you get a limited number of deaths (12) and game weeks (86).  This is bad because the randomness might prevent you from getting the things you need to succeed. I went 10 weeks without getting a healer in my recruitment tent. Plus, the final dungeons become so hard that a single crit on the wrong guy will one-shot them. There are builds that help negate this…but that relies on getting the right trinkets to drop….  In the end, you might spend all your time and you literally cannot win, even with the right builds and playstyle.  That’s ok for a game that is 2-3 hours a run…not 20-30.

Despite how much I do like this game, I have to set it down now forever. The lower difficulties no longer feel like [i]Darkest Dungeon[/i], and the higher difficulties rely too much on randomness for the win/loss.

This game is well known for the permanent death mechanic. Early on and in the midgame, this is a fantastic mechanic that really punishes poor play while still giving the player plenty of opportunities to recover from their mistakes.

Later in the game, though... If you loses a level 5 or 6 hero, you are looking at literal hours of grinding just to get back to where you were. It isn't interesting. It isn't fun. It doesn't create unique situations. It wastes the player's time with mindless grinding. By this point, you have most of the best trinkets, have seen almost every boss, and are just trying to finish up the game. Being forced to spend hours grinding for levels is not a fun mechanic, and the game does nothing to make leveling any faster.

If you have tons of time on your hands, maybe this isn't such a terrible thing. Though, if you have that much time, play something more engaging and interesting.

I want to love this game, but I just can't bring myself to finish it after losing a few max level characters to a combination of poor play on my part and an absurd amount of critical hits. Level grinding is an outdated mechanic that ruins the endgame of Darkest Dungeon.",1696571718,1696720006,False,57,11,0.66553199291229248,0,True,False,False

As the (really good) voice narrator in the game occasionally says, ""Overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer"" 

That aside, the modding community is also great - base game has a good selection of classes (I'm guessing something like 15?), nearly all of them viable. With mods, even excluding the... questionable mods and being selective with classes that are a fairly close fit to the theme/balancing of the original, I'm currently sitting at over 100 classes.

Darkest Dungeon doesn’t sugarcoat this; however, I don’t feel like Darkest Dungeon completely hits the mark, nor is it entirely honest. The biggest issue with getting into Darkest Dungeon isn’t the ‘difficulty’, which is really just excessive RNG, but how much the game relishes in wasting your time. Whether it’s crawling back through 7 rooms/halls of a dungeon you already explored cause you picked the wrong fork in a path, wasting turns in combat chewing through corpses ‘cause none of your characters can attack the remaining enemies, or wasting turns re-arranging characters ‘cause they don’t have abilities to dynamically re-arrange, or needing to wait for the stage coach to bring you a new healer after the one you’d almost got to max level died to a ridiculous cascade of RNG you had no opportunity to react to, or worse yet, having your entire party wipe and having to start grinding new ones up from square one. It’s Roguelite, so a degree of repetition should be expected, but the scale to which you have to repeat things, whether over the course of the entire game, or even in a single dungeon, and the slow pace at which the game runs to ‘build atmosphere’, is a painful combination. Not masochistic, ‘oh this requires a grand strategy’, not masochistic, ‘oh this requires razor sharp reflexes’, not even masochistic ‘oh I made a mistake and now I’m set back for it’, it’s masochistic because once you feel like your time is being wasted all immersion is gone and all that’s left is frustration… and yet I played over a hundred hours regardless, thinking back on my time with it I fondly remember the striking visuals, and dismal setting, and I do recommend the game, all because my time wasting gripes can be mitigated enough by workshop mods that increase the speed of dungeon movement and combat animations, among other things. Darkest Dungeon’s community has supported the game well, and I honestly think if you’re going to play it, you need at least the move and combat speed up mods to make it playable, but if that’s not to your satisfaction, there’s a world of mods from additional variety in graphics, to new character classes, and there’s even an overhaul mod that has its own store page, plenty to tailor the experience to your preferences.",1696677176,1696677176,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The only way you can complete dungeons after a while is by pushing through with all four members having an affliction, then you have to spend almost all the money you earned fixing them up, so in the meantime you have to use level 0s right off the stagecoach who either die or get so stressed out you have to cure their afflictions as well, so you're now in the hole again, spending all the money you just earned. You can't ever afford to upgrade anything because all your money is going into fixing everyone up from the last dungeon. By the time you get some level 2s and send them to a harder dungeon, you get more money but have to spend more fixing them all up again.

BUT, the UI is rough, and the random generation is sooo flawed. Perfect example: it takes forever to rank up, upgrade, curate quirks, supply, and develop one character, let alone the 10, or 20, or 30 needed to win. And you can have a character INSTANTLY killed on the first room, or last room by simply: every enemy goes first, strikes your unit, causes bleed, or blight, and you get knocked into a ""Deaths Door"" status, and then before any unit can heal or return fire - boom perma death. This happens on all difficulties, and really doesn't matter how much you prepare. The game tells you heroes will die. That's fine. But to spend so much time, effort, planning, items, upgrades, to have a unit wiped that way nearly ruins the experience. I've uninstalled and ignored this game for months because of it, and keep swapping reviews. 

ULTIMATELY, I would recommend this game, on Radiant difficulty. But know that it's got some critical flaws. And it's not like FTL, where you can re-load, or bounce back easy. 

ALSO, the DLC's are absolute garbage. I've done entire run-through's where some units simply don't spawn as an option. So you pay for a unit, and never get to play that unit. The Farmstead is a pointless grind that wears down your units with very little reward. And the PVP one is atrocious, and had hundreds of bad reviews lowering this games status.

Addendum:
I could not really get into this game until I accepted what it states in the opening scene. Heroes will die, quests will fail. The one constant is your hamlet, from which diligent upgrades will make those losses irrelevant. Utilize the idle stress reduction between weeks, constantly bring fresh recruits, and send them in screaming with minimal supplies. Don't worry about letting broken heroes go.

Upgrading the stagecoach to supply level 4 heroes will allow you to quickly fill your roster with max level characters, and losing them doesn't feel quite so bad. Level 4 heroes come with weapons, armor, and skills already upgraded, saving thousands in gold. I would not waste your resources on upgrades or stress reduction until you have them. Apart from that, tons of content to explore and conquer, and a free mod that essentially feels like a perfect sequel to the base game. I am nearing 200 hours between the two, and will likely hit 300 before completing The Black Reliquary mod and my Bloodmoon save. What a game!",1693553081,1694375342,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Darkest Dungeon is a game of meaningful challenge that is thought out in every aspect, no matter how small. The creative talent of Chris Bourassa and the coding prowess of Tyler Sigman, coupled with the great skill on display from all those at Red Hook, have turned what was once a small twist on power fantasy into a cult classic of turn-based cosmic horror. It's a true b*stard of a game, perfect for both aspiring and professional masochists, and it'll keep you reeled in from start to finish.

1. Amazing selection of heroes with great abilities focused around certain party compositions

2. Ancestors narrations pull you into an incredibly atmospheric world of certain horror and mind numbing insanity

3. DLC is so much fun and so well done, easy to get into and hard to master

4. Turn based combat revolving around dice rolls, much like dungeons and dragons or other roll 20 games with a unique stress mechanic 

5. Artwork and Soundtrack are beautiful, dark and horrifically interesting. 

6. PVP mode for those willing to endure the pain for personal glory (The Butcher's Circus)

7. Large selection of skills and trinkets allow cool variations of the same hero (minus Vestal, she's stuck healing)

8. The poor miller, thrice a victim. The seasons took his livelihood, I took his land. And now, uncountable years later, the comet has taken his humanity. My only regret is I did not live to see that shoddy mill smashed to pieces by the miraculous bounty I reaped from beyond the void.. (The Endless Harvest)

                                                                   --Cons--
1. Insanely difficult, increasingly more punishing as you progress the story line

2. The Butchers Circus PVP mode is heavily RNG reliant and many of the best trinkets are locked behind leveling making your first games completely miserable

3. RNG can wipe you incredibly fast, especially in the final dungeon. Overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer..

It's turn based dungeon crawling at its finest. The gameplay will demand you make do with whatever you have or fail. Sometimes, do all that and you still fail. Plan around the unknown, plan for what you do know, and press on to riches or ruin. All of the classes feel useful in spite of some definite stand outs. They also all feel fun to play. The sound design is top notch. The music choreographs foreboding, but mostly safe havens, tense treks through threatening hallways, uneasy firelit reprieves, and desperate battles. The stand out feature of the game's audio is the inclusion of the narrator, Wayne June, who brings flavor and injects some meaning in all that you do, filling in the blanks where the game might leave empty spaces or undefined ideas. The art direction and design is an endearing marriage of pop up picture books while also having a dark fantastical edge that makes it visually memorable and enjoyable to look at.

[b]Darkest Dungeon[/b] is a mix of a turn based RPG and strategy game in which we use 4-man group of mercenaries to explore randomly generated locations, gather treasures and fight with various types of enemies – bandits, skeletons and other kinds of abominations. Before we move into the dungeon there are a few decisions we have to make – not only which heroes we send to explore dangerous places (there are 18 different classes) but also pick their equipment (both individual accessories, increasing their fighting capabilities and utility items such as torches, food and medicine). Nonetheless planning doesn’t end after that – during fights we have to rethink every move at least twice since death of a hero is final and irreversible.

Like I said, gameplay is divided into few parts: managing Hamlet which is main hub where player recruits heroes and upgrade their equipment, exploring deadly locations like ruins or warrens in classic dungeon-crawler style and finally turn-based combat. Combat during which we have to use our protagonists as effective as possible since battles can be hard, especially because of RNG, which have huge impact on gameplay. Sometimes people describe Darkest Dungeon as [i]turn based Dark Souls[/i] but I do not agree with that. In soulslike games if you die it is because you made a mistake (most of the times). But in DD if RNGesus says you have to lose, you are going to lose. Sure, you can minimize the damage by playing really well and thinking three times about every move but in the end your sanity and patience will be tested. Nevertheless randomness can be helpful – sometimes RNG gods are on your side and you can pass through the long dungeon (which takes around 30 minutes to finish) without a single hit because your heroes are hitting crits after crits or dodge enemy attacks like crazy. To summarize, combat is double-edged sword - it can give ton of fun but sometimes can be unbearable. 

While describing pros I could also point out visual style of the game – it is nice mix of 
comic-like graphic, dark fantasy and stories/books written by H.P. Lovecraft. Despite being 2D it is very easy on the eye. Separate thing is music and overall audio design – it is not just nice, it is freaking awesome! Wayne June has done incredible work as a Narrator and became foundation of the game’s atmosphere. He delivers plenty of unforgettable lines and when we combine them with dramatic and intense soundtrack appearing during battles, the final outcome is just amazing.

Of course, there are cons, there is no flawless game (maybe except Witcher III). Like I mentioned before, to have fun while playing DD you need nerves of steel to tolerate randomness of the game which appears constantly during gameplay, from start to finish. Missing attack while having 90% chance to hit? Healing for 0 and applying bleed status on your ally which will kill him very next round? In this game it is possible. Morever, after longer sessions there can appear some kind of repetitiveness because of grind, mostly during endgame when our heroes are dying while trying to get through eponymous darkest dungeon. But despite these few disadvantages DD is a very nice title which can give a lot of fun and satisfaction.

I sincerely recommend you this game. At least give it a try. Either you will instantly love it or throw your PC out of the window <333

[b]Final note: 8/10.[/b]

P.S. Do not attach to heroes in your party. They are going to die anyway.
P.P.S. Remember – overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer.


[PL]
[b]Darkest Dungeon[/b] jest miksem turowej gry RPG z grą strategiczną w której korzystając z dobieranej przez nas czteroosobowej drużyny, eksplorujemy losowo generowane lokacje, wykonując wcześniej wyznaczone zadania, mordując bandytów, szkielety i inne maszkary. Przed wyruszeniem do lochów niezbędne jest dobre zaplanowanie, których poszukiwaczy przygód zabierzemy na kolejną wyprawę, w jakie przedmioty ich wyposażymy, a podczas samych starć obligatoryjne jest co najmniej dwukrotne przemyślenie następnego ruchu - bo śmierć postaci jest ostateczna i nieodwracalna.

Plusem jest bardzo ładna grafika w stylistyce dark fantasy z oczywistą inspiracją twórczością H.P. Lovecrafta, dobre udźwiękowienie z GENIALNYM głosem narratora i ciekawe, niezwykle przyjemne, choć momentami także cholernie frustrujące mechaniki gry. Bo oczywiście, są wady, nie ma gry idealnej (nie licząc Wiedźmina III). Żeby czerpać z DD jakąkolwiek radość trzeba mieć silną psychikę (zajebiście silną) i tolerancję na losowość, której jest tutaj dużo, a momentami jest, delikatnie mówiąc, frustrująca. Spudłowanie w przeciwnika mając 90% szans na trafienie? Uleczenie sojusznika za 0 punktów życia i nałożenie na niego krwawienia, które ostatecznie doprowadzi do jego śmierci? W tej grze to możliwe. Ponadto po dłuższych sesjach może wkraść się pewna monotonia wywołana koniecznością grindu, który występuje zwłaszcza pod koniec gry, kiedy nasi bohaterowi padają jak muchy podczas starć w tytułowym mrocznym lochu. 

Jednakże pomimo powyższych wad jest to tytuł niezwykle przyjemny i warty ogrania oraz na pewno jest jednym z lepszy roguelitów jakie kiedykolwiek powstały. A po ponad stu niezwykle intensywnych godzinach spędzonych z tą produkcją, dostałem weny artystycznej i napisałem fraszkę, która idealnie odzwierciedla zarówno moje odczucia, jak i obecny stan psychiczny po obcowaniu z nią:

Treat the game like it hates you. I do not say this lightly, because if you play the game as if you're trying to spite the developers, it is somewhat easier. In order to really get into DD, you have to stick with a particularly grueling earlygame - something many people simply will not do. It's a frustrating game. At times, it'll feel like the game doesn't make any sense, or like you're not making any progress.

Because Darkest Dungeon HATES you. It wants you to fail. It will punish every single mistake you make, and will refuse to praise your victories. As you progress, you will be micromanaging well over 20 characters - that's 5 full teams! - in order to get their stresses down, their bad quirks removed, their equipment somewhat passable, and their skills in optimal position for success. This is an absolute logistical nightmare, since to do any of these things, you need money - lots of it, which you can only get by going deeper into the dungeons. You will lose characters. You will lose progress. The real currency of Darkest Dungeon is not artifacts or gold, but the hard-learned lessons of every mistake you make along the way. You will learn your lesson, or your future expeditions will be just as doomed as the one that taught you.

And I'm playing on EASY!

But it can be done. Stick with it. Make mistakes. You may have to restart a couple times. Learn every character you come across inside and out, don't be afraid to experiment, and most importantly - [b]running away is [i][u]ALWAYS[/u][/i] an option.[/b]",1692997416,1692997440,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Yet this may be my favorite game I've played this year. The atmosphere does a lot of heavy lifting when it comes to the elements that would bother me. Having punishing RNG and muted colors fits the oppressive Lovecraftian vibe they were going for. But I think part of the saving grace of this game is that you always have options.

Permadeath is always around the corner, but you do have the option to retreat and deal with the consequences.

More importantly, due to the expeditions being finite challenges, you aren't forced to replay large sections of the game every time you lose.

There are a lot of positives going for this game, including the systems for characters to develop personality quirks, and the randomized stress reactions, but I'm mostly just impressed that the game was able to captivate me so thoroughly with game play mechanics I dislike instead of despite them.

This game is a merciless master, demanding every ounce of strategic brilliance and iron-willed determination, and I'm not sure whether to praise it or beg for mercy.

From the moment I inherited my ancestral estate, I knew I was in for a punishing experience. The game's dark and gothic atmosphere enveloped me like a shroud, and the narration, delivered with eerie gravitas, served as a constant reminder that despair lurked around every corner. The game's art style, a hauntingly beautiful blend of Lovecraftian horror and medieval darkness, only deepened the sense of foreboding.

The core gameplay in ""Darkest Dungeon"" is a relentless test of survival. Sending a party of heroes into the twisted depths of the estate is a game of risk and reward, where death is a constant companion. The need to manage stress, monitor health, and deal with the ever-encroaching darkness adds layers of complexity that can be both maddening and addicting.

One of the standout features is the permadeath mechanic. Losing a beloved hero, one who's been through countless battles and faced unimaginable horrors, is a gut-wrenching experience. It's a testament to the game's storytelling that each loss feels like a tragedy.

The character progression system is a double-edged sword. As heroes level up, they develop unique quirks and traits, which can be both beneficial and detrimental. It adds depth to the characters but also introduces an element of unpredictability that can turn the tide of battle for better or worse.

The game's difficulty is off the charts. Every decision, from party composition to resource management, carries consequences that can lead to disaster. It's a game that punishes mistakes with ruthless efficiency, and the learning curve can be brutal.

Furthermore, the game's narrative, delivered through journal entries and cryptic hints, adds an element of intrigue that keeps you pushing forward, even as the darkness threatens to consume your sanity.

In conclusion, ""Darkest Dungeon"" is a masterpiece of masochistic game design. It's a game that pushes you to the brink of despair, yet somehow keeps you coming back for more punishment. Whether you emerge victorious or succumb to the horrors that lurk in the shadows, one thing is certain: ""Darkest Dungeon"" is an experience that will haunt your dreams and leave you questioning your sanity.",1692762938,1692762938,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The money they made in adventuring is always less than the money required to cure them in mental asylums, clinic and the money required to lower their stress. So it's more efficient to dispose them or letting them killed. this stance is not just morally awful cause it doesn't value human life, but it bothering in the game play, cause it doesn't allow players to keep the adventurer they like, even if they manage to keep him/her alive.",1692628564,1692629113,False,0,1,0.481481492519378662,0,True,False,False

There's a lot of RNG, that's for sure. But the game says itself that it's mainly about working with the cards you're dealt with. Missing constantly is annoying and i'm glad they fixed that in the new game, but there are a lot of ways to increase your accuracy or lower enemy dodge to make that less likely

The beginning is really tough, no matter how much you know about the game. Your resources are just limited and you have to scrounge by. While the enemies get harder as time goes on obviously, you will have more at your disposal, just push on through and I'm sure things will turn out well. You can't exactly 'lose' after all (Not including the Hardest Difficulty), so you have time to get your bearings

There is a learning curve as well as you try to figure out how things work and how to best combat bosses, and I do recommend looking up a couple guides if you want to play better.

I love the premise of the game and I really like most of the execution, it was just frustrating to end up at a dead end hours into the run and realising I'd have to start over again, but it didn't feel unfair that I ended up where I did - it was entirely the result of my choices.

The idea is that you inherit a town that borders a land infested with eldritch horrors and you need to hire heroes to clear them out and reclaim the land. The heroes plunder the depths, go crazy and get injured, you have to nurse them back to health and in the meantime send out an alternate set of heroes.

While this loop is very fun as you go on expeditions and micro manage your different teams of adventurers, the problem is that there's a limited number of times you can run a given dungeon because the dungeon itself levels up. Combine this with heroes that can perma-die and you can end up with a bunch of level 1 heroes that can't explore anything and not enough high level heroes to be of use.

If you go into the game knowing that you can play yourself into a corner lets you set your expectations accordingly. Having that sprung on me made me feel like I wasted a lot of time playing the game the 'wrong way'.

The fight was a tough one. One by one the hag killed my party members until only the Hellion was left. The horrors of witnessing the death of her comrades in arms and getting dragged into a cauldron full of hot soup made her mentally as well as physically unstable. In a desperate attempt though, she managed to slay the hag and claim victory. Afterwards she collapsed right before she arrived at the Hamlet.
Since that day, she had nightmares of this traumatising event every day and even refused to eat soup, when ever it was served.

The gameplay however falls short. It's very RNG based, the healing is very few and far between, and stress will always be your downfall. One of my biggest problems with it is that you are almost always required to be either heavily over-leveled and over equipped for every encounter if you wish to get to the end, or make a very cheese strat to make it though, such as 90 dodge builds or 85+ prot builds. You have to find the most broken synergies available to you and max the hell out of them, or try to play the game in a 'normal' way and die trying.

The gimmick of the game is that you cannot prepare for everything (unless inordinate quirk locking be considered a virtue), the trinkets always have some kind of downside (or kind of useless when they don't), but the good thing is that having stuns, lots of damage, speed, accuracy, some healing and some stress healing and camp skills to heal stress makes the game a lot more managable, so the conclusion is that you want to look out for heroes that have the aforementioned things and don't interfere with each other's positioning and always can do something useful in case you get surprised or shuffled. Another factor is more related to your personal blunders like forgetting some provisions like Blood or shovels and what not, or starting a fight you can't finish (Shambler, Collector) or having to abandon the mission because your team comp couldn't get to the boss room with little damage, or letting a hero get an affliction (this usually causes a domino effect and you'll probably abandon the quest soon).
Once you harness the game mechanics and RNG to some extent, the game becomes really enjoyable. The only feasible downsides are probably grinding level 6 heroes and RNG screwing you over on a rare occasion (like your level 6 Flagellant  with 87% deathblow resist dying on the first death's door check, have fun spending an hour or two grinding a new hero with good quirks!

That’s the first part of the message that welcomes you into the game and I think it describes it perfectly, this game is hard sometimes even unfair but that’s why it so satisfying when you get to beat it.
Darkest Dungeon is a unique fusion of Side-scroller/RPG. I wouldn’t say it’s a roguelike, but it has permadeath once one of your heroes dies in combat is gone [spoiler] most likely [/spoiler] forever, this makes the game incredibly punishing. One bad dungeon expedition can set you back hours of gameplay towards the end of the game. The game makes an incredible emphasis on the positioning of your heroes some abilities are only available in specific rows so keeping the position of your heroes and messing up the enemies position it’s a key part of the gameplay. 
This game highly rewards knowledge and using the right tool for each situation. There’s a highly armored pig with poison resistance then bleed it to death, an annoying witch stressing your heroes bring it to the front so she can’t use their strongest attacks. Each dungeon is consistent with the kind of enemies you will be facing: 
[list]
    [*]The ruins are full of undead skeletons who are vulnerable to blight but invulnerable to bleeding
    [*]The warrens are inhabited by swine beast who are vulnerable to bledding but really hard to blight 
[/list]
And so on with each one of the locations, every battle is a little puzzle that you can approach in multiple ways according to your hero composition.
About the art style and the general setting it really hit the right spot for the general feeling of being trapped in a terrible situation, the music, the lore everything fits perfectly so if you find any of the elements of the compelling or you really like the challenges give the game a try and if you got yourself stuck don’t be ashamed to look for help in a guide or read the wiki about the game I did it myself and still today enjoy the game to a lot.
Also the modding community is full of great quality mods giving the game a lot of replayability, some modders were even hired to work in the team for Darkest Dungeon 2

Sometimes, you just lose. Everything will be fine, you'll go into a perfectly normal fight, and get such poor rng that a guy you invested a lot of money into just straight up dies. From full health to totally and irrevocably dead. This will happen over and over again until you decide to leave this game behind prematurely or finish it and leave on good terms. Unless there is something major I am missing (which after 39 hours would shock me greatly), then you will unavoidably have incredible setbacks because you can not just make the right choices to avoid death. The best you can do is try and tip the odds in your favor, but at the end of the day, luck will decide the fate of your every character. The best thing you can do is run away, which is kind of lame to me, but that's me. I love the aesthetic. I love the theme. It's so cool.

When I first heard of Darkest Dungeon, the phrase I heard that stuck out most was ""this game HATES you"". After 90 hours, I'm not sure I'd agree. Rather, I'd say this game will take every opportunity you give it to screw you. DD is unquestionably mean, but not unfairly so. When things go wrong, the source can often be traced back to something you did -- characters' skills or gear is underleveled, you forgot important supplies, bad team comp, overconfidence, etc. -- and the game will happily punish you for it.

DD is a vast departure from what I normally play; I usually stick to fun, chill indie games that don't make you shake your fist at the heavens. There were times my sole motivation for finishing this game was spite. Even so, I'm glad I played DD. It drips with Gothic atmosphere, Wayne June is at the height of his powers, the breadth of viable teams adds to the potential replay value, and of course the memes are nigh endless.

Difficulty settings are hard by default. I did NOT enjoy the game until I turned it down to 'easy' and turned off ALL additional difficulty options - THEN it became a fun game for me (others might of course like the punishing gameplay). 

The main downside - which is of course an intentional aspect of the game - is the loss of characters. So don't get too attached to them. You should, however, get attached to your hamlet (city upgrades stay, while characters die) but it feels a little weird / annoying. I think I generally like people more than buildings.

I like the battle line style games (by which I mean the array/position of your characters in a turn-based combat has meaning).  A front line, a back line, support, damage, looking for synergies.  Nifty. Engaging even.
I've read/watched the guides and tips.  I didn't find any of it particularly of use, I've been playing these sorts of things for a while.

The reality of this game is... frustrating.  At anything higher than the easiest level, the RNG is cruel and punitive.  At the easiest level... some mild challenge (which ramped up _sharply_ for the final dungeon).  The designers should note there is a significant difference between challenging and just mean.  Not to mention a nuisance factor.  
I'm okay with taking losses if it achieves my goals.  Slogging to earn enough money to make the characters viable so they can complete the only challenges available, watching them get crushed, oft with a series of crits from the enemies and misses on my part, in the first one or two meaningless fights in a run?  When there are likely to be 5 or 6 more fights plus maybe a boss?  Ugh.  The challenge is high enough that losing even one of four characters on the way to the boss is a death sentence (in the boss fight, that's fine, I've lost 3/4 and still won, dicey though).  
Healing, especially stress healing, is sparse enough, and defenses low enough that one might think that the all damage is the way to go, but attrition will quickly show the error of that thinking.  And, ofc, the decent support classes mostly don't do enough damage &/or tank enough to make them viable on their own (as it should be, but there is a balance to be achieved in there somewhere).

Oh, and the money grind.  Painful, right up until you are flooded with it.  But did I mention the building upgrade resource grind?  Which is dependent on the RNG?  And your limited space, competing with money at every turn?  Choices matter and all that, but you truly need _everything_, right now, no exceptions, or you die trying.  Repeatedly.  Over and over.  Which might be okay... IF the losses at times didn't leave you so destitute as to be unable to continue at all.
Not workable.

And after now rage-quitting from yet another excruciating and drawn-out series of failures and TPWs (which is the usual way I go in this game, build, build, nurse the characters and teams, try to scrape by, then watch it all collapse like a house of cards), the game is uninstalled.",1690348731,1690348731,False,49,31,0.599678397178649902,0,True,False,False

Unapologetically difficult, Darkest Dungeon makes itself clear that it is a game that is not for the faint of heart. You will lose, and you will suffer setbacks. However, through experience and carefully planning out party comps you can begin to overcome the horrors pitted against you. 

With 17 heroes to create parties from, in tandem with a choice of 7 skills per hero, there's an incredible amount of variation in party builds. Since your characters will suffer from the psychological stress of the monsters you encounter, it is common to find the characters you like are indisposed for some missions, leading you to fall back upon other heroes you normally wouldn't use. This is a great method for encouraging experimentation that the sequel fails to capture. 

The art style, music, and narrator serve to create a capturing Lovecraftian tone that caught my attention and adoration instantly. Wayne Jude does an excellent job at adding tension to uncertain encounters, and grim satisfaction at the elimination of a particularly troublesome foe with incredibly memorable quotes.

While the game may not be for everyone, it is incredibly well made, and I encourage those not afraid of failure to give it a chance. 10/10.",1690236392,1690236520,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For a long time, I wanted nothing to do with this game. I had heard that it is a sadistic turn based RPG that kicks your ass over and over until you are able to somehow luck your way through it or something. The megaten series came to mind, a series of extremely difficult turn based RPGs that I hate.

I was convinced by a friend to actually pick it up with the promise that the game is actually pretty fair most of the time, with the big important thing being making sure to prepare and strategize for what is up ahead. As it turns out this is correct and most people just suck really bad. Not to say that the game is easy by any means, many enemy encounters will have you sweating, and even seemingly easy enemy encounters can do enough damage to cause trouble or hit you with an effect that will disrupt your plans, but the game can be conquered if you really put your mind to it. 

A good example: One of the late game bosses humbled me after I had approached him with a little bit too much confidence and lost a unit before being forced to flee. For several days, whenever I was doing some menial task at work I started to think about the best way to counter this boss, taking all of the classes into mind. Then after over-preparing I nervously fought the boss again, to utterly destroy it because my strategy worked almost too well. THIS is what Darkest Dungeon is all about.

When you start, you won't really know the thin line between over-preparing and under-preparing, but if you really put your mind to managing your resources then you'll nail it pretty quickly and start doing pretty well. After that you can move on to figuring out which flaws are minor and which ones are major, figuring out good team compositions and formations, and finding a good balance of gold and relics to take home, and then like me you'll find yourself coming back every once and a while to push just a little bit farther.

TLDR: If you are looking for a really decent, challenging turn based RPG that is also kind of an army management game then here it is.

It just lacks that ""oomph"" that sucks you in and compels you to play for longer than that. What doesn't help is that, quite often, combat drags on for too long due to you and your foe missing a high proportion of your attacks.

I appreciate that bad RNG is purposeful to sell the atmosphere, and I don't mind the ""losing is fun"" thing it's trying to do, but it just doesn't pull this off as well as other high-difficulty games. Progression is as slow as molasses, both in the ""meta"", and during combat, so I felt like I was just wasting my time.

Positives: the artstyle is great, the high difficulty sells the gloomy atmosphere and lore, and the combat is punchy and satisfying (when attacks land, which they quite often don't).

Most fantasy stories portray adventuring as an easy, even glamorous profession. These heroic badasses frequently swagger into labryinths, smash all the bad guys, steal all the loot, and when necessary, resurrect themselves with reckless abandon. But usually, these heroes are human beings. Humans can become frightened, they can have doubts, they can lose their minds and even betray their allies when their survival is threatened. They can succumb to post-traumatic stress after particularly harrowing experiences. These traits are at odds with the daring depictions of heroic characters, and so they are glossed over or sugarcoated. In Darkest Dungeon, they are an integral part of the game.

Before the events of the narrative, the player character's long-lost relative contacts them via letter, explaining that he has done something horribly wrong and paid for it dearly. He was a bored, jaded nobleman, and one day decided to investigate the rumors of an interdimensional portal underneath his castle. The rumors were true, and he unleashed a grotesque, terrifying horde of creatures on the surrounding countryside. The horrors were enough to drive him mad, and after summoning his estranged relative, he commits suicide.

Upon arrival in the hamlet beneath the hills of the haunted family mansion, I was given a small group of adventurers and a bleak message from the game itself, informing me that bad things were going to happen. I collected my eager, fresh band of heroes and an assortment of provisions (no Xanax, unfortunately), and then descended into the darkness for glory and treasure. Well, that’s what I hoped to find - more often I found derangement and despair. Every mission in Darkest Dungeon is randomly generated, with new rooms and hallways filled with curios, wealth, traps, and monsters. Whenever I reached a chest, corpse, or bookshelf to investigate, random effects would occur depending on my party’s statistics and provisions. Sometimes we were awarded some gold, or a trap would spring and inflict a party member with a terrible disease. Most of these encounters are avoidable, but the fights are not.

Instead of the tiles found in earlier roguelikes, Darkest Dungeon uses a two-dimensional presentation. During fights, my party of four was arranged to the left of the enemy party of 1-4, and opportunities are determined by the placement of a character within the formation. My arbalest-bearer, for instance, is better towards the back of the party, where she has enough room to shoot her crossbow. The healers like to be in the middle, and the paladins and shieldbearers belong up front. Party abilities can synergize with each other for tactical advantages - the jester can shuffle the party around and open up combo opportunities, while the bounty hunter can ""mark"" targets for big bonuses from other members. Of course, enemies can also do these things, and they have an AI capable of taking every possible advantage.

It’s not just the health of my heroes that I’m concerned with. Some enemies, as well as the conditions of the dungeon, can inflict stress damage. Stress is a secondary form of damage that, if accumulated too quickly, will generate quirks, neurotic tendencies, and downright psychosis. My heroes would crack when the burden got too high and lose their nerve, suffering from masochism, selfishness, or other maladies, which can lead to lost turns and increased stress on their allies. One of my first paladins, Reynauld, is a degenerate kleptomaniac, prone to stealing treasure in the field and keeping it for himself. One of my healers has an obsession with sainthood and takes every opportunity to martyr herself. My favorite highwayman suffers from alcoholism, and so on and so forth. These afflictions, as well as the myriad diseases that can be contracted in these filthy environments, can all be cured at the local sanitarium - for a price. Stress can be reduced via religious devotion and nighttime revelry, but all of this is only possible for heroes who are actually able to survive the expedition, which is a tall order. Heroes who die are permanently lost, but green recruits arrive weekly in the village. Little did they know they would become just another resource to me, as expendable as the torches and rations that accompanied them on their forays.

Darkest Dungeon is a mixture of stylish comic-like characters and a dark, gothic environment. The fingerprints of Lovecraft and Poe can be seen everywhere, from the tentacled monsters of the cove to the iron bars of the asylum. The effects match the theme perfectly - during battles, fighters cut into the foreground when they attack, and their model switches to a horrified grimace when something bad happens, like losing their mind. Movement animations are simple, but the character models are very detailed in their 2D way.

The music was composed by Canadian musician Stuart Chatwood, who also worked on 'Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time'. It is heavy on the strings and Victorian flavor, and like the gameplay, is deep, dark, and depressing. The narrator (whose character is the dead former proprietor of the castle) is the only voice besides enemy barks, and his pained, guttural delivery is excellent.

It's thick roguelike influences means that Darkest Dungeon is the kind of game that thrives when it is played over and over. Every dungeon is procedurally generated, every chest has a chance at strange fortune, and every new character offers a different set of abilities. Even when times are tough (and they will be tough, I assure you) upgrades can be made to the village facilities that slowly improve the heroes’ quality of life and chance at survival. In turn, the dungeons also get more challenging.

Darkest Dungeon is the rare game that gets my heart pumping while playing, not because it’s scary (even though it is a little scary), but because the stakes are so high. One battle can make the difference between waltzing out flush with loot, and returning home defeated, with the party dead or completely insane. It will punish your mistakes and it will even punish your good fortune, on the rare occasion it happens. Despite all of this, or perhaps because of it, I cannot seem to stop playing Darkest Dungeon.",1686160024,1688936940,True,3,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

As with RPGs - weapons, potions, armor, position, skill, class all play integral roles in a careful balance between squad success or squad wipe.

If a game draws me in consistently on first play through then it gets a favored position in my library.

EDIT: However, upon regular play through, the game is slanted towards the player always on the edge of a major threat. It feels forced and manufactured to create a tension heavy playing experience. To me, this is inauthentic as a mechanic because it becomes a game of finding the ""goldilocks"" zone rather than being properly prepared for each dungeon encounter. In fact, you might be better off being less prepared because then the game might artificially balance it towards your favor. 

On my last playthrough I tried to intentionally wipe my party and that was harder than actually putting in an effort the time before that trying to keep them alive. That's when I knew something was seriously amiss with the balancing. 

I had high hopes that this was a true strategic experience and it falls way short of anything resembling strategy that could be impactful towards your playstyle. This is a game of chance.

I've had my eye on this game since it first came out and it is somewhat unbelievable that I waited until 2023 to get it. I wanted to hone my turn based skills in other games before i got this. This game really rewards preparedness and I prepared. It was very satisfying to build teams with synergies and plan out my strategies. The game isn't for everyone. The games difficulty wasn't mindless dungeon crawling and is more geared towards putting meticulous purpose in every action you take.

While the game is great by itself, the dlcs are a must have, and the modding community is phenomenal. With the community content alone you could pump in 10 times more time into this game with all the content. I personally am satisfied with having only have near 100 hours into the game, but I certainly could put in more since I haven't delved deep into modding beyond a few extra classes. Red Hook making the game so easily moddable was a really smart move that has kept this game alive relevant. I would even recommend enabling mods on your first play through. This and the fact the game consistently goes on 85% discount, this game is a must have for anyone that enjoys turn based dungeon crawling fantasy combat.

You can have full torch light (which is supposed to give Monster Surpise++++) and...
- enter a Battle Room,
- not surprise the monsters,
- have all the monsters take their turns first,
- they all target one of your characters with 4 crits,
- you just wasted 3 hours and get punished through no fault of your own.

How are you supposed to ""get gud"" with encounters like this?

Such a shame. The game looks and sounds amazing! That's what grabbed me at first, but I completely regret putting 80+ hours into this game. I would take back the time if I could.

-- PS

Just to throw some Steam achievement stats out there:
- only 56% of players are able to beat only one boss in Darkest Dungeon.
- 50% of Dark Souls players are able to get all the way to Anor Londo (no small feat) and beat Ornstein and friggin Smough.

- 6% of players beat Darkest Dungeon on its easiest difficulty.
- 28% of players beat Dark Souls on its *only* difficulty.",1688398653,1688400184,False,4,1,0.49922335147857666,0,True,False,False

I will keep my original review listed below, as it does highlight good reasons as to why this game might not be everyone's cup of tea. [u]But my own thoughts on the game have changed,[/u] I do still enjoy it despite it's frustrations - namely overcoming them. If you enjoy a ruthless challenge and seek to triumph in the face of adversity, then I would absolutely recommend the game.

Original review:
The game is fun, for the most part. But by the end-game a single mistake can cost you hours of work trying to make heroes resolve rank 6, which isn't helped by how evasive and dangerous enemies get in champion levels.
It's so unbelievably frustrating to, for example; [i]need[/i] a hero with the guard ability for the 2nd Darkest Dungeon, but every hero who reached high enough level to enter that location getting killed due to negligence and/or unlucky RNG, forcing you to re-train another one from scratch (even with all the stagecoach upgrades, the chances of specifically getting a rank 3 guard hero are slim, and still requires a ton of money and work to make them viable for DD).

I've had the game since early access - back when it was a viable strategy to have four heroes with the abusive affliction and go on pure dark runs, as heart attacks didn't exist back then - but was never able to beat it. And my latest playthrough to cross that off my bucket list has been plagued by scenarios like those described above, routinely sending hours of work down the drain.

The game is undeniably good - great storytelling, music and nail-biting difficulty. But if you're like me, there's only so much frustration that you can take before your enjoyment is completely soured. (It wasn't helped by the fact that I accidentally loaded a save before my mods had been prepared, which outright deleted half my roster of modded heroes. That's my own fault, I'll concede, but its still hurts since there's no way to go back to an older save to fix that mistake).

TL;DR: The game is good, but simply not for me. Something something skill issues.",1686699880,1687894149,True,0,0,0.562189042568206787,0,True,False,False

[h1]Introduction[/h1]
[b]Darkest Dungeon (DD)[/b] is a unique game, as I never played a game as punishing as this one. With the sequel recently being released, my interest was piqued to try out the first game that I happened to already own but never spent much time playing, and I'm glad that I took the opportunity to check out this gothic-themed experience.


[h1]Pros and Cons[/h1]
[b]Pros[/b]

[h1]Story[/h1]
The story starts out with a man known as the [b]Ancestor[/b]; he learns of this special power that is somewhere deep in his mansion. He then uses up his family’s remaining fortune to hire people to help him dig up this mysterious power. However, it turns out that this power was something worldly and he ran from the dungeon. Only the [b]ancestry[/b] survived and he wrote a letter to the next heir of the family, to fix the mistake he made. After he sealed the letter and before the angry mob of villagers that were mad for what he did could get him, the [b]Ancestor[/b] had ended his life.

The story for [b]Darkest Dungeon[/b] is not fully told to you directly, rather, it’s told to you at different points in the game, mainly before you do boss missions. It’s interesting at the very least and I like the gothic [b]Cthulhu mythos[/b] theme it has going for it. Although [b]DD[/b] takes inspiration from the [b]Lovecraftian[/b] universe, there are also different inspirations that are included as well. The heroes you hire also have back stories to them as well.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
The gameplay for [b]Darkest Dungeon[/b] is fun but also very challenging and at the same time, it can be very difficult to grasp. There are many mechanics that you yourself have to try and get used to. You will be able to hire different heroes that each have different abilities for them to use. Each of them also may have a different mechanic that corresponds to them, however, they all do share the stress feature. Stress in the game is determined by what the hero goes through in a given situation. When stress reaches 100, that hero will have a certain negative Affliction inflicted on them, like them being fearful, paranoid, etc. 

However, there is a chance that some heroes will be given a virtue when they reach 100 stress, they get increased stats and will randomly heal themselves. So, while most heroes get afflictions and break, others will use their stressful moments as something to encourage themselves. If a hero gets to 200 stress, they will lose the virtue and go back to zero stress, while those with afflictions suffer a heart attack.

During combat, your heroes can do certain attacks or abilities to buff/debuff allies or enemies. Each hero has a certain amount of health and it does vary, when their health runs out they will be put under a [b]Death’s Door[/b] status. When they are in this state, they will suffer state penalties and they have to go through a test to see if they will survive the next attack. I should note that if your hero is at 1 health and the enemies attack them with a move that does a lot of damage, they will tank the entire attack except the one damage. The only way for a hero to die is by failing the [b]Death’s Door[/b] test.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2995283070
If a hero suffers a heart attack while at [b]Death’s Door[/b], they will be killed immediately, when a hero dies, they are lost for good and will also lose the equipped charms they have. You can recover them if you lose a hero in battle but if it’s outside of one, they are gone completely. So pray that your best heroes survive the attacks and that their stress does not get too high.

There are ways to relieve stress, like taking out enemies or using a camping ability at a campsite. If your heroes survive the mission, you sent them on, you can send them to a few stress-reducing activities like making them meditate, drink at the bar, gamble, pray, etc. There are also times when a hero will get a disease, so you must take them to the [b]Sanitarium[/b] for them to get cured. A hero can get a max of three diseases, if they happen to get another one, it will just replace one of the current diseases they have. Last I checked diseases don’t necessarily work like that but who knows, I am not a medical expert.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2995282569
I should at least give a little tip/warning that if any hero happens to get stunned, for them to recover it will take that hero's turn. Enemies get the same treatment as well. In other words, [b]Red Hook Studios[/b] took some inspiration from the original [b]Persona 3[/b] game and wanted to bring back memories.

Certain moves will also only be available for you to use if that hero is in a certain spot in the party. If they happened to get moved or pushed back, they will be unable to use certain attacks or support abilities. It’s understandable for some attacks but for others it’s absolutely stupid - like, the [b]Vestal[/b] can’t use her [b]Divine Grace[/b] or [b]Divine Comfort[/b] abilities, which heal party members, if she is in the front. I understand that she is a support hero but it’s still pretty dumb that she can’t use those abilities if she happens to be pushed into the front.

Now as much as [b]DD[/b] is fun, there are a few issues with the game that don’t hinder the experience but can be a turn-off for some people. Playing [b]DD[/b] can be a chore sometimes, you will have to do a lot of grinding depending on the difficulty that you choose. This is normal for an [b]RPG[/b] like this game but it can get very repetitive for some people. To add to the fact is that the game also relies on RNG for almost everything that happens in it. Trust me, when your hero misses an attack you will feel pain.

Some of the DLCs in the game are also not recommended to be activated on your very first playthrough. Ones like the [b]Butcher’s Circus[/b] (which is online PvP) or the [b]Musketeer[/b] are fine because they just add features that don’t hinder the experience for the player. However, DLCs like the [b]Crimson Court[/b] add stuff like more grind, a very annoying status debuff, and is just punishing to new players. Buy the DLC on your first playthrough if you just want an even more painful experience.

[h1]Graphics and Performance[/h1]
The art style for [b]DD[/b] is absolutely beautiful, I love the gothic-based art style that the game has going for it, and is very detailed. I experienced no issues while I was playing the game.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2995283203
I tested the game on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB, AMD Ryzen 5 1500X Quad-Core Processor 3.50, and 16 GB of RAM. 

[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]
There is a lot that I haven’t talked about with [b]Darkest Dungeon[/b] as there are numerous things to uncover from the game. If you are someone who wants to play a very punishing game, then this is the right one for you and you will get your money’s worth because a playthrough could go up to at least 50+ hours.

Originally, I played it and after a couple hours, I went ""Oh, this game is just hard for the sake of being hard"" and didn't touch it after.

After starting a new save today, I'm enjoying it more and more. Once you understand the mechanics and some strategies for it, Darkest Dungeon is up there with Morrowind. Most people that try games with in-depth mechanics and punishment for bad decisions just tend to say the game is unfair and uninstall it after they refused to learn or play by the game's rules. This game gave me that feeling of ""eh, just one more dungeon"" after every completed quest. This game rewards you for being good at it. It makes you feel smart once you understand the basics and play under the constraints (rules) that the game explicitly warns you about every time you boot it up. It's nothing but honest to a fault.

The music, art style, voice acting, and tone of the game are good. The combat loop can be addictive and it never makes you feel comfortable with it. The moment you get cocky, the game slaps you across the face and staunchly reminds you to not be too confident simply because you think you've mastered it. Most of the time when your party dies it's because it's usually your fault. Some people don't like that and that's fine. Some people that play games want to turn their brain off and want a power fantasy. Darkest Dungeon doesn't give you that luxury and it never feels cheap about it.

Wrong. Darkest dungeon is a roguelite with a fantastic start, and a woeful endgame. A wonderful idea twisted into a horrible, bloated mess - which I suppose is fitting given the theme.

Standard opening: Who the hell am I? I'm the guy who;

-Likes a good indie RPG.
-Likes a new mechanic
-Is a working adult with a full-time job
-Is not a 100% completionist
-Likes ""Lovecraftian"" a little more than ""Lovecraft""
-But okay, 'Mountains of Madness' wasn't bad

Darkest Dungeon is a turn-based, dungeon crawl roguelike, set in a Lovecraftian world. You are tasked with recruiting various classes of hero into your roster, sending them out to fight the darkness. Over the course of the playthrough you will likely see many heroes fall, but with (an awful lot of) determination you will see you town and heroes grow, and push against the darkness.

Darkest Dungeon is incredibly well-stylised, and works its limited graphics better than almost any game I have seen. The artwork itself is extremely limited and the animation barely existent but time has been taken to make the transitions and feel right. This is complemented by an iconic narrator whose tone and extent of contributions meant that I never grew tired of listening to them.

Such is the commitment to the Lovecraftian concept, that your party members have not only a health meter but a sanity meter. In practice this means little more than juggling two health bars, but thematically it works well. Darkest dungeon is unusual in that its bullshit-o-meter runs absolutely off the scale - one enemy crit cascade added fifteen hours to my playthrough. However it all seems to tie in to the theme well.

Darkest Dungeon is enjoyable, challenging, well-written and generally well-presented indie RPG. I have no doubt whatsoever that you will enjoy it.

The start of it, at least.

See, Darkest Dungeon expresses some quite astonishing delusions of grandeur about its own lifespan. This is a game that you can happily sink 30 hours into, whose ""abridged"" campaign will take closer to 80, and whose unabridged campaign is probably closer to 150. It has no business being as long as it is. The four areas have two bosses each. For no reason other than length you fight these bosses three times each. And you grind and grind and grind.

When eventually the bosses are done, the end-game doubles down on the pain with the sort of level design they should teach out of you on day 1 of design school. Overly long dungeons that, should a character die (at which point your run is to all intents and purposes over) you must kill another character to retreat. Two enemies critted my full-health Vestal back-to-back, and she died from the resulting bleed. I retreated and lost my tank. Lacking another appropriate healer and tank (because characters can only take end-game dungeons once?!) I had to grind up from level 2 a new party. WHY?!

I have finally completed Darkest Dungeon and now can put it to bed. An exercise in how to outstay your welcome. Recommended with caution.",1687381832,1687381832,True,2,0,0.540636062622070313,0,True,False,False

Not difficult due to decision making or strategy, but from the most miserly petty economy of any game in history.

First you spend all your money on supplies for a dungeon, then if you leave the dungeon you lose those supplies and have to buy them again when you go back out. WHY? Why wouldn't I keep my supplies that I bought with my hard earned money, especially with such a miserly economy? It's ridiculous and feels like it just artificially makes the game harder and not in a good way.

To make the cheap economy worse, you can go 80% through a dungeon and still not have picked up enough 'loot' to justify the equipment you bought to make the dungeon run. So leaving before the end leaves you screwed. Do that a few times and you're so broke you have to start a new game. Then again continue with such damaged characters and someone or more will probably die. Not a good design IMO.

Next you are always dealing with stress. And one enemy puts 17 stress on ALL your characters in one hit, but then your only recourse is a skill that ONE of your guys has that takes a full turn, but only cures A COUPLE of points of fear on ONE person. WOW. GEE, thanks for NOTHING. IF they survive the dungeon run, back at town stress persists and you have to pay a LOT of money for LITTLE stress relief. Again, stupidly cheap, intentionally frustrating economy.

Also you can't get attached to your characters because chintzy economy and worthless 'healing' mentioned above and practically forcing you to complete dungeons when people are badly injured and stressed.

Also adding to above, some of your characters just get focused like crazy no matter what position they're in or what aggro taking abilities you have on other characters. They all just INSIST on taking that one character out. Again, don't get attached to any characters.

And by the way, who the heck are YOU? 

You are supposed to be the owner of the land this desecrated castle is upon, but then you don't actually appear in the game as a character. Bizarre. Of course they had to go with such a weird design decision as YOU would just die anyway like everyone else in your broke impoverished healing-free party and the story couldn't progress. This decision ruins immersion and makes you as attached to the story as you are to the characters you pick, which is to say not at all.

Frustrating and disappointing. 
Artificially 'hard' to impress elitists / masochists, all for all the wrong reasons.
Sorry but I suspect the majority thumbs this up, then plays a couple more hours then NEVER touches it again.

It slaps you over the face with a through line that you're trading meat for knowledge and progress. They give you so many cute little options to do things like change your units’ appearance name to ask you to care about them and it is a trick to ask you to waste your time. The core gameplay of dungeon delving is almost as horrifying in that every animation and move between rooms is excruciatingly slow. That means that not only is your time customizing the characters at stake, but the entire cumulative time of dungeons cleared and stress reduced is what you're risking when a character dies. This was genuinely intolerable for me when I first approached this game and I put it aside for later, presumably when I was better at video games.

Actual years passed, and I saw Black Reliquary release. It looked cool, so I poked around and saw it was a mod pack which was much more difficult than the base game, so if I wanted to engage with that fully, I might as well try this game. Looking through the mods of this game is very difficult because most of the collections arrange by users have completely unhelpful (predominately pornographic) imagery as thumbnails. Some of the quality-of-life mods are in all the most popular collections, and they are additionally bundled with cosmetic mods which may or may not be up to personal taste. 

As an aside, it can be considered unfortunate that the only consistent reskins of the game's assets are nsfw. I suspect this is because all the work it takes to bring a complete 'character' to life, which includes specialized animation knowledge, demands more than a hobbyist engagement. While there is a way to fund indie projects where it is free for everyone once it is completed, that crowdfunding model structurally favors porn, to be blunt. That fact is clear, but the why is well beyond the scope of this review. Know simply that the mods for making characters and npcs look different which are sfw are few and far between and are likely to have disparate and incompatible art directions.

What I did personally was download all the mods that steam marked my friends as having also subscribed to. I got all of the quality-of-life mods necessary to make most of the game's problems far more bearable, and it clicked for me. The game is a very tidy rpg if only it wasn't ""pretentious"" in hammering in the point of how brutal and high stakes it is precisely by wasting so much of your time. That said, my mod selection contained beastiality imagery, so I would strongly advise having more discretion than I did. 

After completing the first quest of the Darkest Dungeon, the game begins employing graphical tricks I would merely describe as 'cute' to try and emphasize a turn for horror. I won't be specific about what happens but suffice it to say I got tired of it over the course of two hours. I've had mostly negative things to say about the game and honestly, I probably should disown the game as a grindy piece of garbage which is intent on wasting your time, but that mod support really can salvage it. Mileage varies, but an assortment of ""speed increase"" and ""automatic save"" mods can go a long way in making the game accessible and breezy experience. If you have nostalgia for a difficulty implementation which resembles 'getting punched in the nads really hard and being told to go back and doing the entire section over again, perhaps with even less resources than before', the base experience and difficulty options remain.",1687148611,1687236551,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

What is Darkest Dungeon exactly, and what makes the game sucj a rollercoaster of stress and satisfaction?

Darkest Dungeon is a lovecraftian turn-based RPG with beautiful (or frightening) hand drawn lovecraftian-inspired character, enemy and environment designs. And does the game inspire fear with more elements than just its graphics...the bleakness that surrounds the game is directly translated into tough gameplay, intrincated mechanics and tough enemies.

Darkest Dungeon's most notable feature is the stress meter, which is a separate bar just above your health bar which will cause a trigger when it reaches its mid-point, with impacting consequences. Would the stress meter be full, your character could very well suffer a heart attack. It's just awesome, specailly in a game where you can continuously recruit new ¿heroes? but yet has a nasty permadeath mechanic.

This doesn't mean the game doesn't give you tools to go through its many dungeons: there are roughly over a dozen different classes to choose from and many combinations to try. Trial and error is vital in this game since it follows its own rules and mechanics, and experimenting with different party combinations made my day. Mercenaries can be upgraded when leveled-up and they can learn new abilites. Knowing who t chosse, or which abilities to pich depending on the different zones in the game, is crucial.

And whil the learning curve is steep at the beginning, with enough effort you can more or less master the game and its mechanics, competently entering dungeons with a high chances of success. But all it takes is one unlucky fight for things to get ugly...enemies will not want to make this wasy for you, specially when encountering new ones, and while the variety is just okay, some enemy party combinations have the potential to trash your party depending on its composition and placement. Big shout to the area bossess which are all not only way tougher than regular enemies, but also possess their own, and very flavorful gimmicks which you will have to learn and master...or face death. And don't get me started with the final zone of the game...you thought you had it all under control but there's a good difficulty spike there (and also a highly impacting design decision that will irritate some...and make others clap in respect to the flaour).

This game is not only challenging but also lenghty enough, at about 60hours to reach full completion.

For its current price tag, I would totally give it a try, and would recommend people to see if the kind of tense, pseudo-masochistic fun that Darkest Dungeon provides its their kind of spice. For me it's a 9,5/10 masterpiece.

DCC is an rpg where each player starts out with four characters, who all go through a level-0 adventure, called a Funnel. The game is extremely lethal and regularly unfair, and any character who survives that first excursion levels up and gets the privilege of being a main character. Darkest Dungeon is that experience in video-game form, you watch a herd of characters slowly grow and suffer over a protracted period, and it's really something special. The mechanics are frequently frustrating, but it feels deliberate. If the idea of having a bad time on purpose turns you off, you should probably stay miles away from DD. If you're a fan of pokemon nuzlockes, you're probably going to love this one. 
If I have to levy any real criticisms, runs go on a bit too long. The game's very punishing, but it's bad at telling you when you've lost. I don't know if I've ever actually scrubbed out of a DD run, but I've conceded a lot of them.

A game to recommend to someone for all of the wrong reasons.

This game should not be fun. It just shouldn't be.

You get punished for doing a good thing, you get punished for doing a bad thing, and occasionally, randomly, you get fucked because the game decided it's Fuck-O'Clock in the morning and you look ripe for the pickin'.

Surprising an enemy sounds like a good idea, right? Well, not in this game. Because surprising an enemy doesn't net you an extra turn, rather just you all go first. So, if you can't kill all of them in one turn, the enemy now gets 2, 3, or 4 turns to fuck up your guys without any recourse.

And let's not forget that the RNG is incredibly biased, or at the very least feels biased, towards the enemy. They will consistently crit and land low-chance hits while they dodge every attack aimed back at them. This compounds into the problem of surprising enemies actually not being a good thing, because enemies will line their ducks up, then proceed to double-crit a party member, promptly kill them, and all because you managed to surprise them, which is a random event in this game.

Make no mistake, this game is very fun and satisfying when it wants to be. Landing hefty blows in the 30s and 40s of damage is incredibly satisfying when you've built a party or character for that purpose. But my god, this game is an even tug-of-war game at its fairest, and a suicide mission at its worst.

As far as the economy sides of things goes, collecting treasure and upgrading buildings and managing your party through the Hamlet, it actually feels fairly balanced. Everything is a decision, there is no willy-nilly buying upgrades. The upgrades feel well-priced, allowing you to usually upgrade one or two party members per run, with some money spent towards recuperation. The Trinkets, the Busts, Portraits, Deeds, and Crests, work very well as resources, requiring you to hold onto them as treasures in the place of gold or other valuable items, or adventuring supplies, like torches, food, or curatives, forcing you to prioritize expanding your town or resting, recuperating, and fortifying your adventurers. 

The Trinkets as a system and as part of the Hamlet, are well-designed and play into the games focus on careful decision-making, even if that focus is shot in the knees by some odd design choices and really wack RNG.",1686045436,1686045436,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Tried the game 3 years ago and gave up and ended up completing the main story on build 25721 a couple days ago with the large majority of the game being a great first experience into the roguelike genre.

[h2] Story [/h2]
Storywise this game is average, while it is explained why you are in the town and what your goal is through the narrator and memoirs, it honestly felt forgettable; nothing really stuck to me. I could not figure out what caused the black magic in the first place or the change in intro towards boss dungeons without watching a video after I completed the game. Then again you are not really playing this game for the story, but for the roguelike dungeon experience. Voice acting, music and sounds are top-notch especially during lower torch levels. It actually made me feel anxious about progressing.

[h2] Graphics/Level-Design/World [/h2]
Visually the art style fits the game and is unique, everything from the abilities, character design and the dungeon itself looked great. Each of the zones looked unique and you could tell what zone you are in without a name just from enemies and the environment. The only design direction I did not like was how some characters like the Hellion have a large head proportional to her body, kind of making her look like a Chibi. Enemy wise, they matched their zone with their resistances being relevant such as more blight resistance in the warrens. The only issue I have with the enemies is how their stats are presented, I understand this is roguelike but nowhere in the game glossary or hover is it explained the effect of value of resistances. For instance I have been able to stun an enemy with 50 stun resistance but in the 60+ hours I’ve played I have not stunned 100, 200 or 300 enemies yet for blight I have managed to get it to proc enemies with up to 150+. It’s the same for acc on enemies. Why do I need to use the wiki to find out a swine ability hit rate is 82.5, it should just show me that in game. It is actually convoluted how none of this is explained in game.

[h2]Bugs [/h2]
Performance wise the game runs great, it is not an inherently demanding game with the art style. So you should not have any issues running this game. Bug wise I did encounter stat bugs such as acc showing 0 when it should be showing a significantly high number. It does update correctly after an action but it's too late at that point. Aside from that I have not experienced any bugs.

[h2]Conclusion [/h2]
If you want to try out a roguelike for the first time this game is a great entry into the genre, the game does a great job at encouraging persistence when your hero dies. But I do think as a new player a lot of things can be better explained and presented in-game. I recommend getting this game especially if it's on discount.",1685844923,1685844923,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

What a dumb piece of shit game this is.
Game describes itself demanding a lot from players and making the best out of bad situations.
Well,in reality it is rigged random dice throwing and nothing else.
For example - there is  a limit how much food you can get on a mission.Long missions need more food.Well,you can randomly have food checks in every fucking hallway so you can  not even theoretically have enough.I wont even bother telling how retarded it is ""heroes"" need food every 2 seconds.
""Combat"" - lol
No strategy at all.Makes no difference since its just rigged dice throwing where you always miss - opponent more or less always scores critical.
This is easily spotted at the circus - you can literally beat all of opponent team to 0 hitpoints ""at deaths door"" - and keep having them there for all eternity since you can never score killing blow.Eventually your team will also get there and every single character in your team will instantly die unlike computer characters.

So retarded.

I like turn based games and i especially liked all the visual flare present in this game, which gives characters attacks more ""omph"" and makes the game more interesting.

My only complaint is that heroes don't want to go to lower level dungeons at some point, but that was probably made for balance and you can disbale that with mods if you so please.

Eventually, I decided to give the game a second chance because I wanted to at least beat it. I did a bit better and got a bit further, but honestly, after a while, the game started to feel like a bit of a chore. I felt like progress was slow and I was grinding a lot after a while. It seemed a bit repetitive and eventually I just felt like it wasn't worth it anymore. I couldn't force myself to get to the end because I just wasn't enjoying myself. I felt like I was just focused on farming trinkets/gold and leveling up the characters for most of the time I was playing rather than actually advancing.

You play, in hopes that you have set yourself up for victory, but know that there is always a chance in every step, turn, decision for things south.  When things do go wrong, it is often disheartening, but it is also a chance to really show your mental metal and pull things out of the proverbial fire - and even when that fails, Darkest Dungeon has that one extra layer of hope in the form a hero who becomes courageous when there is nothing left.  You get attached to your heroes, you grow sad when they die, you go to work mad on Monday when your party gets wiped because you just kept telling yourself ""They can make it...""   Yes, Darkest Dungeon brings back something lost in games, it gets you to feel.

The core of the gameplay is a fantastic turn-based and position-based combat system where every round feels like solving a tiny puzzle to try to make the best use of your heroes' abilities. Exploring dungeons is also a problem-solving adventure thanks to the stress mechanic and the constant risk/reward calculations with how much light you choose to have and how many curios you interact with. Add in fantastic artwork, great sound design, and some of the best music and narration I've ever seen in a game.

Some people may not like the amount of RNG - the game is deliberately unfair in a sense, with no outcome ever being guaranteed, but that's on purpose.

Darkest Dungeon is the epitome of simple-yet-effective game design. I've been here since the beta days, and every single complaint I had was addressed and improved upon. Every pixel displayed, note heard, statistic rendered, and word spoken has a purpose to your experience as a whole.

Yes, the game is hard, but it's fair. Every failure has a point-of-origin to be found and a lesson to be learned. Be cautious, be careful, and try again.",1614787322,1684813186,True,5,0,0.487080246210098267,0,True,False,False

It's not difficult. It's punishing. There's a difference. The gameplay is not hard. You don't really have to learn all that much to put together a decent team composition and make decent tactical choices. You are, however, incredibly reliant on luck. Now, this isn't that big of an issue, except that the punishment for losing, which is, again out of your control most of the time, is very high. Your units with all their expensive gear and fancy trinkets and great perks you spent so much money on are lost, and you have to start again. 

Now don't get me wrong, you are always making progress. As you build up the settlement your units start stronger and stronger so there's less work to do when you lose. But the sheer time commitment, as can be seen by my hours, is absurd. There really isn't that much content here that the game should take this long. It just takes this long because the game keeps snatching your progress away and if you want to win you just have to keep slamming your head against the brickwall until you get a good run. 

It's unfortunate because the game IS fun. The aesthetics and narration are fantastic. Individual runs are also fun. But the game should really be a 20 hour game not a 50 hour one, where the extra 30 hours are just the game forcing you to grind by leveling up new heroes since your old party lost at the final fight because of unlucky rolls.",1530321045,1684534950,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

It advertises itself as difficult, which it is, but I have only ever lost characters to series of crits and misses that should be vanishingly unlikely (most recently, I missed 3 86% attacks in a row against a low-health enemy who proceeded to crit and kill two of my characters). I'm left to conclude that the game lies to you about its various elements of random chance, for this and other reasons. For one, every time I should have experienced a party wipe after I lose a character and the situation snowballs, the enemy appears to begin to make less logical decisions and chance to resist death appears to go up. I believe I understand the goal: getting you hooked on the swings in momentum and taking away your sense of control - and the game does this effectively. It would be significantly more palatable if the game was up-front with it, however.

Going into the game expecting to lose every once and a while to bullshit RNG, you'll find its progression systems and core mechanics quite satisfying and frustration at your losses will make your victories all the sweeter. The narration, art, atmosphere, and lore are all astounding as well. I'd also recommend against torturing yourself by keeping track of how unlucky you're getting as I have, lol.

Two things initially drew me to Darkest Dungeon:

1. The advertised difficulty (making the most of bad situations), and
2. The gorgeous paper art style mixed with gothic horror elements.

I read reviews on Reddit and Steam and felt conflicted. On the one hand, some players were extremely passionate about this game, while others bemoaned the RNG and endless grind. Technically, both camps are correct: This is a wonderful game, but it absolutely can be tedious at times and is not something I could play for hours on end in a single day. There's a lot of micro-management and grinding and it can feel very repetitive at times. It's something I'll play for 1–2 hours a day and resume the next day.

Darkest Dungeon is different than other roguelites because it is heavily reliant on RNG—whether your hits land, whether enemies crit you (or you them), whether your heroes stand fast or expire... It's often stressful, but it's also exhilarating and draws you in like no other game. You'll become emotionally attached to your heroes and then devastated when they eventually die. One minute you're steamrolling the enemies, and then the boss at the end of the dungeon decides to return the favor. How quickly the tide turns! Again, the game warns you about this before you even reach the menu screen: Darkest Dungeon is about making the most of a bad situation. The odds are mostly stacked against you. What makes the game fun is realizing this, treating it as a challenge, and doing the best that you can despite those seemingly insurmountable odds. Don't expect skill alone to get you through the game—temper your ego and know when to quit.

For some additional context: I love Soulsborne games and roguelites like Binding of Isaac and Slay the Spire. These games can also be frustrating at times, but they are also immensely rewarding if you stick with them long enough to master the mechanics. If you have a similar taste in games, I'd recommend getting Darkest Dungeon—I think you'll like it!",1684505853,1684505853,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

RNG based combat loves to screw you over sometimes and even help you sometimes just depends on your run.

I quite enjoyed playing this game most of the time, discussing locations, enemies, bosses, pros/cons/builds of heroes, tactics and trivia with friends. Only except when my heroes died in quests. 
There's a complete mechanism to ensure that a hero cannot be revived through S/L(save scumming) after death, and the situation of your entire squad will take a turn for the worse after your hero goes crazy or dies, which means that you have to think carefully about your team comps selection and everything before each mission.
Losing a whole team with all hard-earned trinkets due to some stupid mistakes drives me insane, it's just like the gamer gets paranoid affliction. This game actually emphasizes that mental health point is more vital than physical health point. D:

Obviously, it can, but the odds feel so insurmountable that it's shocking to learn someone out there was able to do it in under 3 hours. This game kills your team with heart attacks if they become too stressed, and friggin' everything stresses them out. They even stress EACH OTHER out. Death from stress can take the strongest of your party in an instant and it’s maddening and fantastic. And that’s before the monsters come into the equation— one of the first bosses is a hag that killed all my best heroes by stuffing them into her cauldron. As soon as you’re able to free one, she immediately stuffs another into it. It’s hard to really pinpoint why I love this game, but it may just be how all the odds are against you.

Everything in this game has a certain chance to happen, and it seems like no system was implemented in order to guarantee that RNG just defeats you, once in my dungeon my cleric was 80%-0% by a spider in the first turn, was poisoned, and on the next turn (she was SECOND, while being slow, due to bad rng or something, so I couldnt even heal her, or get out of combat) she didnt survive the skill check and died. The reason she died? She went on a dungeon, thats it, she shouldnt be the first on my team to act, shouldnt be 80%-0% by a minion, and failing deaths door killing her is just a result of the fact that this game has no balancing on rng, sometimes your character can not kill a guy at deaths door that had an 80% resist hitting him over 12 times (yeah, this also happened, but at the circus), and other times your characters can, miss 6 times in a row with an average of 80% hit chance, can get a combo of one of your characters only being able to go to the brothel for stress relief, and not being able to at the same time (at least you can fix this, my cleric dying is not quite fixable). This game does have strategy to prep correctly, but even with perfect strategy, you are going to lose fights, even with preparation, even with the right characters, because the game told you that you should, and that is unfair game design.",1684343211,1684347347,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game starts with you creating a party of four adventurers. Each adventurer has their own unique abilities and skills, so it's important to choose a balanced party that can handle a variety of challenges. Once you've created your party, you'll set out on a series of quests.

Quests in Darkness Dungeon are randomly generated, so each one is a new challenge. You'll need to explore the dungeon, fight monsters, and complete objectives in order to succeed. The game is unforgiving, and even the smallest mistake can lead to your party's death.

That's where the risk-reward system comes in. Taking risks can lead to great rewards, but it can also lead to disaster. For example, you might be able to find a powerful weapon in a dangerous area, but if you're not careful, you could get killed.

Making the best out of a bad situation is also important. If your party is low on health or supplies, you'll need to make tough decisions. Do you risk going deeper into the dungeon to find more resources, or do you retreat and try again later?

Darkness Dungeon is a challenging and rewarding game that will test your skills and patience. If you're looking for a dungeon crawler that will keep you on your toes, then this is the game for you.

Here are some of the pros and cons of Darkness Dungeon:

Pros:

*1000s of hours of game play.
*Addictive
*Challenging and rewarding gameplay
*Randomly generated dungeons
*Varied party members with unique abilities
*Risk-reward system
*Great atmosphere

Cons:

*Can be unforgiving
*Too Addictive
*Some quests can be too difficult
*Can be repetitive",1684223025,1684223025,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Inventory is a huge hassle. There's an intentionally designed tension between carrying enough supplies with you to have what you need and having enough room to carry back treasure. This should be interesting, but in practice it means that you just skip many curios when you don't have the appropriate item because it's not worth subjecting yourself to the whims of RNG. You also constantly have to just throw money and resources on the ground and move on because you can't carry them. The game is balanced around this of course, but it's intentionally balanced to make you feel bad while you drop loot. 

- The ""easiest"" difficulty setting sets you up for failure. Playing on Radiant, the recommended difficulty for first-time players, causes you to level up faster, among some other small bonuses. This leads to inevitably overleveling your characters for the level 1 and level 3 dungeon runs, and being hit HARD when you try to take them into level 5 runs without max gear and skills (that you haven't had time to afford before your characters got to max level.) This can easily lead to your first deaths after an easy run, and a slow, boring grind to get everyone up to speed so you can actually move on. 

- Speaking of grinding, good god. There is a single class that is used for making extra money, so good luck not bringing this extremely underpowered character on every run (it can be made to work well, mostly by literally hiding behind stronger characters.) There is a constant, demanding drain on money that increases every week. For every run where you bring back 20k, there's 2 negative traits and 1 disease that need to be purged. By then, your big payday is 2 upgrades on one of your 20 heroes. Better get back out there immediately!

- RNG is part of just about every aspect of the game. Attacks are dodged frequently, crits are hugely impactful, and whether or not your characters live or die when their health reaches 0 is a dice roll. The game is balanced around this all averaging out, so usually things work out, but the outliers are frustrating and not based on player skill at all. An example from my experience: Party has one healer, this character is hit with an attack that can cause a bleed DoT. The attack crits, one-shotting the healer down to 0 HP (but not killing her, that's a dice roll.) The attack applies a bleed DoT that will tick on her next turn. If another party member can heal her past the amount of 1 tick of the DoT, she is not subject to the death's door dice roll, but there are no other healers so she has to pass the roll and heal herself. Her turn comes up, she fails the roll and is dead with zero input from the player. That this RNG averages out to being balanced over a thousand runs is no consolation for this feeling terrible and giving the player a bad experience. The game is still winnable, I can get another healer, but see all previous points for why recovering from a disaster isn't fun either. 

Maybe they fixed all this in the sequel lol, I won't be finding out.",1684101872,1684101872,False,9,0,0.551221489906311035,0,True,False,False

Seeing the characters suffer afflictions and heart attacks really showcased quite viscerally that humans just have limits for stress and once you reach that, not only does your performance suffer greatly, it can also affect other people. So resting is not only something you do when you feel like you have no other choice, it really is the best, most logical choice for everyone involved.

Beside my personal attachments, it's just fantastic game in general. The combat mechanics are challenging but a lot less RNG prone than you might think at the start once you get some experience and it clicks. The music fucking slaps. It has incredible high replayability, especially with the timeless artstyle and the countless mods that are available. Even though there's little said about the characters, you can easily get attached through the little tidbids of lore and barks...

It is worth your your money for certain, although not necessarily your time as I would not recommend finish it. 

Darkest Dungeon one is, by all criterion, a game that succeeded spectacularly in what it set out to do, which is to put you in a harsh, unforgiving world and allow you to experience what it would be like to truly be a 'hero' in a dark tale. In the first 10 or 20 hours, it is everything a great game should be: reasonably good story well realised by its art style and voice actings, and a passable gameplay that complements each other with the story.

But because this is a harsh, unforgiving, dark world, to actually succeed requires luck, efforts, grinds, and patients, which is the opposite of fun. So once you pass that 20 or 30 hour mark, you will realise that you have got your money worth back, you have stopped to enjoy the combat, but the game is still as frustratingly stubborn to stop you from finishing it to get some closure., and the developers have no intention to alleviate the grinds even after the contents outstay their welcome.

Don't worry about that. When that happens, just close it, watch the ending online, and remember: While the handling of the endgame grinds can be seen as a hit and miss, and the second game might not be to your taste, the first game is, still, a very, very rare daring innovation so hard to find nowadays and a early access done right.

It's a game, certainly, but I can't remember ever once feeling like I was engaged or role-playing in any personal way when I very impersonally weighed the pros and cons of hero management or decided where to spend my upgrade resources. It's an adventurer-management sim with you ""role-playing"" as the inheritor of a terrible legacy which largely consists of feeding meaningless identical ""toons"" into a grid-based meat grinder (that owes more to B.F. Skinner than it does Lovecraft), until luck and RNG-selection leave you with a party capable of tackling the fairly punishing and ultimately unrewarding endgame.

This entire experience feels more like an exploration of the concept of just how little gameplay one can invest into delivering on a game's premise. Do you actually explore a dungeon? Naw, just make it abstract screens and ""event nodes"" on a grid. Well-written characters? Let's see if we can get away with just one (The Ancestor) rather than giving the ""heroes"" any personality or histories beyond vague traits. Plot progression? Erhm, well, let's not go crazy here. World-building? A touch.

I guess it turns out I'd rather be playing an actual dungeon crawler than an abstract simulation of one.

Credit where it's due: the art direction and sound design are great and the turn-based combat is fun...for a while, but the limited enemy variety in each zone makes every area feel really samey, really fast.

Do I regret my time with this game? A little. Is it worth your time? Maybe so if you actually want to play a ""roguelike"" adventurer-management sim with great art and sound, then have at it!",1683612678,1683612678,False,5,1,0.49157637357711792,0,True,False,False

Darkest Dungeon is an incredibly challenging but equally satisfying game to play through. At first glance the game seems incredibly simple with a four hero team with each hero having 4 unique abilities but that barely scratches the surface on what Darkest Dungeon is. Most people will look at the game that way and come to the conclusion that its a RNG grind fest that is more equipment than skill based and that's exactly why less than 3% of steam players have actually beat this game on the standard difficulty. If you give the game a chance and push through the harsh skill curve than Darkest Dungeon is one of the most engaging and satisfying games on the market and it's already 4 years old.

The ring of hard-edged steel and pleading whispers resonate through the darkened halls, almost sinister with promise. Always leading us and solemn, Balian feared not the horrors that slither over the strangely smooth stone. His life was one of luxury, torn asunder by the creeping disease wracking his existence. Veriel's razor sharp daggers and even sharper eyes made sure no treasure or crumbled earth left unturned. Her dark humour almost fitting to the labyrinth we wandered through...she was my favorite. Priest Illith never far behind me, quick to care and even quicker to light a new torch. The gods had fled these lands, but they still hung over her providing cheap respite for us heathens. 

The days had passed and halls blurred together, when we gazed into the darkness...it too gazed back. Screeching flesh, gnashing teeth, and scuttling terrors overwhelmed our camp. Balian stood fast and cleaved through the beasts, sending them back to the abyss that bore them forth. His bronzed plate deflected blow after clawed blow as they tore him apart. A pooled mess of tattered cloth and broken steel was all that remained of him. Illith tried desperately to sustain us as we fled through the eldritch arcades beneath the manor. She fell too...as did our torchlight. As the blazing light of day pierced through small holes before us, we tore at crumbled stone and encased bone. As I heaved the last boulder away, a tentacle wrapped itself around Veriel's leg and wrenched her from my grasp into the growing blackness. Her screams filled existence as she disappeared from view, I ran bleeding and weeping into the safety of daylight.

Seeing your heroes grow, succeed, fail, and die is really an experience I haven't gotten the same anywhere else. From seeing my favorite hero, Mut The Leper, getting killed by a boss I should've retreated from, to my first hero Reynauld getting resurrected 4 consecutive times in a hella rare town event and being there to end the final boss.

Reynauld and Dismas were a unbreakable duo. Ever since the Old Road, every expedition into the maddening realms of the estate they took, they took together. The shared an unbreakable bond- never straying from each other's side. Together they slew the evils that lurked in the shadows; one after another. They virtuously fought even the thing from that unspeakable comet, always cutting losses, regrouping, and returning even stronger. That was, until one fateful expedition into the swine-folk's lair. Early on, they were ambushed by a maddening beast, who single handedly drove the vestal to a heart attack. This was unfortunate, but my overconfidence drove me to press on with only the occultist as a healer. The three marched forth, felling all in their path, though not without grievous injury. Despite the unsightly madness all around, and with the occultist falling to madness, Reynauld remained virtuous and courageous. He was in good health, and mentally steeled for the challenge. But when they ran against one particularly bloodthirsty fiend, the tide turned for the worse. Crit 68! Blight! Reynauld is on death's door! 
""Shall this battle be my last?""
Deathblow!
Dismas's resolve is tested...
Hopeless!
""The things I've done. They pale by comparison...""
Dismas fled that cursed labyrinth, the occultist close behind.
I couldn't bare to lose Dismas. He retired in a sense, only ever going out on the odd farmstead mission.
The loss of Reynauld made me quit for a week, but evenutally I returned. Many hours later, I was apon the final boss and end of my campaign. One last time, I placed Dismas in my party, giving him Reynauld's Hero's Ring that he had had from the very start.
And he was the last one standing.

Kinda a 2D extraction survival type game which I think is neat. But it lacked a certain depth that I couldn't quite put my finger on. It's simple to a flaw.

One of the main differences between this game and others is the Stress System. It's kind of a health metric. If your adventurers get too stressed out, bad things happen.

I like that idea on paper, but the application leaves a lot to be desired. You end up having characters in desperate situations that refuse to receive the support they need to survive. That's part of the stress system. They can be so stressed out that they refuse any form of aid, including counselling (which will reduce their stress). So as the player, you're left to watch a situation devolve into a disaster with zero ability to effect the outcome.

Taking control away from a player is rarely a recipe that results in a quality game mechanic.

The realisation that this game is not for me came after a stupid battle where everything that could go wrong did go wrong and I ended up suffering some loses. The specific losses were not irreplaceable, but the circumstances surrounding them were unacceptable to me, so despite my hatred to do so, I attempted a save scum mid mission to get a restart.

Upon loading back into the game, I found myself mid mission with all casualties still dead. Already on the fence about whether I liked the game or not, that pushed me over the edge. That was the end of my time with Darkest Dungeon and my 50 hour play through. 

I play video games to have fun. Being challenged is part of that fun, but not all of it.  In certain regards this game seems to want to be challenging at the expense of being fun.",1683401484,1683402079,False,5,1,0.524884819984436035,0,True,False,False

But despite its sadistic edge there's so much to appreciate, and it's easy to overlook some minor grievances. The art is beautifully twisted, the presentation slick across the board, the combat deep and engaging, and the city management adds a thoughtful strategic layer on top of what's ultimately an outstanding tactical RPG.

PROS:
✓ Excellent city and party management
✓ Spectacular art direction sells this grim world
✓ Gratifying play that rewards cleverness
✓ Deep, evolving play that encourages broad strategies
✓ Foreboding atmosphere sets a gripping tone of hopelessness
✓ Narration in the game, provided by Lovecraft interpreter Wayne June
✓ The music is delightfully evocative, and the sound effects are top notch
✓ Tens of hours of potential playtime, with almost infinite replayability
✓ 18 different classes to choose from (including DLC heroes)

CONS:
- Interface can be overwhelming
- Death and failure are frequent companions
- RNG is king here, and not usually in favor of the player

Pretty fun. Characters dying isn't as big a problem as you might think since you can just replace them and tailor them back to what you had with a little gold and some XP. You can lose heroes but you keep upgrades in town.

the characters flipping out and developing random nerosis like a drunk hypochondriac on web MD is annoying but in a fun way. Also when three characters flip the fuck out and start hallucinating weird shit and one party member turns heroic instead of a panicking asshole, that's when you really start to like your characters. The satisfaction you get from winning even after you lose a party member is really satisfying. 

What I would add, however is that the difficulty in this game is incredibly dynamic. If you start doing good then the boss of the dungeon will exclusively get crits against you. I was trying to die to test something and it was incredibly hard to die. It really makes the difficulty feel incredibly artificial and I would say that you should go into this for a lovecraft vibe and a good turn based game.

Also I highly recommend modifying the game or downloading mods to make it more fun. Tweaking character abilities is some of the best fun I have with this game.

quick note: the community manager doesn't just lock but deletes posts for very little reason. I made a light hearted post joking about how a boss looks phallic and they deleted it and gave me a warning.

[strike]Makes me want to break my computer due to RNG and other elements of the game that slow down progress or even remove progress for not playing perfectly.

Other people may get off on that but I'm not a masochist.

The general gameplay during dungeons is fine and even fun but the requirement to throw away your adventurers constantly is the complete opposite of intuitive for me. And meta-progression is excruciatingly slow. There's nothing about this game apart from the general dungeon crawl that i find fun at all, it's like slamming your balls into a spike for hours on end and only having minutes of relief afterwards before doing it again; if you're a complete masochist you might enjoy it but it's an absolute turnoff for me.

3/10[/strike]


After a break and some mental preparation I came back to the game with the mindset to not care about any unit below level 3 and that's allowed me to start truly appreciating the game instead of only being angry at it. 

My main issue was that I always played with the goal of losing as few characters as possible; so I went through every dungeon putting maximum effort into preserving lives and I would spend all of my money on reducing sanity and removing disease, which made the already slow progression of the game reduce to a snail's pace. This also made it so that when I did finally end up losing characters I lost a lot more due to the money put into them leveling their equipment and skills, which ended up infuriating me when combined with the massive stress I put myself under by trying to keep everyone alive and sane.

Now playing the game the way it was intended, by only investing in characters once they've been through enough dungeons and leaving the worse ones to leave or die, I actually have some fun with the game. However the meta progression of the game is still extremely slow and to actually build up a team of characters that's level 3+ takes many missions because you'll be going through up to maybe 15 level 0-2 heroes to make a 4 hero level 3 team, and that's not even mentioning how long it'll take to make a team of level 6 characters for the final dungeon. On top of both of those gaining upgrade materials (heirlooms) for your buildings is very slow too, if you're lucky you'll get about 15-20 heirlooms in a mission but it takes ~20-40+ to upgrade a building once; and to build new buildings instead of upgrading existing ones takes 100's of heirlooms which by itself can take ~5+ [u][b]successful[/b][/u] missions on the [u]low[/u] end and ~15-20+ successful missions on the higher end. Keep in mind that the amount of resources you gain and the amount of time each mission takes is dependent on both the level of the mission and the length of the mission, with easy/short missions taking ~10-15 minutes and medium/medium missions taking ~20-25, and i'm assuming that hard/long missions would take 30-40 minutes; so missions get longer to clear the longer and stronger they are, making it take even longer than you would think to get permanent upgrades.

All of this makes the game feel much more like a very grind-y RPG than a rogue-lite to me; as when I think of a rogue-lite I think of a game you can complete on the first run if you're skilled/smart enough that has replayability in the persistent upgrades you can unlock, the different combinations of skills and equipment or characters you can use and unlock, the RNG on the types and numbers of enemies you face, and other randomization factors that make the game unique on each subsequent run without removing the potential for success with enough skill/strategy.

As a rogue-lite I still give the game 3/10 as it still technically fits under the whole ""play from the beginning each time with persistent progression between runs"" definition, but it doesn't allow for game completion without large amounts of grinding and play time even if you know what you're doing (you'll just take less time with prior skill, but still a large amount of time).
But as an RPG i give the game a 7/10 due to the potential for making different teams with different skill focuses and strategies based on the area you go to. The game has a heavy focus on knowing what options your heroes have available, what heroes go together well, what combinations of hero types makes up a good team, what types of enemies are in what area, what types of status effects are in what area, what types of status effects each type of enemy are weak to, and overall how likely it is for you to succeed with each action you take and how much reward you get off of it (risk/reward play). The score is lowered because of just how much time you need to put in to be able to finish the game and the fact that the vast majority of that time will be spent doing very similar and repetitive missions, with the only strategy coming mid-combat and in team preparation.

Recommended for people that like more strategy focused games that they can play by themselves for a very long time. Not recommended for people that want a purely skill based rogue-lite.",1667686138,1683083711,True,0,0,0.500943481922149658,0,True,False,False

You will lose, you will die, and you will wonder what went wrong. To be frank, the game is rather unfair, and yet, I cannot seem to stop playing it.

Darkest Dungeon is a turn based RPG with position based gameplay. That is to say that you make a party of four heroes, each filling one of 4 slots, and they each can only use certain moves in certain slots on certain enemies in other certain spots. Each hero has unique attacks, functions and general roles within said party, meaning that party composition is paramount to success. Each hero has different quirks and stats which affect how they function. Each hero has their own stress meter which fills up as the horrors of adventuring mount, causing negative debuffs which can be game ending if not managed. Each area has a different feel and theme of gameplay, meaning that there is no ideal party, and each enemy and boss is it's own challenge. Many take issue with RNG in the game, which is an understandable issue, although, I believe  the RNG can be fully manageable if prepared for, and that is part of what makes it so compelling.

DD is a rogue-like RPG game with some horror elements where you assume the role of a contractor that hire several heroes in order to purge a homestead from bandits and eldritch-like horrors in order to honor your ancestor, you do that by recruiting some characters and sending them away in randomized-size dungeons to fetch treasures a clear monster that dwell in it. To make that happen you not only hire your group but also manage its equipments and resources in order to raise your chances of success in each adventure, then the group of heroes delves into the respective dungeon in a side-scrolling like interface where it deals with not only monsters but darkness, tension, diseases, traps and anything that fits the medieval adventure trope.

The thing is, despite this game mechanics being simple to learn, the RNG elements on it that ranges from critical hit on attacks to find loot, gets in your way in a very aggressive fashion that may frustrate a lot of your progression and will to go on with it. It wasn't rare the instance on my group was on the edge of being finished by a non-boss enemy and a series of ""misses"" made me pull the group out, while loosing a character, and having my whole progress in that stance being lost. Sure, it also relies on your knowledge of the game and how do you approach each challenge by somehow planning ahead and deduce what will come for you on that expedition, but still I can sometimes see this issue as a non-organic way of the game to present challenge while ""breaking"" some of its concepts, being that it stacks some factors against the player even from the beginning. The above may give me some genuine frustrating moments on the game, but I can't say that it was enough to detract me from the experience, even thought I can see a more casual or less enthusiastic player abandon it for the very reasons stated above.

Despite that, I can easily recommend this game for any RPG lover that seeks some more direct approach on combat or just someone who likes to have some experiments regarding builds and some tactical combinations from other gaming genres. I do not possess the expansions (since I got the interest in this game only now) neither I have played with the mods on the workshop (by the look of them and the number of different content, I assume that this game is very modable and the community seems to uphold that, maybe I will check it out in a next playtime in the future). Do not buy this game if you are not ready to face (un)deserving consequences of your choices. (8.5/10)

Cheers,

Lycan

Edit: I bought the ""Ancestral Edition"", a bundle that have all the expansion on it so let's go to the following

The Shieldbreaker is a new class that whose specialty relies on the front-line dishing damage on high armored enemies while also being mobile on the battlefield. While I kind of like the concept, I don't think that it justifies being a solo DLC, and it should have been integrated with another expansion. (5.5/10)

Crimson Court on the other hand is a solid expansion that bolster several aspects of the game, it delivers a new class, the Flagellant, a strange front line character that relies on self harm while also focuses on dealing constant damage over the turns and requires some building and tactics to push it's potential from ""weird"" to ""good and useful""; The new campaign is focused on the challenges the Crimson Court, a somewhat vampiric wannabe horrors that once were hedonistic noble humans, now they return to the lands of the hamlet in order to install new and gruesome games to satisfy these needs. The courtyard have a few maps to fool around while also offer 3 *very* long and repeatable maps in order to challenge each of the three court members, also giving new enemies and what I consider a divisive factor in the gameplay: The Crimson Curse, a debuff that most likely will hit your heroes making the challenges harder and somewhat more ""unfair"" (sometimes I wished to punch my screen on frustration due to this condition). Despite that, if you are looking for a greater challenge that wasn't felt in the base game (I doubt that someone on their senses would claim this), this one gives enough content to keep you fresh on it. (8.5/10)

The Color of Madness is...weird. It relies in an endless survival dungeon where you face eldritch-like horrors in a progressive fashion where you either pull your character off or let them die to the beings that dwell on it. It introduces a couple new bosses, trinkets and the aforementioned gauntlet-style dungeon to play, which I found...lackluster compared to Crimson Court. This one adds something for the game, but I felt that it was quite poorly implemented, like a great but rushed idea, still it gives enough to claim being an expansion, but underwhelming if compared to its sister product (Seriously, they should have merged the Shieldbreaker in this one to make it worth the price).

I finished the game in the quickened ""radiant"" mode.

[h1]TL;DR[/h1]
I've seen people summarizing Darkest Dungeon as a 10h game stretched to 100h of playtime. My playthrough was only about 40h, but I played in the faster ""radiant"" mode which accelerates the progression, and I was still getting bored around hour 15.

I don't recommend it. It's a grindfest with tons of RNG that will force you to do even more grinding if you get screwed over, so you get double-punished for any RNG failure. The parts of it that are genuinely good are not worth the time commitment this game demands.

But take my opinion with a grain of salt. This game has a massive cult following and me not liking it doesn't change that, so maybe it's worth giving it a chance. But if you end up hating it - drop in a comment here, so I can at least see that I'm not alone. I feel like it takes a specific person to enjoy it and I am not that kind of person.

[h1]Description[/h1]
In Darkest Dungeon you will watch over attempts at purging evil from a mansion and it's surroundings by hiring heroes, commanding them on expeditions and rebuilding the hamlet.

During expeditions, you can move around a dungeon, explore for items and fight enemies. You command up to 4 heroes and all of them will have 4 skills. Your heroes are organized into a column formation and different skills may only be used from a specific spot. For example in order for your healer priestess to be able to heal - she needs to be at the back 2 spots of the formation, but if you want her to be able to hit things with her mace - she needs to be in the front 2 spots. Moving your heroes around and keeping them in correct spots to maximize their effectiveness is key to survival. Your enemies will be using skills to force your party members out of position, so having means to move them using their own skills is a good idea.

Combat is turn-based, with all characters having 1 action they can use to use a skill or move around forward/backward in formation. Attacks will deal damage, apply debuffs or damage over time - the usual RPG stuff. Different enemies have different weaknesses and tactics, but specific areas of the mansion will have themed monsters that you will learn to build your team around. One area may be filled with enemies that are weak to bleed, but resistant to blight damage, while another may be the opposite.

You also have stress mechanic. Most enemy attacks and even exploring itself will put stress on your heroes. Too much stress and they may break, making it difficult for you to finish the mission. You can always retreat in shame to fight another day - at least you retain all the loot you already found.

Once back at hamlet - you can use acquired loot to upgrade various buildings, like Blacksmith who makes upgrades to equipment, or Tavern, which heals stress. This is the main way to progress within the game - embark on expedition, get loot, upgrade Hamlet so that next expedition is easier and cost of healing your surviving heroes is cheaper.

As you complete missions in different parts of the mansion - you will unlock boss encounters, which need to be tackled in order to unlock access to future ones.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[b]+ Style[/b]
Dark-fantasy comic style is very fitting the idea of delving inside dungeons filled with things that murder people.

[b]+ Atmosphere[/b]
It's heavy and desperate. The voice of narrator really helps bring everything together. His comments reveal backstory, offer encouragement or mock your failings.

[b]+ Mechanically sound?[/b]
I guess? It must be doing something right when it comes to mechanics, since I didn't hate it for the first 15h and later I got bored not because of the mechanics, but because of constant repetition.

Learning what game has to offer is pretty fun. It's just a shame that there's all-in-all not that much to learn at all.

[b]+ Mods[/b]
This is the only reason I might play another round. There are all kinds of mods, from QoL features like bigger stacks of items or new classes to mods that add spice in from of nudity. You can turn most monsters into half-naked anime waifus if you so desire.

Really just for that this game gets a +1 to the score, as we all know - tits make everything better.

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[b]- Padded[/b]
Between grinding for upgrade materials/gold, grinding away at hero levels, replacing dead ones and unlocking access to new areas - this game requires a lot of playtime. There is not enough unique content to warrant this amount of repetition in a tactical game based on RNG. Darkest Dungeon relies solely on novelties to keep me interested, and you hardly see or experience anything new after first 10h, but you still have at least 3x as much game in front of you. Even bosses are reused several times over.

[b]- RNG[/b]
This game's challenge is solely based on RNG and preparation knowledge. Once you know what heroes, skills and items to pick - there's little in terms of tactical decisions to make during actual combat. Most encounters are trivial if you picked correct party and there are party setups that can deal with pretty much anything in the game, so there's little reason not to take them if you're unsure of what's coming. Bosses require a bit more specific setup, but knowing that requires you to throw your best party in blind and hope for the best.

So what you are left with for challenge is just RNG, which can screw you over at no fault of yours. Many times you will have to retreat from the dungeon before completing the objective, because RNG can push your party beyond the point at which it's reasonable to continue. There were points where I lost an important hero to a bad RNG string and that resulted in having to retrain a new one in their place, which pads the game even more. It can take many hours to bring a new character up from 0 to max level.

You cannot win with RNG. You can try to mitigate it, but it's always there, looming over you, waiting to drop onto you like a ton of bricks. And when it does and you end up losing a hero or two - you get set back for hours of grinding.

[b]- UI[/b]
Grid inventory is unnecessary since all items take same amount of space. Hamlet's roster of heroes gets incomprehensible at some point when you have too many.

[b]- Story[/b]
As straightforward and predictable as it gets. There are very few mysteries to uncover and most of it isn't very interesting. Writing is passable at best.

[b]- Items[/b]
Tons of bad items and obtaining good ones is based on RNG, prolonging the grindfest.

Really the main issue for me is the padding combined with RNG difficulty. If the game was less padded and didn't punish you with hours of grind for a bad string of RNG - I'd probably be less bored with it. Unfortunately making a game like this - a simplified turn-based classic-positional-dungeon-crawler RPG - makes it so it cannot by definition rely on skill. It has to be knowledge-based difficulty, where the only thing stopping you from winning is how much you know about what you will encounter.

So... while I do think Darkest Dungeon does a lot of stuff right, mainly it's core mechanics, I also have to say I didn't have much fun for the majority of it's elongated playtime.

I'd give Darkest Dungeon a
[h1]7/10[/h1]
This score may be misleading. I rate games based on how well they achieve what they set out to (usually, sometimes I just don't understand what the game wanted to be at all). But I still don't recommend it - why? Because it's a huge time sink and most of it was not fun for me. Just repeatable tasks with same 2 or 3 parties that worked for me over and over again until I finally had enough items and upgrades to tackle something new.",1682622960,1682672479,False,2,1,0.511136174201965332,0,True,False,False

There is no bad hero/character, as they can fit in different parties, accommodating for a variety of playstyles. The DLC is hard, but worth it, and the multiplayer is balanced, despite having my ass handed to me from people with more knowledge about the game.

1. The atmosphere. This game will suck you in. The theme and mechanics mix perfectly, putting you and your team on a mission where pushing your luck is fraught with danger but is needed. Desperate times and all that. And who can forget the narrator? The narrator is the best thing in this whole game. 

2. The mechanics themselves. I normally don't like mechanics that include a chance to miss. Having a great plan and having it foiled by dumb luck feels bad. This game makes it work. The whiffs are rarely game ending, (though there is always that one), and play to the atmosphere the game creates. They're even offset by how good this game makes a Crit feel. It's visceral, and you, the narrator, and your team will rejoice.

This game is great. Turn based combat feels good, animation is iconic and well done, atmosphere is off the charts, and team structure allows for both creativity and strategic planning. With a good plan and a good team, success is clearly in view.

Or is it merely a trick of the light?

...OK but seriously the narrator (and the game) is fantastic.

Two blood relatives arrive at what appears to be leftover ruins of their family heritage. Despite huge differences between them, your goal is to lead them to the very end. You command up to 4 mercenaries in turn based combat, that will search a couple of areas in search of family heirlooms, riches and plenty of fights, until they are strong enough to take on Darkest Dungeon. You will face several types of enemy families like undead, beasts, humans and abominations. Needs of your mercenaries and their sanity are also a factor. Maybe it's cheaper to kick them out once their end their usefulness? 

Pros:
+ Several classes / heroes (expanded with DLC and MODS)
+ Each dungeon has ""unique"" enemies and represent different challenges
+ At first appear unfair
+ Narrator, music, style, feel, injury and despondence set the stage for heroism or cowardice
+ Decision making. Do You take the loot, heirloom pieces or save your people?
+ Lore
+ Virtue system
+ Overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer
+ Progression
+ Bloodsuckers are cool

Cons:
- Really bad RNG can kill even the mightiest hero
- My Vestal had 59 bleeding at one point
- Bad town management system
- Sudden FPS drop when trying to hire crystal mercenaries (nothing big)
- Can be devastating when You lose
- Mercenaries with conditions refusing to be healed, help or self-skipping turns when on dead door is really irritating

I really recommend to give it a try. Despite getting bored out after each 20 hours, I'll come back to this game. I could really experience the rainbow spectrum of emotions, I could only wish for better immersion perhaps? Will always remember how my Crusader when under mindcontrol, was self healing and stealing buffs from enemies rather than attacking friends. The game is less and less unfair the more familiar You get with it, especially bosses.

[h3]FULL REVIEW[/h3]
I'm going to say this up front: I save scummed the shit out of this game, and I don't feel one iota of remorse. Overall, the game has a lot of fun elements to it, but the fun parts are dwarfed by the stress and frustration that it creates due to poor design choices, mostly those that were added post-alpha. Pre-alpha the game was a lot of fun, often pitting the player into darkness but giving them eventual hope and opportunities to climb out of it. Post-alpha the player is pushed into a well with no rope to climb back up. The game is built to be challenging, but what Darkest Dungeon delivers is an iron maiden of epic proportions: the more you play, the more you bleed out what little energy you have left to come back and get slapped in the face by the massive amounts of RNG you have to rely on.

Darkest Dungeon pits players against a perpetually stacked deck, which only gets worse the longer you play. The game is built to put the PCs into a dying state quickly and often, which is compounded upon by the heart attack mechanic. Introduced sometime after alpha, and a longstanding point of contention, heart attacks cause a PC to instantly enter a dying state, regardless of health, or die permanently if they are already dying. Because of this, often times the game ends up chaining multiple events together that can easily wipe a party, regardless of how well you are doing.

Sanity loss for PCs leads to afflictions, which basically makes the given PC suicidal for the rest of the dungeon. More often than not an afflicted PC will skip their turn, refuse healing, shift the party order around, or somehow injure or debuff themselves. It would be one thing if an affliction only caused one of these things, or even if there was a limit as to how often they could happen, but instead they often happen in succession, which causes other party members to lose sanity and gain an affliction, and the cycle repeats. This quickly leads to an entire party wiped because 75% of your turns are either skipped or used to re-arrange heroes because they can't do anything else (not even defend). This is, in short, not fun whatsoever.

Aside from the in-dungeon frustrations, the game also has a level restriction on those that can enter the dungeon, with PCs claiming that they ""wouldn't learn anything from the experience"", or some other ridiculous reasoning. This is actually probably my biggest gripe, even moreso than heart attacks. This level restriction makes it extremely frustrating to try and level up other heroes to replace the ones that die or are otherwise unable to function for the dungeon. Unfortunately, it appears that the lowest level dungeons are also the least well balanced, so the player is forced to trudge through them again and again, re-living the nightmares they thought they had previously overcome.

Overall, I do like Darkest Dungeon, when the dice are in my favor. When they aren't (which is ~75% of the time, it seems), the game is just an unending stream of frustration. The thrill, charm, and balance this game had with heroes constantly teetering on the brink of death in pre-alpha has given way to the hopelessness and malaise introduced with the post-launch changes, and given that I play games to relieve stress and have fun, this is the opposite of the desired result. As such I cannot recommend that others willingly subject themselves to it, however if you do make sure you keep the lights on and bring a lot of torches.",1463372584,1682452266,False,204,11,0.568156301975250244,0,True,False,False

Darkest Dungeon was designed to create frustrating moments. 2 systems are at odds here, one asking you to not invest too much time or effort in each hero because they could die at any time, the other requiring powerful advanced heroes to advance through later levels. Where these two systems meet is your high leveled highly invested character dying with little fanfare for a reason that was outside of your control setting you back minutes or hours of game-time. 

You could focus on advancing the town to get more powerful heroes to start out with but the resources used to upgrade the town are drip-fed so slowly that you are all but forced to advance characters as you farm materials and will inevitably end up losing time and effort to a death that may have been unavoidable. This being long before they are reasonably 'replaceable' to the degree the game seems to expect them to be because you are always behind the curve, leaving you at a painful deficit that means you end up losing whatever momentum you had going and have to go back to doing boring 'easy' quests just to grind up new heroes to take on... maybe you can see the problem with the overall gameplay loop now. It's not based on fun, it's based on pain. I don't have any problem with difficulty, I've played tons of difficult games in the past, but I've rarely felt so out of control and frustrated in any of these experiences. I feel no desire to better my 'skill' or to be frank try again and pray for better luck to take on the challenges, I just don't want to play anymore.

an excellent turn based strategy game with lots of depth. you will never stop learning about this game, the skill ceiling is very high. many people think this game is too challenging, and i think this is somewhat overblown. the game will punish you if you're not prepared, and in the beginning you won't know much, but you will learn fast. losing characters is okay, do not get too upset, the stagecoach always comes with more new classes to try. half the fun of this game is building and trying new team compositions, so don't get attached to one class! (unless it's the leper). the short term strategy of each fight and dungeon mesh expertly with the long term strategy of building your hamlet, and all of the DLC is incredible.

the aesthetic of the game is really remarkable, there aren't many games like it. it takes a lovecraftian gothic horror, combines with the most interesting parts of history, and builds a vague story structure more focused on feeling than detail. the visuals of the wood-cut art design with such dramatic shadow are a perfect match. and the part that brings it all together, the incredible voice actor Wayne June narrating the highlights of your journey. you will be quoting the voice lines to yourself while playing, they're incredibly memorable and masterfully written.

truthful review here: darkest dungeon is a pain in the ass. The ideas and gameplay are really great, but the whole experience is bogged down by rng-heavy bullshit mechanics. Only play this game if you're prepared for a long grind, and potentially the death of your greatest heroes simply because the game decided that you should die. I can't imagine what the game would be like on hard mode. 

Darkest Dungeon is almost perfect, but I think it needs some more work in some places. The whole point of videogames is to feel powerful, to feel like you're growing and changing with time. That's the fun part. In Darkest Dungeon, you make so much progress only for your hero to get crit and die of bleed damage, causing your entire party to lose their minds and die of stress.

The gameplay loop starts to click and off you go dwelling into brutal dungeons, leveling up your characters to go through even harder dungeons or steamroll through easier ones to get some easy smeckels to upgrade your little town. At least that's how I experienced it and it was pretty nice. The game is unapologetically unfair at times but it fits well into the grim dark lovecraftian theme, you don't have full control over what happens just like you wouldn't in real life, you're just supposed to make the most of it, it's pretty immersive which I respect.

That being said, the game simply outstays its welcome. After a certain amount of hours it gets tedious and it never really feels as if you're making significant progress. You hit a wall and you're left to grind for trinkets and stuff so you can get the edge over the endlessly brutal dungeons to get some more loot and story exposition. The gameplay loop also gets old, you're constantly doing the same thing over and over, and while there's variety in characters and especially comps, it can't hold my interest in the gameplay loop.

Now Darkest Dungeon has too many arbitrary restrictions in place just to waste your time. You can't do lower level dungeons with a high level character. You retreated from a specific battle, we'll just randomly kill off your healer. That's another 3h of grinding for your, lol.

The community is constantly putting out new mods, which adds a lot of flair to the game, so there is a ton of replay value. The recent Black Reliquary overhaul which was released a few months ago just shows how much fans love the game.

Its so grindy without mods to the point where I'm obviously not even remotely strong with 20 hours of grind and over half of that was with mods that increase reward gains and give no penalty to swapping the 4 items for upgrades.

I get that bad rolls will happen, that bad planning is part of learning, and that you're supposed to make the most of a dire situation, but there comes a point where its just unfun. The rolls are anywhere between inconsistent and completely against you, even with high resolve characters.

Currently, I've tried to make the game less harsh by adding mods, stuff like no negatives to trinkets (I personally despise any game that does this, not just DD) and not gaining negative quirks on successful missions, to try to push me to actually complete quests. I've already learned from a lot of annoying mistakes, but in the incident above, there was no indication that was going to happen... at all. I already knew what the boss was, as it was level 3, and had a completely over-leveled group with gear and trinkets as best as I could possibly give them.",1681879259,1681879340,False,2,0,0.496183216571807861,0,True,False,False

You remember our venerable house, opulent and imperial, gazing proudly from its stoic perch above the moor.

I lived all my years in that ancient rumor-shadowed manor, fattened by decadence and luxury. And yet, I began to tire of... conventional extravagance. Singular unsettling tales suggested the mansion itself was a gateway to some fabulous and unnameable power.

With relic and ritual, I bent every effort towards the excavation and recovery of those long buried secrets, exhausting what remained of our family fortune on... swarthy workmen and... sturdy shovels. At last, in the salt-soaked crags beneath the lowest foundations, we unearthed that damnable portal of antediluvian evil. Our every step unsettled the ancient earth, but we were in a realm of death and madness! In the end, I alone fled, laughing and wailing, through those blackened arcades of antiquity, until consciousness failed me.

[h1] Art and UI [/h1]

The art style is frankly brilliant. It is unique yet familiar to anyone who has played darker settings or checked RPG art of dark stories. The animation in battle does a lot with very little, very dynamic.

I'd say the only real place where the art itself seems to blend is on the quests menu, it is pretty for an image, but as a map it is terrible, nothing is memorable, you don't remember where was your last mission unless you focus the green dots  you click like constellations.

UI-wise... I'm not impressed. Maybe it is my ADHD talking but... it sucks. Due to having so many details, I had difficulty finding what is just locked in the UI, what is just for looks, and what the game just didn't tell me it was there. This is very noticeable on the town, extending from the places, to how to make the character menus overlap and interact with inventory and so on.

In combat, it is even worse. Some might figure the equips and uses immediately, some don't, the major issue is how the spells have their effects listed line by line without context and you're just thrown to test them. The game sets you up for failure not because of difficulty but because you need to test them out, leading to a bad run. You just can't properly work with the information you're given until you get used to it.

It tries to save space on screen for no reason, using abbreviations and so on that you're supposed to know from reading about them elsewhere, on another menu.

A good example of a character I couldn't figure out how to work was the something-arbalest. All i could do was throw flares, i didn't know if i needed to buy ammo for the others to work, if i needed someone else to get a mark and i just fdidn't have them on team, or i just got very unlucky to not have a character with the mark spell unlocked.

4 hours in and I still don't know if I could camp or just didn't get there yet. I just could not find the button even when in the tutorial with the lodge i had to carry.

[h1] Combat and Level Design [/h1]

That one is the most disappointing. But let's start with the good first:

While characters don't have a personality, their quirks become rather interesting initiatives. Either them being masochists or deciding to take the lead to hit or heal someone, is nice. After you learn by testing how some skills work in movement, you very easily get into some combo ideas, and start repeating the classes you know to sit on the village so you can keep a solid strategy.

There is also a very clear decision that while many characters aren't made to deal that much damage early on, even tanky, heavy hitting characters can take a support build, and when a character is mostly a support, they become weirdly dynamic in the simple positioning of the game.

With that said, positioning being worth an action feels like a waste of time. Especially when characters can be fearful and retreat, or get pushed. The masked-bard that looks like a ygo card is great to prevent that (he'll move to the front and his finishing move makes him go back), but if your bruiser retreats, she is dead weight.

Sometimes very early on you're on a dungeon, you did everything right and you get wiped out because a lot of conditions and stuff. It happens very quickly and while the premise of the game is that you're not safe, not being communicated more clearly on why the difficulty curve suddenly spiked is very frustrating.

When the game is just being hard, however, the tension is perfect, you're carefully making moves, trying to keep everyone safe, dealing with the unpredictable and tracing patterns. You're not even frustrated with reinforcements of another 4 enemies or a critical hit. That seems to be the intention of the gameplay loop, and it is VERY engaging.

You really have to outweight the mission and the value of your characters, how much can they handle, so on.

[h1] What made me quit [/h1]


Heart attacks are such a random BS. I was on a great clear, with no character getting less than 70% of their HP down, they got stressed right close to the end (that was a very early, very brief quest), but I played worse, then suddenly on a fight with full buffs, no bleeding, no poison, not even worry because the HP of the enemies was very low at their max, Two characters have a heart attack.

Their HP went from 90% to 0, [b]I had no idea that was a thing[/b], I just thought something bad happened when the stress hit 200 points, but I wasn't even there.

I try to recover, fight a bit, but when I see it is a lost cause i manage to leave combat. The characters that were healed have a second heart attacks, and PERISH. Then the third character that was fine the whole battle suddenly dies from a heart attack.

This is very different from when a game throws you a curve ball or you're in say, a monster-house on pokemon MD. You're very early on, you're learning the game, and suddenly something you didn't know was possible ruins the flow of the game, you're not instructed on how to deal with this.

If I just lost because it was difficult I'd just grind my teeth and move on, but I don't want to be invest hours in a game that just feels like gambling because I didn't know something was a thing,

A few tips: 

Axe-lady is by far the most interesting character to collect, giving you several build options, odin-like warrior is a second close, and the tentacle guy is a great support, merchant sucks to heal but can deal damage very fast on the backline.",1681494691,1681494691,False,3,0,0.502583980560302734,3,True,False,False

It requires a lot of dedication and acceptance that things will not be good sometimes, but it's pretty easy to get back on track (just make sure you have at least a couple thousand gold). Each hero and enemy is meticulously handcrafted to feel exactly how they're supposed to. Every move, every design, every  detail is honed to the point where you don't feel like you're just managing expendable pawns, and you aren't discouraged from leveling or progressing in the game at all. 
The way each hero is tuned to accommodate the game's many mechanics (Chad Inspiring Tune Enjoyer) blends the game's strategy and plain old gung ho moments. Heroes will always die, but the feeling of journeying with each one, whether it be scrounging for artifacts on a quest (or finding 60 crests in a single run), having to painstakingly cure each disease your hero has, or fine tuning their equipment and moves to suit your bloodthirst, you really feel like you're making the game your own. Each quest, despite being the same explore/battle/collect system, is made so unique with each new encounter. 
The DLCs are perfect. They mirror the challenging yet rewarding feel of the base game 1:1. You can't even try to be bored, or stuck with this game. Red Hook thought of everything to the point where it pops up right when you think it'd be convenient for it to, like the crystal mercenaries or the ability to cure diseases while camping (just don't run out of gold. It's a bit tricky to bounce back from that). There's always new events and opportunities waiting for you, localized entirely in your quaint little hamlet and horrifying inherited estate.

I'm not gonna go into detail about what this game does, the description (and other reviews) do a far better job...

One thing you need to be OK with before you consider this game is the concept of chance.
Sometimes the game feels out of your control. You can spend your time having fun micro-managing every aspect of your heroes and party, spending your gold on upgrading gear & skills and generally having fun with the game's RPG elements, only to have your progress wiped out by.... basically bad odds. Get ""surprised"" by a group you'd normally be able to take on easily ? A couple of ""misses"" at the wrong time in a close fight ? Sometimes your fate feels at the mercy of RNG Jesus, something i could not abide by.
Also, some of the Boss encounters are absolutely ridiculous and will frustrate the hell out of you. You'll see your best party just melt in front of you, losing all that gold you invested in training and all your fancy trinkets and all that time you invested into carefully tweaking every hero without actually understanding what more the game expects of you. 
One last thing to be aware of: you can absolutely screw your entire save over (usually if you run out of gold). Doing missions rewards gold but they also cost gold. Not only do you have to buy supplies for your mission but your heroes accumulate stress, contract diseases and/or gain negative quirks, all of which will cost gold to get rid of. You will have missions that you will lose money on, and a couple of bad ones in a row can easily bankrupt you, meaning you'll have to start the next on without any supplies, which in turn makes it more likely to fail and so on until you fall into a black hole of progression out of which you can barely dig yourself out of.",1681428677,1681428677,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

I'm a lover of visual style, so I like to mention that first in a lot of my reviews.

Art style: It's like paper, everything is flat but positioned and animated to look somewhat 3D. Most of the side scroller games I have played look boring (except for the Lisa trilogy). This game looks decent, besides the surprisingly very simple and terrible home screen. I love the art style. It is very detailed and does a good job at creating a dark vibe.

Narrator: He is a bit repetitive, but at the same time, he says enough different things and he says some cool things. 

Details: Every hero has information and lore (A brief description) about them, and there is different information about them for each menu you are in. Unlike a lot of games, this game actually tells you a lot, there is even a glossary of terms. I like the dialogue the Heroes have. I don't think they actually talk to each other but they do just say shit every now and then. There are animations for characters just standing there and very cool animations for every single action. The standing still animation is just bobbing up and down but I don't know what else you'd do to make characters look alive. The plague doctor kind of looks like one of those women in silk clothes that do that side to side dancing thing with their hips (I don't know what you call those people). The plague doctor reminds me of that. I find the most random comparisons in every game I play. I could be playing a wholesome game and think - you know that one tiny detail reminds me of a horror movie. Then there's that one guy who is always leaning on his dog like he's a cripple that uses the dog for stability. He must have bad back problems because he never stands up properly. 

Other: Hotkeys, shortcut keys and the UI is all decent and helpful. 

Music: Repetitive, but good enough - fits the theme
Sound effects: Very good

[b]Other[/b]

One direction: I am not talking about that one boy band. I mean the characters hate moving to the left of the screen (they move slowly) and only face to the right. 
Font: The in-game title and header fonts are decent. Some body text is a bit boring.

The interaction range or whatever tf it's called could be better. I be spamming W sometimes and adjusting position until the object is actually interacted with. But doorways are fine - you get close enough and you can just go through

The option to continue exploring or gtfo out of the place pops up before you open the chest in the room. Le bruhski, that should pop up after. That would make more sense. Collect from that one chest then ask if the player wants to leave.

Also: Before I hover over the portraits of some heroes, it shows some kind of monster before changing back to the hero. That's creepy.",1681401723,1681401723,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

When you combine this with very slow gameplay (waiting for combat to switch between characters) and load times I truly don't understand for a simple game this becomes an exercise in waiting, boredom, frustration and praying for good RNG.

If you wanna try playing something almost identical to it, there's a way to do it for only one cent. Simply flip the coin; if it's heads, you win and everybody is happy. Tails, you lose and you can try again.

Seriously, though, 90% of the game is dictated by dice rolls. There are certainly some levels of strategy, team building, and upgrades, but overall it's just dice rolls. Unlike good RPG's, you can't do much of anything to affect those dice rolls. It's quite possible that it becomes more affected by choice later on, but certainly in the beginning, choices don't matter at all. Why play a game where your choices make no difference? You get just as much enjoyment out of watching someone else play, because choice genuinely doesn't matter.

I had really high hopes for this game, and it looks so great - both the art style, and the gameplay in general. But in practice, the game completely fails to deliver. I wish I had a game that was exactly like Darkest Dungeon in every way, just it punished you for having poor tactics instead of punishing you for simply playing the game.

The detailed and intricate artwork creates a haunting atmosphere that fits perfectly with the game's dark and challenging gameplay.

Challenging Gameplay: The gameplay in Darkest Dungeon is notoriously difficult, which makes it all the more satisfying when you succeed. Players must manage their resources carefully and make tough decisions that can have permanent consequences for their characters. The game's RNG-based mechanics mean that even the best-laid plans can go awry, adding to the game's tension and sense of unpredictability.

Deep Lore and Storytelling: Darkest Dungeon has a rich and detailed backstory, which is revealed through cryptic notes and journal entries scattered throughout the game. The game's narrator, voiced by Wayne June, adds to the atmosphere and storytelling by providing ominous commentary on the player's actions.

Hero Customization: Players can customize their heroes' skills, abilities, and equipment to suit their playstyle, making each playthrough feel unique. The game's diverse roster of heroes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, adds to the variety and replayability of the game.

Sound Design: Darkest Dungeon's sound design is exceptional, with eerie music, haunting sound effects, and the aforementioned narrator's ominous voice all contributing to the game's atmosphere and immersion.

Overall, Darkest Dungeon is a well-crafted game that combines challenging gameplay, unique art style, deep storytelling, and excellent sound design to create an unforgettable gaming experience.",1681200152,1681200152,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I played for over 100 hours on Epic, and eventually just had to get the DLCs and everything on steam as well. It's strategic, ruthless, unforgiving, and frustrating. It's heavily RNG based, but balanced well enough that you can negate 95% of it with sufficient skill. For me, it goes up there with other strategy masterpieces like FTL, XCOM and such. And it does an INCREDIBLE job at setting up the atmosphere. Wayne June's voice lines have leaked into my every day life so much so that my friends and family start questioning my sanity from time to time. The amazing narration coupled with the terrific music and immersive artstyle makes Darkest Dungeon a masterclass in immersive atmosphere. Every lost and every win feels so much more impactful with the occasional gloomy commentary from the ancestor, together with the grim music. It's not a game for everyone, but it is a must play for anyone who enjoys the rougelike/turnbased/permadeath styles. Absolute gem, and one of my favorite games of all time.

- The game fails to keep me personally interested as I already have seen every talents/skill and acquired every class but one. (maybe)

- My characters get random negative debuffs at the very end of each mission which isn't explained how it was attained.

- Bettering my characters via weapons/armor feels like an unfair grind as I have to slog through dungeons over and over for GOLD which I don't find fun as I'm risking their lives to make them better. With GOLD.

- If you don't have proper knowledge of how sanity works, increasing roster size for carriage, stress relief, team management, you will find yourself restarting with new saves a lot.

- Now let's not forget gold management as to how on edge you need to be with spending, mainly because if you have a lack of gold you cannot get certain things which are required for doing more missions: Torches, shovel, food, etc. If you fail to have at least 6 torches, 1 shovel and 8 food you risk failing the WHOLE mission due to climbing stress, not enough light and losing sanity from clearing obstacles without a shovel.

(CONTINUED)  Let's say I send a team of 4 on a mission with 100% sanity and they are my only 4 heroes. I buy them 8 food, 6 torches and 1 shovel. That's more that 1000 gold, right? Hopefully the mission isn't too harsh and they come back with 6000 gold (high average for me) and all of them have medium to high sanity loss. I send 2 to the pub and 2 to the church (not 100% possible because of caretaker). Easy 3000 gold. One of them has a disease which reduces their stats by a lot. 750-1000+ gold. Reynauld is also a f*cking kleptomaniac but I cannot cure him for 1500-5000 gold because it would make me go broke. Due to him being a kleptomaniac I probably lost money and equipment that would've helped on the recent mission so that makes things worse. 

Do you get where I'm going with this?

Please understand that I like this game and it's provided content but I was trying to find a game that respects both player interest and player time, not be introduced to a possible pain fetish game.

You level up characters, then they die and you need to start basically all over again and level up more characters. Yea ok its fun for a bit, but the amount of fun you have dosent trump the insane frustration you go thru when a high level character dies. Not worth your time really.

EDIT:

I have decided after about another 20 or so hours of gameplay that i am going to change my review to a positive one. I decided to over obsess about figuring out team builds, studying peoples moves and how to create a solid team that meshes well with one another. Now that i have gotten the hang of building proper teams and figuring out how all the moves work (buffs, marking, healing ect.) I am having a MUCH more enjoyable experience. As of right now about 40 hours in i am finding that the only thing that is REALLY frustrating me at this point are my characters sanity levels. They climb so fast its difficult to keep sane and when they max out your character can die of a heart attack so its basically like having to manage 2 life bars. Aside from that.... not to shabby.

THE GRAPHICS ARE AWESOME, THEY'RE GOTHIC AND SORT OF SIMPLE, BUT AT THE SAME TIME REALLY DETAIL-ORIENTED. AND THE SOUNDTRACK IS LIKE SUPER EPIC AND ATMOSPHERIC, IT REALLY ADDS TO THE GAMEPLAY EXPERIENCE.

BUT LIKE, THIS GAME CAN BE PRETTY TOUGH SOMETIMES. YOUR HEROES CAN DIE AND STUFF, AND IT CAN BE REALLY HARD TO KEEP THEM ALIVE. YOU HAVE TO MANAGE THEIR STRESS LEVELS AND MAKE SURE THEY DON'T GO CRAZY, WHICH IS KIND OF A CHALLENGE.

BUT OVERALL, I THINK ""DARKEST DUNGEON"" IS PRETTY GOOD. IT'S NOT LIKE THE BEST GAME EVER OR ANYTHING, BUT IF YOU'RE INTO GOTHIC RPGS AND LIKE TOUGH CHALLENGES, YOU'LL DEFINITELY ENJOY IT.

Guess what it's one long fight with no respite OOOPSIE did we do absolutely nothing to explain that to you before you launched your mission with exactly the wrong party for it? 

Holy shit, I get this is a tough game but going from playing at release to adding a bunch of DLC just means you get to waste tons of runs and probably have to restart games as it introduces the new mechanics which if you're not prepared for, completely derail you. Guess I should have done extensive research on how to play the DLC before playing the DLC.

Super frustrating when it just keeps happening over and over sandbagging a new start, then starting over, and OH YOU FUCKING IDIOT YOU DIDNT KNOW THIS MECHANIC YOU 100% HAVE TO PREPARE FOR BECAUSE WE DIDNT DO SHIT TO EXPLAIN IT TO YOU! HA YOU IDIOT! fuck this game.

You prepare for a boss fight lvl 6 (max lvl) and there are just too many RNG (random number generator --> crit chance, evasion, defense). 

[b] For example: [/b] ""The collector"" (a random spawnign boss) - that i defeated already btw - occurs in a difficult big dungeon, where I even struggle to not to lose too much HP/Building up stress to be able to fight the boss at all. You can flee from the fight but you cannot progress in the dungeon and have to quit.

That means u have to do all the work again to be proper prepared for a hard boss fight.
Plus, RNG has too much effect on the game (like this random spawning boss --> btw he occured the first time as i had just lvl 1 characters which cannot compete with him --> quit dungeon or lose all party members). Means, a poor creep skeleton crits you 3 times and u actualyl have to leave the dungeon, heal, cure deseases and stress. Crits also build up stress, so u lose a lot of money which u have to grind in every single dundeon ur fighting in.

--> Circle of grinding and meaningless time wasting masochism.

Too much for me!

This is a game that offers players a glossary of terms used to describe its various mechanics. Exploring the Dungeons of the fallen estate evokes a sense of immense danger since you're never quite sure what traps or monsters could lurk around the corners. After familiarizing oneself with the game mechanics for a few hours, the game starts to reveal itself as one that offers plenty of depth for players to explore. In spite of its steep learning curve, this game can be rewarding for those brave enough to bear the challenge. However, the gloom and doomed atmosphere of this game isn't for the faint of heart. Personally, I don't always find myself looking forward to barely surviving the game's dungeons, if at all. However, RPG fans may be in for a gothic treat! 

This is a game that manages to feel fresh even after 10 hours of playing. This isn't a game that derives its challenge by simply throwing enemies with an unfair amount of HP at players. Inventory management, positioning, and equipping yourself with the right crew members all play a role in this experience.

At the start of a run it is pretty fun, but after maybe 10 hours it devolves into a repetitive and boring grind. You will be running the same few dungeons over and over again. Bosses get repeated several times each. A lot of dungeon layouts force you to do unavoidable backtracking through empty hallways for no reason. It is often correct to drag out combat for several turns to get a few extra heals off, since you can't use them out of combat. The game is hell-bent on stretching itself out and wasting your time. Contrary to what a lot of people say, it is not that challenging of a game. It is just tedious and overstays its welcome by about 50 hours. Difficulty is not the reason only 4% of players have bothered finishing a full campaign.

The punishment of misplaying can be a bit too much for some people, and learning multiple complex game mechanics is not something many people are willing to do. However, although it took me a while to get into this game, I absolutely adore it. I do not consider myself an RPG fan, but this game is still incredibly enjoyable for me. The Lovecraftian theme of the game is amazingly immersive and grim, and will not get boring after hundreds of hours. The main mechanics are woven together so beautifully, and everything feels almost perfectly balanced. I think the best way to demonstrate is that there is over a dozen character classes, all playing completely different. and every single one is on par power-wise. The biggest problem beginning players seem to have with darkest dungeon is the RNG, but this is usually able to be solved with proper knowledge and planning. Sometimes however, you may not be able to afford that weapon upgrade, or the trinket you want from the trinket shop, and these little differences make up the challenge of the game. Almost every situation (spare the final area) can be made much easier with the proper forethought. There is always the risk of things going south however, and this makes the game feel constantly tense and exciting. This game is punishing. Very punishing. Losing hours of grinding because your strongest character died punishing. Oh yeah, this game has permadeath. if the character you sunk thousands of gold into dies you are not getting them back. Overall, Darkest Dungeon offers an experience like no other, and is one of my new favorite games of all time.

Does playing a game of D&D with a brutal dungeon master that hates you while rolling weighted dice appeal to you?  Pick up the game.

Lovecraft would turn in his grave; imagine if the yacht was sunk by rabid dolphins before even reaching R'lyeh.

Do yourself a favor and try out Sunless Sea instead.  That game has all of these elements but actually implements them well and TELLS A STORY.

Trust me when I say, if you're failing, there's something that you're not understanding about the game.

The features are confusing at first, the town as well, don`t know where to buy all your pagan stuff and other things. The game mechanics began to feel exaggerated for some reason. Too hard even on normal, as a cheap or out of control thing. It was so annoying that I was planning to thumb it down or refund.

Then ""The Butcher's Circus"" (some multiplayer form) keeps suggesting to activate DATA COLLECTION and popping up on screen. At first, it is mandatory to activate it. They let you deactivate it later, but it is obligatory all the same. Another corpo rat dictating what's best for me and my computer. After the game's success, someone decided to suck more money.

Then maybe by the destiny, astral congruence or some subtle CTD, I gave the game another chance. I can divide in 3 parts why I keep playing this. If you consider features report some sort of technical spoiler, then don't read it. But there is no story spoiler.

[olist]

[*]✞ This game is about imperfect heroes. An imperfect narrator describes some of your current actions, combat status and performance, yours or enemies`s, or things you do or take [b]with great voice acting.[/b] It feels specially satisfying when you do something right. Narrative is impressive, for many times I had this feeling I was reading those infamous interactive gothic books ""if you choose right, go to page 40."" Then, ""The hero found nothing but death.""  

Voice acting is only good on the original main game, the rest feels rushed. Like done in a hurry to please the business model wishes.

Time to roll the dices. The RPG is good thanks to the turn-based battles and this British, somber looking artwork staight out of some sick fairy-tale. It is cute and at the same time disgusting. Pretty much like Fable series artwork, only disgruntled. These things alone already makes the game likeable and playable.

[code]HP and mana is like all other games, but not like this original piece. Why I wasn't sniffing all that at first, I think I was suffering from anosmia. Battles aren't just based on lucky hits, or how many items you got on your inventory. You need some prep-work and other attentions but in a different way. If you're can't flow with the chaos, the unexpected, if you only count with planning, chances are you will fail.[/code]

Usually, big city gurls like me knows how to cope or deal or rush with chaos. Expect the unexpected. But without any planning you will also fall. Need everything, including common sense - and you will still fall. Just flow and see how you can dance. And then... Well, fall. 

I guess this game is about how expendable and glorious life can be.

[*]✞ For some outworldly reason, I managed to survive my first battle in ""darkest"" difficulty with only 3 warriors. I got angry and went back to replay it, I thought it was scripted. But this game is a survival in essence, it was my fault. So I tried again from zero like 5 times. I finally learned it, the core of problem solving is at the stress level.

I would feel proud with my victory, if the survivors hadn't all become a bunch of broken paranoid lunatics. Infected with phobias, psychological disorders, stress and unpredictable changes of mood. Even when a hero is good, if he/she grows up too broken, it will be better to retire/dismiss them than trying any treatments. There is inflation on the prices at some point you can't control. 

It is not random crap, it is all real. [b]Example;[/b] The light went off because I never bought enough torches. We had to fight the final fight in complete darkness. One of the 4 characters got used with it. After that, when there is light, she debuffs with it. It is mechanical, still can flows nice but hard as hell. 

[h1]When the adventure becomes a military operation.[/h1]

Think of the manor's state like how The Wall from GOT began. All types will end up at the outpost, or should I say death prison.

Preemptive measures aren't all that good, so you need to take care of them during battle and after battle as well. Maintain good relantionship on the team by camping. Find some funny traits, or avoid them and recruit them. Traits, negative or positive are up to your attention and strategy of how to better proceed.

1- Maybe you find a hero to recruit that has the ""pep talk"" trait. And curious abilities like smoking pot... I mean... ""experimental vapours."" Not all negatives are that negative.

2- Find one, or be lucky enough to maintain at least one possible platoon ""leader"", if he/she has speech traits or beliefs that may bring peace or order.

3- Maybe you find an entire group of good characters that can form a typical heroic band. Or the opposite and win the title of inglorious besterds. The combination can be surprising. 

4- You gotta evolve the town's size in the innards, for post-battle treatments or relaxation, gotta buy them by collecting treasures and money then using it on the town. Sometimes the mansion's caretaker goes in there town and uses one of the slots you will need, rendering it useless to use it. 

Expect British-like humor and sarcasm as you decay into the putrid abyss of the aged oblivion of the great nothingness, while the caretaker attempts to heal something like his sanity, he has probably already lost.


[h1]The Sanctity of this place has been fouled.[/h1]

Other games have tried that before, but just this little one made it into a complex battle penalties.

[list]
[*]A well fought battle and victory itself can really boost their minds and morale up as well.

[*]A hero won't always fall into desperation, some particular characters may brave the bad effects by themselves (but may lose it if you abuse it) helping the long-term. How cool does that sound? Others will disagree and get stressed, negativity can spread and debuff others, but the brave will be more buffy.

[*]But tough sonafabeaches are rarer. Usually when a character is really desperate or nervous, game over is around the corner. Funny how depending of the move, the opposite can change scenarios. A coward can get courageous and a brave can earn a phobia. Etc. Etc. 

If things keeps changing all the time, all the time, you're doing something wrong. Like stressing them on a over-level scenario or putting them in the wrong team's position. You gotta think, watch the penalties, go slow and do the pre-work.

[*]Planning is also needed when not in battle, that is where the war is actually happening.

[*]Characters can get to like or dislike each other, so just resting isn't enough.

[*]I appreaciate there is no main hero or main character, until you personally define by yourself some personal canon. Experienced survivalist characters may earn the proper badge, so it is really good when you keep them alive and sane (or not).

Who's the leader of the team for you? Who's the second hand? You can't lock that in-game but you can attach yourself some (thread your feelings carefully) I did that and I must say it helped me keep things right.[/list]

[*]✞ Music flows from ambience and dark undertones, to epic confrontations. It just fits perfectly in all occasions. Dude, when some indie game immerses you, you know you just bought some good s#*t . Animations are ranging from basics to hand-made but they are all pretty organic.

[code]Oldschool are going to be happy, as if Ogre Battle just had a sidescrolling little son. Also if you remember Tristam, well, the dungeons. The diablo under the church. It has been inspired by, but not copy-pasted, it is original by itself and deserves attention.[/code][/olist]

To clarify, almost everything other than the RNG is wonderful in this game which makes it even more of a shame. But obviously if you are fine with insanely heavy RNG you'll likely love it.

Essentially if you like games that punish you depending on your actual actions (normal person) then you likely will grow tired of this game's antics.
If you enjoy games that make you spend countless hours making every perfect decision, full proof plans, amazing character builds and best upgrades just to say ""your god warrior apparently missed due to the arbitrary dice roll and is now dead"" (unemployed person) then you will like this game because you'll have something to endlessly fill the time you aren't spending productively.

From the start, you'll be greeted with a cast of characters who are either already completely insane or well on their way. But don't worry, you can always throw them into the sanitarium to be fixed - or just send them off to die in a hopeless mission. It's all in a day's work for a ""Darkest Dungeon"" player.

But don't let the game's punishing difficulty and unforgiving mechanics scare you away. There's nothing quite like the feeling of finally conquering a boss battle after weeks of grinding and rethinking your strategy. And let's be honest, the game's narrator is worth the price of admission alone. Who doesn't love being told they're in over their head by a gravelly voice?

In short, ""Darkest Dungeon"" is a game that will test your limits and your patience.

The are flawed in a pretty human way.

This game is amazing. It has held me in through multiple sessions and even when a whole party might die I never did back out. Two in-game years and I still feel like I can get so much more out of this game.
This game is about risk. Simple as. Every quest you gamble on many seemingly small things- but they do add up; They add up rapidly. Every finished quest will either grant you sadness over lost members, or the highest high when everyone made it out- and with good loot. 
I do recommend- you should play this. And lose your hope like I have countless times.

When a game tells you to expect to lose recognize that the developer is saying this because they don't know how to make good games, and they are preparing you for the festival of suck that is the result of their failure.

The player has virtually no agency, the DM is god, and the DM harbors an irrational hatred of the player. Characters die and become emotionally crippled so easily that it isn't worth investing any resources in them. Every aspect of this game is tedious, every system is designed to draw out progression arbitrarily. The characters actions are limited by their position and their position isn't under your control.

One of my personal pet peeves is when a game includes a healing ability, but you can't use that ability outside of combat. What is the rationale here? The developer clearly wanted there to be healing magic, but they didn't like the logical consequence of characters that can actually heal each other, which is having full HP most of the time. So you end up with this completely useless class of healing skills that have no value whatsoever, because you can't heal enough to overcome the damage you take in battle, and you can't just use your mystical healing power outside of battle, and if you try to prolong a battle, monsters spawn constantly and your Stress level grows (Stress increments are like HP, you can reduce stress, but never more than the amount you get hit with). Every tool the game gives you is insufficient to match the problems and threats your characters face. If HP loss doesn't kill you, the Stress will. 

Saying that this is good game design is like saying you have a really great job digging ditches and the only tool you're allowed to use is a spoon. It's ""challenging"", but fair, because the task is technically possible. Oh and your boss is constantly shoveling dirt back into the ditches while you are in them. Yeah, that's real great. I love eating dirt and rocks while toiling under a blistering sun.

You can try to rationalize that there is something good here, but there really isn't. You can form a delusional mindset that makes you somehow deserving of the victories you experience... but it isn't the truth. The Truth is that if you just sit and roll  dice for long enough you're eventually going to see the result you want. You didn't earn it, it just happened.

If you can get past all of that, and more, you might start to enjoy the game...

Or it could just be that the madness lurking in the darkness has gained purchase within your own twisted mind.",1679328002,1679349173,False,4,0,0.423464477062225342,0,True,False,False

+ VERY TENSE ENVIRONMENT AND SETTING - FOR A SIMPLE TURN BASED HORROR/FANTASY.

+ INCREDIBLE SOUND ENGINEERING FOR A NON ACTION GAME.  

- NOT HARD, NOT CHALLENGING - JUST REALLY FRUSTRATING.

I have really tried to like this game.

This has many elements I like - a gripping setting, turn based strategy and compelling character generation.  

It is ruined by it's crippling difficulty.  

I got the DLC on offer in case it made things better - nope.

Along with the usual couple of turns of bad luck crippling your game, it now drops dimensional attrocaties randomly into your encounters.  

It is just too frustrating - the only tactics that don't rely fully on luck are in the regional bosses.  And it takes a lot of effort to get that far.

(NOTE: you do not need to play this game in order to play or understand the second game. Like any predecessor, this game could help you familiarise yourself to the game play, but the second game is quite different to the first, and so it is not necessary. You can absolutely enjoy the second game to it fullest without playing the first.)

I could speak forever about every little detail about the game but ill try to just write what i feel i need to.
-Firstly: value. Is this game worth the price and time? Yes. It is a fantastic RPG that will test your abilities to think, form strategies, and most importantly, test your patients, and how far you are willing to press your luck. This price of this game is definitely worth the experience you will be getting when you play this game.
As for the DLCs, the musketeer DLC is practically worthless unless you feel like trying her out in the butchers circus( a free dlc), but all the other DLCs are 100% worth the pickup. What is also great is that you can integrate new DLC into old save files, so you dont have to create a whole new save in order to play any of the DLC. For this reason its entirely valid to complete the base game before buying any of the DLC, but if you wanted to purchase them halfway through a campaign, you could also do that.

-It is not an exaggeration when I say this game has changed me. The feelings I get when I play this game seldom are replicated in other games. I use to become emotionally attached to video game characters. You spend so long with some characters that you become sad when they leave or die. This game broke that in me. I had to learn to distance myself because every dungeon these characters enter could be their last. In fact, this game becomes much easier when you stop caring if less effective troops die for a bit of extra gold. These days, every character I play as i see as just 1's and 0's, and if they die or suffer, I dont care if it helps me progress that little bit more.
The stress mechanic is very interesting. Every time a character reaches 100 stress, they get an affliction check. At 200 stress, they have a heart attack, dropping their hp to 0. If their hp is already 0 upon reaching 200 stress, they die instantly. This means that hp is actually much more easily maintained than stress, and less meaningful to keep topped up. A low hp hero can do all the same things as a full hp hero, but a high stress hero is less effective than a 0 stress hero. Upon being afflicted, a hero will start refusing to act, picking their own actions, hurting your party, stressing your party out, move their position in the party, refuse to be healed or buffed, the list goes on. Not all hope is lost though, as every affliction check has a 25% chance of giving your hero a virtue instead! This is the opposite of an affliction, and that hero will start doing things that benefit the party instead. When you are facing a tough boss, and you're 30 minutes into a fight, your resources are exhausted, your Hero's health are razor thin, and your hope has faded, and now your hero has reached 100 stress. Surely now you will have to retreat and try again another time... right? But then you see the white light, your Hero's stress goes down, and Wayne June begins speaking and says: ""Many fall in the face of chaos - but not this one. not today."" and that one hero carries you to just barely win the fight... Its a feeling that to this day, I have never felt in any other game. On the other hand though, that only happens 25% of the time, so if you are willing to put in the time and the frustration of failing and getting back up again, it will be worth it.
-the visual art style of this game is great! Very compact and optimised, and I love it. everything in this game looks beautiful, but the music is the real rose of the art for this game. The OST for this game is fantastic, no matter what you are doing, you are listening the great music and ambience.
Of course, the narrator for the game, The Ancestor, voiced by Wayne June, really makes the game what it is. There is no reason this game needed a narrator, and yet, I cant imagine the game without him. He will amplify both your highest highs, and your lowest lows. I quote this game daily, its amazing.
-Every character in this game can work somehow, some way, doing something. This game is very well balanced, for both your Hero's and enemies. Though as you progress, higher level dungeons and difficulties will require better understanding of what works and what doesn't.
This brings be to the only 2 things I do not like about this game: The pacing and the difficulty progression. This game is slow. Your characters move slow, upgrades give very little individually, its only when you max things out and look back at where they started out that you realise how much better it is. Fights are slow, animation is slow, etc. There is no way around it: The base game is a huge time investment and it will get annoying how much time some things take to acquire.
I dont mind the difficulty but it is very annoying when every dungeon it seems like one of my characters has been designated the party's punching bag, when it should be more spread out. Or when 2 crits land on one character and a bleed proc kills them after only one deaths door check, and that character was level 6 so its going to take hours to replace them. there was nothing i could do to prevent such a thing. There is no way to predict when 2 crits and a bleed all in a row are going to show up. For all these reasons, its not uncommon the rage quit this game for a week or 2 before coming back and building back up. This game is hard but most times that is not a problem, but this game, more often than not, pushes all the wrong buttons when it comes to the rng and difficulty spikes you will experience.
-this game is open to the steam workshop so you can experiment with different mods at any point. I STRONGLY recommend faster walking and faster combat mods for all the reasons I mentioned above, other than that just have fun with it.

Is this game perfect? No. But its almost perfect and I love it. I could say more but that's really all I can be bothered to write. If you want a fun turn based RPG that will make you cry tears of joy and anguish, while expanding your vocabulary beyond what you thought possible, I strongly recommend Darkest Dungeon.",1679067892,1679067892,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

""I am a 52 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 16. My son recently started Dinkum and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.""",1678859225,1678859225,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

Set in a dark and foreboding world, the game puts players in control of a team of adventurers who must navigate through a series of increasingly difficult and dangerous environments while battling a variety of supernatural monsters. The game's narrative is presented through a series of journal entries and cryptic messages that slowly reveal the game's backstory and lore.

What sets Darkest Dungeon apart from other games in its genre is its emphasis on psychological stress and the toll that adventuring takes on the human psyche. As the player's characters explore the game's environments, they must contend not only with physical dangers but also with the emotional strain of facing constant danger and uncertainty.

The game is designed to be challenging, and players must carefully manage their team of adventurers in order to survive the game's many hazards. The stress mechanic is an integral part in this, as players must constantly monitor their characters' stress levels and make sure they are taking steps to reduce stress before it becomes too much to handle. Failure to do so can result in characters gaining negative personality traits or physical afflictions that can severely impact their effectiveness in battle. Additionally players must also carefully consider their team composition and equipment choices in order to succeed. Each character has their own unique abilities and strengths, and players must choose which characters to bring on each mission and how to equip them in order to maximize their effectiveness.

Red Hook Studios showed courage by breaking away from the generic dungeon crawler formula that dominated the gaming industry then (and today) and instead created a masterpiece that stands the test of time. In my opinion, Darkest Dungeon is one of the greatest risk management games ever created and the first game I recommend whenever I am asked.

The fact that the affliction takes your control way while also having to deal with shuffle mechanics, two death mechanics (health / stress), and RNG you are always at a disadvantage.

If you go in completely blind, you will have to learn through A LOT of failure, it will be a big challenge and a lot of time investment from trail and errors, and not everyone has the time or energy for that long process, so feel free to lookup all the tutorials and read all the wiki page you can find.

The game is very unique and well made, a good mix of risk and reward, punish you when you get too big for your shoe, but also reward you plenty if you do everything just right. I and many others find this game pokes our primitive monkey brain just right to keep us playing and returning to it again and again for that unique experience of excitement.

If you plan to play the game, don't activate Crimson Court in your first save, it'll make the early game a lot harder, and thus making the learning process a lot more painful that it should. The dlc is also controversial in general as seen by it's rating, so activate it at your own risk.

Here's some of my understanding of the game:

Don't tempt fate: Do everything you can to minimize the chance RNG fucks you over, and don't take any unnecessary risk. Get your chance to hit to at least 90% to minimize the chance of spending two turn and not killing anything. Get your speed at least on par with enemy's average, or have high surprise chance, to be able to somewhat consistently kill one or two enemy on turn one. Focus down that one enemy and risk tanking three enemy crits next turn, instead of trying to kill two and risk tanking four enemy crits next turn, which could be difference between surviving and losing one/two hero, even teamwipe.

Action economy is king. Do everything you can to reduce enemy turn, that means focus firing down one enemy at a time to permanently take away enemy turns, and stun enemy when the stun chance is reasonably high, proportional to the threat of enemy's turn, 50% stun chance on a ghoul that might give your whole team 12 stress in one turn is acceptable. Leave one low-threat mob after having killed everything else, stun it and kill it slowly to squeeze out more turns for your healer to heal. Apply a DOT of Y damage per turn, stun the enemy, and make the enemy take 2*Y damage in two turn.

Positions are important: Certain melee enemies is weak when pushed to the back, certain range enemy are weak when pulled to the front. Pull back line enemy to the front to also force front line enemy to the back, vice versa. Keep or remove the corpse via DOT damage to maintain/change enemy positioning. 

Scout is OP: scout turns traps into stress healing. You cannot be surprised by scouted enemy encounter. Scout gives you information that helps you optimize profit and avoid combat when needed. Critical scout reveals secret room with chest of 10,500 gold and rare trinkets when opened with key. Secret room only exist in medium/long dungeon.

I love this game to death. But it is hard to recommend, if you are interested in playing for the first time there is an easy mode and the options allows to modify some aspects about the gameplay. I say this in the context of recommending this to a friend. I took interest in playing Darkest Dungeon because of the art style and then because of the lore. Among the best RPGs I have ever played, but it will take A LOT of mistakes to get confortable with the mechanics. The best part would be playing blind for the first time, the anecdotes of people learning from their mistakes and random deaths because of crits and aflictions are very memorable 🤡. 
Some tips:
-Every hero has their uses, you can mix and match their skills in the middle of a dungeon and before entering a boss fight.
-In the early game, bosses will give you a random very rare trinket, try and go for a trinket thats worth the risk.
-You can (and should) dismiss heroes that may not be worth keeping.
-Anticuarian is a MUST in the early game, every time she interacts with a curio she gets an extra relic worth 500 gold that can be stacked 20 times.

     At heart it's a dungeon crawler. However, at no point did it really feel like a dungeon crawler. In the 275 hours I have played, it has yet to feel repetitive. It's almost like a paradox game, where after all this time investment I am still receiving knowledge checks and learning new mechanics and ways to play. There is always something different happening and the interactions constantly feel refreshing. 
     The customization is shallow, only being able to name the characters and choose from a few color palettes. Yet, I so easily feel myself becoming invested into my heroes. I enjoy naming characters after my friends who watch and names from fiction I like. Feeling genuinely driven to keep them alive and have them succeed. When they do well I often give them titles reflecting what it is they are doing well in. I named a Graverobber Lilith ""Demon"" because she would constantly drop massive crit roles and dodge like a machine. Which makes it all the more impactful when I lose these characters. 
     The progression isn't linear, and the game requires trial and error, more so reflecting an exponential curve in skill. The unspoiled surprises make the game exciting and intense. Leaving you on the edge of your seat wondering how you can adapt to the situation at hand. While on the flip side, being prepared and ready for engagements makes them all the more satisfying and enjoyable. The different areas, mobs, bosses, classes, and lore all are rather limited in the grand scheme of things. However, it is the presentation, execution, creativity, atmosphere, simplicity in design yet depth in lore and mechanics. That make this game truly a gem. 
     Once you are done with the base game, have had your fix and want something new. There is an entire workshop full of devoted fans who are looking to spice up the experience. I would name Pitch Black Dungeon particularly as something I look forward to playing. Which is a mod aimed at overhauling the entire game, and adding a completely fresh and re-balanced play through. People come up with some of the most interesting concepts for classes and characters. This game acts as an excellent medium for artistic expression in the facet of character design. Of course some art more... Niche... then others. There's something for everyone. 
     Within this unique small game there is an experience for everyone. At 25$ no less? The value is phenomenal. The narrator is a marvel in and of himself. I cannot stress how much I love this games art style. The three difficulties allow any and all players to find a desired experience. Usually difficulty sliders mean trouble for a games longevity (Total War I'm looking at you) due to the lack of proper balancing and creative limitations. However, this game actually found a way to make difficulty sliders add flavor and consistency. So whether casual (Radiant) or masochistic (Stygian/Bloodmoon), this game has you covered. I would absolutely call this a must play. There really isn't anything like it. This is no mere dungeon crawler, this is the Darkest Dungeon.",1677832100,1677832100,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This game is mean,

Your favorite heroes will die
They'll be gone forever
And you will cry
That being said i love this game.

The combat has highs and lows, anything can happen. It's all about risk management and responding to problems when things don't go your way. Even if that means retreating and failing the quest or losing a hero.
Straight up my favorite implementation of turn based combat, albeit some game balance issues. But I've just had too much fun with this game to care.
This review is biased, this game is probably not a 10/10 if I had to guess it's probably an 8/10 in reality. But this game scratches such a particular itch for me that no other game has. If you enjoy gambling and risk management I think this game will resonate with you as well.
The core gameplay loop is so strong. If you lose a mission, or maybe multiple in a row just remember the new heroes on the stage coach will fight for you for free. All you need to do is pick yourself up and jump back in to...

Even if you do everything right and have the best party for the dungeon, you will have to grind new heroes while others rest, you will have to wait for heroes to heal stress, ailments, swap quirks, etc. Buying supplies for every dungeon is pretty BS as well -- the dungeons are RNG, so you never know what you will or won't need, and even a best guess is only a guess, which means you will at worst be woefully underprepared and die, or at best spend too much money on factors you couldn't predict.

The dungeons and enemies get pretty old pretty quick since they aren't that diverse (stuns, dots, moving you so you can't use abilities).

First off, if you can't cope with some RNG which didn't go in your favour, don't buy this game.
But if you are one of those who can bear with some bad luck and into any kind of strategy games or dungeon crawlers, definately get this game. It offers a very effective ""sugarbread and whip"" system of frustration and reward which will keep you hooked and wanting to further level up your heroes and do another dungeon. Always putting you into situations where you have to decide what lesser evil to take, the game nails the art and audio style while still featuring an interesting storyline.
The only thing I have to criticise is the amount of RNG in the game which can lead to very frustrating moments and I think it could be tuned down a bit.

I wanted to replay this game after downloading the Darkest Dungeon 2 demo to see how much the sequel held up.
Over the next 2 weeks I ended up spending 25 hours scouring the many locations, killing monsters and bosses, collecting treasures, and finally: beating the game. 

[b]OVERVIEW[/B]

Darkest Dungeon describes itself as a game about making the most of a bad situation.
You send 4 heroes at a time to delve into one of the many different dungeons in the game, which holds monsters and treasures for you to collect.
The catch however, is that permadeath is constantly on, which means if you're not careful, or if you just get plain unlucky, your beloved houndmaster is dead.
On top of that, the game also auto saves, so no save states whatsoever.
All of this combined means that unless you are an experienced player, or look up a guide, you will very often have your nose to the grindstone during your playthrough.

With all of that being said, if you don't mind the possible death of some [i]debatably[/i] replaceable heroes, this is an extremely fun game for [b]ANYONE[/b] who likes turn-based combat, and exploration.

[b]WHAT I LIKE[/b]

I don't think I could fit every little thing that I enjoy about this game, so instead please accept this list of what I liked most.

-The Bosses: The bosses for me were simultaneously some of the most fun, and most frustrating experiences I've had in Darkest Dungeon.
On one hand, coming in with a party composition that just so happens to be horrible for the selected boss of the region simply sucks.
However the intoxicating feeling of putting enough DOTs on a boss so it's taking 20 damage on its own turn, or getting a lucky crit to prevent a character death is probably the best feeling I've had in this game

-The Narration: This right here honestly might be what makes this game special to me.
The amount of work put into writing and voicing these line is incredible.
This might be the only game that routinely gives me goosebumps with how well done its voice acting is done.

-The Characters: In the base game there are about 15 different characters to choose from.
What makes each one of them interesting and unique to me is the written dialog for them.
Each of the characters have different dialog they occasionally say depending on the situation, such as when they become stressed or hurt, or when they deal a critical hit.

[b]WHAT I DISLIKE[/b] 

The Speed: A decent portion of the game is spend wandering hallways in search of quest items, room fights, etc. but after a while, it just gets monotonous.
Not only that, but at the last stage of the game I was going to the dungeons simply to level up some select characters for the last dungeon of the game.
I just wanted to get it over with as fast as possible, so when I was leaning back in my chair with my mouse on my knee, listening to podcasts, I got pretty bored.

RNG: As you would expect, random chance plays a big role in this game.
It can be the deciding factor whether you have an entire party wipe, as it's entirely possible that your healer drops down to a quarter of their HP, or that your party gets ""surprised"" which randomly shuffles their marching order.
While it is certainly just a part of the game, and it probably gets evened out by the times you get a lucky crit heal, it still just feels really bad when your houndmaster drops to 0 due to a crit, and then bleeds out the very next turn.
Mind you, while I am speaking from experience here, that same houndmaster DID get revived by a random event, so again, it probably evens itself out.

[b]CONCLUSION[/b]

Gameplay consists of two main phases: the hamlet and exploring dungeons.

The hamlet functions as the players base, allowing them to: recruit new characters, upgrade and treat existing ones and manage resources such as purchasing charms and paying heirlooms to upgrade various buildings in the hamlet.

Exploring dungeons consists of building a team of up to 4 characters, assign a party order (different characters excel in certain spots, more on this later) and send them into procedurally generated dungeons with various objectives.

Combat is turn based, with each character bringing unique skills and abilities to the team.

As the party progresses through the dungeon, they will accumulate physical damage (HP) and stress (below).

HP damage can be resolved by healing and eating.

This is where party order becomes crucial, characters are only able to use certain abilities when they are in certain positions in party order.

Therefore, having a balanced team is very important, and one of the places where the game shined the most for me. I did not get very interested in the loot (the game does not place much emphasis on it and they are mostly thematic currencies for purchasing things), but the characters really kept my interest. Who goes where? Who does what? Who can do what because of where they are positioned? Who gets upgraded? Who gets dismissed? The possibilities widely range and kept me thinking about optimal setups of both individuals and party comps.

I find that my strategy changes drastically according to who I am playing, and taking a few battles to get into the rythym of knowing how to play each unique team I send out, as well as theorizing about potential dream teams

**Camping**
Here, camping would be useful to mention; on longer missions, players are given breaks to ‘camp’, this essentially means sitting in a room in the dungeon, eating, resting and allows players to use their second ‘camping’ set of abilities to reduce stress, heal,

Stress is affected by a myriad of factors, including: party order, hunger, darkness level, health and status of allies and enemies

**Thoughts:**

Overall I am enjoying this game and find the character building and composition really stimulating. The difficulty of the game: permadeath, cruel autosaves, no manual saves, hunger, stress, illness, disease etc all combine into a game that encourages you to go deeper into the dungeons and then intermittently punishes you for it. Have someone die, even if they are not your star player, feels big and that you somehow messed up quite badly. Having a sense of consequence and an ability to improve really make this game feel nice to play. However, there is something that prevents me from spending more than about an hour playing at a time, once I figure this out I will update.

**Core (One-liner):**
Build characters, build up their skills (RPG) get attached to them, send them out to die in very difficult missions that do not favor unpreparedness (or if they do not die, they get incredibly stressed and come back with trauma and disorders that the player must deal with)",1677240661,1677240661,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Let me cut to the chase; this game is unforgiving. It's quite easy to lose a level 6 maxed out character to permadeath. Maybe you pushed your party too far, maybe you mismanaged your supplies, or maybe it was just bad luck on the RNG. Characters can, and will, die through no fault of your own.

To me, the party management aspect was the most entertaining. I enjoyed forming parties that could play off of each others strengths and weaknesses. It was satisfying to build up their levels and abilities. Just make sure that you have a contingency plan. Your favorite party won't last forever, you will need to have apprentices in training at all times, otherwise you won't be able to form a cohesive party if you lose a key member. The dungeon exploring is pretty linear, and your party will constantly be affected negative quirks. In other words, your party is often more a danger to itself than the monsters in the dungeon are. Selfish bastards spring traps on themselves, cause you to lose treasures, etc. Rising stress levels cause heart attacks, diseases inflict negative status effects, etc. The combat is generally fun, but frustrating at times. Often your party needs to be in certain order for their best moves to function correctly, but enemies know this and constantly try to re-arrange your party which screws with your strategy.

Pros:

- Art style, music, and voice acting really set the scene
- A lot of different character classes, abilities, upgrades, etc.
- Dungeon layouts are ever changing
- The ability to add trinkets for added status effects is nice

Cons:

- RNG will have no qualms about completely screwing you over
- Some of the voiceovers get a bit repetitive
- It takes a lot of luck as well as skill to build up a successful party. If you need a certain class, you may have to wait (in game) weeks for one to show up at the stagecoach, and then hopefully you have a decent party to throw them in for training

Look... I have too much anxiety in my life as it is. I turn to video games for some fun and relaxation. I'm not opposed to a challenge, but this game literally stresses me out at times. For that reason I had to take an extended break. I may return to the dungeons some day, but not any time soon.

Overall, I recommend this game. If you know what you're getting yourself into, it's a pretty good game. But if you are easily stressed or are prone to anxiety, proceed with extreme caution.",1676785714,1676785714,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The ONE and ONLY issue I have with this game is stress Gain and Stress heal. So You face SIMPLE dudes/mobs that Inflict 30 Points of Stress. So that's 30/200 usually you fight at least 2 of the at once. Some other simple dudes get casts on 2 heroes for 20~ on each. And by simple I mean like stage 1 enemies. Once you reach 100/200 your heroes Resolve Or loose Hope Which is cool right! Tho like 95% of the time they loose hope and fuck with everything but im cool with that. The problem I have is that the stress gain is like Insanely high. You might think that you can pervent those guys from casting the stress spells right? NOPE They have high speed stat which lets them almost ALWAYS go first so that 30 is guaranteed at least once And there is one of these fuckers at almost every battle. If you do A crit you heal for like 5-10 stress. There are some stress healing spells but they also cover like 10 or so stress. If you camp you can cure like 20 stress most of the time. So there is Straight up no way to pervent stress from skyrocketing every single time... And once stress reaches 200/200 you get heart attacks which bring your hero to 0 hp (+ There is a chance to die at every heart attack) and sets that hero to death blow status where if he takes damage from that point there is a chance he might die. (if you have all settings on default your heroes loose other stats also when ever reaching that death blow status) Now when you reach 200/200 and you have hearth attack even if your hero is at 100% you loose it all. The stress does not reset it goes down by like 10 or 20.... so even if you heal your hero from 0hp to any hp and remove the death blow status any other stress from anywhere will give you heart attack Oh and when your hereos have had lost hope at 100/200 they ussualy get stats where they talk shit and apply stress to ALL other heroes. So at every action you take like heal your hero from 0 hp and after the heal another dude talks shit stress goes to 200/200 and heart attack again.... and then it just starts looping around and you just die cause you cant even make a move.... Yeah sure if it gets bad you can retreat right? well not really... In my last fight I fell back from the battle and all my heroes died from heart attacks before I could take an action to return to town.... 

EDIT- Ok So after playing quite some more I realised that I lost 95% of my heroes to heart attack... how fucking dumb is that? like from going all the fucking time max hp to instantly dying to never ending hearth attacks... This mechanic is 100% ruing the game experience for me I REALLY wish i could just turn it off and enjoy the game... like its so fucking stupid... worst game mechanic i have seen in a while honestly... like after the heart attack any other stress is gonna give you a heart attack... so if you have 3 other heroes stressed out they talk shit and boom another heart attack... And I dont know how about you guys but when my heroes enter deaths door they NEVER last longer than 1 extra attack and they die... like this is so fucking stupid I'm really questioning if I want to play this game just cause of this ONE problem with the game... its such a fucking game killing mechanic!!!  

TLTR- STRESS GAIN IS FUCKING BULLSHIT and needs a nerf.
Ok now I not saying make it a non problem thing right? but like come the fuck on your basic enemies cast 30 stress on every fucking attack they do its just 2 much 15 should be the norm and 30 if they crit or something...",1676230042,1676760641,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you have never played this type of game before, play it with only Character DLC or without any DLC at all. This game will be challenging and feel demeaning if you are not already use to this type of game. Character DLC helps to add more abilities for the player to use at their disposal, and that should be enough to help in the long term. Should you attempt to actually complete the entire game as I have.

If you have played a game similar to this before and dont want a challenge, refer to the first paragraph. 

If you have played a game similar to this before and dont care/want a challenge (are a masochist like me), then buy the game, get the Color of Madness and Crimson Court DLC. This game will ramp up in difficulty and have ALOT of content for you to complete while feeling challenging and question how quickly you can adapt to a worst case scenario coming true.

Turn order is random, your speed is not the only thing determining the order your hero's activate, the game rolls a dice and often the enemy activate twice in a row, giving you no opportunity to take any actions. This is pure luck, there is no strategy to prevent this, and often results in the death of a hero, setting you back hours of progress.

--- The chances of losing your best hero are the same chances of losing a fresh level 1 hero, I have no idea why anyone would want to play a game that arbitrarily sets you back by hours of progress. ---

The game is much better played with mods, but the game is already a waste of time because of how random every action is, your attacks can miss, the enemy can crit for insane damage, you can be locked out of taking any actions while the enemy take 5 actions in a row...

It seems like just throwing disposable adventurers at an eldritch dungeon seems like a neat idea for a game until you realize that to take on tougher dungeons or even to improve your performance in even the easiest ones on the easiest difficulty you have to put money into improving them, taking care of them after the adventure, training them, make sure they complement each other well... I am sorry but does this not all sound like the absolute opposite of the word disposable? If the point is to get as far as you can and do a little bit better each time, than why does dealing with stress soak up almost all the funds you get from dungeon diving? You even have to spend your upgrade currency just to improve your stress reliefs all the while you're stuck farming for the exact same resources hoping that the random number generator god just doesn't decide to fuck you over

This kind of do a little bit better system of game play only works well with games with fixed encounters so that you can learn from your mistakes and in fact do better the next time around, Dark Souls doesn't randomly change enemy positions or tactics every time you fail, X com doesn't suck all your resource into just keeping your experienced troops barely functional and when they did add a functionally similar system to Darkest Dungeons stress gimmick it didn't suck away most of the earnings you barely walked away with. 

And yet the strangest thing is that I would still recommend you play this game, I mean I wouldn't recommend you play very long or drop a bunch of money on it but it is worth taking a look at mostly for the way the game actually plays when you are delving into dungeons, whenever the game doesn't feel like a random number generator it is actually very interesting and fun.",1550655886,1676270362,True,1,0,0.537815093994140625,0,True,False,False

That's really odd, because I find it to be a fun, enjoyable--albeit stressful--experience. If it is so unplayable, then why am I able to play it? A lot of people seem to complain about the game's difficulty and the fact that the game tends to throw a monkey wrench in your best-laid plans (a random trap attacks your Plague Doctor, enemies land a few critical blows in a row, etc.). I'd like to start out by saying, rather flatly, that this game is a roguelike, gothic, dungeon crawler. It is not Candyland.

The game does a great job of playing out the difficulties and trials associated with exploring haunted or possessed dungeons and labyrinths, infested with creatures and abominations created by your own ancestor who leaves you to clean up his grievous mess. Your team of heroes will get stressed and they may go crazy or pull through and save your team from utter ruin. This makes sense from a regular person's perspective. You're going through creepy dungeons with a bunch of strangers, armed only with the best gear a nameless heir can provide you (or is willing to), only to hope that you can survive fighting disgusting, fleshy pig creatures, skeletons, fish monsters, zombie mushroom creatures and more. How would you, as a normal person or even as a hero, not end up stressed out by this?

Of COURSE the game is supposed to be stressful and arbitrary in design to an extent--that's the point. Do you remember a roguelike game where you remember the layout of every dungeon and the item drop rates and enemy spawn rates were overly-consistent? That wouldn't be a very roguelike game if this were the case. So, if you were traversing through the halls of these places, you would be stressed out too, fighting such monsters. This would lead up to the point when you would fear for your own life from dealing with such insufferable creatures, or pull through and refuse to take this kind of treatment lying down. Sure, the game is quite spontaneous with some of the situations that occur. I once interacted with a curio incorrectly, only for my Vestal to end up with Syphillis. Needless to say, she wasn't welcomed to the Brothel any longer.

This game sets out to do what a roguelike does best: throws spontaneous game mechanics out at you while you do your best to fight them off. The objective in the game is not to expect what happens next, but to survive whatever that next thing is. If your characters can't survive the onslaught, then I hope you've upgraded your Stagecoach.

tl;dr This game is great, but a lot of people complain about the difficulty, claiming it to be unfair or ""unplayable"". The game does get frustrating, but it is understandably so. It is a great purchase, especially for the $10 it is on sale for at the moment. I highly recommend it if you like gritty, dark, challenging roguelike games with turn-based elements.",1451500942,1676207740,True,6,2,0.567474007606506348,0,True,False,True

According to Steam, I have played 117 hours of DD. Around half of these were played more than a year ago when I rage-quit for good. Or I thought as much. I tried to check out the sequel which is still in early access just to see if the devs were fixing the issues I found obvious, but without luck. Anyway, this year, I returned to this game and tried once again to beat it but again smashed into a wall.
After 30 years of gaming, I don't believe I have hate-played a game before, but Darkest Dungeon takes the crown for being a major disappointment. But before discussing what I believe are flaws in game design and presentation, I have to talk about its virtues: First of all, the art, music, narration and overall atmosphere are all amazingly good, -I would say iconic- and are in the end what make me come back to this game. The gameplay mechanics of stress, in addition to normal damage and the afflictions, quirks, torches, loot system, and virtue mechanics are all wonderful concepts and work well in the game. The settings, monsters and story are also very evocative and hint at an eerie Lovecraftian worldbuilding. The classes are ok, with some being totally uninteresting and bland and others some of the coolest in any game ever. 
BUT my main issue with the game is that in order to enjoy all that greatness you have to push through a random, grind-dependent, limiting and obscure way of playing, presenting the story, and (not) teaching the player how to ...play
Yeah ok I get it, the devs wanted to make the game HARD and want you to ""GIT GUD"" and not take you by the hand to show you how to win. I get all that. But for me that is not the way to do it. And even if you do ""GIT GUD"" in this game you just have a better chance of winning. 
In Darkest Dungeon the getting good part mainly means two things: Grinding and becoming more familiar with the game itself. But the game never tells you how its own mechanics work. This is work you must do on your own, and I mean not in the game, but through googling and visiting wikis and watching other players play. You need to do that for example to understand what ""PROT"" means which is a stat in the game (it's basically ARMOR lol).
If you already know what works for one area of the game, you can stroll right through it. If you have fought the bosses once and you remember how you beat them before, and you know what each hero's stats and skills are, you can select the appropriate party for each boss and kill them easily. If you have grinded enough to upgrade all the necessary town buildings and all your heroes have good armor and weapons (which basically means having money and heirloom loot) the game is not that hard. BUT the game doesn't tell you that you don't need to upgrade some town buildings AT ALL while if you don't upgrade others you are F***D. This is why if one follows a guide from a veteran player and do the exact same things they do, they will most likely win (and it's the way most people have learnt to play the game successfully, through meta-gaming). 
But that is the definition of boring. And call me old-fashioned but I think games should be fun.
Darkest Dungeon doesn't help you build any skills as a player either, unless it's skills in accounting, bureaucracy and nomenclature (and don't tell me the skill is strategy because that is cancelled by the RNG half of the time). Don't get me wrong, there is quite a bit of fun in the randomness and tension of the encounters but after the first 30 hours the fun stops and the game becomes mainly a chore in order to get to the few next fun parts. An example of that is that it takes waaay too many runs, way too much money and way too many hours of your life to build a roster of heroes strong enough to attack the actual Darkest Dungeons. The stories are also kind of good but they are spread really thin throughout the game and none of the narratives actually have any serious impact, they act more as excuses to keep going through the same dungeons over and over again, fighting the same enemies over and over again, having to throw away too much loot you cannot fit in your tiny inventory and trying your luck with the game's supercharged RNG. 
This game is a bit like playing backgammon with Lovecraft themed graphics and sounds where if you lose, you die and go to hell :D
I have played 117 hours of this game and not once have I managed to get beyond the first Darkest Dungeon where all my level 6 heroes (which take around 30 hours of playing time to build) get wiped out. And it's not for lack of trying or a lack of maxing out on being a DD nerd.
To be clear: we are talking about a totally devised way of making a game difficult and long: having a huge percentage of battle decided on pure chance, deliberately limiting the amount of loot a party can carry, introducing overpowered enemies in the late game and after your heroes have reached max level, presenting a mediocre 2 hour story in short snippets just so it can be dragged along for 100 hours or not disclosing basic information to the players that should be available from the start in order to play the damn thing properly.
And to all those that say ""but in real life things don't come easy and are many times random like in DD"" I will answer ""Yeah, this is WHY WE PLAY GAMES because real life is shit"".
Those were my two cents. I will now escape to my escapist utopia of GUD GAMES and leave you to self-flagellate with DD and the upcoming DD2 which is even worse.",1675995968,1675995968,False,18,7,0.550135612487792969,0,True,False,False

It's Gothic/med evil/ horror theme works very well in bringing the game to life. Unfortunately that's the only comment I can give this game at all.

Pros: this game will give you a huge amount of Characters to work with, upgrades and if you are a masochistic or a sadist this game is for you because clearly you either hate yourself and want to punish yourself or just love to watch your main characters fall every round you get a chance.

Cons: The game doesn't give you any help what so ever, you get thrown into the deep end within the first round. You will immediately lose players in the first run you do because all the monster are on roids whilst your characters are sat there trying to jam a flute up there backside hoping it'll debuff them, well in reality, you just ****ed them off. 
after a few hours of playing you finally figure out the construct of the game and go back to the first dungeon with a semi-decent team and all of a sudden, the game will throw what seemed to be Solomon Grundy and the HULK, in the first level where they proceed to spit roast your entire team on a BBQ when you barely even gotten through the entrance. 
The chaos, Randomisation and number generator are so unfair, you might we well tell your players here is a 6 sided dice whatever you roll you do Damage. now here is your dice game you get a D20 (20 sided dice) with ALL 20s on them.

This game is a modern day classic and it will forever leave it's mark on videogame history and game design in general. 
The systems are simple, but elegant, the Lore is elusive but concise and the Ambience is a masterwork. 

This game has a sort of cotextual storytelling, that you have to be in the flow and feel things. It's not like an RPG like baldurs gate or kingmaker where there is a story going on with a main plot and subplots and the characters in your party are talking and all that. The thick of the story in DD is how you with your choices and the RNG generate memorable pieces of memory, like how a party of powerfull heroes will fall to overconfidence and badluck and how a group could beat overwhelming odds because one of them, when faced by the nhilistic nature of the cosmos and his own weakness and insignificance, decided to give a middle finger to fate and make his own destiny, becoming virtuous and beating the crap out of the enemies.

Darkest Dungeon is about human struggle, resulting in victory by perserance, failure or the middle ground, sacrifice.

It sucked me in early on. The dungeons are cool, the world is neat, the lore is great. And I've never heard such awesome in-game narration. But, after a dozen hours or so, the problems became evident.

My biggest complaint about it is the inventory system. You have to buy supplies before each dungeon and they don't carry over into the next dungeon. Anything you don't use on a mission is discarded. You don't get to keep it and you don't get a refund. But, since the dungeons are randomly generated, you'll be either constantly wasting your gold on supplies you didn't use, or else risk losing the dungeon because you don't have enough supplies to continue. 

Also, progress is slow and requires a lot of grinding to level up, and given that there's not a lot of variety here, it quickly becomes a slog.

I'm the type of person that if they start playing a game and if I want to get good at it, I will start reading the game's wiki, watch guides of experienced people and try to use the most optimal strategies so I can enjoy the game. And then here comes Darkest Dungeon and says ""I know you have good knowledge of this game, but I don't want you to have fun"".

I've got so many character die because solely of the RNG. And before you say ""Git gud"" or ""You're just bad because you under prepare"" or ""Overconfidence is blah blah blah"" or ""You should instead play on Radiance difficulty"", there is nothing like that. I never attend a difficult dungeon if I am not at least the same level with the specific dungeon with my skills, equipment and trinkets and even then, when everything goes smoothly and I play the safest can someone play, the game just tries to ""spice"" things up and hit you with the most unlikely scenarios that can happen. The game sometimes induces you a false sense of you doing great. I am saying that because early dungeons are easy and you'll have for some reason, more chances to deal critical damage with a very low chance ( I had multiple instances where my heroes would crit 3 times or more in a row with only 10% chance ), but beware, the game turns into CBT when you attend higher level dungeons. 

Here is only ONE of the many, many times this came just bended me:

I'm in a champion dungeon, I bring a party with great trinkets and heroes that synergies with each other according to guides and people that has sunken thousands of hours in this game. I get into an encounter, I start playing safe, stun important targets and here comes my antiquarian, +50 dodge, using Protect me to put it on someone with riposte. Everything goes well, then I have only one target remaining so I think ""He is the least threatening enemy, I will just start healing and stress healing the party until the stalling mechanic is about to kick in"". So only for ONE round I didn't guard the antiquarian. Next up, the enemy hits her for a crit of 30 putting her to deaths door and giving her bleeding. I notice my mistake so I am like ""Oh, no problem I can put my healer to take her off deaths door"". Wrong, the game doesn't even care about the speed mechanic because even if my main healer had speed of 7 and the antiquarian had a speed of -3, she goes first and dies from the first bleed damage. Have I forgot tell you that she had over 75% death blow resists?

I could go on and on with all sorts of events that lead to my heroes die in utterly unfair and frustrating ways but I'd rather not. Some positives of this game on the other hand are the art style, atmosphere and music. They are absolutely bangers but that is everything I could say good about this.

I might play this game now and then because I hate myself but in no way I recommend this game to people that want to enjoy their free time.

These are three of my favorite quotes from the narrator, and I must say, the narration in this game is excellent. This goes hand in hand with the art style and sound design which all mesh fantastically well with each other, and with the gameplay. 

The gameplay can be quite challenging at first, and may seem downright unfair at times due to RNG. It's also very grind heavy, though less so on Radiant difficulty.

I played during a free weekend in 2020, but didn't buy it until 2022. Glad I gave it another shot. The game uses a custom lightweight cross-platform engine, and the native Linux version ran perfectly.

Met a torch-shrine eldritch, and promptly uninstalled the game. There is literally no strategy, no planning, no clever ploys you can use against an enemy that just dodges everything you do and grows stronger every turn. There are moves that lower dodge. They can be dodged!

I would recommend this game to anyone that believes ""hard"" and ""getting screwed over by RNG"" are the same thing. In that case I would recommend Candy Crush Saga. At least when you decide to stop playing that game you won't regret the 20 euros you spent on it.

You remember our venerable house, opulent and imperial, gazing proudly from its stoic perch above the moor? I lived all my years in that ancient, rumor shadowed manor, fattened by decadence and luxury - and yet I began to tire of conventional extravagance. Singular, unsettling tales suggested the mansion itself was a gateway to some fabulous and unnameable power. With relic and ritual I bent every effort towards the excavation and recovery of those long buried secrets, exhausting what remained of our family fortune on swarthy workmen and sturdy shovels.

At last in the salt soaked crags beneath the lowest foundations we unearthed that damnable portal of antediluvian evil. Our every step unsettled the ancient earth but we were in a realm of death and madness. In the end I alone fled laughing and wailing through those blackened arcades of antiquity until consciousness failed me.

You remember our venerable house, opulent and imperial. It is a festering abomination! I beg you. Return home; claim your birthright, and deliver our family from the ravenous, clutching shadows of the Darkest Dungeon.

I had to delete the game. It is so addictive, thrilling, satisfying and beautiful to look at and hear. There is lots of depth to the combat. Trying out a bunch of party formations and synergising them is fun and so satisfying when you pull it off. I mean this is the stuff that, as a gamer, I live for. 

However, I hate the fact that the bosses have these gimmicks that would never cross your mind. Some of them make sense but only after you know what they are and some of them are plain stupid; they don't even make sense. So if you want to go through the game using your own brain, you are going to have to wipe out a different lvl 6 party 2 or 3 times in the learning process which is just brutal.

Very risk-reward based, and not an easy game by any means. Gameplay is straight forward and about as difficult as you want to make it (harder difficulties require much more planning).

We heard the repeating cries of a fragment of metal
So, true to Magnus' orders
I take my company's reins onto the surface, we settle
And as we branch out and explore the wreckage
We uncover a terminal's long-lost message
A visage of the past and of beautiful cities
So what has occurred here? What are we missing?
There is something wrong here and there is something hidden
With every second growing closer, I feel it near me!
My mind shudders, why does my heart race?
A psychic scream, like a crushing weight
Resounding in every corner of the world
""The Ancient awaits!""
Enwrapped in grief and beset by pain
It bides it's time, all it does is wait
We shoulder the hardship now and we endure
And to its source, we'll trace
The sight before my eyes is stark
A Dreadnought here, bearing the Emperor's Children's mark?
Unexpectedly, it interjects with pointed thoughts
Awake once more, energy arcs
Across its words now, demanding to know
Are we standing here gathered as friend or foe?
Its shattered form yet still poses a threat to us all
It shall not be deceived, nor ignored
I speak in half-truths to not invite alarm
""I see through your words, and I am not disarmed
We had learned from Him to hold to truth with every breath""
The wrong word here may mean death
""Even your words may be twisted and turned into weapons""
There is danger here, with every phrase now it beckons
I know the name of he who has me in his sights
""I am he who remembers, the Ancient of Rites!""
All at once, the pieces come together in my mind
This place was Istvaan III!
And we are here upon its corpse
On the grave that was left behind!
""Would you convince yourself I am a remnant seeking saving?
This was not a cry for help!
This was a lure I laid to invite something in need of slaying""
""Was this trap set for me, old one of mine?
You look terrible. A disgrace, even""
""At last, Fulgrim, you have come to me, abomination""
""Words uttered by a shattered pile of metal, rust and stagnation?
You've had millennia to think of what to tell me, you've my attention""
""I need not glory nor for words to speak
When I have held
A Virus Bomb!"" (""No!"")
Reaching out
My Raptorae uses his mind to hold the pace, to silence time
I channel him all of the strength I have
His power desperately relying on mine
And from my peripheral sight
I can no longer see that frail shell, devoid of its might
But rather a righteous being of defiance
Who is not without the will to fight!
I watch the Dreadnought lash out in wrath
His blows deflected away from their path
Despite the years he has endured
It's clear that he will live and he will die by the sword
Fulgrim then returned a strike
His sword slitting through bravado and machine alike
His face a mix of contempt and glee
The eyes of one who can feed off misery!
""You can never be forgiven for the things that you've done
And so it falls to my hands to end the prodigal son!""
""You cannot imagine the beautiful bounty of Chaos""
""Those things I'd never even wish to know!""
""There is still your potential that shines through
Imagine the unfulfilled glories we'd see to!""
""That you'd still think I seek any glory
Betrays the true blindness that has overcome you!
I recall the virtues I stood for
I recall the struggles and the things that we have done!
I will not be deterred from my vengeance
I remember the lessons passed on to the Sons!
I am one of the Emperor's Children
I am Rylanor and I am the Ancient of Rites!
So I reject you for now and for always!
To strike you down I have waited for a million nights!""
Inspired by the things I've heard
I raise my voice and shout clearly and out of turn
""Rylanor deserves better than you, oh Primarch
Rylanor deserves better than all of us!""
With but a single shot
The Raptorae is relieved of duty and released of his task
I feel the virus rend me apart, with my honor intact
As I'm enveloped by the encroaching flash
""Although this body of mine's still intact
A part of my pride, I fear, will never come back""",1674808077,1674808077,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It`s just made by one of the shitty developers who confuses UNFAIR with DIFFICULT, those are two completely different things. They just threw shitty mechanics into a blender and didn`t even care if it`s fun or playable at all. Even the party is expendable exactly because it`s completely unbalanced and when you lose a character is out of your control - full hp and/or sanity and by the end of the enemy`s turn your character is dead with zero inputs on your behalf. Everything depends on random and everything is aimed on ruining your day, ultimately the player is the one who is stressed instead of the characters in the game. On top of that a playthrough takes stupid amount of time and grind so you can`t even decide if the game is worth paying until you`re 10 hours in.

In short it is abusive. This game grips you, squeezes out your sanity and spits you back out. The narrator and the movies are positively haunting, terrifying even. I am 30 years old and this games scares me shitless. In the beginning you think: neat i get to slaughter little evil buggers. But more and more you learn the backstory of the game and in all honesty, having played through it twice, i am not so certain you play the good guys or even good guy adjacent. Some of the bosses are pitiful, some are as evil as can be, some made the wrong choices, some never had any. I will not spoil the big bad of the end but you are left with two thoughts: Did I do the right Thing? Or is humanity doomed?

I'm not certain if it was the intend of the developers but this ""game"" shows the very worst of humanity in form of the ancestor. His voiceovers leave enough to the imagination, that it is sickening. He is eloquent, has a magnificent voice and a Rythm that draws you in. You get lulled into his exposition and just want to listen to his story. And than you realize what his stories are about. If your reaction is revulsion at this point, then congratulations, i think you are a healthy human being, and a good head ontop of your shoulders and no tendencies of psychopathy. 
(I'd like to imagine that he is a little bit like hitler, or atleast how hitler felt to most people. He drew them in and left no room for doubt, lulling you into his falshoods and evil machinations)
At this point i'd like to point out, that the sound design of the game is absofuckinglutly amazing. I have never played any game that is anywhere close to the quality of cutscenes and voiceovers. (Yes it is THAT good.) 

The gameplay is not bad either, not perfect mind you, but it is fun and adrenaline inducing. I hope this review helps you. Personally i would not advise anyone below 21 years to buy and play this game. 

One last shoutout to the community: You are fanastic. this game is a bit aged, but still recieves love from the developers and the modding community. (though in all fairness a lot of... questionable NSFW mods have been created recently... not sure what that is about)

[b][u]General Thoughts/Overview:[/u][/b]

Well. Darkest Dungeon is definitely the right name for it. Two attempts, almost 4 years of real time, and many pick-ups and put-downs to actually finish it. Darkest dungeon will grind you down until you have nothing left. But you [i]will[/i] be back. 
Take on your role as the caretaker of this godforsaken hamlet, and the poor souls who dwell within. Seemingly the last of your line, it comes to you to cleanse this place. Hire waifs and strays, call them heroes, discard your humanity, and march these forsaken souls upon the bones of those that came before you. There is no other choice, there are no other paths. Only forward. To victory.
Use the riches and the heirlooms that they uncover to improve the heroes lot, arm them with the trinkets found within the ruins, and return the town to its former glory, in the shadow of the forsaken mansion. Delve into that forsaken place once the survivors appear strong enough. Who knows, some of them might even make it out again. 

[b][u]Pros:[/u][/b]
[list][*] Dark and broody in the right ways. 
[*] The duel physical and mental health mechanics are gruelling but interesting. They truly give the game an added depth, and the choice between how healed healed really is adds to that. The cost of recovery can be exorbitant, the cost of failure worse. 
[*] The narrator is just perfect. The music and sounds are also excellent. Even after the 100th time of hearing the same lines, they still land… It never even crossed my mind to turn him off.
[/list]

[b][u]Cons:[/u][/b]
[list][*] Grindy as all hell. This is particularly bad if you happen to lose a hero, or more. Getting heroes up in levels takes time. Esp if they need recovery time after delves… which they almost certainly will. 
[*] Massively disproportionate losses and costs. You can mill through newcomers, however, to simply explore short missions with little to no equipment, fleeing once the burden becomes too much and taking what you have. 
[*] RNG hell. “How quickly the tide turns.” Will haunt me forever more, after watching three group-wide crits in a row decimate my previously untouched party, followed by a round of tick damage kill every single one of them. I’m sure every player of this game will recall a time their healer gave 1-0 points in critical moments, ending runs or even entire team’s inches from victory. 
[/list]

[b][u]Suggested improvements:[/u][/b]
 [list][*] I’d like the journal notes separated from loot, in order to make collection easier… OR they should impact other things, such as making certain boss fights easier, or unlocking characters.
[*] It should be possible to ‘press’ higher level party members to undertake tasks ‘beneath them’. But at added stress cost, higher chances for their flaws to come through, and they take loot up to a certain value for themselves… This could also lead to additional perks and flaws. (Darkest Dungeon survivors should be willing to go on them for free… “Anything to not be sent back to that hell hole”. 
[*]Some saved layouts, or some way to see what I’ve encounter in each of the areas would be nice. My memory is pretty bad and I ended up bringing everything to every mission, it was wasted space and gold, all because of my own imperfections. Just some way of seeing which items I’d used in each space would have helped with this. 
[/list]


[b][u]Overall Recommendation:[/u][/b]

Darkest Dungeon is not for the faint of heart. It is not for people who hate grind, it is not for people who grow super attached to their characters, and it is not for people who give up. It literally mixes some of the worst aspects of rougelikes with some of the worst aspects of traditional dungeon crawling adventures… but this is by design. 

DD is also [i]for[/i] all of those people. It will grind you down, you will put it down… but if you’re not a quitter you’ll be back, maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, maybe not for another year… You’ll suffer a loss, it’ll be too much… but you will be back to try again, and there are always more bodies on the stage coach, ready to try their luck and make their fortunes.",1674481312,1674481312,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

While RNG plays its little game all the time, if you plan around minimizing risk from week 1, and manage to consistently execute this strategy through the entire run, then around week 40-50 you should have -

1. Maxed-out Guild and Weaponsmith.
2. You first team of four Resolve Level 6 heroes.
3. Some, if not all, tier S trinkets, class-specific and general.
4. A few ancestor's trinkets, although they are far from mandatory.

This means the player should be ready to take on DD1 (We Are the Flame) by week 50 in the worst case. On Stygian difficulty, the base game gives you 86 weeks to beat the game, so that's 36 weeks' leeway for four quests. Because failing a DD quest is heavily punished, it's more preferable to keep farming for useful trinkets / quirks past week 50, than launching a premature assault on DD (prevention > reaction).

This is a simple and effectively way of having successful runs. Over time you'll accumulate enough game knowledge and start thinking in a new way - 'what exact party composition, hero level and gears do I need to have a reasonable chance at quest X'. Ultimately, X is the Darkest Dungeon level quests (win condition).

On your first run, it is not possible to deduce preconditions from this win condition, because you don't know about them at all yet, so working from week 1 all the way to DD is like scouting the game to get a map of it. This is what Darkest difficulty is for. Then you should have all you need to make deductions from win condition and make a path on the game map, so the second run will be all about execution, walking that path. Of course, there are many possible paths, some safer and longer, others riskier but shorter. Speedrunners are always looking for the shortest path and they don't care about failing a hundred times as long as the 101st attempt succeeds.

Now, the real fun (reads punishment) comes when you get emotional and greedy. When emotions take control, you tend to make faster, but not better, decisions. The game rewards good decisions and punishes bad ones. So we don't want emotions. But emotions always emerge, so what I like to do is walking the *** away from my keyboard for a while. Relax and watch some porn maybe, and come back only in rational mode.

Greed is all about risk management. Risking something you can afford, like a disposable hero, for a huge potential reward, like a Focus Ring, is OK. Risking your best men on quest reward, which usually includes some gold, heirlooms and a trinket, even if you are just one room away, is often not. Click that X button, bite the bullet, and live to fight another day. Always make favorable bets, never hope for godly rolls on unfavorable ones.

And of course, there will be times when the game just decides to **ck you up with really bad RNG. My mental model for this is simple - it's not my fault. Rather, it's just another way of the game saying 'I say 86 weeks, but its' really just 84. RNG tax is a thing'.

That's pretty much it for me. The first run is all about enjoying original art, music and combat design from the game. Then, if you are up to it, the second run is all about executing a reasonable plan, cold-blooded, and with a heart of steel. Darkest Dungeon does a really good job hand-crafting good experiences for such two runs.

Lastly, I must say the game has its problems. My biggest two complains -

1. Focus Ring.
2. Abuse-able stall-heal mechanics in combat.

Focus Ring is just strictly the better trinket 99% of the time, which defeats the purpose of the trinket system.
Stall-heal is tedious but too rewarding not to abuse, sadly.

That said, you can always play the game with self-imposed challenges -
1. No/Limited Focus Ring.
2. No/Limited stall-heal.

I don't think the dungeons are too hard. Very luck based sure, you die a lot sure, that's common in the rougelite genre and I don't think that part is that much worse than any other.

The problem is that Darkest Dungeon is not a rougelike. Or even a rougelite. It's an RPG. It REQUIRES you to grind and level characters. The only thing rougelike-ish about it is that the dungeons layouts are randomized, and permadeath. RPGs also have sequential dungeons, random encounters, and randomized loot drops. If it weren't for permadeath, it would play exactly like a turn-based JRPG.

There is no skill based way to complete a higher level dungeon in DD without leveling characters in low level dungeons. And unlike actual rougelikes, it punishes you for losing. They took ""punishing"" much too literally. In fact, they seem to have spent a lot of time thinking of creative and complex ways to punish the player. It literally requires you to just wait for your characters to heal and recover from the permanent damage they take while fighting. I don't mind dying, but I HATE waiting. There is no reason for this gameplay choice other than maybe sadism? You should never include both grinding to level characters along with permadeath. Avoiding grinding is one of the central reasons to play rougelikes over traditional RPGs, and that's the thing they decided to bring back. You can't manage the hard dungeons if your whole party of four isn't high level, so losing even one character requires you to go back and grind a new one if you don't have a replacement.


Most rougelikes suck me in. I die a hundred times, and every time I die I think ""THIS time I can do it!"" Even in rougelites with a lot of metaprogression, once I unlock a level, I always have a decent shot at beating it when I launch the game. In Darkest Dungeon, when even one of my characters dies, I think ""time to give up and play slay the sprite on max ascension for six hours and die over and over""

In order to start having fun with DD after losing all my characters to bad RNG, I need to grind the first two dungeons for several hours to stand a chance at the higher level dungeons I managed to unlock. And the early dungeons aren't actually hard! So I'm actually NOT being challenged 70% of the time I'm playing, because I get punished for losing when I do face a challenge, and the punishment is grinding. Imagine deciding to punish your player for losing to challenges by making them play the easy part of the game for a hundred hours.


The bummer is that every other part of the game is awesome. The combat is awesome, the lore is awesome, the dungeons are awesome, the artstyle is awesome, music is awesome. But I don't want to play it. Sometimes I think about giving it another try, and I always get bored and feel like I wasted my time. I think that for me, the one change of figuring out a way to remove the grinding would turn it from a 4/10 to a 9/10. They could let you recruit characters that were already high level once you've unlocked the high level dungeons. The combat would still be exactly as challenging, but you wouldn't feel like you wasted your entire save file if you get a bad roll and lose every character.",1674065317,1674065317,False,147,20,0.769542336463928223,0,True,False,False

The Butchers circus is an invitation to try out a competitive game style in a game that is traditionally campaign focused.
Leaving that stupid icon to the butchers circus on the town screen is just so in your face, it's a fourth wall break back to advertising, bringing you right back into the mainstream commercial BS that indie developers were supposed to be the refuge for.

What I mean by the last point, meta-game mechanics, is that it doesnt feel like you are playing in a living game world, but rather it feels like you are playing against a computer opponent sitting across from you whose very adept at consistently targeting your partys weak points, and hammering away at them relentlessly throughout missions, no matter what they are, all the while completely ignoring *any* area that you even moderately defended against (ex: one party member has cove phobe, another has cove adventurer. Guess what? Enemy stress attacks in cove *never* target the adventurer, and *only*, and relentlessly, target the phobe.)

Its just not very fun. Its hard, but feels hard in a quite artificial way.

Original review:

Base game recommended for those who enjoy very difficult RL challenges, however, the game becomes exceedingly repetitive rather quickly. There is also very little feeling of actual player progression; things scale upwards in difficultly rapidly and outpace your ability to match the difficulty. That is not necessarily a negative, but it is something for players to be aware of at the get-go.

Some other things to be aware of: there is essentially no exploration in this RL beyond familiarizing yourself with the different areas to go through. The movement is literally walking linear lines from point A to B, chosen on the mini-map. The stress mechanic is interesting and novel, however I personally find it in its implementation more annoying than fun. Weapons and armor, mainstays of RLs, are ""streamlined"" (read: boring and linear) to a point of being an after-thought. Actual equipable items only come in the form of trinkets, of which each character gets 2 slots for, and of which 99% of the trinkets themselves always have an equal number of negatives to literally counter the positives, in terms of attribute modification. This becomes really annoying, really quick, and goes towards the feeling of a lack of power progression.

But I recognize that some RL fans do enjoy the sadistic style of certain RLs, and if you are one of those, I think this game would probably suit your fancy.",1533750466,1673717162,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I recently re-installed it, and re-discovered why I'm frustrated by it. At first, it's not too difficult, but the enemies keep getting harder over time, faster than your heroes gain strength, unless you're grinding in just the right way. That would be bad enough, but then it's got random difficulty spikes with certain sub-boss enemies that occasionally appear, which are actually harder than some of the real, actual bosses that you encounter at that early stage in the game. (I think those sub-bosses might be bugged, and spawn the levelled-up versions, instead of the ones appropriate to your dungeon and hero levels.)

The game opens with a line about ""making the best of a difficult situation"", but that's actually not true. (Even if it's unintentional, because of poor testing or balancing.) Instead, every setback that you encounter can just be solved with grinding, and the difficulty of the game is high enough that you *need* to grind, in order to overcome those and finish the game. For example, if your experienced knight hero dies, you just need to hire a new knight when they show up in the barracks, or play with other heroes temporarily if a new knight hasn't shown up yet. The monsters and dungeons keep getting harder, but you just need to keep spamming missions to get gold and heirlooms, to upgrade your town and heroes. Those upgrades are all also really shallow, since they're just linear upgrades, and every knight can get every knight skill with enough gold, or every healer can get every healer spell. All of your heroes are interchangeable cogs in this machine, grist for the mill as it were. That fits with the pointlessness theme in this Cthulu-ish story, but makes it just a very slow, frustrating game to play. The ending of the story also fits with the pointlessness theme, which really just adds insult to injury, after you slog through this game.

If you want a horror / Cthulu story, I'd recommend enabling the difficulty option for monster crits to not double damage, and add the Reforged character mods, and the one that rebalances all the trinkets. (The vestal, alchemist, occultist, and antiquarian are all already balanced and don't need their mods, IMO.) After that, the game is still a little slow and grindy, but can just be played without frustration. (I listen to a podcast and zone out.) If you don't like or trust mods, then I'd say you're better off reading a book instead. Or you can wait for the sequel, which from what I saw on a streamer's preview of the game, looks like they removed some of the tedium. (I could be wrong, but I think the game and story can handle you losing one or two heroes, and you only ever have four maximum, and don't need to manage a huge roster of interchangeable mooks.) The sequel also seems to be adding some more depth and breadth to the mechanics, like better in-combat items and a fire damage type. :)",1672538787,1673567957,False,2,0,0.495145648717880249,0,True,False,False

What they've done is that they limit variety missions if you have one or more heroes with higher level by filling limited slots of missions with higher ones you may or may not have a party to take on. If anything they should have added a drop down window for said mission slots instead of making the quest screen a huge sigh and eye rolling endeavor. The second flaw is that they have artificially extended the play time of this game with grinding gimmick that gets stale very quickly. This gimmick isn't flawed from the onset, it is that they have extended it way way way way way way way way too far, making the player have to grind for lord knows how long to complete all the upgrades and modifications one wants to complete the game with.

tl;dr: It's not awful, but its so grindy and full of dissatisfying reliance on luck it detracts from the overall experience. (Cool game, playing it feels like a chore)

I appreciate it for what it is but it felt like i was actively wasting my time at points throughout my playthrough when it came to the gameplay. The over abundance of luck when it comes to many facets of the games design is just such a turn off for me, you must be sufficiently lucky to have you're heroes:

Land attacks, dodge attacks, have the intended effects of said attacks be put on enemies, hit within a range of damage / do a meaningful amount, roll for initiative for when in sequence they can attack, be able to withstand trauma, survive fatal blows, have positive mental breaks (rare), gain/keep/replace positive quirks, gain/lose/replace negative quirks, not become afflicted by debilitating diseases by chance or in battle, not disappear for weeks on end from your roster, keep trinkets or traits after relaxing in the hamlet between missions, or even having new recruits that are worth the time investment, etc. I could go on and on.

The gameplay is a rollercoaster. I found sometimes it was satisfying, having to think before doing an attack or even trying to think of the capabilities of my enemies, enacting a plan, making mistakes and being punished for them. Where I stopped really having fun was when i realized i wasn't in control of whether i could have a positive outcome from a fight or not and what seemed like being punished for even playing the game, feeling like i am just wasting my time. 

Getting crit/hitting one, heroes/enemies dodging, missing 95% chances back to back/landing crazy 5% chances back to back, losing/saving valuable heroes despite my best efforts. It really feels like you live and die by the roll of a pair of dice, what does it matter that i hit 1,2,3,4 nasty crits back to back if my lvl 5 leper just got hit with 3 trauma attacks in a row, became hopeless, refused any healing, skipped his turns, and died a stupid death, resulting in me having to run away, failing the run away check leaving my remaining heroes open for even more harassment by the games rng.

 It boils down to grind, the impact of good things happening in Darkest Dungeon seldom outweighs the effects of a few bad things happening. If you just get unlucky enough you will end up having to sink multiple hours just trying to get back what you lost.

The boss also has variety of difficulty (I'm not saying about the easy to hard but rather mechanism difficulty). which need to be learn (might lose some hero if you had bad composition team). And dont forget about the narrator for giving the best dark and thrilling atmosphere while you playing along.

Overall, This game can be addicting and its for a good reason.

I've been playing Darkest Dungeon for almost seven years and to me it's always been the perfect rogue-like, although I've never had the patience or time to finish it until now.

First let me start off by saying that Darkest Dungeon, at least on its default settings, is still an unforgiving game. At the very beginning, as soon as you boot up the game, it tells you that Darkest Dungeon is all about making the best of a bad situation, and I'm sure anyone who's put any amount of time into the game, can confirm that this is definitely the case.

Effectively, the game plays as thus; A week passes every mission, there are multiple 'Dungeons' you can go to, each with their own trials and tribulations, enemy types and bosses, you take a party of four that will suit that dungeon and complete the given task. After that task is completed (or failed) party members will level up and you'll earn gold and trinkets, which you use to upgrade your Hamlet (Effectively your base of operations) in order to become stronger to make dungeoning easier and get access to harder quests.

There are a multitude of heroes/classes to choose from, each of them bringing their own unique abilities and playstyle to the game. You can also rename all of your heroes to anything you want, making the game ideal for those who want to put their friends in the game (This is what I do for all games that I can, such as XCOM or Phoenix Point or Disgaea) or also ideal for Twitch Streamers as you can make your chat feel more involved by naming them after people in there.

The gameplay loop is very satisfying and I don't ever get bored playing this game, although what I will say is, things -will- go wrong. You will lose that max level hero to something out of your control, yes you can debate that the game is mostly RNG, but think of the game more like D&D as opposed to other turn based RPG's, it's the dice that does decide at the end of the day. However you do have a multitude of ways of mitigating damage and making sure you're getting the most out of your heroes, if you plan ahead well, know when to take a loss as well (tactically) you'll be fine.

The game is long, there's no doubt about that, you're talking anywhere between 30-50 hours for one proper run at the game, beating the final boss and all.

Another great aspect about the game is the Hamlet, randomly you'll get Town Events, these can be positive or negative. Things such as... The Tavern is free for the week, or a free weapon upgrade (This can be particularly helpful in the mid-game when money is an issue.) Or negative ones such as a big bad boss is at your doorstep all of a sudden, with no preparation and you -need- to deal with him. It makes the game feel alive, like not everything is always 100% under your control, and this, for me, is what makes the game so exhilarating. 

In truth, I don't really have anything bad to say about the game, I guess I've been done over by RNG a few times but upon reflection, I guess I could've prepared better, but sometimes I did just get crit 3 times in a row and had a hero die, but I also don't see how blaming RNG for losing someone is a bad thing, especially when that's the nature of the game; you expect this going into it. But that's the reality of the game, I'd say it's a feature and not a flaw, you can do all the preparation in the world and be set up perfectly, but as the narrator so aptly puts it, as you think you're doing well. ""How quickly the tide turns.""

To me, this is one of the best games ever made, it offers extensive replay-ability and despite its unforgiving nature, it's extremely rewarding, I promise when you pull off something magnificent, or one of your heroes becomes Virtuous, or you beat a boss that was skelping you endlessly, you'll be jumping out of your seat in joy.

10/10.

Also, one of the things I love about Darkest Dungeon is that it's turned based but without a time limit on when you have to make your decisions. Also, when the enemy attacks, there's nothing you can do to change the outcomes. Both of these features means that you can leave your computer and come back and deal with the situation when you get back.

I thought Dark Dungeon (DD) this would be challenging, hard and fun. This is from someone who can stomach MMO RNG. All I found here was endless punishment with little to no progression after so many hours of playtime. I'll try break it down for detail. 

[h1]Story:[/h1]
I've haven't completed the game, but so far it's gives a light background on why the town and the narrator is so gloomy. As you progress, little diary entries can be found for extra flavour. The actual setting is fictional but things like classes that use single shot pistols and crossbows gives a 18th century feel. The game doesn't really need a strong story since most of the features were part of gameplay.

[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]
You work your way through randomly generated rooms which is the game's strongest feature. This is considering the limited graphic assets, DD gives a new feel to each new dungeon the player decides to plunder. There's also the standard RPG heroes progression, classes, renaming, and stat changing items. It's clearly simplistic by design so players can focus on the main mechanic, Stress. The more you push your heroes to do super human things, the faster you'll find a team wipe. In fact, the dev's tried a little too hard on this part and forgot about letting the players know some dungeons shouldn't be attempted. This game has punishment by the truck load.

Like I said before, it's so severe, that even recruiting new heroes is a chore. Let's start there. Heroes are randomised in terms of skill set, and alot of the time you're staring at a roster full of unplayable heroes with conflicting skill sets. You can retrain them which cost a punishing amount of money; coinage that you simply don't have at the start or mid game. In fact you earn so little money that progression slows down as you get further. Add that to the fact they come out of a dungeon with a bad trait 90% of the time means they'll lose value after 2 uses unless your spend more money. What makes this worse is that they can't cure their deseases or lose bad quirks at the same time. So this means yet another punishment since both deseases and quirks will become more severe and cost more to remove each week you put it off. 

So how do you get stress and deseases? Through dungeon combat which has many great features and clever designs. Unfortunately it's eclipsed by the fact the random events are biased towards gaining stress and misses in attacks. I've had a hero miss twice in a row even though it says 90% chance to hit. Granted after playing over 100 hours, players might see rare misfortune like this, but I haven't gotten close to that much gameplay. Positioning is vital and this plays a great deal with strategy and planning before starting out into a dungeon. In fact once you got a good synergy going, most fights end favourably. That's if you can get the right people (see above). Turn order and speed is the second most critical thing in this game since it decides turn order. More speed and means your heroes go first. For what ever reason, the further you progress, there will be a boss that breaks this rule and hits you twice per turn. If the turn ends with an enemy attack, the next turn can start with their attack since they got more speed. But 2 swipes in a single turn was incredibly stupid and great waste of time. The whole 5 mins was just enemy attacking and spamming moves. 5 mins of no keyboard or mouse. 

So a biased towards misses and handing the initiative to the enemy AI will always leave your party worse for wear. But all would be fine if the coin and treasure are good, right? High risk, high reward? Nope. DD doesn't even have risk since you can't tell what random things will happen inside a dungeon. At best, you can walk away with minimum stress but never enough money to remove all the bad quirks your team will stack up. At worst, you'll team wipe and lose all items, exp, and training. I don't even know they why allow renaming if they're forcing players to make 99% of heroes expendable like this. 


[h1]Sound:[/h1]
The ambience and sound effects are absolutely amazing. It goes well with demonic design of the dungeons. Not much to rave about in terms of the music once you hear it play over 100 times. That's the same with any game soundtrack so nothing new here. The voice actor for the narrator is harder to judge. I can imagine some would say he's a broken man, which understandably sound awkward. The other voice lines like gagging and spluttering weren't over the top.

[h1]Graphics:[/h1]
As with most 2D games, Art style is king. It was grotesque when it needs to be, intimadating when you meet a boss. With many mixed themes thrown around like despair and death, the colour pallete was mostly dark colours. Each attack animation had a comic book feel, with it's stylised expression and shading. It needs to be said that movement isn't entirely animated.

It's really hard to expect everyone to like a certain art, and this extends to DD's graphics. For me, I like it. 

[h1]Bugs and Overall:[/h1]
For a game that's selling gameplay as a feature, there was just no mid game substance. It creates the illusion that players have pathways to finishing the game. Plenty of unique concepts and mechanics, great art, and bug free. I only wished they keep the punishments mechanics in check. Whoever balanced the economy should really think about decreasing the 'cost' ingame to even make it playable. Just horrible execution.

Try this game if you truly, absolutely hate yourself! 

But seriously speaking, this game is a wild rollercoaster. Its ups are extremely high, and the lows are extremely low. The game will spit in your face, slap you, steal your gold, and then burn your town down. But that's okay because that one hero who died long ago and you spent almost 40k gold on will just come back to life because they felt like it.
Game is extremely hard and unforgiving. There's a lot of randomness, but just enough to the point where you can feel like you're able to do things with the right gear. It will constantly test you, and has a very high chance of giving you an affliction IRL. Sometimes the game will feel like utter and complete bullshit, other times you'll get a dopamine rush when you crit for 68. There is no inbetween.
My only real gripe with a game like this is the grind. You'll need to spend a lot of time running the same missions over and over again, which helps you learn the mechanics via brute force and trial and error, but at the same time you'll inevitably burn out because of how same-y a lot of fights tend to get, at least in the same region. Trinkets are both a blessing and a curse because good trinkets can change the outcome of a mission entirely, but losing them is always worse than losing a maxed-out hero towards the endgame. It becomes easier to replace people and not trinkets, so it's incredibly demoralizing to lose such a powerful artifact.

It's a very painful game which punishes you deeply, but when good things happen, they happen for sure. The grind I feel is its biggest issue.",1672427868,1672427868,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

     people have said this is a game about handling setbacks, and that's possibly the best description of it i could provide. more often than not you're on the back foot. sometimes you can't afford proper provisions for an excursion. sometimes you gotta take a guy who's still afflicted from the stress of the last trip, and rush through before he freaks everyone [i]else[/i] out. the game is tough as nails, and doesn't give you an inch.

     if that doesn't discourage you, i highly recommend giving this game a shot, because you'll find one of the most stylish and inspired rpgs you'll ever play!

The difficulty at the beginning is immense, but as soon as you get familiar with the Heroes, it starts to very slowly become a cake walk. The gameplay can also be very, very grindy, which I can get, although I don't really base the gameplay of Darkest Dungeon off of the Objectives, I base it off of the battles, the balance, the variety of enemies/bosses, and how much fun I'm having. I think that Darkest Dungeon checks all of these off, except maybe for the fun part. If your RNG is really bad, it can piss you off. It took me ~70 hours to finish this game without trying to rush anything.

The atmosphere in Darkest Dungeon is likely one of the best I have ever seen in a game, with it's art, narration, enemy design and variety, and most importantly, this game's soundtrack. I'm genuinely surprised this game's soundtrack didn't instantly blow up at launch, although I didn't play this at launch, I think this game's soundtrack, and soundtrack creator, deserve much more than what they got. If you haven't listened to it, I totally recommend you do.

This game's DLC is actually pretty good, excluding The Butcher's Circus. Both The Color of Madness and Crimson Court DLC offer a lot of original content that is brand new to the game, but still has the same Darkest Dungeon tone to them. Although the difficulty does tend to scale, especially in late game The Color of Madness. The only good thing The Butcher's Circus brought us is it's amazing exclusive soundtrack. Having the Death's Door mechanic in a PvP environment was a terrible idea, you basically just get heroes who have high stress damage dealing, and team wipe within 3 rounds.

Overall, if you never played Darkest Dungeon, or a game like it, you will probably not like Darkest Dungeon. But if you like side scrolling, turn based, RPGs, then it really doesn't get much better.

Unfortunately due to the state of Darkest Dungeon 2, Red Hooks most objectively up to date gameplay is extremely uninspired, and it's actually sad to see who was plausibly my favorite game developer, ruin their reputation like this. I regret every second of development time spent on modifying their game that is already extremely punishing for new players, regardless of difficulty level, it's just the nature of the game. Do not give Red Hook your money in 2023.

I also have no choice but to stop modding this game due to a frame rate bug that is ruining my experience, after nearly half of a year. Yes, half of a fucking year, I could not find a fix for this and it's quite clear Red Hook couldn't care less.

-Secondly, the RNG is full on poop-aids. It renders anything, and I mean ANYTHING, you do to 'improve' your success odds completely pointless. The stats loose any and all point, and become merely aesthetics on the screen. It can create a literal stress loops in the adventure group. And you are forced to watch them panic themself to death, BECAUSE YOU CAN'T SKIP!!

-Thirdly; the online/pvp part. It is unbalanced as hell. If you do not win the coin toss, give up. You cannot win. Also the RNG there is bad aswell. But this is not as important. You're not buying the game for the online part anyways.

Solid game that can be tailored to your liking with mods. A 3/5 game that becomes a 4/5 with mods. Worth the money for fans of the hardcore strategy genre, and worth it for most people on sale if they're willing to put in the time to beat a campaign.

Pros: Cool art and music direction. Team-building for missions is fairly complex with the Quirk & Trinket & Mission systems. Trinket system especially hooks you into running more missions as you hunt for the perfect equipment builds. Nice town-upgrade system. A wonderful modding community that has added many QoL fixes and content add-ons. Solid combat system, and a relatively small learning curve.

Cons: Combat and exploration can become quite repetitive, similar to XCOM. Combat and exploring dungeons is novel at first, but after awhile you start to see the same locations and enemies over and over again as you grind for resources. Then dungeon exploration becomes slow and tedious, with walking and combat animations taking forever to get through. After mastering the learning curve for combat, the biggest challenge you have is inventory/town/character management, all of which require resources. Most of the ""difficulty"" comes from artificially limiting the amount of resources you can get from each mission, which for some people is fine. For me, it looks a lot like an artificial time-sink. Campaign runs can be 60-100 hours. I've seen enough of this type of difficulty in other games that it ends up being a turn-off. I don't need to grind the same dungeons over and over just to get the 1x resource I need to get the next upgrade because I had to choose not to get it in the last mission because my inventory was full of other important stuff. Thankfully the modding community comes in clutch with mods to fix most issues one might have with the game.

EDIT: After a few restarts and a 145 hour run time, I'm back to say that the game is still worth it. Game is definitely not for the faint of heart. Even with the issue of mercilessly dragging out progression via limited resources and slow animations. The DLC in particular add some fun new game modes and characters, but the core gameplay is solid. I may downgrade the rating to a medium 2.5/5 due to the unnecessary dragging of gameplay and some of the repetitive dungeon-crawling, but mods do correct a lot of issues, which still probably bring it up to a 4/5. Don't expect to grind out everything in a couple days. It will take weeks to months of real time to beat the Darkest Dungeon - go in, expect characters to be expendable, and try not to be disheartened if something goes wrong - play it casual and you'll get there.

I'll probably never do another play-through again due to the sheer length of each campaign, but if I were, it would be with additional modded content (sunward isles community made DLC, abyss, community-made characters, etc) in order to add some more variety to the characters, locations, enemy types and overall game mechanics.  For those thinking of doing a 1-and-done playthrough, try adding those mods to reduce some of the repetitiveness - would probably have made the end-game 30+ hour grind more interesting.",1670007937,1671851871,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I keep coming back to this game, year after year. Always coming back. Because I simply love this game and it has enough replayability that I can push it, start to ... eh, near-the-end. Again and again. Because it is simply awesome.

None of the other reviews mention it....  First off, there's this overly-dramatic weird dude narrating everything you do.  Sometimes he'll catch himself being too zealous and try to save face, for example, sometimes after opening a chest he'll say, ""IMPRESSIVE HAUL!... if you... value... such things.....""  Sometimes he's just psychotic - like if an enemy dies of poison he'll sometimes say, ""Slowly, gently... this is how a life is taken!""  Sometimes the things he says don't make any logical sense - there's just a lot of alliteration, like, ""packs laden with loot are often low on supplies.""  Basically really bad dad jokes, but with medieval vocabulary.  It's an incredibly unique sense of humor that I've never seen before.

It's not just the narrator either, it's everything.  The diseases the characters get while adventuring, like ""The Runs"" for example.  The personality traits they acquire, like ""The Witness"" - due to something they saw in church, they'll no longer pray for stress relief (it's a reference to child molestation by priests).  When their stress builds up to 100, they get an ""affliction"" which can have hilarious effects.  They could become ""Abusive"" for example and when this happens, they'll berate other members of their party which in turn stresses THEM out further, possibly causing a chain reaction with everyone getting afflictions.  They could become ""Paranoid"" and refuse to let other party members heal them.  They could become ""Masochistic"" and attack themselves.  You could then, after the dungeon run, put them in the asylum to treat their conditions.    You could pay to have their negative personality traits literally beaten out of them.  If it's not ""Dark Comedy"" I don't know what is.

It doesn't end there.  Even the characters' skills have funny flavor to them.  For example, The Graverobber has a camping skill called, ""Gallows Humor"" which when used, lowers her stress by 25 and all party members either get their stress lowered by 15 or get their stress RAISED by 15.  Get it?  She basically tells a sick joke while camping and there's a chance some people don't appreciate it and this stresses them out.  There's a bard-like character who plays a mandolin and his camping skills have names that all allude to real music... but it's all cheesy 80's tunes (Every Rose Has Its Thorns, Eye Of The Tiger, and If I Could Turn Back Time).  He's also got a skill called ""Mockery"" which raises one character's stress while lowering everyone else's stress (meaning that he makes a joke at someone's expense, which stresses them out and makes everyone else laugh).

You don't usually see such highly emotionally intelligent things coming from RPG devs.  Everything is translated into a number in these sorts of games - everything.  The college level psychology expertise couldn't be quite as funny in another genre of game - the irony of its presence in the nerdiest genre just adds that extra layer of comedy.  No offense to nerds, it's just that usually if you sharpen one corner of your mind, another softens.

Just thought I'd add something that no one has talked about.  I think this is the 3rd funniest game I've ever played after Conker's Bad Fur Day and Trover Saves The Universe.  I didn't even think I'd like this game, the gameplay looked horrible and dated to me.  I just bought it b/c it was on sale and I've learned to trust critical consensus above my first impressions.  It's become a fav quickly though and no one should miss it.  I almost got my wife to try it and the only game she plays is The Sims.
