Overview:
Z1 Battle Royale, formerly known as ""King of the Kill,"" and ""H1Z1"" has undergone a revitalization, seeking to recapture the essence of its original appeal. This fast-paced, action-packed, free-to-play Battle Royale title returns with a commitment to restore the classic look, feel, and gameplay that once enamored its player base. However, while strides have been made, not all aspects of the revival have resonated positively.

Pros:

Nostalgic Restoration: Z1 Battle Royale successfully taps into nostalgia by reviving the classic elements that players loved from its ""King of the Kill"" era. The restoration of movement, combat mechanics, and the PS3 era map contributes to a sense of familiarity.

Competitive Gameplay: Staying true to its competitive roots, Z1 Battle Royale offers solo, duos, and fives gameplay, challenging players to be the last ones standing in a fast-paced and action-packed environment.

Major Overhaul: The game has undergone a significant overhaul, addressing concerns from the past and bringing about changes in movement, animations, combat, gun mechanics, and vehicle mechanics.

New Features: The introduction of in-match missions, a fragments/collection system, seasonal play, and a ranked playlist adds fresh elements to the gameplay, enhancing the overall experience.

Showdown Tournament: The announcement of a new Showdown Tournament and the inclusion of all-new rewards provide additional incentives for players to engage in competitive play.

Cons:

Mixed Reception: Despite efforts to restore the classic feel, the reception has been mixed. Some players appreciate the return to the game's roots, while others feel that the core gameplay has declined in recent years.

Deteriorating Appeal: For certain players, the charm that originally drew them to Z1 Battle Royale seems to have diminished over time. Issues related to recent updates and changes have resulted in a less engaging experience.

Competitive Market: The Battle Royale genre is highly competitive, with numerous titles vying for player attention. Z1 Battle Royale faces the challenge of standing out and retaining its player base in an ever-evolving landscape.

Final Thoughts:
Z1 Battle Royale's attempt to recapture the magic of its earlier years is commendable, with a considerable focus on restoration and improvements. While some players may find solace in the nostalgic revival, others might feel that the core gameplay has not kept pace with evolving player expectations. The game's success in the future will likely hinge on its ability to address these concerns while maintaining the classic elements that once made it a standout in the Battle Royale genre.",1525002585,1702026559,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Ingredients:
1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie 

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.

When this game first came out it was only a survival game there was no battle royal mode to the game, so everyone that paid for the game were buying the just survive edition. Then when these battle royal game game modes that were being  made started becoming really popular daybreak (this games dev team) decided they wanted to make a battle royal mode and add it to the game as an option to play instead of the just survive mode. This was fine with me as i could still play the just survive mode of the game since that was the main reason i bought the game in the first place, after some time passed the battle royal mode to the game started doing really well and was also being streamed on twitch by many popular partnered streamers, this obviously got more and more people to buy the game since everyone wanted to play against these partnered big time streamers. At this point daybreak had decided to split up 2 teams of people and have 1 team work on the battle royal mode of the game while the other team would continue work on the just survive mode of the game. This seemed like a solid plan and again i was fine with it. After some months or so had passed people started noticing that the just survive mode of the game was not getting nearly as much work done to improve it like the battle royal mode of the game was. So of course this caused a pretty big concern for the just survive mode players, daybreak addressed these concerns and told us that just survive would be getting updates still and that it would just take a little longer due to some silly reasons but hey what ever as long as it will still get updates fine. Maybe 3-5 months later after just survive had still received very little updates/fix's the devs came out with another response that basically said they are removing just survive from the game because they want to put all their focus on the battle royal mode of the game. This of course pissed off a lot of people since most people that bought the game got it for it's just survive mode since that was all it had at the start. Now don't get me wrong the battle royal still did pretty well for a while even after just survive mode was removed from the game but over time it did start slowly losing it's player base, in my opinion i feel the reasons the game ended up completely falling apart was due to greedy devs who just wanted money and did not care about screwing over all the people who bought the game for it's just survive mode by removing it from the game and not even offering a refund to people. The game also became littered with cheaters that would of course take over the leader boards, daybreak said they were banning these cheaters but i honestly do not think they banned as many as they claimed they did since a lot of these cheaters remained on the top leader boards for months on end or longer. The player base for the game was also extremely toxic in every way possible. There was a lot of other things that occurred too that were pretty bad. It is honestly really sad that this game fell apart because it was one of the best survival games out there at the time.

This is how NOT to make games or manage them. The majority have asked for (Just Survive) and less have asked for Battle Royal, but because of the hype over Battle Royal game modes in the mid 2010's they decided, ""hey if we take the other game mode away then they'll just gravitate to the game mode we want them to play and we'll be as rich as the other game company's that are capitalizing on Battle Royal game modes"". So lets keep game servers open and try to fund them in a dying game with an overrated game mode instead of listening to the majority of the player base that was willing to throw money at you to build, maintain, and expand on a game mode we actually want to play, lets just ignore that with brute arrogance and try to force people in the direction they no longer want to go in because of your own delusional dream of being a top dog Battle Royal game and just kill of your player base entirely and not even offer us the ability to keep playing (Just Survive) even with our own dedicated servers at the very least is just laughable and frustrating and honestly sad. I can still play call of duty games from 2008-2012 even though the (Official) servers are down we can still take control and play our own servers at the very least. It could have live on for years to come and kept players in your corner. So NO! I say DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON ANY DAYBREAK GAMES OF ANY KIND AND LET THIS COMPANY DIE WITH OUT DIGNITY FOR THEY HAVE NO RESPECT FOR THE PEOPLE THAT MADE THEM A SUCCESSFUL COMPANY IN THE FIRST PLACE!

This game set the bar and set it very high from day 1.
H1Z1 was killing it and became the most popular game for streamers and youtubers. I remember waiting for this game to download on the first night after building my PC at 13. I would watch videos after videos of H1Z1 players while waiting for it download on the world's worst internet. 
It was my first game purchased on steam and my first game that hit 100 hours on my profile. Reach it in 2 weeks. I can barely play for a couple hours until I have to log off now 7 years later.
H1Z1 doesn't exist anymore, it has Z1 Battle Royale in its place. To be honest, its a **** game because of Daybreak's poor decision.
I'm sad I will probably never be hooked to multiplayer game like this again. The game will be truly missed.

update: I wrote this when I was like 13 or 14 lol. I'm 21 now.

Haven't even heard of this time in years until only now seeing this all the way at the bottom of my steam library. I don't even play games that much lol. Good early memories but besides that the game itself was super lackluster in it's Battle Royale component and even it's wannabe Day-Z component.

my favorite memory of this game was the proximity voice chat. especially when it was activated the moment the game started loading and it would just be a 50-100 player VC mic spam fest, funny moment in early gaming. Rip",1494893938,1696727161,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

While H1Z1 was once the powerhorse of Zombie Survival (DayZ Mod was outdated and the standalone still garbage), with a really good map, nice balancing, a great community, and innovative ideas, Z1 is a game noone ever really needed. lets face it: pubg did it better from the beginning and COD took it to another level. Its never been an outstanding Battle Royal like H1Z1 has been as a Survival Game. But apperently, u can make way more money with a Battle Royal Shooter! Or at least the devs thought this way. First riding the upcoming survival wave, then, jumping right to the next wave to take on the next trend, Battle Royal. The first Battle Royal Game Mode was pretty okay. That was it. Me and my squad would do a round or two after getting killed in the MAIN game, just to return there right after. And you know what? H1Z1 was great. I loved it. My Squad loved it. It was hella fun. It wasnt perfect, but it could have been near perfection with ongoing work from the devs. 
And Im still pissed it had to die for this. They could have made two games. But no. One gamemode had to die apprerently. And it was the wrong one.

Z1 Battle Royale, formerly known as H1Z1, offers a mixed bag of emotions for fans of the battle royale genre. Developed by Daybreak Game Company, the game has undergone various changes and updates over the years, resulting in an experience that is both exhilarating and frustrating.

The core gameplay of Z1 Battle Royale is undeniably intense and action-packed. The fast-paced matches keep you on the edge of your seat as you compete against other players in a fight for survival. The adrenaline rush from landing in the map, quickly scavenging for weapons, and engaging in intense firefights is undeniable, making each match an adrenaline-pumping experience.

The game's map design is vast and diverse, with urban areas, forests, and rural landscapes providing different challenges and strategies. This variety ensures that no two matches feel the same, and it keeps the gameplay fresh and engaging.

Furthermore, the gunplay is solid, and the shooting mechanics are satisfying. Players who are quick on their feet and possess good aiming skills will find themselves at an advantage, making each kill feel like a well-earned victory.

However, despite these strengths, Z1 Battle Royale does have some notable drawbacks. The game has struggled with optimization issues, resulting in occasional frame rate drops and lag spikes, particularly during intense moments or when multiple players are nearby. These performance problems can be frustrating and can negatively impact the overall enjoyment of the game.

Additionally, the game's community can be somewhat toxic, with instances of cheating and unsportsmanlike behavior affecting the overall experience. While the developers have taken steps to address these issues, they still persist to some extent.

Another aspect that divides the player base is the game's overall direction. With the changing development focus and updates over time, some players may prefer the older versions of the game, leading to mixed feelings about the current state of Z1 Battle Royale.

In conclusion, Z1 Battle Royale delivers a thrilling battle royale experience with fast-paced gameplay and intense firefights. However, the game's performance issues and the presence of cheaters detract from the overall enjoyment. If you're a fan of the genre and can overlook some of the game's flaws, Z1 Battle Royale still offers moments of excitement and fun. However, for those seeking a more polished and stable battle royale experience, it may be worth considering other options in the genre.",1689877859,1689877859,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]
It's the BR that started it all for a lot of people, it's where i started. I actually have well over 200 hours in this game but due the game splitting from it's survival counterpart, those hours where no longer tracked. You parachute into a map, search for gear and fight it out while the circle closes in, familiar right? Keep in mind, i had to search for games on the NA server, being from Aus i had roughly 170ms, i found roughly 7 players per game, which you know, if you like quick matches i suppose. Fortunately, the circle does compensate for the amount of players, so they are just firefights as soon as you hit the ground but with ping that high it's just not enjoyable. Their are customisation options for your character, and a store to buy cosmetics from, which, these day's, wouldn't be worth it. 

[h1] Story [/h1]
To my knowledge, their isn't one, unless there is lore outside of the game that i am not aware of.

[h1] Difficulty [/h1] 
It can be hard if you are unfamiliar to these sort of games, it might be quite jarring to come back after playing pubg, fortnite as well, or you just happen to have 200ms like myself.

[h1] Length [/h1] 
I loaded this game up, for the first time after it split and played it for about 10 minutes. No OCE or, SEA servers really limit the time i would want to spend on it, which to be fair, no point them having those as options where the player base essentially gone.

[h1] Visuals [/h1] 
It's generic, i don't really have much to say about it these days, it's not bad, not great. It always fit perfectly in that ""anyone can play it"" category, without looking awful.

[h1] Audio [/h1]
It's all just ""fine"" to my ears, music is dramatic and tense, guns audio sounds fine, footsteps are loud, but that's for game-play effect.  

[h1] Performance [/h1]
Today, you could run this game on just about every system, i'm sure, no bugs that i had come across, and if their was with how long it's been around for, then that's an issue.

One of the biggest issues with the game is its performance, as it suffers from frequent lag and stuttering that can greatly affect the player's experience. This can be especially frustrating when playing in high-pressure situations, such as during the final stages of a match.

Another problem with Z1 Battle Royale is its unbalanced and lackluster weapons and equipment. Many of the weapons feel underpowered or unresponsive, making them difficult to use effectively in battle. Additionally, the equipment and perks system is underdeveloped, with few interesting or unique options to choose from.

Finally, the game's map design is also a drawback, as it is poorly optimized and lacks the level of detail and variety found in other battle royale games. This can make the matches feel repetitive and uninteresting after a short time.

Overall, Z1 Battle Royale is a game that falls short in several key areas, and fails to deliver a truly engaging and enjoyable battle royale experience. While it may have some redeeming features, such as its fast-paced and action-packed gameplay, these are outweighed by its technical issues and lackluster design elements.",1483398934,1676111968,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It was a raw game with very basic elements but something about it kept you wanting more. However as time went out, so did the players. Better games came out and players ended up abandoning this game, but only after the developers abandoned this game and left it to rot. After years of not playing it. I found out Just Survive (the better part of this game) is no longer playable. And because I have more than 2 hours and obviously more than 2 weeks since I bought the game. They wont issue me a refund. It's hard to believe that a studio is so grungy about their money. I can never play this game again and yet they refuse to issue me a refund based off some 2 hour nonsense. I used to love this game, now nothing but hatred. The battle royale was good for a time being, but quickly got turned into a mobile game but for your PC. The whole studio is garbage and scumbags.

(Jan 15, 2015) King of the kill (KotK) was originally a side game mode (that PlayerUnknown helped develop for SOE) and could only be played with event tickets that dropped in the main game. Then the BR craze happened.

Sony sold SOE, Daybreak formed.
KOTK was the money cow, and the main game became the red headed step child. 
Daybreak split H1Z1 into two games, H1Z1 Just survive and H1Z1 KOTK. 
Daybreak renames the two games, by removing H1Z1 from Just Survive and Changing H1Z1 KotK to H1Z1. 
H1Z1 is made F2P
Daybreak kills Just Survive
Daybreak basically kills H1Z1

A lot of the reviews are negative because the gamemode creates toxic players. You get one life per game and when you have a high amount of kills end game but lose of course you're going to be pissed. YOU WON'T WIN ALL OF THEM!
If you're considering this game try and two tap all the royalty players for a good laugh, because apparently they think they are the gods of KOTK. Trust me they will have something to say.

But well, the developers destroyed this game with their not smart decisions.
1. While H1Z1 was around and before PUBG was released what did Daybreak (the devs) do?
-Push out little updates every 4-6 months, such updates that were NOT worthy of the time they took to come out.
2. After PUBG and Fortnite appear what did Daybreak do?
-Push out big updates (cosmetic ones) and completely reworking both gun mechanics and vehicle mechanics (which only needed some corrections not reworks).
-Couple months later, the unoptimized, cosmetic filled, money grabbing H1Z1 is announced to go out of early access, aiming at a very good perspective for the future of the game, (which didn't work as devs expected). 
Updates that didn't bring anything good ruined this game.
It was a great battleroyale game with a lot of potential.

Announce Preseason 3 ->
Make sure china can play (no kill in the name, blue blood, no skull, taxi car skin instead of police car on chinese servers) ->
Merge JS with KOTK back into H1Z1 (which removes kill in the name) -> 
Make the game free 2 play on first week of ps3 launch (pay gap against cheaters after) -> 
Plenty of servers (to prevent player queues) -> 
Advertise PS3 on steam/youtube/twitch -> 
Make H1Z1 multi platform (epic games store + origin + battlenet) -> 
Z1Map on BR 

Quality of Life: (+ Keeping Players)
Add someone who manages cheaters (apex legends hideouts (someone who big streamers can send clips of cheaters to)-> 
Moderate Toxicity 1 WARNING then PERMANENT BAN -> 
fix bugs (obviously easier said then done) -> 
Bring back old Quality of life things 
(examples remove beltpouch merch bulk with default character wastepack only on ground) ->
Remove White Loading Screens (flashbang is annoying) -> 
Fix infinite running man on start up (character select not showing) ->
Improve on communicating -> 
Give players something to do / grind for (reset level, sneakyfeet skins grind, steam achievements)

Tried this game again today.....Miss what it use 2 be, completely dead now. :(


I love the game but believe it does lack content. Its still in ""alpha"" so i hope to see more content along with more stable game play and less bugs/glitches. A few more game modes and guns would help. There is plenty of action and fun to be had. At its current state being ""alpha"" i highly recommend and even if i was a finished product for the $10 i spent, well worth it. I feel as though if Daybreak keeps with it alot of people will be pleased, I honestly hope they do. They're sitting on a game with amazing potential!

Yes, this game has had its issues with bugs, unnecessary updates, and other major things. But the amount of fun I have had playing this game and memories I have made playing with friends will always be there. It hurts to see that this game went from being one of the Top Battle Royale Games of a player base of 150,000 to what it is now. I know that Day Break pushed out updates to help improve the game but failed to realize that most things they did were completely unnecessary and also failed to listen to the community's feedback, especially after the Combat Update. Back in early 2019, when Jace Hall & NantG took over H1 and began to make bug fixes, improve the games play style in regards to combat, movement, etc. There was hope for this game once again. But it was too good to be true, and once it was announced that NantG would hand back the game to Day Break, I feel as if all faith for H1 was lost through out the whole community.

Several Patches Later:

Game is nothing like it used to be.... Riddled with botters and now mostly dead.   Good luck getting into a lobby that has more than 7 players unless you get on the asia servers and want to deal with hackers galore lol...

They really could have made this a great title but they refused to listen to the community and well....  This company did the SAME thing with Everquest 2 and ran that into the ground as well.   EQ2 used to be thriving when it was owned by Sony Online Entertainment and not long after the title changed hands into this studio it quickly went downhill.....  Any title this company touches is set to fire and burned to the ground.

To anyone interested in Purchasing this game, let me give you a heads up of what you are getting into. 

This game is currently in alpha as of, 10/3/2017. This game was launched in the alpha state ""2/18/2016"". The development team has failed to fix bugs, glitches and hit registration. 

They have not put in effort to fix the game and instead pumped out crates and skins to profit off of games initial success. 

Well they succeed in generating revenue, yet failed the player base who supported them. Now they are trying to rush and make improvements but its a little to late. They didn't listen to their player base and instead moved forward with their own agenda. A prime example to future developers on what not to do.",1507092569,1632502607,False,1,0,0.502016127109527588,0,True,False,False

I really hate that I can't get a refund/ they removed it completely. Honestly they could've made money off of player hosted servers but no.

Anyway not much to be said here, it's an online game and you need people to play with or against. Servers are dead, with players up to 30 max on each server, whereas it used to stretch to 200 players in one session. These people are also the veterans of this game and won't have any mercy on you, so if you are a new comer, you will have a terrible time unfortunately.

The game runs well on medium to high settings on a mid-range system. The coolest thing about this game is that you can toggle your view-distance, so you can set it higher whilst you are in a game to see far when you need to and when you don't you can set it lower for that maximum fps boost.

January 15, 2015: It's sold under the name of H1Z1. It was marketed as an open world zombie survival game, akin to DayZ. I bought it for 20$. The game does not run.

After a time, they release a new gamemode; King of the Kill. It's a battle royale mode, made specifically because PLAYERUNKNOWN made a hugely successful battle royale mod for the game but then split off to make his own game (PUBG).

February 5, 2016: KOTK is doing well, so they split it off from the game, both of them costing 20$. They silently abandon the original game, only doing small feature updates and adding nothing but bugs. H1Z1 (The survival game.) is renamed to H1Z1 Just Survive. KOTK is renamed H1Z1: King of the Kill. Not long after they rename H1Z1 Just Survive to simply Just Survive (Which sounds like a terrible 3$ app game.) and rename H1Z1 King of the Kill to just H1Z1.

KOTK, or H1Z1, or H1Z1 Battle Royale...or...whatever the crap they named it, is shut down as well, and re-published and renamed as a different game, Z1 Battle Royale, obviously done to alienate the game from it's wretched history.

The kicker? It's free. Also, it's still called H1Z1 Battle Royale on consoles, and when Z1 BR is run, the window is named H1Z1.

They made a game said it was like DayZ. It didn't even work. Then they simply deleted it from my library with no refund. Z1 BR is dead, it garners about 3 active players. They actually, legitimately built a fake game and then deleted it for money.

Utterly disgusting development team. When everyone said the original game was going down in flames due to terrible updates, horrible balancing fix attempts that only worsened the balance, and endless amounts of bugs spilling into the game, i sat there, with hope. This is what i got.

They said the original H1Z1 was originally going to be made free. I was fine, 20$ for instant beta access to a DayZ game was fine. What they didn't say is that it was a blatant lie and they would toss the game in the trash in favor of another random game they made using the original games assets (I told you. They're terrible.

The only marginally interesting or entertaining part of this game is it's history.

January 15, 2015: It's sold under the name of H1Z1. It was marketed as an open world zombie survival game, akin to DayZ. I bought it for 20$. The game does not run.

After a time, they release a new gamemode; King of the Kill. It's a battle royale mode, made specifically because PLAYERUNKNOWN made a hugely successful battle royale mod for the game but then split off to make his own game (PUBG).

February 5, 2016: KOTK is doing well, so they split it off from the game, both of them costing 20$. They silently abandon the original game, only doing small feature updates and adding nothing but bugs. H1Z1 (The survival game.) is renamed to H1Z1 Just Survive. KOTK is renamed H1Z1: King of the Kill. Not long after they rename H1Z1 Just Survive to simply Just Survive (Which sounds like a terrible 3$ app game.) and rename H1Z1 King of the Kill to just H1Z1. (H1Z1 Battle Royale on consoles.) Development of the original survival game, ""Just Survive"", is still mostly halted.

October 24, 2018: Just Survive, the survival game i paid for, is shut down. The game is removed from my, and everyone else's steam library, with no refund. KOTK, or H1Z1, or H1Z1 Battle Royale...or...whatever the crap they named it, is shut down as well, and re-published and renamed as a different game, Z1 Battle Royale, obviously done to alienate the game from it's wretched history.

The kicker? It's free. Also, it's still called H1Z1 Battle Royale on consoles, and when Z1 BR is run, the window is named H1Z1.

They made a game said it was like DayZ. It didn't even work. Then they simply deleted it from my library with no refund. Z1 BR is dead, it garners about 3 active players. They actually, legitimately built a fake game and then deleted it for money.

Utterly disgusting development team. When everyone said the original game was going down in flames due to terrible updates, horrible balancing fix attempts that only worsened the balance, and endless amounts of bugs spilling into the game, i sat there, with hope. This is what i got.

They said the original H1Z1 was originally going to be made free. I was fine, 20$ for instant beta access to a DayZ game was fine. What they didn't say is that it was a blatant lie and they would toss the game in the trash in favor of another random game they made using the original games assets (I told you. They're terrible. Too lazy to even make new assets.) simply because Fortnite was getting popular.

And after all that?

The game sucks balls.

Now unfortunately, there isn't anyone playing anymore. In fact it would take me 15 minutes until 1 other person joins the NA region to actually play a round.

I paid for a open world zombie survival game, with open mics and proximity chat that felt more like the walking dead than any walking dead video game to date. The world truly felt like playing the walking dead as I could hear other players talking to each other as they got closer and the people where the real threat not the zombies. So tense, so good! What I ended up with was a mediocre micro-transaction filled battle royale game!

The games strong point was the survival game play not its gun play and they killed that part to chase an upcoming trend and only fall flat on their face when games that are better at shooting showed up. Now we have a dead survival game and piss poor br game to show for our early support of this dev! I feel duped, burned, tricked, and conned

This bait and switch has forever burned me on the idea of early access. Thanks a lot H1Z1, and may this cautionary tale serve as a warning to others.

This game used to be king.

Terrible, terrible dev decisions just massacred this one, from a simple game with a fun and interesting map and gunplay to trying HARD to compete with the extreme success of pubg. Like this is the videogame's industry version of Linking Park's one more light, it's just absolute garbage which flips off its fanbase infavour of more popular elements but stumbles and shits its pants, alienating the old fanbase and potential fans just see right through it. 

This is just a travesty, ugly, overly saturated, weird new mechanics, changed pvp system, weak/pointless added content, heavy use of microtransactions while still having the original version's problems like floaty and shit movement both on foot and in cars. 

The old version was a clear 7.5 but this, THIS is a 1/10 absolute embaressment.

But, I do not mind having multiple options in a game. I love having multiple game mode types in one game to change things up. There are a ton of people who want preseason 3 H1Z1 back. Like bring back that game and call it H1Z1 classic or something. I mean there are definitely positives in the newer version of the game. But I feel like there should be more of pre-season 3. I mean I honestly feel like you catered a game just for China. 

I even feel like the shading in pre-season 3 was better. I felt there was better visibility in that version.
Forced shadows shouldn't be on, we should be able to turn them off. 
The battle royale experience is awful in the new game. 
There were more refined spawns in preseason 3. You didn't always spawn in the mountains or at the edge of the map all the time. 
The gas has changed. Like if you are caught in the gas you are dead. Never used to be like that. I remember having more time to loot and and get gear and plan my next route to the safe zone. I like that the gas moved at a slower speed, and even the timer for the gas gave you more ample to time. On the contrary though you still had to make haste when looting.

I have a good understanding of the game and it's mechanics. i've watched this game ""evolve"" over the various preseasons, whether it evolved for the good or the bad is really up to the player. With that being said, the majority of the people who have been playing for a good while like me, agree that H1Z1 really has taken a turn for the worst. Before you start to blame the new players for wanting the game to be easier for them or the advanced players for wanting some sort of change in gameplay mechanics, none of their opinions really mattered in the first place, let me explain why. Daybreak Games is the one to blame for this game's downfall, not the players or community, the devs. They didn't change the game because of the new players who wanted the game to be easier because they kept getting 2 tapped by the good people. The devs want more money, period. Honestly, I'm having trouble typing that with confidence just because the game is now dying because of their poor decisions to cater to brand new players rather than enforcing a ""skill gap"". They're digging themselves a hole and it might be too late to update the game out of the bottom of it.


Gameplay Mechanics: My biggest point to make about mechanics has to be the recoil. The combat update ruined this game and I cannot force that statement enough. The new AR-15 recoil especially made spraying WORSE and all it did was lower the skill gap. Daybreak should have reliazed that horizontal recoil was completely unique to H1. Seriously, what other game can implement something as dumb as horizontal recoil and have the game do good? The answer is no other game besides H1Z1. It was the most fun and unique aspect to the game which oddly made sense while you were playing. Switching to vertical recoil was just taking away the uniqueness of the game and just turning it into a shitty mainstream game. Next, the movement. If you have ever played PUBG, you know how it feels when you move compared to pre-combat update H1Z1. It feels slow and sluggish, which is exactly what post combat update H1 feels like. The pattern is starting to form, Daybreak is making H1Z1 as close to PUBG as possible. This really sucks to see for the veteran players because we play this game because its NOT PUBG. This review is already long so I'll leave it with those 2 main points.



Unneccesary Changes: Daybreak is known to ignore big issues within the game while spending their time on trivial things to add to the game that nobody cares about. Examples, in the most recent update, new gun models were added. Someone explain to me why we needed that? Anyways, some more examples I won't go in detail with are new crates, new POIs, a new menu, I could go on but you get the point.


Unqualified Developers: I want to know what college or university these people attended, or better yet if they even finished high school. Some of the things these people do are so beyond retarded I physically can't even comprehend the reasoning behind it. An example is in the combat training or deathmatch mode, who's idea was it to have a set loadout that cannot be changed by the player, (i.e. AR/AK, shotty/smh, pistol) just let us make our own loadouts with our preferred weapons in whatever slot we're comfortable with. It seems like whenever the community asks for something, Daybreak does the polar opposite. We asked for better hitreg, a better shotgun spread/damage, and the reversal or fix to desync. What did we get? The fucking combat update. 


I think I'll stop there, if you want more info just go on the H1 reddit, there are tons of great informative people on there. If you read my review all the way through, you're a beast. If you found it informative, a thumbs up would be much appreciated. There are definitly points I missed in this review, so if I catch any I'll be sure to make an edit at a later time. My final verdict is I can't reccomend you this game in it's current state. Thanks for reading.",1486427795,1617510060,True,0,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,True

It used to be our home, a Zombie Survival MMO. I made tons of good memories and lifelong friends alot the way, then a greedy cow name DayBreak Game tried to milk it as much as they can. 
The BR mode was wonderful in its own arcady style but some of bad decisions from greedy company executives ruined this game.  I still have hope for it to comeback. Anyways it's F2P rn and if you are new player, it would be frustating at start. But the feeling and sound of 2 tapping someone is better than anything else in the world.

That said, the game was somehow still incredible despite the incompetent dev team for at least a year after the BR mode was released. The blood splats and different functions of motorcycle vs. tactical helmets made the game challenging and unique. It was the most fun BR to date, bar none. Unfortunately, about a year and a half in, Arclegger spent more time fanboying Lirik on Twitch than listening to his player base and completely overhauled the camera view, removed the blood splat mechanic and replaced it with basic B**** hit markers, then he made all helmets the exact same. As if his player base hadn't suffered enough, he and his team of dropouts thought it would be a great idea to completely take the map everyone knew and loved out of the game forever, replacing it with a neon-colored, vomit-inducing map straight out of Banjo Kazooey. I have never seen a player base collectively quit a game so quickly in my life. Seriously folks, this game had the most robust and die-hard player base in the gaming industry at the time and it disappeared overnight while Arclegger counted his shekels and sent his resume to his local Subway. This game died the day those hackers forced the CEO of Sony's video game division to land his private jet and cut Arclegger loose with a great game so he could ruin it. I'm not even joking, this dude named his company ""Daybreak Games"".... ""TheyBreak Games"", you can't make this sh** up!",1616113958,1616113958,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

DayBreak always taken the worst decisions and continue to take... This game dies every passing day and you still not give up. You shut down servers to the best players who were always close to you, they never asked for anything,they continue to play this game full of bugs and promote this. Now the next ""kicking in the a$$"" for your remaining players is to promote a great event on facebook, really? Everybody knows facebook is for family, for you is the same DayBreak Team = Family... You know more better about these teams came to play just for the MONEY, no one ever plays that. Good players in this game are on fingers (Max 10). Your next decision is to remove all the old players and let Free2Players to play (People/Bots who always punching and have default outfit)
Our honest advice is to sell this game. Please save us !!!

If H1Z1: Just Survive was doomed to fail immediately, then H1Z1: King of the kill still kicked for a while. Back in the heyday of the Battle Royale genre, there were disputes about which was better - PUB or H1Z1: King of the kill, although even then everything was extremely obvious. This game was saved only by more adequate optimization than its competitor, so buckets could play this new and fashionable BattleRoyale of yours. The game itself is a crooked craft of the genre of royal battles and has:
- Poor variety of content.
- Bad shooting.
- Stable monotony.
- Weak online.
- Poor gameplay.

[b] Summary:[/b]
The game did improve from my last update. The devs tried to make it like PS3, however they were too late I guess and they all got laid off. Currently H1Z1(Z1BR) doesn't have a dev team, but who knows? Daybreak was bought by another compnay. Maybe they will revive the true H1Z1? We'll just have to wait and see. Until next time!

I don't really know if I still recommend it. I'll wait for Z1 before I change it. Giving it a chance!

[u] 2nd Review  [/u]

Posted: 13 March 2018, 7 months after the last one.
I'm updating it because of the game going free-to-play and out of Early Access.


[h1] Backstory: [/h1]

I bought this game for ‚Ç¨19.99 in [b] January 27, 2017( Pre-Season 3) [/b] and I currently have [b] 1011 hrs. [/b] So I'm a ""trustworthy"" reviewer and I'm not BIASED. H1Z1 is my first ever PC game as I was previously an Xbox gamer. The reason I went all the way to buy a $2000 PC 
(First PC btw) was so I could play with all my friends and H1Z1 was the $HIT back then :)

[h1] Okay, let's start with the review. [/h1]

[b] Is this game good? [/b] 

I think so. 

This game has definitely come a long way and improved internally, unfortunately, it has lost a lot of its player base. When I did my review 7 months ago it peaked at 140.000 players, now it's 41.000 and only because it went F2P. Right before that, it was 8.000. I hope this game will survive.. It's really apart of me by now. The reason the game was dying... Well, Daybreak did their biggest mistake ever, releasing [url=https://www.h1z1.com/update-notes/combat-update-live-patch-notes-August-2017] the Combat Update  [/url] and long story short. It ruined the game and what made it H1Z1, but now it's back to its glory IMO.

[b]So? Should you download and play this game?[/b]
Why not? It's free :) Nah, seriously you should. If you can handle getting killed a lot in the beginning, rage and frustration then absolutely. H1Z1 IS VERY FUN when you win games, kill other players etc. Anyways let's start with the cons and pros. 

Cons: Desync, the shotgun currently and the toxic player base.

Pros: Great gun mechanics, very skill, fast pace, amazing driving mechanics, third/first person and it's very rewarding mentally. 

[b]Final verdict.[/b]

8/10
Do I recommend it? 
Yes, I do.

Hope to see you in Fort Destiny :)

[u] 1st Review [/u]

[h1] H1Z1: King of the Kill [/h1]
 
[b]Okay so is this game good?[/b]
hmmm no not really
[b]Is it addicting?[/b]
YES
[b]Should you spend your money on this game?[/b]
It depends.. If you can handle rage and frustration sure. The game can be fun at times like when you win games, kill ppl etc. But the shotgun... oooh the shotgun is trash. Let's start off with the cons because that's the easiest one to do. 

Cons: Hit Registration, Desync, THE SHOTGUN, a lot of bugs and glitches.

Pros: Enjoyable when it works. More specific huh? well if you like third person shooters then this is your game I guess.

[b]Final verdict...[/b]

If you got the money sure but I would say wait until the combat update which is in a couple of weeks to see if daybreak doesn't mess up.

6/10
Do I recommend it? 
No not in its current state BUT I will be updating this review in the future.

The rating might be too low but the flaws are too big and it's really a daybreaker[spoiler] (deal breaker) [/spoiler]haha see what I did there xD. This game has potential but it will die if Daybreak doesn't start fixing this game. PUBG will destroy the game and the community, a lot of pro and amateur players already moved on to PUBG.",1502389232,1612818522,True,4,1,0.569832444190979004,2,True,False,False

EDIT: More updates comes more trash. Once again it is not worth the filth it was built on.

EDIT: Biggest failure.

EDIT: Pile of shit guns dont reload upon audio queue and players vanish and turn up behind you with a shotgun and shit servers that are only hosted in west coast of the US so us East coast get high ping and regardless half the games population are japs

So it was a real pity for me to witness how the game has been transformed into this fourth-rate, copy-cat, constantly glitched amalgamation of bad creative choices. But at the same time I am really proud and overjoyed by the reaction of the community, and although I think there is no realistic way that we can get the game back, I encourage everyone to voice themselves if they haven't already and write one of this stating your opinion and maybe a nice experience you had with the old game, so we can focus on the positive things even in the face on this loss we have all suffered. And who knows, maybe one day the developers will realise the atrocities they committed. 
I'll leave you with a quote that I think really describes the oblivion of unshameful-ness/ delusion the devs have wrapped themselves with. (From the game blurb found above)
""Staying true to its ""King of the Kill"" roots, the game has been revamped and restored to the classic feel, look, and gameplay everyone fell in love with. Play solo, duos, or fives and be the last ones standing.""
...
To the devs, go fuck yourselves.
To all of you, my fellow comrades, keep true to yourselves (because I think that is what we can take away from this experience) and don't forget to spread the love and be supportive and amicable with each other.

8/6/20 Update - Yeah I don't know why I acted that way but the real story is I had a really bad Laptop that my Dad gave me and I thought I could run this game. So anyway I just left th game running in the background for over 400+ hours and I never even got to play it. Anyway still sticking with my statement form 2 years ago, Game is awful wouldn't even launch and I'm still locked out over 2 years later. Also checked up on this game and I'm pretty sure it's more dead than Fortnite so don't even buy it.

Update:
This game is dead. Glad I sold all my skin before they decided to disable transferring skins/items from player to player lol. I remember one AR-15 skin could cost about $1k when this game was popular. I laughed at my friend who kept his skins instead of selling. He thought the game would get better and even more popular.

This game would actually be good and fun to play if it wasn't for hit registration and car physics being fucked up all over the place. The concept is good, the map is playable-ish.

If daybreak actually listened to customer feedback and acted upon it, they would immediately fix hit registration on the shotgun and the AR15 bullets.

A good order to follow would be like so:
1)Fix all shotguns. Completely scrape the code and model for the current shotgun, and make a new model and re-script the code with those ""high-level developers"".
2) Next fix all of the missing AR15 and AK47 shots. Headshots SHOULD ALWAYS be on the head and deal damage, and bullets should NEVER just disappear out of nowhere. 
3) Desync: Oh for the love of god, please fix your damn desync issues. This fucks over so many people it is actually unreal and funny to watch on twitch highlights. Instead of allowing the server to adjust itsself based on each individual player, make one rate that the server refreshes to. If a player's internet can't keep up, then boo hoo, they lag(not like that's already a huge issue with the game).
4) Car Physics: Oh for the love of god this too. I'm not talking about when people drive off cliffs and their cars' explode. I'm talking about when a car gets stuck inbetween a fire hydrant and a pole, and magically their car explodes. Getting your car blown up by a fucking wooden bench would never happen, at least not in 0.500 seconds. Also on a side note, if I run someone over with a car and it is apparent, it should kill them, not make the car glitch.
5) Map issues: There are still issues with the map(duplicate doors, clips where they shouldn't be, no clips where they should be, etc.). Noticeable ones are the roof of one of the buildings in Ranchito, where there is a complete shield around a person and they are essentially invisible. 
6) (this relates to the issue of desync) Trading: For the love of god, when playing, my first three games, I traded 3 TIMES IN A ROW. Trading should NEVER HAPPEN, especially after 2 years of ""development"". One person shoots the gun first that gets the kill, bullets do not wait for the other person to shoot their gun and then go.

Overall, Daybreak doesn't give a shit about their game and it will have to start declining for them to start losing money to actually give a shit about the game. They keep releasing skins(just like valve), without fixing their game, and as long as they are still making money, they won't actually put effort into fixing the game.",1496283576,1604627687,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

AWFUL GAME!!!   I MEAN WHO THE FUCK MAKES A GAME THATS BEEN EARLY ACCESS FOR 2 FUCKING YEARS?!?! THIS GAME FUCKING SUCKS FUCK YOU DAYBREAK

---Update since March 13 2016---

THE GAME IS STILL FUCKING TRASH.. I THINK IT EVEN MAY BE FUCKING WORSE

---Udpate since June 20 2016---

Jesus Christ, PUBG has saved my life because it is way more balanced than KOTK. The shotgun is just way too unreliable. The new map had me thinking that the game was going uphill, but all the same problems have not been fixed. The hit reg is stil not good at all, the glitchy car mechanics make for frustrating moments, and sometims you randomly just die for no clear reason, like you have just suffered from cardiac arrest. Sure, the ranking system is cool and Daybreak have come out with some pretty cool skins, but that is just for looks, they are not pushing out updates on the regular fixing the bad mechanics they have already. PUBG is the way to go if you want a battle royale game in my opinion, i dont think i ever want to reinstall this game onto my pc. The only things going for this game for me is that not everybody camps like in PUBG and it is more fast paced, but for all the other drawbacks, it is not enough for me to give this piece of shit failure a positive review. Thanks for reading.

---UPDATE SINCE JULY 26 2017---

wow... the developers have really blown me away, they have seriously impressed me. they have run this game so far into the ground that the game has less than 5000 concurrent players... daily. this game was so fun, and now it is the worst game i own, and you can look at my library and see that i have some bad games. this has to be one of the biggest disappointments regarding video games in the past few years. fuck off daybreak

UPDATE 10-8-2020

Players can choose to play solo, in a duo, or in groups of five, with the goal of being the final person or final team remaining.
H1Z1 started as a survival game in 2015 and received later a battle royale mode with the help of Brendan Green (PlayerUnknown).
In 2016 H1Z1 had been split into two separate games, subtitled Just Survive and King of the Kill (KOTK).
At its prime KOTK had an all-time peak of 151,239 concurrent players in 2017.
Then came the combat update, the gun play and recoil was drasitcally changed for its core guns and the result was that the playerbase was shrinking.
In 2018 the game was made free to play. Most players have already switched to other Battle Royale games.
In March 2019, the game was rebranded as Z1 Battle Royale under the development of NantG Mobile. The target of NantG Mobile was to revert the majority of the changes made to the game's mechanics, weapon balancing, and user interface since the ""Preseason 3"" era of the game in early-2017. However, NantG handed Z1 Battle Royale back to Daybreak. It was announced that Daybreak will only keep the servers running but there will be no more updates.
Over the years there were 2 different maps, Z1 and Z2. A 3rd was for PS4 only.
It was alot of fun to play the H1Z1 Battle Royale game, especially before the combat update. It was always kinda broken and had lot of glitches, but it has given it its charme. It was fun to watch streamers raging because for no reason the car they were driving explodes and so on.
Wrong decisions of its developer and other competitors on the market made the game die.
In a match there is place for 150 players but nowadays you can be happy if you find a match with 20+ players.
The Just Survivors servers have already shutted down, I think it is only a matter of time until Z1 Battle Royale will follow.
As it is free to play you can check it out, but there are more popular BR games out there, from my point of view it is no fun anymore to play with something like 10 - 20 players a round.

It wasn't Day Z, and it didn't have to be, it had its own charm, its own moments and interactions; like when the hospital first became a location, more fleshed out, the original map being expanded in size and scope and feeling more lived in.  It was an amazing game.  Z1 Battle Royale felt--like it was fine at first, it felt like H1Z1, the same mechanics, the same firearm feel, recoil, aiming, and then a few updates along the line and it felt like it was trying to be Fortnite.  It felt cheap.  Not unique, not the fun experience I remembered.  And then all these whacky modes start entering the scene, and even earlier on the game is separated in to two and then Just Survive as it would be known, was just killed off.  Gone.

H1Z1 from years ago, was an amazing, fun, and enjoyable game.  The survival game was excellent.  The battle royale was slower and that was -OKAY-, that was more than okay!

There's no way that none of the devs don't have back ups from the updates of the game. Then again, I really wouldn't be that surprised to find that Daybreak is incompetent enough to not keep backups of the game they were working on.

The old map was organic but hardcore, scrapped. The old shooting-system being completely unique, ""fixed"" (it just got replaced with a stock boring and very unskilled system), also scrapped. Daybreak added a new ""good"" map which wasn't utilized properly for most of it's used life-cycle (nobody should play this game anymore atm, seriously) and it gets worse.

There's no access to the old map, likely because it was ""remade"" despite ignoring the fact that they aren't similar even vaguely. The developers only focused on spewing out new colorful skins of varying rarities etc, as new competing products crept up and posed as a threat. Essentially, the game imploded on itself because the developers never understood why their game was great in the first place. If i could speak to the entire dev team, i'd be insanely furious on how they literally gored their entire game part by part, and then spent the rest of their remaining cash on sponsored streams from Twitch personalities (NO joke, summit1g for example). And they did this after making the game free2play. After butchering the game, and after people had learned the new map which barely got used past it's 50% hotspots because their designed code was so bad the end/ring couldn't reach the cool outer limits of the map.

What irks me a ton at present day is that i still to this day get no way of going back to play the old map what so ever. At best one get youtube vods of the map, it's not good enough and i would cleanly stay away from them and their products till maybe when they make a good game and manage it like adults again. It's just an idea though.

I have over 400hrs on H1, played since the beginning and it's fair to say the experience has nosedived with the arrival of each patch. There have always been flaws but these were easy to overlook in the early days(especially as it was an 'Early Release' game), the arcadey gameplay was addictively fun which made it a great alternative to PUBG. The fact this game is now free and still nobody wishes to play speaks volumes, it's almost impossible to find a game with more than 10 players.

The main reasons why this game went down the toilet:
‚Ä¢ Gunplay - Weapon balance was constantly being changed, i lost count of the amount of times the effective range, spread and damage of the shotgun was altered. As a player it gets very tiring very quickly to keep up with incessant and unnecessary tinkering. 

‚Ä¢ Physics overhauls - Yep, something as simple as the way your player runs, jumps and interacts with the environment has seen multiple iterations as well. When something isn't broken in the first place and fans aren't complaining about, don't try fixing it. Vehicle physics were always a huge talking point among players and streamers yet very little has ever been done to sort them.

‚Ä¢ Hunger for Money - I understand that a business needs to make money but... way too much emphasis was put on crates and skins from an early stage. It felt like this area of the game received more attention than anything else. 

I really hope Daybreak read these reviews, the only positives ones i have seen are from questionable accounts with 1-2 hrs under their belt. Your genuine playerbase is disappointed at how their investment was so poorly managed.",1593781021,1593816855,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

A game that seems to have been around so long, it would be in a nursing home and still not collecting social security. What I mean by this is that it has changed so much and went through at least two world wars and it's still alive. Unsurprisingly it got quite a few bullet holes in the form of poor decisions by the developers. I watched the original H1Z1 that I loved go from great to satisfactory to sub-par to broken and back to satisfactory. While it had it's glory days, it seems the developers want to take it back to the wild west days when it wasn't dumbed-down to meet the popularity of similar titles. I appreciate this quite a lot since I hope it remains in a humble state not seeking to be better than it is. At the core is a special thrill, less flashy than other games, but more raw.

For why I'm playing this game is to get what I bought to get it back and that is the Survival mode that was the game that they should upgrade and delete this ugly Z1 BR and just stop with the crates and cosmetics (over 100 cosmetics rly). I recommend to anyone that has Just survive and try to get your money back at least.

+Gameplay:
+Very well done on graphics,
-Shooting you will die 1000 times until you get 20 kills if you new and bad at aiming,
+Controlling good enough (the only bad thing is throwing grenades very slow).

This is from a person that played this game a lot and got through a lot of bull soap from the devs very disappointed in daybrake.

We've had PS1,PS2,PS3,PS4,PS5,PS6,PS7,S1,S2 and when im posting this mid Season 3 and the game is full of D-sync, bugs, and failed promises. Daybreak promised bug fixes to improve the stability and integrity of the core gameplay and gave us Bloom, Ugly weapons and Auto Royale. So Daybreak realizes they lost all their players and let Jace Hall (Doesn't know shit about the game) take over and try to let his little baby dev crew fix this game and get back to what we wanted but the problem is that this idiot doesnt know either. So now we ended up right back to where we started before we asked them to fix a few minor bugs except there isn't anyone to play with because Daybreak and their team of brain dead idiots scared off all the players with horrible updates and game breaking bugs.


Update: everything said above still stands. I don't play this game anymore and its the best choice i ever made. Im telling you and anyone that reads this to not play this game or any other game developed or published by DayBreak Game Company. I want to see this company and every member of Daybreak from 2017-present to rot in the eternal pits of internet shunned hell.

Just Survive and the Battle Royale mod were supposed to come free, yet they split the games and doubled the game price. Even if games were split on paper, you would feel they were lying, as every Battle Royale update would crash the Just Survive game as well. They used Just Survive as a cash cow and most of us were fine with it if they would just fix some old fkn bugs and deal more with cheaters. All we asked for. Instead their updates would be more cashing oriented and bringing more bugs, making the early version of Just Survive (while company name was still Sony) looking like a perfect release. And as if that wasn't enough, they decided to close the game, after they milked they shit out of it. And I called it, way before it happened.

Long Version: Well fuck me where do we begin, although it may seem I have not played a lot I regularly played battle royale. Which I will add was better.

In this game you spawn in and bug out and get one shot killed.

Then you spawn in and bug out and get one shot killed.

Or alternatively you find a gun shoot someone , twice, does nothing gets one shotted with a pistol  THEN BUG OUT AND DIE.

Game runs like shit , plays like shit and looks , you guessed it , like shit. 

The UI is better thanks for that , for everything else just piss off.

Also really appreciate you splitting the game that had both features survival and battle royale for free. So generous. 

Buy Just Survive , timet to kill is less than 5 seconds and plays better than DayZ. Which is somehow better.

If you for some reason want to play a hunger games like game , get the culling. 

Oh and fuck off with the early access we all know you wont fully release it.

I stuck with the PVE side of the game because my PC at the time handles this game very poorly and competitive play was just impossible. But now it's been very long and Just Survive has closed down.

Now that I can play it and seeing the game's player base went up during January 2020 (10,000 active)
I was curious and tried it out.

Found out that they locked the Asia server and made it so when you have 200 ping above you won't be able to do any sort of combat. So that's why the players didn't stay long and immediately went down to barely 1000 active during Feb and March 2020.

I don't think this game will ever be alive again if it stayed in it's current course, especially locking an entire region. How is it even going to be possible to play the game at decent ping when your proper region is gone?

What do I have to say. The community was thrash, everyone hated each other. Sometimes you get a earrape when you killed someone. But that is a part of the game and I can laugh about it.

The first time when you play you just want to survive and win the game. And that feeling is so great if you win the first game. But after some wins you are grinding for the kills and then win the game. Everytime when you set a record for yourself your day can't go wrong.
The feeling is legit legendary.

Sadly there were some bugs that the developers did not fixed. And the updates were not good most of the time. When the game Fortnite and PUBG came out, this game died. The skin prices dropped and probably a lot of people lost a lot of money. Also I did, but for me it was worth the feelings I had with this game.

The best time was when I played a lot of games with my friend Justin and we dropped a thirty kill game win. Legendary!",1508427644,1585152046,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This review was pre combat update.
After the combat update some people came back but most people left. at this point like 50k people play and its hard to find a play a game without waiting forever. Game WAS fun but I personally don't recommend it anymore. Who knows though, with the Z1 map coming back it might attract a lot of people and it might have a comeback.

I have this ""Hate-Love"" relationship with this game. I mean I love this game, but I hate this game so much. Other players take 10-30 shots, and I die usually with 1-3 bullets no matter how far/close other players are. Maybe my guns deal less dmg or those other players are actually terminators.....and I am the only fleshbag in the game. I'd really like to recommend but it takes around 5-20 mins to get in into the game and I just got shot from the other side of the lake.....and I died....and I am prity pissed off....only reason to get this game was that you got it for free.

Tho I'll give this game some credit, imo, killing people on this game and listening them accusing you for ""hacking"" feels so satisfying.

Very balanced gameplay requires good instincts, tactics, and aim. 3rd person is kinda universal for this game and it has an arcade like feel which helps the game overall---without taking anything from its realism in terms of last man standing.

Balanced in terms of weapon choice. Theres not a huge variety and no attachments which add a lot of balance and keep you focused on the gameplay instead of hording items---big plus in my book.

If you like battle royale games and havent given z1br a try then it is a must imo. Dont get discouraged at first you will improve most by being aggressive and going after frags--the name of the game is king of the kill at least that was the original gametype back in 2015-16 when h1z1 came out :)

In a genre now dominated by Fortnite and PlayerUnknown‚Äôs Battlegrounds, this battle royale struggles to find its own identity despite predating both ‚Äì with the most promising spark of inspiration coming from an inventive new destruction derby-style mode.

H1Z1 is actually a refreshingly simple game in a lot of ways when all is said and done. Where contemporaries PUBG and Fortnite define themselves by aiming for a realistic feel and zany base-building shenanigans, respectively, H1Z1 floats somewhere in the middle. You can‚Äôt attach scopes and quick-draw magazines to your rifles and there are no sky bases or mile-high sniper towers to be found in this one. That lack of commitment to a signature look and style often leaves an empty feeling, even if it does have the benefit of being a more accessible battle royale as a result.

H1Z1 tries to fill that void with fast-paced action, but isn‚Äôt entirely successful. For example, at the very start of each match teams pick which region of the map to drop down to, and as areas become more populated they‚Äôll start to glow yellow, orange, and eventually red, giving you the ability to determine how much of a firefight you want to immediately land in. (In PUBG, by contrast, the plane‚Äôs path and the circle‚Äôs placement is random, and you only get to pick when you drop.) Picking where to go makes the drop feel more strategic, but removes a lot of the impromptu strategy involved with random drop spots, and that makes them feel more routine. Most teams end up picking the same handful of popular spots regardless of the safe zone and just drive to the zone once they find a vehicle.
Wait, Which H1Z1 Is This?
Originally, H1Z1 debuted on Steam Early Access in 2015 as a hardcore zombie survival game inspired directly by the popular ARMA 2 mod, DayZ. A few months later it added a tense battle royale multiplayer mode known as King of the Kill
SEE DEAL
, which proved so popular it was spun out into its own separate Early Access game. In February 2016, the original zombie-focused H1Z1 was renamed as Just Survive, and in August 2017, King of the Kill was renamed back to H1Z1, and finally launched out of early access on February 28, 2018. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs reviewed here.
Once on the ground, in my experience, a match of H1Z1 consists of three phases. The first all about looting and getting to the circle, if you aren‚Äôt already in it. The circle in H1Z1 shrinks slowly over the course of the match, just as you‚Äôd expect, except here the threat you‚Äôre avoiding is depicted as deadly poisonous gas instead of an electric force field.
Since the entirety of H1Z1‚Äôs design is predicated off of ramping up the action, the looting of the countryside is greatly compressed relative to most battle royale games. The good news is that there‚Äôs never a dull start ‚Äì during my time with H1Z1 I‚Äôve rarely needed to check more than two or three houses before I had all three weapon slots filled, a helmet, a backpack, and a thrown item like a grenade or molotov cocktail. That‚Äôs enough to carry me to the end game when the crates of really good stuff start to fall. The bad news is that there‚Äôs little variety: even though the locations of the houses I loot may change, the loot cycle always stays the same.
The good news is there‚Äôs never a dull start.
‚Äú
The one extra layer to the typical looting phase that H1Z1 introduces is some light crafting elements. You won‚Äôt be building an entire base like in Fortnite, but you can break down basic items like shirts and backpacks into pieces of cloth that can be turned into bandages for healing, or combined with duct tape and sheets of metal for body armor. It‚Äôs a shallow idea that never evolves into a full crafting system like the one found in Just Survive (H1Z1‚Äôs spin-off sibling) and could have honestly been left out with little consequence.

Grabbing more ammo never hurts, but there aren‚Äôt any attachments to search for or ultra-special weapons of any kind to stumble upon. Most people roll with an AR-15 as their ranged primary weapon, an AK-47 as their mid-range automatic weapon, and either a recurve bow with explosive arrows (if they‚Äôre lucky) or a shotgun for up-close blasting. Since I always ended up using the same few weapons every game, there was an utter lack of variety. Sure, I could‚Äôve switched things up by choosing other weapons, but without hope of finding attachments that could make one of the others more enticing, there‚Äôs zero incentive to do so.
Once the first round of teams are killed off, that‚Äôs when the next phase begins, and it can either be the most exciting part or the most boring. Depending on whether you‚Äôre playing solo, duo, or in five-person squads, your strategy may vary a bit, but this is the part of the match where people drive around and try to pick off as many stragglers as possible. What makes this more exciting here than other games is that it‚Äôs an area where H1Z1 embraces absurdity: you cannot run people over, but you can jump out of a vehicle at full speed without taking damage. Those two facts totally change the dynamic of facing off against a fast-approaching car in favor of the on-foot player, making it closer to a fair fight. But if you don‚Äôt evade the incoming fire from passengers and take out the driver before they close the gap they can pull up right beside you, hop out, blast you with a shotgun, then jump back in all in one fell swoop.

Depending on how much of your team is left at this point and how confident you are in your aim, this phase usually turns into either an intense bloodbath or a tedious game of hide and seek as you evade the roving bands of car-equipped marauders. For me, too often it‚Äôs been the latter, making a third of a typical H1Z1 match feel like a waste of time more often than not.
Going for crates is terrifying and risky.
‚Äú
One way or another, the objective is to get down to the last 15 or so people left, because that‚Äôs when the third phase kicks off and the good stuff starts to happen. By then, the circle is usually too small for vehicles because anyone driving around in a loud car will get shot immediately. Meanwhile, crates containing ultra-powerful rifles, snipers with scopes, and more begin to fall, creating irresistible bait that can either be looted or camped. Going for crates is terrifying and risky, but if you don‚Äôt upgrade your gear you‚Äôre at a big disadvantage in the final battle to come.
While I found myself enjoying H1Z1‚Äôs fast-paced rounds (on average they last around 15-20 minutes, as opposed to upwards of a half hour or more for PUBG), it‚Äôs a harsh place where death can come so suddenly and quickly that it risks being off-putting to new players. A surprising number of people who are playing H1Z1 right now, especially in solo, either have some of the most incredible twitch reflexes I‚Äôve ever seen or are hacking (or some combination of the two). In most matches, even with body armor and a helmet equipped, it seemed like I died far more quickly than I was used to in similar games. If you struggle at first I highly recommend playing in groups, even with random people, or trying out the Combat Zone mode to hone your skill on a map with unlimited respawns.

There‚Äôs no element of pay-to-win in play.
‚Äú
Beyond developing your skills there‚Äôs no actual progression to H1Z1 outside of pure cosmetic options, which, to its credit, means there‚Äôs no element of pay-to-win in play. Between matches you can buy cates full of skins using one of three different currencies: crowns, which you pay real money for, skulls, which you earn by completing challenges and finishing games, and scrap, which you",1578109927,1578960564,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Also, if you for some reason install this then good luck booting the game up first try because it takes me 10 minutes to boot the game up to only get a 4-10 man lobby which is dull as all hell.

(0 of 5, It can't be worse, scam.)

The WORST game I ever bought on Steam, but not from the beginning, it has become such.

I remember I Bought Just survive, which later become H1Z1
It was really not bad 3rd person sandbox style zombie survival with house building and crafting and whatever survival games have.
I liked it.
But due to the poor game support, it has alot of bugs, server lags, game crashes, I belive to developers who said it will be fixed soon and put this game aside for a while in hope that someday it could be wonderful sandobx survival.

But what have they done with this game? Ugly replica of battle royale? Seriously?
They just ruined this game, they tought it could be more succesful if they just make the same game as today alot of number already exists.
And aslo it become FREE! I spent my money for sandbox zombie survival, but now I get creepy BR-syle game with alot of bugs and poor support, just a pathetic parody for PUBG.

I Highly disapointed and will try to return my money back.

I don't recommend you to buy this sh!t. Don't even think about it.

This game is a beautiful old house that's owners have just left to fall into disrepair and become overgrown. That doesn't stop those that know it's there, hiding behind a mass of undergrowth, from playing within it's rooms. If only it's managers cared enough to maintain it and display it to the world as the beautiful gem it could be. But alas, it seems never to be.

Devs need to listen to its players for once. We are still here and playing! And by 'players' I don't mean big streamers that dictate what should be done for their own gaming experience. Look where that got this game, and look where the streamers are now... not here, because the average players didn't like the constantly needless changing and messing with the game and so they left. No decent player base means no streamers, which means the game isn't reaching out to people.

This has resulted in a small community of regular players which I can't really complain about. Many of us are nice, but again some have to spoil it with mindless toxicity or by cheating. But even they are dropping off.

I would so love for this game to be revived. It deserves a place in the BR genre once again. Whether or not that happens, I'll still be playing, and I hope others will too. 

Positives:
- Simple game mechanics
- Easy to find viable weapons and loot so gunfights are more balanced since both sides are using the same weapons
- Games play at your own pace, whether that be fast or slow
- Vast numbers of different clothing and weapon skins
- Semi-easy for new players to pick up and compete in gunfights
- Just really fun to play!

Negatives:
- Abuse of skill-less game mechanics (i.e. shotgun rushing from vehicles, ENS bullet dodging)
- Hit detection and desync
- Inconsistencies with shotgun damage and AR spam firing accuracy
- Glitches/exploits that are abused and not fixed (i.e. shooting out of the back of the ARV)
- Spawning (games with many players could have you spawn over an area with next to no POI or loot, whereas games with sometimes as few as 1 other team can have you spawn over the centre of pleasant valley!)

All in all, I would 100% still recommend this game. You love to hate it! :)",1578094743,1578094743,True,41,4,0.687284767627716064,2,True,False,False

+graphics got better and fps smoother.
+Better UI

Pros:
You can depend on your own skills and not other players like in cs go. (If you play Solo Battle Royale ofc)
Leaderboards in waiting area so people can see how much swag you have
and how big a nerd you are when you are top 1.
Cool items n ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• you can access by using real money to open cases, just like in every other game in this world.
Hackers tend to get banned pretty quick, neat.
As long you have a medkit you can run in the gas forever, i spent hours doing that cuz i never drive ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing cars in this game.

Cons:
F*ckin teamin fgts everywhere.
Up hill shootin is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• af and u'll never hit anything. (Think they updated bullets and where they come out depending on where you are standing, sum complicated ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•..)
Cars are ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, hit a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing pebble in the forest and you'll do a 720 bounce between 13.5 trees IN THE AIR land on the back and die in the car explosion.
Shotgun super op close range, people will be hidin' in everything that has a door and blow ur ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• up when you walk in.
Every player in this game will tell you that you have a bad aim when they kill you, litterally.

But all in all, this game is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing great and i enjoy playing it.
PS. Get ready to get tilted since weird ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• that doesn't make sence probably will happen to you a 1000 times before you understand.
PPS. Fashion is key in this game.",1562189486,1577459028,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But im not about to write an essay right now so you'll need to go elsewhere to see that part.

the game is pretty much how it was in PS3 and it feels really good, PS3 is what everyone wanted and they got it, but they dont hold on their promises that they'll ""come back if its reverted to PS3"" but the skill gap is steep and its hard for new players, so I don't think the game is ever coming back, but its free, so theres no reason not to recommend it.

All of this in a feudal attempt to assimilate with the likes of PUBG and Fortnite.

Original Review:
Look, I understand the complaints about this not being a very polished game, it's early access. 
However, putting all things aside, this game is extremely addictive and fun. The premise is simple enough, there aren't too many items and weapons to make it complicated to choose what gear you need, the learning curve is low and I can happily say I've dumped 21 hours (with more to come) into this game within a very short amount of time. 

I think it's definitely a great multiplayer choice to look into if you're in the mood for something new. Especially great with friends. (Duos and teams of 3-5).

My real wish for future development is that they remember H1Z1 started off as a zombie game and add additional game modes like the current ones, only with zombies spread across the map as well. Right now, bows and melee weapons are basically useless so zombies could reintroduce some different tactics to the game.",1482576496,1575248539,False,0,0,0.519927561283111572,0,True,False,False

I'm rushing a guy. I shoot him one time with the shotgun.
Ohh Dear 2nd time, Oh hell yeah 3th time, Huh still not dead??
He Shoots back, What will happen?
A: He hitted me and I shot back and killed him
B: He hitted me and I died
C: He Just ran away

The answer is.........
B
Yeah well, In this game you can shoot someone 1000milion times with the shotgun and he still doesn't die while he shoots you once and you're dead, pretty fucked up like the entire game!

SO YOU, DO YOU WANNA BUY THIS HORRIBLE GAME,
Where you jump like a kangaroo.
Where you can run for hours without seeing any1 and all of a sudden there are like 2000 milion people even when the lobby can have a max amount of players which's x<200 
Where there are everywhere fucking explosive barrels which are powerfull enough to kill you while you are standing 4 feat away from them!!!
Where you can see a running man screen for hours.
Where the servers are always fucked up and usually under maintenance.
Where it doesnt matter which server you connect to and where you live, you always have a lot of ping!
Where the Leaderbord system is still fucked up, It always counts the deaths, but if you make like 1 or 2 kills, the system doesnt count those. Pretty fucked up! Like the game tho!
Where the spawns are so great that you always have a great chance of surviving, Uhm NOT!
Daybreak fixes 1000000 milion things but not the things that have to be changed!
Where the guns are all fucked up and all hitboxes and hitregs are EVEN MORE FUCKED UP.
Where You can drive against some1, He'll fly like 100 feat in the air, drops down and still has 100hp yeah right.
Where you CANT LOOT ANY LOOTBAG because if you do, You will get shot in the head because a noob is behind a tree watching the lootsack/bag.
Where every single silver is just camping in a caravan without showing him or herself except when there are two people alive, uhh weirddddddddd.
Where sometimes you can loot 20 buildings without finding anything, while one building has more than 20 aks, ars and shotties.
Where every1 can shoot a headshot without any practise.
Where no1 in the whole game can control the bloody truck.

Great ahhh

Only beginning players would recommend this game cos they have no fking experience, but after you have played this game above 100 hours, you will notice how bad this game is!

So IF YOU WANNA BUY THIS CRAP, NO PROBLEM BUY IT BUT U WILL NOT BE REFUNDED EVEN WHEN you drove against a nerd who flew 100000 feat in the air still has 100hp, but then you headshot him and you're gonna loot the fag, while looting getting shot in the head by a silver who gets exploded by the bombs of an airplane flying over, then you're at 0 hp because you have got the 0 hp bug, you get shot by a shotgun but you dont die, WUT?, you shoot back and kill him. two people remaining. Oh damn, Shit too late, THE CARAVAN, You get shot in the head cos you're helmet is bugged.
Great a two year old kid shooting and screaming MAMMAMAMAM I'VE WON H1Z1 MAMAMMAMAMAMA.
You Break your keyboard, throw you mouse against the wall but its wired so it comes back against ur screen, Shit broke, Start yelling harder and harder, Mum comes home and she says, ARE YOU GAMING AGAIN, Yeah well end of the story here!
ATTENTION< YOU WILL NOT BE REFUNDED SO BE AWARE IF YOU BUY THIS CRAP AND I DONT MEAN THE FRENCH CRAP BUT CRAP FROM SHYYYT AND NOT SHYYT FROM POOP BUT SHYYT FROM HORRIBLE AND okey just dont buy this aidsy game.
JUST only buy it when you wanna break everything you have got!

Ingredients
- To Make the Dough
375 grams (3 cups) plain flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
1/4 cup (50 ml / 3¬Ω tablespoons) olive oil
1/2 cup (120 ml / 8 tablespoons) water
Extra flour for dusting 


- To Make Cheese Filling
15 ounces (425 grams) container Ricotta cheese
5 ounces (142 g/about 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons) ""3 Cheese Italian Blend"" (Parmesan, Romano & Asiago)
Note: grate these cheeses yourself and create your own custom blend.
1/2 cup cheddar cheese
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper


- Extras
Your favorite sauce for the ravioli (i.e. marinara/ marijuana)
Parmesan cheese
Basil
Fried vegetables
Shrimp
Fish slices
Chicken pieces 
Make the Ravioli filling.

- In a small mixing bowl, add the ricotta and mash with a fork.
- Add in the 3-cheese blend, Cheddar cheese, eggs, salt, and pepper.
- Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth, paste-like consistency.
- Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. 

Make the Ravioli dough.

- Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.
- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.
- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.
- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.
- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.
- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).
- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn‚Äôt suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. 

Fill the Ravioli shells.

- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.
- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.
- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a ‚Äúhomemade‚Äù touch as well.
- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.
- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. 

Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.

- Roll the dough into two sheets
- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.
- Fill with the ravioli mixture.
- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.
- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.

Cook the Ravioli.

- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.
- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.
- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest 
- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed plates

Serve it up.

The Creation

In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon
the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of
the waters.
¬∂ And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light
from the darkness.
And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.
And the evening and the morning were the first day.
¬∂ And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the
waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were
under the firmament from the waters which were above the
firmament: and it was so.
And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the
morning were the second day.
¬∂ And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered
together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of
the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding
seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in
itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his
kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his
kind: and God saw that it was good.
And the evening and the morning were the third day.

¬∂ And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven
to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for
seasons, and for days, and years:
and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give
light upon the earth: and it was so.
And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day,
and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light
upon the earth,
and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light
from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.
¬∂ And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving
creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the
open firmament of heaven.
And God created great whales, and every living creature that
moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their
kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was
good.
And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill
the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.
¬∂ And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after
his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his
kind: and it was so.
And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after
their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his
kind: and God saw that it was good.
¬∂ And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness:
and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the
fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over
every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created
he him; male and female created he them.

dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and
over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed,
which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which
is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to
every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have
given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was
very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.
2
Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of
them.
And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made;
and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had
made.
And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in
it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.
Man in the Garden of Eden
¬∂ These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when
they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the earth
and the heavens,
and every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every
herb of the field before it grew: for the Lord God had not caused it
to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.
But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole

This game met a tragic end back in 2016/2017 when they updated it with a new map, new graphics, different movement and shooting etc. This made it feel like a completely different game, it was pretty much ruined at this point. H1Z1 2014/2015 is my favorite BR game of all time and I've played pretty much every popular one and nothing compares to H1Z1 back in those days.

Of course it has its flaws but its still a good battle royale game.

The reason I played your stupid game H1Z1 was because of the survival game mode.
The battle royal was fun for a while but I was actually more upset with how it gouged 
the player base in the survival part of the game.

You proceeded to ruin Just survive by changing everything about it. You ASSUME to much about what you think the community wants rather than taking time to better understand what we want. You seem to have this knee jerk reactionary plan that is terrible and when people tell you to stop you just power forward and fuck it up more. ""But I am the developer, I      make games I want to make, I make decisions I think are good."" Well how has the mentality worked out? I have scoured steam to find a game that is like Just Survive. You abandoned a Gem. And we didn't abandon Just Survive because of anything other than your changes. ALL WE WANTED WAS BETTER OPTIMIZATION AND HIT REGISTRATION YOU MORONS. And you piss me off because as of now it seems like you feel like you can steal from people, the people that invested in your game. 

And the community of the game are no better. Political Correct culture has fucked up the way we interact with each other and it has been seen that Proximity Voice chat is a very risky thing to enable. Imagine Fortnite if you could talk shit and berate your opponent after shitting on him. Or Apex for that matter. 

Bring back Just Survive and stop being idiots. Make it the way it used to be and just make it run better. Try to fix magic bullet and let us deal with the glitches and such with the original base building. The raiding system was tedious but very rewarding. I think the issue of large bases can be addressed later and I have seen more people running better hardware to compensate with some of the frame issues. 

Three nights ago I counted how many people where in each Region on the current Z1 Battle Royal and counted 12 across all solo lobbies in the afternoon. This is a common occurrence. No one cares about this. In JS you can build a base chill in the server and have more of a reason to keep coming back. And Id buy your stupid ass skin cases as they came out to keep it going and I am surely not alone.

I doubt you will listen, I am sure it is too late. But maybe there is hope, maybe someone will see what everyone is telling you. Survival is why you succeeded, it brought many of us here. Everyone is doing BR. The gunplay is better in JS/H1 than Rust imo. Rust can be annoying and not as satisfying. The satisfaction of the .308 taking someones head off with a clean shot that you had to lead just right is awesome. As well as the moment you check the bag and hes LOADED with shit.  Get over yourselves and stop fucking around. Good work on PSA by the way. but everyone will just play Apex and get a similar experience that's already populated. Or destiny to ride little hovercrafts around.

They were the top dogs when the battle royale theme games back in the days but the devs and daybreak team became lazy and literally became stagnant. They tried everything to climb back up the ladder, doing things like cutting short the budget for ""Just Survive"", not employing proper people to develop the game for JS. They rebranded and split the two game modes and spend most of their money and time on the Battle Royale mode even though CLEARLY PUBG overtook and kicked them off the list of game under the genre. Z1 Battle Royale is rubbish, it is bad and irrelevant. 

I hope someone somewhere takes control over this situation, there are a group of people, a community that still deeply love the old ""Just Survive"", the hussle and the rush into playing such a competitive game, those people would DIE and PAY GOOD MONEY for the game to be resurrected.

Please, for the love of GOD, and for the people of Just Survive,

I started playing August 2016 (when I built my first pc) a little while before the new map ""Z2"" people would call it came out. Even with its flaws I was hooked, I played so much. Nothing beat this game at its peak with friends. I played so much I got (in my opinion) very good, I played in the 2017 Showdown, I qualified for and competed with other top players in Champions Arena. Winning my first games in CA is something I'll probably never forget. At one point in time this was my favorite game, probably at its best one of my favorite games of all time it was great and unique don't get me wrong it still had its problems but those problems it had then were overlookable because of the fun it was, the fun it was with friends. They had a really good thing going in my opinion from around January 2017 to the Summer of 2017, then they decided to try to fit in with the other BR's making waves at that time (notably PUBG). So they made a bunch of changes, called the ""Combat Update"". With one horrible update (the players begged to be reverted) they turned their peak player base of around 150k to below 30k in 6 months. I was one of the people that stayed playing for awhile after this update in hopes that one day they would fix it. They didn't want to or couldn't? They later did some changes but it was far too late. Writing this kinda makes me sad, looking back at the friends I made, the fun I had, and the things I accomplished in a game I loved. I wish I could go back in time and relive some of these memories but I can't. This games potential was insane, never would have gotten fortnite level but it definitely could have been so much more successful and probably still have a decent size active playerbase to this day. I have some videos of the old H1 on my YT in my profile bio if you're interested.

Devs sold out, partnered with the monopoly Tencent, brought in tens of thousands of Chinese hackers, and when there were no legit players left for the chinese to cheat, the game was abandoned. Game updates and bug patches stopped, repeated unwanted gameplay overhauls and new, never-fixed bugs were the result. New micro-transactions every week. Any negative feedback was censored and resulted in a permaban on the Steam forums.
China ruined this once-phenomenal game.

Since 2017, now >65% of players on Steam are from China. <20% are from the USA.
They did the same to Dota, CSGO, League of Legends, and most notably PUBG. Tencent has now bought a large stake in Square Enix, Epic Games, Ubisoft, and Blizzard. Say goodbye to gaming by 2025.",1456175698,1569198437,False,3,0,0.479629278182983398,0,True,False,False

I use to love H1Z1. Climbing the ranks, just survive, playing with friends.

I enjoyed this game for the way gunplay felt and the freedom of movement that I feel other BR's lack. 

This was one of the first BR's too.

Sadly no one plays it anymore. Due to devs no updating the game, companies like PUBG and Fortnite came and took this game down.

Then the devs updated it and made it free-to-play, but it was too late.

I'm saddened because this will remain my favorite BR. If you want to play it, go ahead. I think you'll like it, except for the fact they'll be less than 15 players every match.

I recommend the game, but I would recommend finding another game with more a player base.",1566859873,1566859897,True,1,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

you can select your region in case you want a larger match or actually wish to play squad or duo, pubg got rid of this feature and with a bunch of poor excuses while advertising VPN companies at the same time, surprised they don't make another shell company to advertise the cheats for their game as well

I write here because you removed Just Survive from search of steam.
I can't believe that i paid for a game i can't play. I've never seen that from others companies.

Daybreak Games, the rich company deleting their game, breaking their image.

Unable to keep some servers online (even one?), unable to make a solo mode / local mode (just to play it), changed 10 times the name their game to bring back some ""hype"". You deleted the artistic work of your own developpers community. You didn't give the possibility for players to make their own private servers and enjoy the work they could have done. You just don't respect the work made and took players for idiots.

It's pathetic. I paid for this game and i can't play it anymore. How many big companies do that?The communication is and has always been trash. I will never pay for another Daybreack Games.

This game had more players than Z1 battle royal and you still pay to keep Z1 Battle royal in life. Since you've split your game, all your decisions have become worse and worse. You divided the numbers of players and there's the irony : the 2 games are dead now. 

Your Money based strategy is execrable.

-H1Z1 has loot boxes as an unfinished game. This wont end well...
-H1Z1 splits to H1Z1: King of the Kill and H1Z1: Just Survive
-H1Z1: King of the Kill, what was once the secondary battle royale mode, becomes the only thing the devs care about because loot boxes and money.
-H1Z1:Just Survive gets pretty much no dev time so that they can continue to make what was originally a secondary gamemode.
-H1Z1: Just Survive gets no longer has the H1Z1 branding. The devs hate it so much that they stripped the game of any ties to H1Z1.
-H1Z1: King of the Kill, the secondary gamemode, gets rid of the King of the Kill name and rebrands to the original name of what is not Just Survive; H1Z1

Honestly, When I bought H1Z1 I wanted a survival game. I played the Battle Royale a bunch but when it split I knew something was up. When they all but stopped developing Just Survive, I knew something was up. But when they took away H1Z1 from the name of Just Survive I'm not sure what the hell is going on.

EDIT 7/27/2019

Daybreak have robbed us of Just Survive, formerly H1Z1(the original survival game). I recently got a new pc after over a year of not having one and I come back and see that after taking everyone's money they have unlisted the game and blocked all of their paying customers from playing it.

Daybreak should have at the very least released server tools for fans of the game so that our $20 didn't go to waste. This should have come with a refund if anything.

Do not support Z1: Batlle Royale by any means. Don't play it and don't buy the lootboxes or skins from the steam market. Daybreak will eventually shut this game down just like they did to their other one and just be sitting on a pile of your money while you have no game.",1509292525,1564247489,False,3,0,0.551957845687866211,1,True,False,False

After some days I Hopped into a fives game in H1. Meet some cool people, after that, I joined the H1Z1 discord and started only queuing fives with other people cause the was the most fun thing to do in the game, at least for me. But after a while, I took a break from it again. I started playing other games etc. The other games got boring after a while so I just sat around and had nothing to play and tried H1 again, jumped into the H1 discord and then it happened I meet some people that I had fun with, those people became a part of my life. I became really good friends with them, every time after school I would run home start up my computer load up discord and jump in a call with them and I would spend at least 8-10 hours with them a day. We were pretty good at the game cause we were getting 30+ bombs most of the games and we r*ped the best teams in the game, as you can see in the clip in my profile. Then the devs started destroying the game. By each update, the game would get worse and worse and it tilted us seeing the players leave and the game getting worse, but we still had great times. We were like 15+ people that played with each other, obviously, we couldn't all que in the same match but when we ended up in the same game we would meet up in a location and fight each other and see who was better. But one day my IRL friends invited me to play fortnite(It was before fortnite blew up, it was before preseason 1 on fortnite so k*s normies) and I started ditching my H1Z1 friends I didn't even think about what the consequence would be. After a while of playing fortnite, the group had fallen apart. The guys I used to spend hours and hours in discord talking about our lives and shit. I felt like it was my fault that the group had fallen apart when I think about I want to cry no kidding we had so much fun those were probably the best years of my life. I would kill for the moments we had. There is so much more detail to this, I was only scratching the surface and tried to explain it in a short way.

H1Z1 is so annoying

1). Everytime especially the process you have to fill out, and getting B u l l S h i t.. ERROR 32, and so on, Verify some other B u l l S h i t.. Pubg just gets to the point; You load the game then you pick what mode you want to play in then you play the game, and get some CHICKEN DINNER...THAT EASY!... Im not saying pubg is perfect...yet.

2). If you make a mistake on you're DayBreaker it will automatically delivers you to this website and more paper work. No one have time for that.

3). Every time there is a patch or an update, more bugs and glitches come to the game, than the amount that are removed.

4). Hit reg is still a extremely inconsistent, and all of you saying its fine are delusional because otherwise Daybreak wouldnt be talking about in what ways they are trying to fix it.

5). The shotgun is in the game at all. The spread is so much rng its crazy. When two players from the same distance hit each other once with shotgun, one has two-hit lammy and the other one doesnt even have armor, yet the guy with a lammy dies, something is obviously wrong. When getting someone down to onehit and pushing them, you are still in a bad situation because the other player can kill you in one shot and he has peek advantage so hes obviously going to shoot first. You shouldnt be punished for having better aim/positioning. Remove the shotgun and bring an SMG to the game, far less rng based.

6). There are too many cars. Its truly turned into car1z1 after the release of Z2. More carspawns, ATV spawns everywhere. And the way of fixing it isnt to buff the magnum (which is already op) or to blow all cars up after second safezone, that would ruin the game and within a month all slayers would just stop playing the game. Just spawn less cars. Copstation PV has 3 carspawns, turn it down to 2. G7 has 7 vechilespawns, turn that down to about 5. Reduce carspawns in ""hotspots"" where there already are a ton of spawns.

7). Hipfire is still overpowered as hell, which reduces the skillgap massively. Players with 2 hours in the game can two tap the best player in the world if theyre lucky.

8). Arclegger claimed that there are no bad spawns anymore. I can agree that if youre playing to win with less than 10 kills, sure spawns are amazing. However there new map has basically no hotspots anymore. G7, strip north of PV and the compound west of that are the only possible hotspots there are. On Z1, there were several hotspots, which were all easier to get to due ot the map being way smaller which also meant that the space between hotspots was way smaller. Warehouses, AK alley, big and small res, dam and suicide cabins. Even Cranberry could be pretty lit at times. Now you can honk your horn for 1 minute and not a single player will peek you in the city.

9). PV, and all other cities are too big. PV is suppose to be the place where you can get 10 kills without problem. Some games you even struggle to find 5 after the first gas starts spreading. The city is so big that there are no consistent hotspots. This makes the earlygame very frustrating and also boring in a lot of matches. Lets be honest, the huge park in the middle of PV is fucking useless.

10). Fighting mechanics are reducing the skillgap and extremely repetitive. Strafing one way while firing your gun, maybe crouching a bit aswell. There are no ways of outplaying opponents other than outaiming them (something which makes hit reg incosistensy even worse) Its all just really boring after doing the same thing for several thousand times. Bring back seatswapping and pronespamming, but nerf them, dont remove them. Bring in more fighting mechanics that you can use. Im not saying that snaking people was a very healthy mechanic when you could do that, but bring something new that makes the game fun to learn again. Adding so that fire exstinguishers could be blown up is a cool mechanic but lets be real, its used like once every 10th game. Jumpshooting was a relatively fun mechanic, I would love to see that back in the game.

11). The cross on your crosshairwhen standing close to a structure. Has anyone ever said that this is a good feature? Im pretty sure its all complains about this, how its completely unnecessary and shoulderpeeking is impossible if youre also prefiring.

12). Are nades ever going to be fixed? They have been like this for 4 months now and I dont recall Daybreak even metioning this a single time in patch notes or producers letter. They take so long time to throw, and if you throw fucking air instead of what your hand is holding, thats annoying. This cant be hard to solve can it?

13). The scoring system is unfair. EU spawns with 185-200 people per, while NA spawns with around 150. I know why Daybreak did this and I think its a pretty good idea to solve the queue times, but it gives EU a higher chance of getting high kill games and slightly higher scores. Im not a technician or something but doesnt more servers equal lower queue times? This can hardly be a problem considering the amount of money the game makes from all the crate they release (instead of fixing bugs). I get that crates make more money than fixing bugs etc, but keeping your players happy should imo be the highest priority.

Honorable mentions: Trees north of PV floating in the air Items spawning in the ground The cop car spawn in G7 (hard as fuck to enter) Items spawned on shelves unable to loot Sometimes when you tab out your game crashes Infinite running man. Not being able to see killer and killers health (lets see where they move after killing us though) Hunting Rifle only being usable in first person (not really an issue but it was more fun in 3rd person) Getting stuck in your inventory AK sound glitch Proximity chat turning off for no real reason without you changing your settings. Shadows cant be turned off. Its so easy to just allow players to turn them off. Low FPS players have more opportunities to make the game playable (I played on 20 fps and it sucks) Thank you for not patching the region switching glitch though.

I know that all the devs are probably going to ignore this completely, I just wanted to speak my opinion, and Im happy to see that Daybreak are hiring, Im hoping that improvements are coming in the near future. But despite from all that BS.. its only a ok game nothing serious. If you want to play in a good realistic game that make things challenging in some situations then my advice is play PUBG. Now if you want to stick with H1Z1 running around, and bomb rush people in a cartoonish gameplay then.. yah",1509788360,1562957238,False,4,0,0.553884029388427734,2,True,False,False

January 15, 2015: It's sold under the name of H1Z1. It was marketed as an open world zombie survival game, akin to DayZ. I bought it for 20$. The game does not run.

After a time, they release a new gamemode; King of the Kill. It's a battle royale mode, made specifically because PLAYERUNKNOWN made a hugely successful battle royale mod for the game but then split off to make his own game (PUBG).

February 5, 2016: KOTK is doing well, so they split it off from the game, both of them costing 20$. They silently abandon the original game, only doing small feature updates and adding nothing but bugs. H1Z1 (The survival game.) is renamed to H1Z1 Just Survive.  KOTK is renamed H1Z1: King of the Kill. Not long after they rename H1Z1 Just Survive to simply Just Survive (Which sounds like a terrible 3$ app game.) and rename H1Z1 King of the Kill to just H1Z1. (H1Z1 Battle Royale on consoles.) Development of the original survival game, ""Just Survive"", is still mostly halted.

October 24, 2018: Just Survive, the survival game i paid for, is shut down. The game is removed from my, and everyone else's steam library, with no refund. KOTK, or H1Z1, or H1Z1 Battle Royale...or...whatever the crap they named it, is shut down as well, and re-published and renamed as a different game, Z1 Battle Royale, obviously done to alienate the game from it's wretched history.

The kicker? It's free. Also, it's still called H1Z1 Battle Royale on consoles, and when Z1 BR is run, the window is named H1Z1. 

They made a game said it was like DayZ. It didn't even work. Then they simply deleted it from my library with no refund. Z1 BR is dead, it garners about 3 active players. They actually, legitimately built a fake game and then deleted it for money.

Utterly disgusting development team. When everyone said the original game was going down in flames due to terrible updates, horrible balancing fix attempts that only worsened the balance, and endless amounts of bugs spilling into the game, i sat there, with hope. This is what i got.

They said the original H1Z1 was originally going to be made free. I was fine, 20$ for instant beta access to a DayZ game was fine. What they didn't say is that it was a blatant lie and they would toss the game in the trash in favor of another random game they made using the original games assets (I told you. They're terrible. Too lazy to even make new assets.) simply because Fortnite was getting popular.

And after all that?

The game sucks balls.

Most the reviews seem to be for H1Z1: Just Survive mode which is still being improved. 

Since this review is about the Battle Royale mode which I placed 120+ hours into the game before the split.
This review will ONLY contain the Battle Royale (King of the Kills)
I will be reviewing each feature and part of the game in Anti-Cheat, Bugs, Gameplay and Microtransactions.

Review 2/18/206 Subject to change as updated:

Anti-Cheat: I've seen less hackers since the BattleEye Anti-Cheat have been added into the game, which is a huge improvement.
Once in awhile you meet one or two but they're quickly dealt with by the anti-cheat system after.

As expected with most games you will run into cheaters once in awhile this is not just subjected to H1Z1.
The anti-cheat system tends to handle everything pretty well.

Bugs these are the bugs I've encounter: I couldn't land on the ground and the parachute would flip all over the place.

Microtransactions: The game features microtransactions,  NOTE this is not GEAR but cosmetics and skins much like Counter Strike: Global offensive
Now days these is a common in games to feature cosmetic items. 


During special events and holidays Daybreak have feature special halloween skins that can be gained by just playing the game and getting special drop crates that drop during the fight.

These drop crates players must battle over to gain special skins and items to help their survival in battle royale free for all.


Gameplay: The overall gameplay is very fun, playing with randoms to playing with friends. The goal of this game is to be the last one standing.


If you love the Battle Royale Movies and Hunger Games, Want a battle of wits of fast thinking skills? This game is for you.


I would rate the game 7/10, the game still can use some major improvements but the overall gameplay is fun.

Z1 Battle Royale (originally H1Z1: King of the Kill) is a Battle Royale title that spawned as an additional mode to the original H1Z1 (Just Survive). As the BR mode became more popular, both H1Z1 and the BR mode were split into two titles, where the zombie game received less and less updates until it was shut down and removed from Steam. 

H1Z1 would then be completely overshadowed by PUBG and Fortnite, and with a new Battle Royale game coming out every week with a new gimmick and play style, H1Z1 just refuses to die - recently re-branding to Z1 Battle Royale. With every re-brand comes a boost in the player base, although players will quickly realise why they stopped playing.

Z1 Battle Royale is now Free-to-Play, but with a dwindling player base, it probably won't be enough to bring it back to the level it was at just a few years ago. The game itself feels clunky, looks outdated and in my opinion, isn't worth the time.",1561845541,1561845541,False,24,5,0.725993216037750244,0,True,False,False

This game is going to die now and this company, along with these developers are the reason why Early Access shouldn't exist on Steam. I personally think Steam should be doing some sort of test before letting games that are Early Access onto their platform. If only this company had a leader that could enforce a direction and change, rather than focusing on crates, then maybe this game would have done better. 

Apparently they decided to shut down Just Survive, which was the main reason why most people purchased this game, before it got separated into two. PUBG outshines this game now. If people would have spent less time spending money on crates and more time giving them critical feedback, maybe things would have been different. 

There are hardly any players on anymore and you can just see that by checking steam stats. The game itself lacks a lot of content. They removed the rain which made this game very atmospheric. The guns have horrible mechanics and crappy recoil, as well as spread. Everytime you shoot it feels like you're shooting with a wet noodle. The graphics are decent but that doesn't matter because of the lack of gameplay. The loot is somewhat decent. But the actual number of items such as guns currently in the game are small. I guess they tried is all I can say. It just wasn't enough.

All I'm doing now is just waiting, waiting for the moment they throw the final nail in the coffin and put this game to rest. I imagine it will be soon that we will see some news about H1Z1 shutting down forever and only being accessible on the Playstation. Which was one of their worst moves ever for the PC community.

To keep it short,
-either people are investing tons of time to get their reactions set or some people simply do cheat. the amount of times I played lately and took a quick double headshot are.. considerable.
-loot spawn has changed. there is NO NEED for pistols because rifles with ammo seem to spawn 'frequently enough' that in this 'BR' game you won't have to worry about ammo for your AK or AR (finds an AK and AR in a single shack, another 150 rounds in the next house....) but as a 'balance' you get super skilled enemies.. I play shooters mostly so how every firefight ends in less than 4 secs (with me dying from 2x headshot) is a miracle to my understanding capabilities. Hax0rs?
-generally it never really went anywhere, I have seen the beginning years back and the major changes are 'additional gamemodes' - nothing substantial has changed as far as I can tell. more skins.

In general I could invest more time to be more detailed with this, but I don't wanna. Maybe I just suck at this game, for some reason perform reasonably decent at other shooters and only get absolutely rekt here, dunno.
For what it's worth no one got their money back (cuz otherwise bankrupt maybe) and development went and would'nt go nowhere, sadly.

+ Better Optimized
+ It's easier to understand

I've had two steam accounts that OWNED the game, as in, the night of release, our group of friends sat in wait for the servers to come online since we pre-ordered the game. While sitting on teamspeak, we waited until it was time and then spent over an hour trying to login and get setup while SoE and their dev team worked out the connection issues. Once we were in the game, playing, and building; we actually enjoyed it (as long as the servers stayed up; since we got kicked numerous times because of the server issues going on -- but hey, new game, nothing ever goes to plan. You can't expect a launch to go exactly how you planned, that's understandable). Spent over a week getting on, building up bases, raiding, and legit enjoying how the game was.

And then the first signs of a struggle came in the following years, SoE selling to Daybreak, all the flip-flopping, Battle Royale VS Survival. Then the free-to-play move, and finally they jabbed a nail in the coffin for Survival all together.

And here we are; 4 years and some months later, and H1Z1 practically is dead. With what started out as a Jan 15 release with over 15,000 players online, ended up at 0, and a King of the Kill / Royale / Transgender game that averages about 1,200 players a day (vs say Pubg's 300,000), it's safe to say that the game should just taken out back and put down.

Then you've got the technical elements, such as taking a beautiful engine such as Unreal Engine, and then producing the results that were done with the way H1Z1 looks now.... which is..... garbage. I've had the graphics up to ultra super max on 4k, and nothing, aside from putting a paper over your monitor, would help make the game look any better. If unlucky people out there happen to have lower-end PCs that don't support great graphics; well then, expect your environment and player model to look like something that resembles an indie remake of the movie ""Toy Story"".

All the people who decided to pre-order the game, really got screwed. And I mean ""royally"". Right in the rear, no lube, not even a free breakfast. Just a down-right gang-bang, and all you've got to show for it is a failed title sitting in your game library.

Steam has a feature now where you can request a game be completely removed from your library; you won't get your money back, but you can at least get rid of its existence from your own little world. That feature was made for games like this. No point in keeping H1Z1 in the library anymore if survival is dead, and I have no interest in playing a modern version of a game that resembles ""Toy Story"" quality.

The original release of the game was how I'd like to remember H1Z1. But now, the only thing I can remember in great detail, is how the game crashed and burned. In regards to the mess that is now known as ""Z1 Battle Royale"", I'll defend the developers by saying, they were high on large amounts of high-grade Columbian cocaine, had a 3-night binge with a hooker named Molly Munkhouse, and just received the sad news that they had contracted aids, herpes, syphilis, chlamydia, AND also were informed that their wife of 10 years was actually a guy with a bigger ""wee-wee"" than they had them-self. Any developer getting news such as that would botch a game up this bad, so that has to be the ONLY logical reason this game went THAT south.

Even thougn my game crashed probably like 3 times, I ran into no bugs or glitches which was good. The only downside now is that the game is beyond dead, no one plays this game any more and if you do get in a game you are with like 20 people at the most, which is bad as the map and game supports little over 150.

Its a shame this game went free. My final verdict is a 3/10 now and was a 7/10 when it was popular.

The only reason i ever come back is for the small  chance that they fixed the game that so many of us loved for so long but 5+ years later there is still only 1 map that most people didn't want in the 1st place, with no option to play the other map that most of the h1z1 player base started with and loved. Instead we got a new version of the game that is clunky and not even close to the same fell or mechanics. Then u take away all the private servers that were hosting Champions Arenas, EU Revenge the 5s league right in the middle of there seasons and killed them all, great way to lose most of your devoted players and fans. Daybreak games has already proven that they dont give a shit about there community plenty of times so hearing they are back with Z1 is a same and the only way u will see me playing this game ever again is if they do a full revert but even then the damage has already been done.

What the hell...?

*EDIT* So this is what is super stupid:

This game was supposed to be free initially as a zombie survival game with the option to pay for early access. The battle royale mode came out and all of the sudden it became more popular than the survival mode. Then they split the game into two and dropped F2P??? WTF? 
Okay, so then we have King of the Kill and H1 Survive or whatever they called it. 
Now the BR is finally free like it should have been in the first place and is now called Z1 Battle Royale? 
WHAT THE HELL GUYS? PICK A NAME AND STICK WITH IT! So scatter brained it's no wonder that this fuckin mess bombed. (3 name changes, 2 pay wall changes, and splitting the game into two)

*EDIT 2* I'd just like to add that this game requires you to sit through THREE loading screens before getting into a game. The game's mechanics are trash. The movement requires 0 skill, shooting requires 0 skill, looting requires 0 skill. I can't even tell if the bullets are hit scans or projectiles. The recoil just feels so synthetic and stiff. There is no leaning. The buttons you'd expect to be for leaning are, strangely, used for healing. There is a button to change shoulders but the view change is so minor that it might as well not be there.

I lied: the mechanics are actually as mediocre as can possibly be - it plays pretty much like 3DO's 1999 release ""Army Men"" but with better controls and no noticeable ballistics while being consistently less fun. It is absolutely a game and it absolutely works but it is definitely not good at all. 

They also reduced the player count considerably and reduced the overall size of the playable area without adjusting the size of the minimap. The minimap is completely useless as a result.

Instead of jumping out of a plane you are now forced down immediately. This makes it almost impossible to be strategic about your drop location. The map is also very boring to look at and totally uninspired.

*EDIT 3* I HAVE CONFIRMED THAT THIS GAME DOES INDEED HAVE BALLISTICS! Albeit very rudimentary. The shooting is even more frustrating than I could have imagined. There is a deviation even if you are ADS. It means that you can miss shots that you shouldn't have missed, adding a luck factor and reducing skill base even further. 

Don't even try to use first person mode - especially the iron sights. The sights obscure your vision with no benefit to accuracy over TPP and you will be at a complete disadvantage vision-wise. This is absolutely a third person shooter.",1540181225,1554870268,False,5,0,0.508566856384277344,1,True,False,False

H1Z1 once had two game modes. The primary gamemode was a survival mode that is now* a standalone game titled Just Survive and a battle royale mode that was a tacked on side thought by the devs. It is your standard survival game: hit things to get loot to build base to hoard loot. It has changed major dynamics of both games so much that they are not anywhere near what each mode was like when the game started. H1Z1, at one time called King of the Kill, was the only popular battle royale mode before one or more of the developers left the company and made the very popular Player Unknowns Battlegrounds game. I have not played the auto royale variant but I have played every Twisted Metal sooooooo yea can anyone else believe Twisted Metal started waaaay back in 1995? Ah the memories. Recap: Devs broke game into two seperate games and changed the name of both at different times because these devs are conartists, exclusively.

Update 04-18-2018: Everytime a new update comes out I check the steam game stats. Everytime, less people play. The only thing positive about this dev studio is the pretend positivity the devs have typed out in the updates.

*Update 09-08-2018: The survival part of this game is officially discontinued. pfff H1 BR is certainly next.

Update 09-21-2018: Now they are renaming the battle royale part just like they did with survival before they killed that portion off.

update 04-08-2019: 3rd company that this game was handed off to is giving it back to the second because they realized it is the equivalant of an entire tire factory on fire which is also how the game plays. AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!",1520815409,1554769492,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Not many bugs, tons of players, cool skins and good mechanics. But one day, daybreak bosses wanted more. They started to add more updates that no one wanted to pull in more people. This was when the game went to shit. They added stuff like a new recoil for all guns, then they added stuff like the SMG which ruined the shotgun fights that everyone loved. This game had it all, but they threw it away.

Now, Daybreak and NatG listen to the community (for once) and they realized that if they wanted to keep this game from dying they have to revert. And that's just what they did... They reverted to the time when everything was perfect, old map, old recoil, new showdown, good movement. Its all back ladies and gentlemen. For me H1Z1 has always had a special place in my heart. I loved this game so much. I was devastated to see it ruined by greedy Daybreak Bosses, while people like Carto wanted it fixed. Now that this game is back, the people are slowly coming back. Lots of streamers like Landon FPS and CDN The 3rd have played it and said they loved it. I want this game to come back, along with the community too.

After a few months passing by i was like 'shall i try it again' but skipped every time due the reviews, lack of time and the threads about the bugs/hackers and game breaking things.

Till the day today March 20th 2019.
Downloaded the game again cause i was bored and setted everything up to have a smooth 60 fps game with no problems at all. The pre-lobby is still the same as always and nothing is really changed to that in months. Even the weapons/items are still the same and the overall quality is pretty bad to be honest.

Anyway, i was just looting around grabbing the weapons and loot just like i did since the release (nothing changed) and *poof* someone infront of me suddently so i sprayed and prayed hes a$$ till he died and i was happy cause i got a kill.
5 minutes later i was in the top 10 and i saw a person having kills and kills over and over.
I was hiding in a corner while knowing nobody could know i could be there and guess what.
He prefired the sheit out of me while he couldn't know i was there so i clicked spectate.
And yea, he was hacking.

There is a lot more things i can tell you but right now the game isn't really playable in my opinion.
You're competing against very OP Z1 nolifers who probably have over a 1000 hours and more and there is noway you can kill these guys. 

Shortly explained,
Decent game when bored, playing against hackers/veterans who are undefeatable, decent quality overall but the devs are still lazy and a lot of progress isn't there.",1532797277,1553093520,False,7,0,0.462195932865142822,3,True,False,False

I miss the original Z1 map and until they bring that back, I can not agree with them that they brought it back. The current map is garbage and always was. But other than that, some may like that map and overall, the game ran smooth, you just won't see me playing it, but I can honestly say I would recommend it to people if they like the map, but if you were hoping for the original map, your SOL.

To irradiate on what I mean, for those that have played the original Z1 map, where Governor's mansion was in the NW part of the map, Pisspot creek, Dartmouth, Toxic waste and Runamok cabins was in the S/SW part of the map, the original Z1 is what I was expecting, not the later one where they made PV more in the  center and destroyed the overall flow of the map. 

I know some of you did not like that battles that took place on Veeshaun's Peek, or on Spence Hills, but, I thought those battles were some of the most fun I ever had and some of the most epic battles there. 

So, if you are expecting a game where they brought it back to the point in which made the game great and popular, they didn't, its a lie. They are on pretty much running Z1 2.0, (which to me and many others was the start of the decline), and not on the ""Original"" Z1.

I doubt anyone from NantG would read this, but if you want to make this game great again, go back to the Original Z1 and not to the Z1 2.0 map.",1553024045,1553028715,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,2,True,False,False

This isn't a game you would like in the first day, you need to get into the game and learn how to play before saying it's trash. I think that the game is great, the skill gap is huge (That's why most the new players dislike the game), graphics aren't the best but overall very fun and enjoyable. One of the main reasons this game isn't that popular is because when a new player tries to learn the game they just get shit on against a player with 2000 hours or something, but once you get a few hours in the game and you start getting kills and wins this game is rewarding and fun. This game has also helped my aim in other FPS games as well because you need to have a good aim to play this and you learn a lot quicker then in other games if you just play this game for a while because the people you are being have a good aim so you end up learning quicker. If you do play this game and are new the first thing you need to do it turn your sensitivity down because otherwise you will miss a lot of your shots. I have 400 DPI and 17% mouse and 6% you should try something around that sens and get used to it and within a few days you will become a lot better at FPS games in general not this game.

Too many sweats to enjoy the game and too many long loading screens (like Fortnite).

This game can be brutal, but mastery can be rewarding. Maybe it's the ""Dark Souls of battle royales"". About 3 shots to the body can kill or 1-2 shots to the head (depending on if you have a helmet). I encourage new players to try the game and stay with it, along with being a positive member of the community!


Pro's
-guns have projectile physics: bullet speed & drop. This means it takes greater skill to hit shots at longer range.
-sound fx are rewarding and satisfying. I'm looking atchu, AR-15 reload sfx
-large skill gap. 
-sense of community. Proximity chat enables you to interact, joke, tease, antagonize, and revere like no other. Ranks are visible in the kill feed, you can see who to worry about/learn from. Go be weird, be funny, but please be respectful.

Con's
-graphics/color choices might be a turn off to some.
-not as beginner friendly as other games
-sometimes players can be toxic, but it's improving
-can be demanding on the CPU. This one is probably more dependent on CPU than GPU
-some people may consider the small variety of primary weapons to be unappealing, but the stategy is simple and deep.

Congrats to the OG team on returning and restoring this gem to glory. I look forward to what's to come and wish the game/team the best!

Then, they turn around and write a review calling the game trash without putting in the time to become a good player. I don't understand why everyone is listening to the opinions of a person that has 0.4 hours played. I've played since preseason 3 (900 hours) and I have never reached royalty rank. The highest rank I've achieved is master 2 during season 1 but the game is still tons of fun. Nothing feels better than getting that 2 tap. I do admit it has been hard to get into the game in the recent months before the new update,  but with the new season 3 update the game feels great again. The gameplay is much smoother and lobbies are filling again. The introduction of the ranked pro mode (that just opened up this weekend) is allowing newer players the opportunity to grind the game without the elite players ruining their learning experience. Give this game a serious chance and you'll see that it's much more rewarding to master than any other BR. Just be positive and don't let others opinions persuade you into disliking a game without giving a serious chance yourself.",1552747536,1552747536,True,5,0,0.510730147361755371,0,True,False,False

My suggestion for the latter is:
Just remove the regular bow.
Just remove the melee weapons. Maybe make punching deal more damage.
Just remove 1 of the handguns. 1 plus revoler is enough.

You will rage when you die too many times in a row off spawn or a guy one pumps you with a shotgun, but all in all, no game can compare in terms of kill satisfaction. When you headshot someone in this game or win, it is truly an accomplishment that feels euphoric. Nothing compares to that adrenaline in the industry. Put the time in combat zone to hone your skills. If you are new, it will not take as long as it seems to catch up to the skill levels of others that have had this game for years. You will start by getting one kill here or there and then suddenly you will feel comfortable with the mechanics. Give the game a chance. If you are an old h1z1 veteran, give the devs a chance to win your trust back. You just might like what you see if you aren't all caught up in the ""dead game"" meme. If the game is fun, don't let a meme hold you back from good times. I recommend giving this game a shot to everyone. What do you have to lose? It is free. :)

Update: This game is now under new management starting September. Every complaint anyone has ever had against the dev team of the past is a thing of the past. Updates are prompt, community driven, and good. There is a perfect amount of new content/bug fixes so far. Stick around to see the progress the game will make. It is actually insanely good fun again. Check Z1roadmap.com to see the plans for this game. It wil soon be called Z1 Battle Royale. I have always loved this game alongside many others. Once again, it is free to go in and try out the changes. You lose nothing :)

Update 2: Following the update to the game on March 6th, 2019 the game is insanely fun again. Lobbies are full. The gameplay feels fulfilling, and any bugs are quickly tracked and patched. The game has officially returned to the mechanics of the glory days (aka pre-season 3) This game is the BR that started the craze. It is free to play with no pay to win features.

Enough of that though..

Now.. its early 2019 and we're now named Z1BR and under a new company called NANTG so here's my review:

Playing a lot during the preseason 3 era was honestly one of the best times for me the game was growing, doing awesome community events at twitchcon etc and most importantly it was fun. This is what NANTG is trying to recapture with all the classic things like combat, movement, world, UI etc coming back, it's a great step in the right direction and i feel like i'm starting to enjoy it again.

There is still small things that are needed but i am sure NANTG will fix them!

Regardless of what happens in this game. Whatever happens for H1 in the future.

Just know,

I've had some of the best times of my life on this game. This is what MADE battle royale. Fortnite, PUBG, and any another BR game on Steam oughta pay their respects. This is what started it.

Now now, I'll have some Arma 3/DayZ fags in here talking about thats where it all began but believe me, H1 was the game that put that shit up on a pedestal.

Regardless if this game makes a comeback or not, it'll always have a place in my heart. I will ALWAYS give it a shot no matter how many updates they come out with.

I do honestly hope this game can make a comeback. I am not so optimistic about it(the numbers are already dwindling) but with every inch of my soul, I hope this game can do well.

They just threw out survival mode and then close project with reason: nobody play this... Oh wait... YOU DO NOTHING! JUST SCAM SOME PEOPLE WHO TRUST IN THIS FUCKING GAME!  Just making another map for Battle Royal and a lot of cases and skins  because  everyone loves money! Easy way!

These devs dont give a damn about this game, and they supplement all of their mistakes for skins and crates. The shooting mechanism in this game needs to be scratched and rebuilt from the ground up. They consistently add new POI's, but the spawns every single round are the same, and usually consist of 20 people landing in the same area. This game is 95% RNG, and the other 5% is a skill. Nothing in this game is ever consistent, especially shotguns, which is by far the most broken gun in the game. In fact, the last update claimed to have largely improved the shotguns consistency, and now it will shoot all six rounds at the same time and screw you over in short ranged gunfights. Even if you land that single shot, it's not going to kill the other player, and will most likely damage the other player a max of 10 hp, regardless of the range.

Overall, this game is trash, but I continue to fund these idiot devs, and their plans of keeping games in early access to max out on their cash grab. Don't be like me.",1482104541,1551906836,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While its a game of no skill with guns you either point and randomly shoot and the auto aim will kick in no matter how far away. If you can see the player you can kill the player with ease. Competitive gaming doesn't use auto aim features and if they do its not competitive its who pulls the trigger faster. I really want the original H1Z1 Just Survive as it was hands down way more fun then spawning and getting shot faster then a shooting star. Battle Royal is fun after hours of grinding in Just Survive.

Genre: 1st and 3rd person shooter / Battle Royale

Date: January 2017

Thoughts: Daybreak Games cannot fix any bugs and is a money hungry company that has little to no care about their product that could be great...  They do not permanently ban cheaters (they only give them temp bans), and they allow popular streamers to cheat on stream without punishment.  The game would be great if they would just fix a couple of things... #1: Get new servers #2: fix the desync issues #3: perma ban cheaters (even popular streamers that cheat) #4: get rid of the foreigners that plague the US servers #5: fix other bugs/issues #6: release new content (such as different weapons, vehicles, maps, skins, increase players in the map from 150 to 200, ranking system for 2s & 5s, better type of leaderboards that shows in depth stats (not just wins/kills but like headshots/vehicle kills/kills with specific weapons/assists/bullets shot/accuracy/so on and so on), etc...

Additions 1: the game has been updated into the ground, every patch and update that hits this game, slowly kills and ruins it more and more and they still constantly refuse to perma ban hackers, which is why im changing the game rating from 8 to... 6 out of 10... (December 2017)

Additions 2: the game is in a worse state than when it had the horrible combat update lol why are the characters so slow now??? how hard is it to REVERT to 2016..? ALL OF THAT CODE SHOULD STILL EXIST FROM EVERY PATCH... and also they still refuse to ban popular streamers that have cheated in the past, and who knows if they are still cheating to this day... as well as probably still refusing to ban other cheaters too... changing the game rating from 6 to... 5 out of 10...

On this principle alone i purchased pubg after a few rounds of seeing what this game turned into and i have not played it since. It felt wonky and even more unpolished than PUBG (and im talking about over a year ago) and large engagements with multiple enemies would always get choppy on me no matter how good my internet and ping was.

now the survival servers have been shut down, its not that no one wanted to play survival, its just that they made the game trash and introduced their lame lootboxes, same with current BR.

Here are the ingredients you will need!

Ravioli Dough: 2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 pinch salt, 1 teaspoon olive oil, 2 eggs, 1 1/2 tablespoons water.

Ravioli Filling: 1 (8 ounce) container ricotta cheese, 1 (4 ounce) package cream cheese, softened, 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, 1/2 cup provolone cheese, shredded, 1 egg, 1 1/2 teaspoons dried parsley.

Pesto-Alfredo Cream Sauce: 2 tablespoons olive oil, 2 cloves garlic, crushed, 3 tablespoons prepared basil pesto sauce, 2 cups heavy cream, 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, 1 (24 ounce) jar marinara sauce.


1. Mound the flour and salt together on a work surface and form a well. Beat the teaspoon of olive oil, 2 eggs, and water in a bowl. Pour half the egg mixture into the well. Begin mixing the egg with the flour with one hand; use your other hand to keep the flour mound steady. Add the remaining egg mixture and knead to form a dough.

2. Knead the dough until smooth, 8 to 10 minutes; add more flour if the dough is too sticky. Form the dough into a ball and wrap tightly with plastic. Refrigerate for 1 hour.

3. While the dough is resting, prepare the ravioli filling. Combine the ricotta cheese, cream cheese, mozzarella cheese, provolone cheese, egg, and parsley and mix well. Set the filling aside.

4. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the crushed garlic and pesto sauce and cook for one minute. Pour in the heavy cream, raise the heat to high, and bring the sauce to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the Parmesan cheese and stir until the cheese melts. Remove the pan from the heat and keep warm.

5. Meanwhile, in a separate saucepan, warm the marinara sauce over medium-low heat.

6. Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat the egg with the tablespoon of water to make the egg wash.

7. Roll out the pasta dough into thin sheets no thicker than a nickel. To assemble the ravioli, brush the egg wash over a sheet of pasta. Drop the filling mixture on the dough by teaspoonfuls about one inch apart. Cover the filling with the top sheet of pasta, pressing out the air from around each portion of filling. Press firmly around the filling to seal. Cut into individual ravioli with a knife or pizza cutter. Seal the edges.

8. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Stir in the ravioli, and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the ravioli float to the top and the filling is hot, 4 to 8 minutes. Drain well.

9. Grease a baking sheet. Place the cooked ravioli on the sheet pan and bake in the preheated oven until brown, about 4 minutes.

10. To serve the ravioli, divide them among four warmed serving bowls. Drizzle the marinara sauce over the ravioli and then top with the cream sauce.",1509493803,1548723211,True,1,4,0.485498100519180298,1,True,False,False

So somehow like that. If you want to slip for a while on a tight-fitting jacket, have a tick in your right eye, or if you're just going to have a chat with a person who is as mentally wrong as you, just follow these instructions. The game offers a wide range of ways to go crazy. Here are a few options:

1) INTERNET
waiting for a connection - with a friend you decide to give yourself a BR in five people, all of you hungry, horny, everybody is slowly dying from thinking that you are wearing a kevlar or massaging your ego by surviving the last but then on you a small window pops up to let you know that you will wait for a few minutes, so you decide to go up, lean, sweat, wash, brush your teeth, rewrite, pour, turn the house, buy rolls, dog, help your grandmother from the stairs, cook for 20 members of your family, donate money for charity, and once you return, you will find that only a minute has passed, just fine, nerves only have one and,

2) QUALITY
drop - it will not affect you, you will just appear in the air, for a while without a parachute, so you say okay, because the game is still in development, but it is a detail, then your parachute jumps like you and you fall, dele, you hit, sometimes even under the texture, dense not? and then you will find yourself on the ground, there you will find that you are really in the * deli because the closest camp, cottage, house or even the city is from you super ultra mega maxi xxl dystodemonically crucifixously away so there is not much chance that you survive the more experienced you of course, a chance because they have a pink 20-euro pink sweatshirt on their skin and their mummy's shoulder is on their monitors and they clutched on their shoulders to clean their room

game + teamspeak - ""dude, I have a lousy drop"" ""you with an ARKO"" ""a thick kevlar and a helmet"" ""I'm a military backpack mate"" ""I have 200 rounds to AKC and 100 to shotgun"" ""Dude we have a good spot"" Nobody can do anything """" I do not have anything """" I do not have a car """" A guy opposite, I take him off """" P * killed me """" # $ @ &% *! c * ka ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• , f * cker, b * tch, your mother marihuana my banana (for the ignorant - your mom smokes my cip) ""and imagine it in five people, but vp * deli just

looty - ""your buddy, jaxvine barn, there will be a ranch of things"" ""on the top floor you will find that you have picked up really nice t-shirt with birds and you are running elsewhere, of course it's not always so

3) GAME PHYSICS
driving a car - HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA ehm .. ""bacha hora"" bum, prask, sme v p *

slopes of steep slopes - ""we have a beautiful view, damn boys, I have to disappear""
""hmm kudy"" ""j√©√© √∫ruk√° hora"" and you go down without falling over your HP

4) GRAPHICS
in general - look at your shadows and find out that you bought majnkraft, but otherwise nice urine, vodice, grass, stones, valentine .. p * if it does not belong here .. but otherwise the game with preliminary approach? I will go and for a while I'll make a nice lamb. Of course there are some mistakes that I have. ""And now we all agree to the bosom of the Lord and some of us do not know HIHI""

scale distance - take the binoculars and see the guys who are wearing only shirts, quite seksi not? when driving the car they look like sitting down in the saddle while walking as Jesus Christ nailed to the cross .. do not kidding .. and feedback? ""boys already have something to start with when you have split the game into two"" ""hea Paaartiik we now have our hands full of skins"" badum tsss ok ƒçau

Otherwise, it is a perfect refresher if the dog gets a prey at home or you are spoiled with vegetables in the fridge. I really do not understand all the other game owners who write their ""negative"" reviews here, but check it out, it's a very early access to you. If you do not like it, you can go shooting a cousin's camera with your cousin in the shower as he sticks a peach and sings with Justin Bieber. I'm playing 6/10 for me. Let's see how it will be with other updates or even a full beta. It then pays to invest in a multi-office office chair that will have a built-in bathtub with a shower and a refrigerator.

I was in love with this game since I bought it in 2016, when I saw it on Twitch, and it was the best BR that I've ever seen. (btw, I still think that the Pre-season 2 or 3 is the best BR that was ever made). I spent only 200 hours on this game, and I regret that I haven't played it when it was at it's peak. The mechanichs were perfect, the recoil, bullet-drop and even my old-ass Pentium G3220 could run this game at 50-60 fps in Pleasant Valley.
Everything went downhill when they decided to do the PUBG update (combat update in August 2017), and they started losing a lot of players, now it's a crappy thing with 20 players in a match.
If I could revive any game it'd be H1Z1 (both Just Survive and King of the Kill), because when it was updated only for passion, not trying to make a lot of money and gain new players in many risky ways that'd bring the game to the stage where it's now, it was gaining a lot of popularity, and it was really good.
I lost all my hope about this game, and when I finally deleted it yesterday I was feeling kinda sad, about the memories that I had with this game.
Rest in peace, power and love, good old friend.

p.s.: I recommend it only beacause it brought me in a lot of groups where I made friends that i still talk to, even today, and I had a lot of fun playing it in it's early pre-season days(with the old-new Z2 and UI).",1485959237,1547320427,True,1,0,0.519774019718170166,0,True,False,False

H1Z1 in its prime was revolutionary in my opinion, I have never had as much fun in any game as I have had when it was Preseason 3/4 of this game. My friends and I would sit down and play for hours upon hours, grinding the ranks trying to get up to Royalty and once you finally achieved it, you felt on top of the world. 
The combat of this game was entirely new and fresh, you had to have amazing hand/eye coordination to perform the infamous 2 taps and the crunch of the headshot was enough to want me to play more even upon losing. I will forever say that H1Z1 in its prime was my favorite game to play out of all the varied and vastly different titles I have played. 
However, the Combat Update has ruined this game and dug it into an impossibly deep hole that even to this day, they haven't escaped it. The combat system was changed, the UI was odd and clunky, the models were different, the shotgun was basically useless, everything that we loved about this game proceeded to sink into the ground. Daybreak had EVERYTHING in their hands with this game and in a blink of an eye, washed it all away. 
Even with the new direction they are taking with Jace Hall leading the charge, I don't ever see this game coming back to how it once was and that is okay. I can say that I was there and I experienced it in full charge and now I can move on to other games, letting go of what it once was.",1545950279,1545950279,False,1,0,0.522293031215667725,0,True,False,False

This game was a big part of my life as it also helped me reach out to so many different communities and meet Friends that I still talk to today. Alot of my best gaming memories will be with this game because it gave me the greatest feeling I had never experienced with the BR genre. One day I hope H1Z1 will get back the following I was once apart of. If maybe JUST maybe the dev's hadn't have messed up everything with the games development, Then I wouldn't be writing this review I would instead be playing it and loving every second of it along the way. But it isn't anything 1 single person can control and it is something I have to accept.
 

I have recommended the game because the current devs have tryed to develop it back to its former glory with the help of the community. Even though this is something that should have been done in the past when the following was at peak to develop it further. Still this shows that they are better. This also shows that they have learned there lesson and that they will better work with the community in the future (I hope). so I recommended H1Z1 not because the company deserves the playerbase back, but because The community deserves their playerbase back. Too many players have been left in the dark because of this dying game and im sad to be apart of it.


This game will always have a special place in my heart which is why I am of course sad to see it go. As much as I want to hatepost about this game (which is taking every ounce of me not to do). I would instead like to thank H1Z1 and the communities that made it a special place for someone like me. I had hoped that in the near-future people will see all the good of H1Z1 in its current state and everyone would all come flooding back. But I have long now accepted and have come to terms with the projected future of the playerbase. So I would like to one last time here on the steam review section say goodbye, and thank you H1Z1.
