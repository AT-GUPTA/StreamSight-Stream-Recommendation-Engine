Official servers:
First of all servers are based only in USA leaving players from other major regions like europe, asia, australia with over 120 ping. Any sense of immersion as a surviving dinosaur is broken. Water dinosaurs are completely busted with their speed and ability to fly trough 1/3 of a giant with one jump out of the water at the speed of sound. There is no end goal only wathing numbers grow. Fights if any are far and few between and usually end in 3 seconds of starting. Its usuall for players to sit for 3 weeks (3 real weeks) growing one dinosaur only to reach growth which lets them bully other players and then roam the map in search of any newly spawned players. Many when presented with a choice of fight or flight choose logging off. There are strict rules on combat which prevent any kind of free for all, only duels. These rules are stated only on discord server and if you are new there is no understanding for your learning time of the game.

Community servers:
Range from good and growind pyramid schemes intented on reaching as big growth numbers as possible. Usually also dead.

The game has been in early access for over 5 years and there is no end in sight which is paradoxicaly typical for whole genre of dinosour survival simulators for unknown reasons. The balance of dinosaurs is not even close too good despite such long development time, The only saving grace is the growth levels which sometimes help the balancing but then again cause bullying problem as mentioned before. The system which was special for this game such as floods and droughts were neutered and current world events are outright boring. 

Suggestions:
Make rules accesible for players in game on server ui.
Bring back interesting world events with catastrophic even scale.
Expand the current world events such as growth, slower metabolism, bountiful land spheres.
Introduce aging to nerf old and extremely old dinosaurs with some sort of reward system after death as a huge dinosaur.
Make some sort of a understandable tutorial for challanges of speed, power, survive deities.

Visuals are good, Audio is good, Gameplay is good. All around fun.

     I do however have some warnings regarding the servers, and community. Some private servers are really fun, they often have a long list of rules which is specific to the server and a list of the rules can usually be found in the server's discord. I have had a particularly unpleasant time on ""The Forgotten Realms"" server, the Staff of this server is known already for being unfair and abusing their admin powers to punish players they don't like. I was muted for 48hours in game rendering me completely unable to communicate in-game with other players even within my own group, even DM's are impossible now. What did I do, you ask, to deserve this punishment? Well, I was simply expressing my feelings regarding the rule where you cannot type anything in all Capital letters, I was just casually chitchatting with other players in global about this before suddenly another player told me,""suggest a rule-change, or shut up"" and I said,""Woah why be rude, can't talk about anything around here"" or something to that effect. IMMEDIATELY I was muted, for (Caps, and Toxicity) according to Nessarion their Admin. I never said anything toxic and I never even typed anything in all CAPS like they claimed. I suspect they didn't like me criticizing the ALL CAPS rule and just got so upset that they wanted to mute me and did so. If that's the case just mute me and say that don't try to bend reality and act like I did something I did not do. So yeah end rant, just a little personal experience to help anyone who reads this to be aware of the kind of staff they might have to deal with on these private servers.

The argument for auto-revive, fast growth blah blah killing the game is moot - the community will govern itself with enough players 

But players need new content. Titania didn't flop per se, Gauntlet maybe. but vast majority of the community was put off with performance issues and didn't really return, give them reason. Stop listening to any side of the community run servers because they literally have all the control they could want or need to play the game their way just like the players who play can choose what type of settings they want. But just DO THIS, RELEASE MORE CONTENT. SEMI-OFTEN. 

Bob is on its final leg in the dead game world. The game is boring because there is so little actual content. Skins, achievements and all the other bells and whistles are great additions for sure. But players are here to play an animal, give them more and unique takes like this, let the community control its on servers and rules and just see how you can make money instead of having donated dinos (which is cool I don't dismiss the idea)

But invest in your craft and your game, maybe it looks like playdough but it has smth the other dino games don't for sure. 

This game is dying because everyone is bored. We are still awaiting long standing promised things with vague reasons why they don't exist yet. 

I hope even the slight increase to player count will remind the devs there is hope, we shouldn't be against them. It actually is a small team which I hear a lot from other bigger games where people haven't played 2000+ hours. 

Bob is good, but it can really be great with just a little more movement and prioritising of what to add and when.

If your playing either an aquatic, a flyer, or a apex land carnivore, trust none of your species. This is extremely frustrating, as when you talk to them to possibly try form a pack, or coordinate against nearby possible prey, they will simply try to kill you, typing ""GG EZ"" afterwords if they are successful. The game allows you to spec into different talents to alter your play style, but unfortunately if you are not using an optimal build, the cannibals that are will 9/10 times kill you.

Herbivore play is different, as other members of your species have no incentive to kill you other than because they're bored, and other herbivores are usually peaceable. There were some outliers, usually pachys, that will kill anyone and anything because of reasons unknown to me, so I wouldn't trust pachys either.

The growth system is a bit of a mixed bag. Since theres no upper ceiling to growth, you may encounter extremely large specimens who have been growing for hundreds of hours, or see yourself tower over other members or your species, which is cool. This presents a problem however, as these unusually large dinos will cull their own species in an effort to maintain their own primacy and to further stroke their ego. Usually its only the the aforementioned aquatics, flyers, and apex carnivores who do this.

The Weather system is amazing. Rainstorms that flood the entire map, which allow aquatics a easier chance to find more terrestrial prey other than waiting at river crossings. Land dinos finding themselves having to compete with their predators or prey for an ever smaller growing island that may be possibly surrounded by unseen aquatic carnivores is exhilarating.

There is a solid foundation for a very good dino game. However, with the game still in early access after 6 years, and no indication of a full release anytime soon, and with the epidemic problem of unneeded cannibalism, I couldn't recommend this game to anyone who does not have a colossal amount of patience, both for the game and the players they may encounter.",1708217160,1708217160,False,3,0,0.519224703311920166,0,True,False,True

     I'm going to be blunt; this game is rough. It is buggy, unbalanced, garish, and generally a chaotic mess. It is nowhere near being an excellent game...

     ...But despite all of that, I'd say it's enjoyable and sets out to do what it's trying to do. For all intents and purposes, this is a dinosaur sandbox. The fun comes from the unpredictability of other players. From apex predators that friendly call you and chat to dog-sized terrors that will slit your throat, you'll never see the same thing twice. This is a double-edged sword though, as playing solo can be uneventful and frustrating. If you have some friends (or are willing to make some), love dinosaurs and want to fiddle around with the best dinosaur dress up (there's unparalleled skin customization, it's great) then this game will be worth some time.

Overall, Beasts of Bermuda is a charming mess. Sloppily executed, yet great for the niche audience that these particular dinosaur games attract. I'm not going to call this game great per say, but it's the best ""screw around as a dinosaur"" game I've played.

Partially I like that, making your experiences and learning from just trying things out. But in a game that wll leave you at a *heavy* disadvantage if you don't know what you're doing against seasoned players, the chances of your experience being
- spawn in and explore a little
- meet a hostile player
- immediately bite the dust
are a touch too high.

And it really does depend on the people you end up playing with and the rules of the servers. Official servers are NOT recommended at all. While you can get lucky with nice people, if you don't get into the big groups of dinos, prepared to be killed on sight for no reason.

Over the years Beasts of Bermuda has changed a lot.. from a poorly balanced funny dinosaur game to a slightly better balanced funny dinosaur game. 


It's come a long way and many improvements have been made, but so far it seems pretty good!

There's still a lot of cons even if it's more refined than before however... Mosa's existence alone is a con

Balancing isn't the BEST yet, but hopefully it is improved in this aspect, as it has plenty of potential


If you don't wanna read for like 20 seconds then I'll simplify it here: Has lots of bugs, balancing isn't doing too well (especially when stuff gets so big they literally start breaking the game) but it is DEFINITELY better than the past- I mean I still loved 'Old BoB' but.. I have to admit it is definitely better

As someone who has been playing a lot of The Isle (mind you not in the the greatest spot of its lifetime right now) I find that the boosted/chill servers; which is where most the player base is are pointless. Literally just a chat room where you move a dino around a map and get banned for attacking things. Quite frankly, whats the point. Real grass has much higher fidelity guys, you can feel the rain, and actually hear and use your vocal chords. 

the good things i will say about this game are;

great customization of the dinos and skins

lots of choices in dinos

a nice perk system that allows you to play more toward your preferred style 

bad things 

community of basement dwellers (??)

the weather stress system was pretty stupid imo 

a lightning strike killing hours of ""work"" 

some of the gameplay loop seems like it just wants you to figure it out yourself


In short; this game isn't bad. just avoid the ""chill"" server unless you just want to look at Mid tier graphics and chat with strangers all night.

A bad community is ignoreable for some with a singleplayer game, but for a multiplayer PVP game, that is BAD news that the community is generally just unfun.

2) The game largely plays as an MMO, and as such is an enormous time sink to learn and without enormous depth.

3) Certain aspects for the game, like aquatics and flyers, are not fully developed so the game feels incomplete and it won't be so for a long time.

When I initially started playing this game, I found myself in awe of the mechanics and fun additional gameplay it provided. In contrast to it's competitors, Beasts Of Bermuda provided many of the things we all wanted; Dinosaurs in all kinds of fantastical colours, fun builds and diversity when it comes to the dinos. 

However it has one MAJOR problem that makes this game borderline unplayable;
The community. I have never in my life seen such a toxic community in one game. 
Whereas The Isle certainly gave me a run for my money, the people playing this game are on a whole other level. 90% of the communities you'll find in this game are filled with teens taking out their puberty anger on each other or adults who act akin to toddlers when they don't get their way. 

If you are to be playing this game, please look for servers focused on chill or realistic gameplay unless you want to be surrounded by nothing but complete degeneracy. I would tell you to stay clear of Lost Beasts, but that server has since been taken down. 

In a majority of servers the admins appear to be nothing but tools to big clans or giant carnivore mains who rule the servers. Even after the nerfs to growth past 1.2, there are still people with ridiculously big dinos who can easily track down ANY person whom they wish to kill on the map. Many pretend they aren't mixpacking, but in reality they have friends who play flying dinosaurs who relay them information disguised as ""silly game banter"". And since these same people will usually befriend admins, there's little that can be done to stop it. 

If you are going to buy this game, do extensive research on whatever server you enter and avoid all servers that are rulefree, unless YOU yourself play with the express purpose to be toxic. A reminder that the freedom most rulefree servers offer is an illusion and only applies to the players favoured by the admins. 
Which shocker to absolutely NOBODY seems to be the worst of the worst. 

Apart from the horrible community, this game runs horribly slow. Constant lag spikes, computer getting way too hot and issues rendering the map despite me running it on an INCREDIBLY powerful gaming rig. 
(When this review was posted I ran a 4070 Nvidia Graphics card)

To continue my point of groups ruling the servers, if one friendgroup is ruling a server with mosas, then mosas are unplayable unless you are part of that friendgroup. They will kill other mosas on sight and given they will have an organised party, there's little you can do about it even as a more powerful marine predator. 
I've seen this happen with a multitude of dinosaurs; Mosas, Megs, Rexes, Acros, Pachys, Ludos and more.

There is fun to be found in this game, but it's overshadowed by it's community to the point that it's unplayable. 
The devs also enjoy censoring the critique they get and hold bans and threats of harassment against creators who disagree with them. 

STEER CLEAR OF THIS GAME IF YOU VALUE YOUR TIME, MENTAL STABILITY AND ABILITY TO HAVE FUN.

If you're looking for a dinosaur survival game that provides a similar experience, I recommend Path of Titans. It features many dinosaurs and the ability to mod which gives you plenty of servers to play on that allow for fun. And while there is toxicity, as there's no infinite growth and dinosaurs are regularly re-balanced, you will not run into the same chaos seen here. If my review saves someone from wasting their money, I consider it a win in my book.

People refuse to let the game progress because they'll lose their uwu 9.0 autorevive grown rexes/mosas/whatever.

Official is the only real survival experience but because the community refuses to move on with progress, population peaks at around 60 and averages 20-30. 

Infinite growth is also killing the game - how do you expect newcoming players to compete with giants that spent literal years growing? ""Play official"" Yeah mate official population is dead and not a good look for new players??? lol? Cap it at 2.0 when the elder morph is filled out. You don't need a boss battle all 3 trees maxed 3/3 5/5. There isn't even a challenge at that point.

Nice game until you get frustrated by it, mechanics allow one player to dominate the entire server with enough time hiding and growing.

Hit boxes extend past most dinos, Devs have no idea how fix it, they have tried multiple times.
So all the vets do is do swing bys with random bites and catch hit boxes and Devs say this is intended game play.
Some of dinos like the Sia can get bit on his tail (cause of hit boxes) but can't hit dino in face doing it?

Velos are able climb trees, do it at your own risk, you will be climing with 2.0+ velo and hit seams in trees that make u fall, the screen goes to a sky view then under ground crashes then u come back to dead 2.0 + dino, happens all time. 
          (hours wasted, and they want u record to get dino revive, your game isn't worth the trouble)

you can get sick in this game and need charcoal to fix it, half charcoal on map can't be eaten.

Devs have no idea what they are doing at this point and you can clearly tell this game lost its value.

Worst part is the community, the most horrible part of this game, vets act like this is some compettive pvp game, with all these bugs not even being addressed, 90 percent time they are killing smaller dinos and talking crap in chat, it really makes u guys look like fool not person got pvped.

Just about all vets mesh through rocks even though not allowed, basically these people take advantage of any bug or exploit game has, do it so much u master it, and then they think they are good lol.

I go 40/2 - 68/2, all times in competitive shooters and pvp, screenshots all over my pages but Beast of Bermuda will never be competitive PvP game.



Update: 1/26/2024

they have fixed most of previous errors / bugs, but introduced so much more.

Official Server has been constantly crashing, along with client crashes also on regular basis.

New Sai model has been introduced, still has hit box problems.

Mega rats move is still broken, he able hit u and access his dodge move at same time.

Food and water drain rates are still little high, which makes anything 2.5 + a stressful hassle just to manage.

Idk, where fun aspect of this game is, the PvP is still a sloppy mess and suffers from latency issues big time.

PvE aspect of game is really broken and the Devs try to force u to play their way through the mechanics of the game.

Chill servers are the bane of this game - chill servers are rampant and go unchecked. Just people using the game as a chat room. No new dinos for over a year and a half, but they are apparently working on archelon and paleo now, no idea when that's coming out. They teased archelon over a year ago as well. 

So far still just plushies and skin spam as of Jan  12 2024.  

Now for the postivies: 
- A lot of bug fixes
- Titania is great
- PVP feels smoother 

If  I could give a neutral vote I would, but since I can't I'll just give it a thumbs up. Keep in mind that its a neutral vote. It's to be seen if anything new comes out that isn't a skin.

Creatures that people payed thousands for have not been released almost six years now.

[edit] since i basically have no intention of installing this game ever again i figured i'd write an actual review. it's long but you essentially only need to read the first two paragraphs for an overview.

this game's store page is at best over exaggerated and at worst a complete lie. the footage you see in these trailers is not indicative of what the actual ingame experience is like, at the very least not on official servers which is the gamemode/style intended by the developers. those elasmos peacefully swimming as a pt dives in for a fish? yeah good luck. those elas would've spotted your pt sonner than you would them, dart 300m into the sky (very realism), grab you, and drown you. or you can choose to escape the grab, suffer 70 injury and die a slower death. if you want to have the 'roaming through the fields as a herd escaping danger!' you'll need to already be friends with people that play the game regularly or hope that you can get into their good graces as most people's official server experiences can be summerised as: grow for an hour, maybe two if you're lucky, get spotted by a clan or any player of the same species, die outnumbered or manage to escape to live another hour. watch this if you wanna see the REAL frequent official experience: https://youtu.be/bsbazVxEBAE?si=GPoCA3Om8zJfSdUm

a competitive '''survival''' game where people can grow to immense sizes and strengths is nothing more than a breeding ground for cliques, clans, or maybe a few invested friends if you're lucky. you won't be roaming with herds from predators since as soon as someone bigger than you spots you it's time to battle. and by time to battle I mean pray they're a sub par player so that your skill can make up for the stat difference, and BOY are there stat differences. if you know anything about Ark Survival Evolved you'll understand the deal: the game envisioned by the devs isn't even nearly close to the real experience, at the very least, if you're so much as considering spending money on a survival game where the highest pop server is chill and no fighting then PLEASE watch some gameplay videos of people ACTUALLY PLAYING the game first, not the scripted garbage of a 'trailer' they made.

now, the long version

there's several reasons why this game is dying, to name a few:
- canibalism
there is no real insentive for players to fight other species over just cannibalising the same species smaller players, you'll be VERY lucky if you're first interaction with a same species player is positive. this goes for herbivores too! since official gameplay is basically just a pvp KOS arena with some survival mechanics involved.
- talents
the talent tree system is a joke for a game that largely consists of a competitive pvp environment. as your dino grows not only do your stats scale but you also unlock points to spend on talents, these talents have NO downsides/trade offs which means that bigger is always better making for a boring system that is a chore to fight against.
- inherits
ontop of the points you can spend on talents you can also inherit points if you grow a dino that other players have created from an egg. this system isn't awful but it does mean that as a player you will inherently be brought down if other players have better inherits. how do you get better inherits? hope other players who are big are willing to nest you, or try completing trials during your dinos life so you can reincarnate for a new one with better inherits, however the reincarnation system is so RNG you'd be better off spending the money you could on this game for lottery tickets and you'd probably have a better experience.
- bugs
bugs are expected in every single game and by no means is this game unplayable because of them. but i personally have lost patience losing dinos i've spent several hours growing because i got stuck inside a tree i merely tried to brush past (if you're lucky like me you'll get stuck in an invisible one! fun!)
- balance
this game's balance is piss poor, and i'm not talking about specific stats or abilities, although with basically every update a spanner is constantly thrown in the works to make some dino op and another complete garbage. every major change over the past 2 years has had massive issues and continues to tank the playerbase:
  - pt went from a relatively peaceful low damage little bird to a tactical missile striking down apex creatures in a single update. while it has been nerfed it goes to show the devs do not understand the game they have actually made if they considered the update appropriate for release in the first place: in the trailer the new ability was shown as a manoeuvre for the pt to dip and dive at high speed with grace! ... in reality since the game has no player collision people used the ability (and still do) to dive through others at mach 10 which, during the original update, could do enough dmg to put it on par with mid tier ground carnivores. the clip at the end of the ability showcase where the pts are shown flying in formation over a lake like geese? yeah no, now bird vs bird consists of going so fast everyone is teleporting around because the game isn't optimised enough for such an ability to work in the first place.

  - acros remodel ruined it's main gameplay style and sais recent remodel broke its main skill that it uses to defend itself, not that either became unplayable but enough to make them a chore to play. acro's main form of fighting constists of hitting players to apply bleed, making distance, sitting or laying to heal off the dmg taken which they can't because of the bleed, then getting up and back to rinse and repeat. it's the long game, endurance. the new animations made acro the second slowest creature to get up from sitting and laying, second only to an Apatosaurus twice its size. the new model also made its tail and body an easy target during fights with rexes and most mids: since you're body is so long and your head has no way to reach your side if someone manages to get behind your legs you're a laughably easy target.

sai's main ability is spikey shield, allowing you to deflect and mitigate dmg when someone hits you if it is active. its club tail is its main line of defence dealing a subpar amount of dmg but a lot of injury. a very fun set up for this armoured little pancake. however, since the update you can no longer swing your tail and activate your ability at the same time. if you swing your tail you have to wait till the animation is over to activate your ability. for a creature that has very limited speed/movement, every turn and every step counts, but now, people can simply wait until you try to swing your tail at them then bite your head for free. this is exceptionally bad since counter intuitively you usually WANT to be facing your attacker because on the backswing of the tail you dont deal dmg and cannot start another swing, making it an easy free hit for people, so the remodel made an existing (albeit liveable) hit box issue into an even bigger one.

  - people have had issues with the mosa's grab ability for ages as most playable's that aren't semi/aquatic (aka most of them) are helpless to do anything against it. instead of reworking the feature and the playable entirely to make it more engaging and fun (for those playing it AND those that aren't) they decide to tweak stat changes that do little to nothing in terms of fixing the actual gameplay problems. this kind of change would require a big overhaul (not necessarily removing the feature) but it's changes like this that the game desperately needs if the devs want to dig it out of its grave.

TLDR: the devs are constantly making changes and adding new features that don't line up with the experience they have already created. this game needs a serious rethink from the ground up and frankly, while it can be some fun if you get the game free, it isnt worth your £16 IMO. please stop buying games with interesting premises but flawed executions.",1686498725,1704855562,False,13,1,0.556123137474060059,0,True,False,True

The steam page touts itself has a Dinosaur Survival Game, but once you go on in game, you'll find most servers are Auto Revive servers, eliminating any sense of survival, and just as bad, the rate at which you grow your dino on these servers is extremely slow, the main actual survival servers are the official game ones, but thet are severely underpopulated. 

Back around mid Nov of 2022, they tried to fix it by implementing a new and improved game mode without either alongside a better map that dint allow Auto Revive and extremely slow, AFK growth. But the community whined so bad a former official staff admin called it [i] ""Overwhelmingly Suffocating"" [/i] and they had to undo the changes, bring the Auto Revive game made and AFK growth to the new map. Since then, they have made no strives to amend the lack of survival in this game, and instead, have doubled down by allowing DLC's for skins and Paypal donations, [b] (Donations are not allowed by Steams TOS, do with that what you will) [/b] allowing the NEET's who play the game and keep it down to fund the game, allowing the game to stagnate further.

But why doesn't the community do anything? You might think they all can't be NEET's, and while good people do play BoB, they are drowned out by the tide of NEET's in game and in the games official discord server. The playerbase is beyond terrible, it is the worst I've seen in a game, as they are the main reason the game is the way it is. The devs made mistakes in the early stages in the game that fostered them, but the devs were new, they didn't know, and wanted to try and fix things, but the community didn't want fixes, didn't want change, they wanted to sit and AFK, and eventually, the devs caved, and then doubled down.

With bugs and exploits that have existed for years and become widely known about and still not fixed. Consistent hackers and exploiters that do not get punished, though if you die from real bugs you'll be laughed at and given no assistance. The game is incredibly incomplete and requires a ruling system even on official servers so be prepared to join the discord, deal with constant reporting, and discovering new rules as you go since they aren't even all written out but you're expected to know them. Make a few strikes and you'll be permanently banned.

The one chance you have to save yourself is to record hours upon hours of gameplay to have every second of your screen saved for when bugs/exploits/etc happens and report it in their official discord. This takes tons of space on your pc, and requires you to download other programs like OBS. If you try to use their own in game recording system they suggest to use, the mods will tell you it is not sufficient. So why does it exist? 

Updates have ruined the original reason this game was enjoyable and more popular. The concurrent players in the game have been consistently on a downward trend and it is dying steady. Standard the game doesn't even have 1000+ players online, and only about 50 on your best day will be in an official server (official 2). Expect 20-30 on any regular day.

This game was definitely one that helped me get through the 2020 pandemic. I absolutely loved growing the little guys, having a 1.9 Ptera and a 2.4 Ory (Which growing took a LONG time back then.) that I adored playing. The game was fun, addicting, and i've met a lot of kind people on there. I used to admin for a community server, which *was* a fun experience.

That being said, it's a shell of it's former self.

Around the Rex/Trope update, there was a huge memory leak going on that just was never fixed. (At least from when I last heard.) 
This memory leak was so bad it actually DAMAGED a few computers; including my old pc, which at one point ran the game at 60+ FPS. If I could put pictures in reviews, I would send the many screenshots of players saying how their computers were damaged by such an update.

So many things that sounded cool that were added- like wild fires- only for them to be seemingly untested. Laggy, buggy, you name it. It feels like the entire game needs a recode. New content is lacking in favor for skin DLCs, Plushies, anything else to suck more money from it's currently dying playerbase.

It's a toxic community where the developers tell you to ""go fuck yourself"" after being critiqued about updates NO ONE is happy about. Again, I wish I could share screenshots again because this is an exact situation that has happened. 

WE KNOW so many cool dinosaurs exist. We've seen developers play them. Yet, they give every excuse under the sun to actually NOT develop these dinosaurs whilst croaking out a wonky-looking remodel that they insist doesn't break it's own spine when you turn your camera. It's like The Isle devs gatekeeping Hypos but worst. The Maps they release is laggy and constantly full of bugs, you wonder if they have a NASA computer running this game because the lag is noticeable even with the highest specs.

Accessibility: UI is an absolute nightmare to read, especially if you have any kind of visual impairments, and the heavily textured buttons and backgrounds make navigating the accessibility settings impossible if you actually need the accessibility. Compatibility with the Steam deck is hazardous at best; don't expect to be able to read any text in the game. No captioning that I can find that clarifies which noises from which dinosaurs mean which things, which would be greatly appreciated for a game where those noises make up the bulk of player to player interaction and danger warnings.

Like Stoin, I wish I had the option to vote 'neutral' here. BoB is changing directions and I'm okay with it. There are a lot of disingenuous negative reviews on here which I wish to distance myself from.

21/10/2022: The devs have posted several interesting gameplay changes for the upcoming map and game mode, Titania. They have also planned several mechanics to balance the issues mentioned in my review below. This shows great promise and I am eagerly watching its developments. I will update my review to fairly reflect the game after Titania launch. 

Disclosure: I have more than one account and my hours played is higher than stated.

I could talk forever about the state of play for BoB. I would consider it my favourite of the top three dino PvP survival games on the market, but that does not mean it is in any way good nor is this my recommendation to buy it. 

I used to really enjoy this game when permanent death existed and servers could not adjust growth rates. The gameplay loop was more defined at this point. Grow, die, repeat. Back then, combat was high-stakes and it wasn't as easy to create creatures that were incredibly over-bred (i.e. with a high amount of inherited talent points which makes one stronger than the average). I hated losing my characters permanently but part of that also brought a lot of thrill and adrenaline to the game. Aged servers would run into issues where there would be a large cohort of extremely large and powerful dinosaurs which would make gameplay impossible for new arrivals due to the aforementioned overbreeding problems. Still, if one of these large creatures either stopped playing or died, the server ecosystem would shift and keep things refreshing. The alpha t-rex dying would be big news. The break up of a keystone herd would make real gameplay changes for herbivore players.

BoB attracts the type of player who grows attached to the identity of a certain dino, which I can respect, but PvPvE (survival) servers are dominated by players who are in love with their characters and do not want to see them die. They will do anything (including breaking rules, metagaming and abusing staff) to circumvent the death of a character. They will also verbally abuse you if you even so much as attack them. In a survival PvP game. I had one guy threaten to get me shot IRL for kicking him out of my herd (for being abusive in the first place). Don't bother blocking people because it doesn't work- the block falls off on logout and doesn't carry across servers. 

Infinite growth is an issue that the developers have been unable to fix and it is killing their game, driving away new players who get a taste of the competition and decide it is not worth the time investment. To combat this, the devs have adjusted the growth scaling; I fully support the devs' choice to tune down the strength of larger dinos in order to balance the game, and their decision worked. The playing field is much more even and newer players have a real chance to at least exist without instant domination by clans and cliques.

So, what did the community do in response? Not only did they mass review bomb the store page (lol), send horrible abuse to the devs on the community discord (lol), but they have also created extreme servers to support the gameplay loop of growing big, fast and without penalty. Instant revivals after death, 2x+ growth speed, dinosaur simming but not in a chill server (where that kind of play belongs). Eventually the larger dino is still going to outplay the newcomer due to sheer size and talent point difference, and community servers have just made it as easy as possible to do so by implementing fast growth times- this is after the devs deliberately reduced growth times to try and stop these problems! Sure, the new player gets their dinosaurs revived, but what is the point when everyone else had a head start in the race? Nobody is going to want to come back to getting beaten over and over again by the same players.

The community votes with their feet and the only servers with population are those with fast growth, no growth cap (i.e. infinite growth) or instant revival on death. This allows the hardcore player to devote hours of their day getting as large as possible in order to stomp on anything smaller and, let's be honest, it creates a very unwelcoming atmosphere for the newbie. I have been on multiple PvP (NOT chill) servers where players will literally leave their creatures online and GO TO BED in order to grow more. This is how bad the game has become: no gameplay loop, no risk, full reward, full AFK. Too many community servers are doing this and any that don't are either gatekept with extreme realism rules, password protected behind applications, or are just empty. 

I'm also going to give you a warning now that most community servers carry toxic players, bad staff, or have absolutely no understanding of the player-built ecosystem and how to manage that. Don't bother going to the official servers either, because it's WORSE there. Like, full-blown abusive chat and mismanagement. 

BoB is as much a survival game as it is a social game. To succeed, you HAVE to play with others. Solo play is NOT an option.

You know what I think will help this game? Implement scheduled server wipes. Create a leaderboard and rewards/exclusive skins for the largest of each species; give prizes for the highest in every trial overall, or on a trial-by-trial basis by species. Give people a goal to work towards that isn't about sitting in a hole AFK growing while you go to bed. Give players customisation rewards, we already have the coahuilaceratops backer with their exclusive bionic skin. We know the code is there to do this. 

Remember when coah dropped? And all servers had everyone playing coah and the playing field was even and exciting? People were working hard to breed the best and playing strategically. Remember starting in a fresh new server that released, where everyone was at the same starting point and all gameplay niches were open? We can all agree that it is that point in the gameplay loop which is the most exciting and engaging. Yeah, bring that back with regular wipes (Rust, another PvP survival game, does this to great success). Forget posting suggestions like these to the official discord suggestions channel, you WILL get downvoted and laughed at.

Please don't buy this game.

---{ Graphics }---
Depending on what dinosaur you play, the model can range from being a bit goofy to being good. They're definitely not as polished and perfect, but they fit in well. There was a recent update that also ported the new textures to older maps, which also makes it look a lot better than it used to. Overall, 6/10 on the graphics since so many things are unreal assets and a lot of terrain is super unnatural.

---{ Gameplay }---
Gameplay is extremely versatile. You can be a full fledged camo ambush hunter, spending your time waiting for the right moment, a group hunter, an aggressive herbivore on some servers, and so on. If you want to spend your time socializing, you can play herbivore or join a chill server, and if you want action, there's deathmatch servers and autorevive servers. Overall, 9/10 since there's definitely some aspects that could be changed and improved upon, but aren't so bad that I can list them off the top of my head.

---{ Audio }---
The audio is decent. The calls are generally easy to distinguish as long as you spend the time to learn individual dinos calls. The music on Titania and the burrow and cave music is very nice, coming from someone who usually turns off music in games. Overall a 7/10, the footstep sounds and ambiance could be improved upon.

---{ Audience }---
I've met people of all ages and will confidently say that there is a place for everyone on this game, no matter your age or where you're from. Many people (including me) respect the older members of the community and a lot of the time are more patient with the younger ones. However, there are no chat filters or anything of the sort and you can only disable global chat, so for super young players this could be an issue.

---{ PC Requirements }---
If you want it to look good, you'll need a fairly good computer. If you just want to play the game, there are definitely people who play it on a laptop and somehow manage, but it's not the best with optimization and is honestly a case-by-case basis it seems. If you have multiple PCs, I'd recommend using the best one for this game unless you're willing to sacrifice the often relaxing graphics for frames.

---{ Difficulty }---
The difficulty is also very flexible. Combat-wise, I'd say it takes a bit of learning and patience, but the game itself is generally ""easy to learn, hard to master.""

---{ Grind }---
You'll probably be enslaved for a good thousand hours before you can say you have any clue what the fuck is happening

---{ Story }---
There's some lore but it isn't extremely story based and there aren't really RPG aspects unless you play realism or roleplay servers. Most of the lore is within the map decorations and shrines.

---{ Game Time }---
You can play it as long as you want, if you can keep interest that long. Technically, there's no cap to your growth, but many servers have one set.

---{ Price }---
I'd say it's worth it. If it's on sale, even more so.

---{ Bugs }---
It's pretty annoying. Not really Ark level, but expect some bugs. Some of them are funny, some of them make you uninstall then reinstall after the next patch a year later just to see the same thing still there. You can still enjoy the game despite them, though.

---{ My Rating }---
8/10 but if you don't care for the talent tree aspect and the infinite growth aspect just refund and go play path of titans.",1611261838,1702710200,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

This is also with weather, this can stress your dino out and the comfort lvl goes down.

Or people who want content to be put out every two weeks despite the developers putting forth a helluva lot of effort to get a sea snake playable fully functioning with its own physics.

The new player experience is *literally* the best it's ever been, with a compass popping up when you sniff, inherits only providing a marginal buff, playables overall being very balanced for what the devs intend to them to be, and a incredibly immersive map that is still being expanded upon.

This game has its moments with its ups & downs.

Admittedly. It's an addicting game, mostly only because of the massive growth goals and skin goals to obtain those special and unique skins, to try and pop out or feel unique compared to others. PvP I do NOT recommend overall (Unless restricted for like realism and keep dinos), it's honestly never been my strong suit and just feels like a waste of time to spend hours growing or to achieve something to only die easily by another whose either bigger or apart of groups.

Even then. It's still rather... boring. There isn't really much of anything to do aside from skin hunting, inherit hunting, growing. Unless devs start actually adding stuff to do such as events, missions or boss like ai's, goals that arent all skin or cosmetic related, maybe then it'd feel more... exciting? I really enjoy the cosmetic additions and new skin events, but it all feels too much skin related.

I'd personally love to see more cosmetics you can buy or earn in game such as collars, chains, scarfs, etc... earn them from missions, bosses, etc...

Eitherway, if you enjoy hunting for hours on end to days, weeks or even months for a specific mutation or skin. Decorating your skin, etc... this game is for you, awesome skin simulator! But if you want survival based and stuff to do, nah.",1552216082,1702007930,True,3,0,0.521486043930053711,0,True,False,True

The customization is great. The nesting, back before gauntlet mode/new life cycle came around, could be fun with a group of friends. The dinosaurs themselves are (mostly) fun to play. The music is great. The new map is pretty, if poorly optimized. (several patches later it's better than it was but still has some lag issues here and there)

There are some odd design decisions, however, such as the modelers' apparent obsession with making all of the dinosaurs unnaturally square or angular. Or the water shader. The most recent map update added some cool new volcanic trenches...which would be great *if I could see anything*. The water gets darker the farther down you go to the point it's actively unpleasant and I can barely see MY OWN DINO never mind the scenery. I'm not a fan of the new life cycle/gauntlet mode as it (still, even after several patches and balance changes) feels like a stressful eating sim where you can never slow down and do things like nest, make pretty ory burrows, or even just be a goofball with your friends.

If you absolutely have to get your play as a dinosaur fix, I'd recommend this one, but honestly if you can wait until these games (any of them, not just Beasts of Bermuda) are out of early access you really should wait.

Recent major overhauls of the game have diminished core systems and enjoyable mechanics or simply tossed them out in favor of a generic, watered down experience that has failed to grow the community and is having substantial difficulties maintaining it. Gigantic dinosaurs, acquired after deep investment and hours upon hours of growth utilizing the infinite growth system, were nerfed to the ground and made practically irrelevant aside for farming them for hunt points. The infinite growth system and talent point system were also not spared in this exchange, reconfigured to have a generic growth cap where at max growth you may opt in to a rapid growth rate to larger sizes (slightly larger and slightly stronger than normal dinos due to extreme nerfs) and are offered substantially less talent points with your growth to work with along the way as an insult to injury. It would be generous to call the entire experience an insulting mimicry of The Isle's hypo system, but it even failed to be a knock-off.

The foundation of the game has been smashed with a hammer and replaced by a foundation of quicksand that the dev team continues to sink their game with at a rate that makes one wonder if they are sabotaging their own product on purpose. The long term playability of the game was sacrificed for a short-term burst of fun that burns a player out a surprisingly rapid rate. The core gameplay loop has been drastically dumbed down to rapid growth with little to no investment in your dino or your talents, all for the chance to get on a leaderboard for a skin or cosmetic. Natural disasters are shelved, giant dinos, talents, reincarnations, nesting, and so many features all continue to be nerfed or removed to further dull the experience to a cheap, generic dinosaur survival simulator as the devs make a panicked sprint away from their former game because of their insistence on their ""vision."" 

And none of this is even accounting for the gamebreakingly poor optimization, toxically negative (shitty criticism/review-bombing/harassment) and toxically positive (yes-men/positive review-bombing/refuse criticism) community, extensive toxic cliques, content creators, and groups (some occupied with official moderators), chinese and russian clans that tamper with experience and at times hack to make life hell for others, necessary recording software required to enjoy the game without the risk of a ban for killing someone ingame over complex rules on official servers and most community servers, or the couple dozen other glaring issues with the game.

But hey, with a quirky little DLC, the game's death screen says ""Skill Issue"" if you die now. Neat.
If you're looking for a decent dinosaur experience, this is unfortunately not the place.

The game has been saved. You can now pay $3 for overlays (NOT skins) for your dinosaurs, with a bundle price of $32, $12 more than the price of the game itself.

Sad to say, if I'm honest. The community surrounding this game manages to often make itself more toxic than the Rust community, the servers are essentially all player run because the official servers are either too laggy for most to run or too empty for others to care. Community servers often means admin abuse, cliques, and often even more toxicity from friend groups defending one another. The community constantly argues over what the game is ""meant for"" and how it's ""meant to be played"" and whether or not certain styles of community server should even *exist* and whether or not BoB devs should ""allow"" those servers to continue to exist simply for having a different preferred playstyle. The devs seem to care very little about the game itself and are more interested in making as much money as possible, only ""making changes if goals are met"" as if they didn't make a kickstarter for that exact reason and hit every goal plus more.

I’ve played both PoT, and The Isle off and on over the years especially one of my close friends who got me into these games originally. Overall, I really see where BoB is superior to the other two major Dino survival sims, but also some drawbacks. I love the environments and the mysterious vibe I get while playing BoB. The other two really can’t match this feeling. I would argue PoT more so compares with this, but The Isle has its own kind of vibe as well I guess. The Isle I would say has more of a dangerous setting/feeling while playing. I really can’t explain it but I feel like the major drawback for BoB is the progression systems as it seems to lead to players just being simple too powerful. I definitely like some of the mechanics in this game, but again I would argue all 3 games in this genre has something unique. I do believe there is room for all 3 games and I couldn’t put them in any particular order. I hope to see all of the games succeed, but I’m getting slightly off review here. Anyway, after playing BoB the game is truly fun and easily worth the $20, but it needs some work with its progression system and just general bugs/glitches.

The diverse skins, and interesting mutations are definitely a favorite. Alongside the ability to mix multiple skins, acquire skin mutations, different voice pitches, and gain inherits to benefit your dinosaur either in just a survival instance or combat. There are various concepts that have been implemented in Beasts of Bermuda that make it unique in its own way as another multiplayer dinosaur game.
    The patches may take a while to be implemented with new content, thus causing the game to stale a bit, but it keeps me coming back simply because of how unique it is compared to others. At least in my opinion. I still look forward to all the new features being implemented in future patches, along with new critters, features, skins, etc. I've been playing this game since it officially released on Steam, and still continue to play it even when things are slow. It's just one of those games that keeps me coming back as a player.

1. Path of titans
This is my all time favorite Dinogame since it has everything I want from a Dinosaurgame. 
+ Graphics are stunning
+ Fun with quests where you go and collect berries/nuts to get evolution points. Even though it´s very unrealistic with quests where you collect stuff it really gives you a meaning walking or flying across the map and it makes it really stand out from the others. First I thought it would feel flimsy and weird but this is what I really love with it :)
+ Very enjoyable as a soloplayer and if you put the chat to ""Local"" you will not be brought out of immersion. Also some players don´t kill on sight allways in this game and it´s quite fun to communicate with others to see if they want to be friendly. I allmost never look at the chat since I want to get the feel of being a Dino. This is the only game of all on the list which I can just drop into and just chill and at the same time enjoy playing and experiencing wonderful nature at the same time.

+ MOD SUPPORT! It´s wonderful because some servers have such diversity of dinosaurs and you can really enjoy all of them regardless if it was millions of year inbetween when they lived on earth. Also someone created a Sabretooth :D. The mod community is very strong and serious in its dedication to bring more content.

2.Beasts of Bermuda
I played this before I found Path of Titans since The Isle was to hardcore for me.
+ Nice with the weathercycles and storms where you need to take cover.
+ Quite easy with to learn the controls and get a hang of it.
+ Neat with a skilltree so you can develope your own style of dinosaur
+ Super fun to start as an egg and get hatched and grow with parents
- Neon skins for the Dinos(Thankfully you can turn them off)
- Very gamy and Dinos of all sorts bunch together and just hang around doing jack shit.
- Shrines where you can get boosts and such, very gamy and I must say takes the immersion totally out of it.

3. The Isle
Realistic but quite boring because it´s so hard to survive (At least as a noob like me with only 15hours in the game).It´s also quite hard to survive and quite limited to what you can eat as a herbavore. It´s probably fun if youre a bunch of Dinos on discord but not so enjoyable solo.

- Not possible to add your favorite servers in a list for completly unknown reasons to me, so you need to write down the server you play on.

- Very few dinos to choose from since its striving to be realistic which means Tyranosaurus are not posible use together with other dinos that you´ve seen in Jurassic park ;(

Actually I prefer The isle more than Beasts of Bermuda but I have not just got the hang of that and I´m sure it has much more value as a Dino game than BoB.

4. Isle of Yore:
If this game would support 500 players on a server I would have not refunded it.
Wonderful graphics & realistic landscape & awesome atmosphere, no players :(
+ Best graphics
-Worst animations
- No players

BIGGEST MINUS WITH ALL DINO GAMES:
It is actually that they playerlimit on servers are around 100-150.
I hope all them can make a breakthrough on the playerlimit so we can have really alive worlds. PRoblem with most of them is that the worlds are to big and the server limits are so low so players tend to hang out at specific areas and not really being all over the map. This makes the immersion a bit boring and it feels like there has been some sort of plague.",1700593890,1700593890,True,42,0,0.764760434627532959,0,True,False,True

Unless you have a **** ton of time to kill i do not recommend.
This Game is extremely toxic and Pretty Unbalanced, Not to mention that Almost all the servers with populations Have Auto revive With Super nested Dinos :D

If your Playing solo Your basically a snack for Everyone. 
Best to play with friends, or a group if you can find one that'll let you in :>

Hitboxs are trash, you could be sniffing someones ***hole and still not hit.
Or You Could be 5 Years Away From Someone And take a Hit :D Aint that great???

Some of the Creatures have 0 Counter play and Get outta jail Free Cards 

I Picked this game up again recently cause i was interested in the new AI creatures you can play as, But i was thoroughly disappointed Cause Ya cant play as Em unless your LUCKY Enough to Nabb an Egg.
The other thing that Brought me back Was the rex Skin. So My Happy *** read the post, Hopped in what i thought was a life Cycle server Cause it was labeled as one N' Started groin a rex only to Find out... ""Oh yeah! Ya Cant get the skin on this server."" Scuse me...??? I Joined a Life Cycle Server DId i not???

Conclusion For all Yall Who Have Yet to Buy This Game!
JUST DONT
YOU Will Save
YOUR TIME!
YOUR MONEY!
YOUR SANITY!
AND! YOUR PATIENTS!
Also you Wont be so Lonely and Bored :>

If you Just walk away n' pretend this game dont exist 
Just... Just walk away. You dont want it.

I'm going to try to keep it simple: I think you SHOULD give this game a chance, but be prepared for the troubles ahead.

No matter how many grieving, annoyed, pissed-off nights I've spent playing this title with my friends, something always brings me back to it. I think there's something so uniquely innovative and charming about the world of Beasts of Bermuda and what the game has to offer. Everything from a fantastic soundtrack to recognizable models to such a captivating way of growing and surviving, no matter how badly this game frustrates me it's way of play always pulls me back in for hours upon hours more. I have followed this project since pre-Titania (the most recent major update) and I'm excited to see where it's going, but worried at the current state it's playerbase is at. Most days, player counts don't even graze 1000, and the majority of the playerbase is using the title as more of an ""online chill chatroom"" as opposed to rugged dinosaur survival.  I have so much hope for the future of this project but it's numbers just continue to dwindle. Apart of this problem, I feel, is that much of it's own playerbase doesn't even like their own game. I watch people join lobbies for the first time and they are promptly bullied away or encouraged to uninstall & refund -- then these same players complain when nobody joins the barely populated lobbies.

Beasts of Bermuda is highly configurable and has endless customization options, many unique ways to grow and thrive, and unique challenges such as storm threats and infection, but I cannot deny it's problems. The optimization is horrible. This game WILL destroy your computer by memory overload or thermal throttling, and with every ""optimization"" patch, little to no progress is made, and many previous problems are made much worse. It's community is uniquely toxic in such a way that you'll be numbed by some of the stupidity of it's players, and many necessary functions to survive are constantly unbalanced and shuffled -- but yet I still recommend this game because I firmly believe it can grow and become something amazing.

The development team for this title is VERY small, but I cannot disregard the incredible amount of progress they've made and especially at such a fast rate; updates (major or minor) are pushed out on average every 4-6 months. I can't ignore the love for the community that the staff holds and how well they implement and acknowledge feedback, and I absolutely cannot turn my head at the unique style and gameplay, which is why I think it's still running - and what keeps bringing players like me back.

TLDR; A lot of people don't like this title, but please, give it a try. It will frustrate you. It will annoy you. It will make you want to pull your hair out, but once the ball is rolling, it *really* stays in motion.",1660786531,1698455037,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Beasts of Bermuda is a dinosaur simulator where you can play a range of animals from Herbivore to Carnivore.
As it is the game is fun, and worth the price for anybody wanting to start their journey of playing as these wonderful animals. Surprisingly this game has a skill tree, and it works really well, You can also get perks that affect your playstyle. This game honestly blew me away with how nice it is for beginners, HOWEVER as much as I'm praising this game, It has It's flaws. First and Foremost.. the fanbase, Honestly not as bad as I was thinking, But once in-awhile you'll find a player who'll kos without actually needing to. Bugs can appear and while I haven't found any that directly ruin the experience, I'm sure there are some people who have.

On most servers you have to be 3.0+ growth on most dinosaurs which takes days, maybe weeks to grow, to even be slightly viable in PvP, and only if you’re a nested dino with good inherits. 

Gauntlet is impossible to play long term if you’re looking to grow a big dino, 6 hunger and thirst drain per tick on a 2.0 velo is ridiculous.

PvP is generally really toxic, a lot of people just say GG but even on free revive servers there will always be toxic people flaming you because they attacked you first but you killed them instead.

The rules on a lot of the community servers can be really overly strict, complex, and confusing, but it’s different for every server.

Updates are few and far between for a game in early access, and clearly not ready to come out of EA any time soon, I feel like the devs have lost passion for the game, but if they really put the hard work in to improve the game and actually listen to their player base I could see this game being really successful.

I play it just because it’s a fun dino game and I like playing as a dino, it’s a less toxic version of The Isle but that really isn’t saying much, BoB is still fairly toxic and I wouldn’t recommend it to someone whose never played these types of games before.

I started off on this game on May of 2021 the game was less of hassle then how it is now DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS GAME there's too many toxic player groups and servers and worst part people who victimize themselves to to fit into larger crowds to degrade others and ruin reputations even if they weren't known by a lot of people to begin with too many favoritism among admins and not one damn is given when misleading information is released into the community itself and people take a bite off then go along with it if you want to deal with the backstabbers and admin power abusers then go for it otherwise you'd be better of playing something else the updates aren't even all that too save your money for something else

Funny part is this game is full of REAL pedophiles there was even a server shut down 2 years ago cause of this so called person (who did actual stuff with SOLID PROOF) but nowadays guess what more people want to finger point and assume who's one and who's not without their real solid evidence and using out of context stuff CHILL and SURVIVAL is FULL of these THINGS do not allow your kids on this game period

I'm an aunt to 5 of my sister's kids and i wouldn't even allow them to play ANY game on steam (i will say star stable is a better example of safe games because of the control of censored words) with a chat involved or even the discord server with it that's a no no even if i was a mother i wouldn't let MY kids do it either even if they were old enough to communicate in chats nah sorry that would never happen this game is not meant for kids due to the volume of groomers/pedos and scary as it is some admins are secretly these disgusting people or defending them on their TEAM 

Oh and they'll try to find the games you ""supposedly"" play on and report you to get you ""banned"" so you can't play it (even though majority discord servers won't listen to them) when you have no interest or reason wanting the game itself so along with that you get your own personal stalkers who will drag it out for months isn't that lovely? people these days act like kids instead of adults- yeah it's funny too stay safe out there guys

Beware of these stalkers they will manipulate anyone and claim they have proof of stuff that's out of context as shown from many screenshots and photos we have from their docs along with a silly little video with ridiculous clipped bs AKA Taelove and their partner Kino they have dragged things out and done illegal stalking/harassment and caused emotional distress along with ptsd to one of the indivisuals they forced to be involved along with another who's already suffered with past stalkers/harassers and deals with anxiety/depression that should be reported even checking profile statuses and would screen shot them that had quotes from google search as their ""evidence"" to also add to their doc while STILL checking the profiles of these people to continue monitoring for more ""evidence"" when people have been moved on 

There has been a owner of a chill server who goes the name of Rynth allowing underaged children to make jokes about sexual assault even the R word involved in that category when one of the minors who claimed they were ""groomed"" are doing this as well and telling others to go ""k*ll themselves"" multiple times and also have been doing this in the server chat and even on Ashes of Death Match which is owned by someone else but topics are very heavy in their discord genral channel but no admins are doing anything to give warnings or mutes to stop the behavior whatsoever and there is many proof of screenshots from people who showed them claiming it's ""Normal""",1687979020,1697605422,False,12,2,0.497674643993377686,0,True,False,True

Ive been playing since the Sai came out, ive seen this game change over the past few years, mostly for the worse. the game used to be perma death, so once your op dino was dead it was dead forever, they added a ress system to the game as well as a way to reincarnate your dead dinos. That sounds cool on paper, but the result was grinding for better dinos, once you have your op +2 dino you can ress it at a cost if you die. being big on a dino used to mean something, the titania update gave us a buggy map with a tiny ocean and poor terrain. growth means nothing now, you can fart out a 2.0 in a day, when before that 2.0 used to be among the most feared dino on the server. inherits mean almost nothing now because they nerfed them into the ground, to the point of why even bother having them? once that goes the whole gameplay loop becomes meaningless. I miss the old beasts of bermuda, when killing the big krono/mosa/rex on the server used to be an achievement. I miss going from a baby to an adult and realizing how op your dino, surviving against all odds, sadly those days look to be gone, this game may become extinct at this rate. If you want a better dino survival game go play path of titans, its updated constantly and the devs are the people who made legacy isle, they seem to know what they are doing. on a side note steam needs to change the survival tag on this game, titania's gauntlet is more of an arcade game than a survival game. of the 3 dino games: path of titans, the isle and beasts, this game quickly went from the best dino game to the worst, all it took were a few terrible updates in a year to totally trash the game play and the player base. for all the updates they never got rid of the admins, something that should have been a priority, the admins and their circle of friends are the biggest cheaters in the game, another reason the game is failing. You were fun for a while beasts of bermuda, but all good things must come to an end sometime, I will always have fond memories of when you used to be a good game.

Edit: It has come to my attention that the game has run out of funds (an anonymous inside source) and is now desperate to make a buck, do not buy this game, do not fall for the plushie campaign to ""make the game better"" its a scam. they squandered the success they had and then attacked the players for raising legitimate concerns.

The players it currently attract are lazy and overly attached to their creatures to the point they absolutely hate playing anything related to losing their progress. Servers that tend to try and keep up the survival aspect of the game struggle to keep their player base time and time again due to said chill servers taking over the entire server listings.

Firstly, developers made an entirely wrong move adding Auto Resurrection as a server-side setting with no restrictions. This allows people to play without losing progress. This defeats the purpose of the game attempting to be survival-based. While it's useful for helping players to learn about the game without stressing over PvP, server owners have created highly unhealthy game play using said server setting with a survival aspect (players are given basic rules to follow however no consequence of permanent death). Upon the developers attempting to remove the Auto Resurrection feature a few updates ago, it didn't go well and caused so much pressure that they brought it back (horrible mistake to allow toxic players to FORCE you to bring it back).

Secondly, [b]THE DEVELOPERS HALF A** LISTEN TO THEIR COMMUNITY[/b] in the first place even before auto resurrection was created. We have constantly begged and pleaded for better optimization, modding (to allow talented individuals or teams to create amazing things), more creative skins to be added (there are several extremely talented members creating skins DAILY in their discord), DLC's (to possibly help aid in supporting the game financially), more dinosaurs added, and most importantly drop more frequent updates. It's understandable all of these heavily cost however if implemented at the right times it can make this game take off again in players. 

Thirdly, [b]THIS GAME UPDATES EVERY 3 MONTHS[/b] and that alone makes people leave this game as it is. On top of this, we are teased with certain progress updates and [b]NEVER[/b] see them in-game. It's as if the developers of this game act like The Isle developers. They tease you about a specific creature that you're never going to see or play for another 5-6 years from now. Such as the Utahraptor, players have YET to see this one specific dinosaur added as a playable for all. There is no reason this one should take as long as it has to be released. There has been several other creature releases but that one specifically? No updates what so ever. Another example is Saichania remodel, given teasers for it yet it has been 2-3 years, not even given yet. It's absolutely ridiculous up to this point. The team has serious problems working and focusing on one thing at a time and instead choose to bounce around multiple different areas of the game.

[b]The owner of this game has shown multiple times he's no longer passionate. They are absolutely ignoring the red flags of their updates and not taking the time to actually visualize if it will help or harm this game. This recent patch for the AI update was honestly disappointing due to the TIMING of its release. It should have been released patches ago when AI were first introduced.[/b]

If the owner were really smart, they'd just sell this game to someone absolutely passionate about it and is willing to take all of the risks needed to make it better again. In that case, completely adjusting the Auto Resurrection server setting and creating it into it's own game play mode with some restrictions (growth strictly capped to 1.2 or 2.0 ignoring the server setting growth cap) so that it is more useful for introducing new players to learn the game and not having them entirely hooked. This will then allow for room to add all other interesting things such as DLCs (skins, monstrous mutations, glows, etc), more beautiful skins (including the glowy skins), optimizing the maps and such.


[b]Overall I do not recommend this game to anyone who actually wants to feel the intensity of survival. You will not get that feeling here. If you are lucky, maybe you will catch 1-3 actual survival servers thriving though whatever else is left, is the last of the player base holding on.[/b]",1696788065,1696788065,False,69,13,0.696845531463623047,0,True,False,True

The reason I was game banned was because I was a part of a modding community that attempted to make it so that all people could access the skins (some of which were supposedly worth upwards of 2800$) and be able to have that experience that only the select few could. At no point were these skins sold, only made available to be able to nest so people could have the skins they dreamed since they couldn't afford to pay thousands for them. The modding community also changed the growth rate of the base game so that the game could be more fun and enjoyable instead of grindy and boring. As a result of this we got a lot of people interested in the game for the first time in a long time, and the devs insisted that we needed to be shut down even though we brought hundreds of people back to the playerbase.

I implore the game devs specifically you Predatoria, to learn from this experience and see what the players actually want. Now that I'm game banned, I'm actually excited to work on other things that are more open to criticism. Perhaps its a skill issue on your part to not understand what constructive criticism is even when it is thrown in your face. I don't suggest anyone get this game unless you want a slow, grindy, annoying process that will make you just hate your experience with time. I do hope with time that the bells of reason ring in the echo chambers that is the Official Discord and there will be an update that makes me want to play the game again.

**In regards to SkinkMaries comment, yes I was aware that we broke TOS, however we were very passionate about making a community of people that wanted a good time playing a game we once all loved. This ""hacking"" was only done to the skins and growth rates, both of which are fairly harmless from my perspective and did not aim to hurt the image of Beasts of Bermuda but to enhance it's potential as a game. Most of the skins that you know of are nestable yes, but many are restricted like the alleged 10,000$ terminator coah skin is not nestable, and only serves as a reminder that the majority of the community cannot afford to have a cool looking dino or you have to wave an ungodly price in front of the devs noses for them to get anything done. On top of everything, a lot of the original owners of the skins no longer play Beasts of Bermuda, which over time will make the skins more and more unattainable for average Joe. The intent wasn't to be malicious, it was to make the game great again, regardless of how you feel about it but I will admit I cannot speak for everyone that was on the project. I was never given any warnings, time outs (only on the official server discord once a long time ago), I'm not the type to be troublesome, I only aim to make things better.

I don't think the update really did anything to fix any of the ""issues we caused"" but to each their own. I have no desire to make this game tolerable, it has already wasted enough of my time. I left a negative review to show my disdain for the devs and their overall response to any feedback given about their game. Perhaps you are right in that we actually made the game better by being a pain, and forcing Predatoria to actually care about his game again.

For you to take the time to post three replies to my review tells me you are passionate about the game, which I admire in a person. The fact that you of all people are defending a game developer that time and time again has refused to listen to the community is admirable, and it makes me think that you yourself might be in an echo chamber feeling that all you do is righteous. I find it curious that a game that was released several years ago and has had moderate success why is it that the dev team continues to be quite small, and why is it that they have to run campaigns for funds when they've made quite enough to theoretically expand their efforts. But that is not something you or I are privy to, so who am I to make assumptions?

Don't get me wrong, as far as 'games that let you play as a dino', it's unfortunately probably the best. Which isn't saying much as that pool is pretty damn shallow. 

There are a good number of dinos to play around with; and it feels good to roam around, doing dino things. But the main problem isn't how the dinos play mechanically...it's the playerbase.  It's TOXIC. Nearly everyone is hyper-aggressive, hyper-hostile, hyper-salty; both in gameplay and general attitude. There are only a handful of genuinely active servers, and the people you'll meet there would just as soon murder you as look at you, regardless if you or they are carnivores or herbivore. 
There are never any admins or mods on. Players are constantly accusing each other of hacking, cheating, etc. And to top it off, it's a real struggle to get your dino to grow past 1.5...especially if you're solo, because...once again, every dinosaur and their dino-grandma want you fossilized. That gentle-looking apatasaurus? It'll chase you into the sunset and murder you? That tiny ory? Will hunt you relentlessly until you give up on life. 

Oh, also. Combat in this game effective amounts to if your opponent is agile enough to get behind you and tail-ride you so you can't do anything except take the ass-biting of a lifetime. A single tiny velociraptor can and will take down a t-rex simply because the rex isn't fast or agile enough to turn and chomp at the velo biting its tail.

Of all those games, I love this one the most.

Pros:
Character customization: It is out of this world what you can do. 

Easy growth: It might be on the server i'm on, but I've had so much fun growing and enjoying my time.

Community: There seems to be an uptick in users who simply want special perks from days of old given to them, as opposed to allowing the game to progress in a forward fashion, for free. Instead, they choose to take their anger out by essentially stealing an indie company's assets, and even money they claim could be used to help the very game they're stealing from. 

But you know, aside that, the community is overall about what you make of it.

Weather sounds: Of all the games I've played, BoB has the most realistic weather sounds, so much so that my cats flip absolute heck if they year lightning from the game.

Cons:
I wish BoB would update their graphics, but I have a feeling they're slowly working on it, and I am more than willing to hang out until then",1631610596,1696007373,True,1,0,0.519685029983520508,0,True,False,True

However understand that this is basically a dinosaur themed open world MOBA, which would be fine if the 'respawn room', time to become competitive again, wasn't 2+ hours. This game requires hours of the player's time in order to create a false sense of fear and investment, and it is *intended gameplay* for overwhelmingly powerful creatures to show up and pretty much delete/harvest that investment. It's like Agar.io with different graphics. Some of the creatures in this game are terrifically unbalanced at larger sizes, to a degree that could only be caused by hacking in most games. Again this is an encouraged mechanic. There is no skill or tactic to compete with an animal of your own species that is older than you, except to never encounter them, which doesn't work because all creatures get faster as they grow and you can't escape them.

The game relies on private servers using discord channels to moderate and enforce rules to make it playable and stop clans from wiping out every animal on the server. This kind of moderation poses its own set of difficulties. You have to use a third party program to record your gameplay at all times, and filing a report is a piece of work on every server I've been on. Of about 400 players, maybe 20 will be on official servers- that is how vital third party moderation is to the game. The player base is also extremely toxic and uncooperative. 

People play this game like a breeding gacha, trying to get all of the best inherits before they bother growing out the dinosaur since they can't otherwise compete with the rest of the +2 creatures. There is Honestly virtually no gameplay- herds race around eating before they encastle themselves on top of rocks or cliffs and just sit there with the big characters guarding the ramp, because if they go into the open they will pretty much die. A LOT of idling, very little interactions between herbivore players. At least carnivores have to coordinate and walk around to some degree, before they get deleted by another pack or a flier that can 1-shot them after appearing from out of visual render. Because you are virtually guaranteed food when you hunt a smaller member of your own species, cannibalism is rampant and it's virtually impossible for some species to find groups that aren't established cliques where you will be tolerated as a meat shield.

The degree of time-wasting is incredible. It's fun to struggle to survive, fight and die well and raise up a new creature, but the comedic brokenness of the time-reliant leveling system and rampant mechanic exploitation, resulting in comical unskilled and tactless combat, makes the game little more than an early beta time waster. Even when you're the big one it's hard to enjoy yourself. Agar.io does it better.",1695925723,1695925723,False,6,0,0.522449016571044922,0,True,False,True

Predatoria's refusal to allow its members to play the game the way they want has created a stifling atmosphere that undermines the essence of what gaming communities should be about: enjoyment, freedom, and creativity.

Beasts of Bermuda is a game that thrives on player interaction, creativity, and immersion. However, it's disheartening to see Predatoria take a stance that seems more focused on controlling and limiting gameplay rather than embracing the diverse playstyles and preferences of its members. This restrictive approach has led to growing frustration and disillusionment among the community's players.

A gaming community should be a place where individuals can express themselves, experiment with different strategies, and explore the game world in their unique way. Unfortunately, Predatoria's heavy-handed rules and regulations have curtailed these essential elements, leaving many players feeling marginalized and unheard.

The beauty of Beasts of Bermuda lies in its potential for player-driven experiences, where each player can contribute to the game's evolving narrative. However, Predatoria's insistence on enforcing their vision at the expense of player freedom has had a detrimental impact. It's disappointing to witness a community that was once vibrant and promising become a place where members are denied the opportunity to fully enjoy the game on their terms.

In summary, the situation within the Predatoria community regarding Beasts of Bermuda is deeply regrettable. Gaming communities should be spaces of inclusivity and camaraderie, where players can come together to share their love for the game. Predatoria's unwillingness to allow its community to play the game the way they want undermines the very essence of what makes gaming communities special. It is my hope that the community can find a way to strike a balance between structure and freedom to rekindle the spirit of enjoyment and creativity that brought us all together in the first place.

Graphics: Alright
Gameplay: boring
Story: nonexistent 
Combat: sh!t

The main function of the game is to grow as large as possible, sinking massive amounts of time into growing a character. It's a glorified Bitcoin miner, you spent more time AFK than actually playing. It runs on FOMO, ""if I don't play, I won't reach x growth tonight"". The talent trees don't effect gameplay in the slightest because every stat scales. A 5.0 dinosaur with sh!t inherited talents will always beat a 4.9 dinosaur with God tier stats. Not to mention it takes literal years to get to 5.0, time that you can't get back. Absolute nolife game. Players powertrip over 50+ discord rules in every server. Toxic autistic players, just like in the Isle.

The devs are too lazy to add more than 6 character slots, and they always respond to the criticism with ""just buy another copy of the game"". But at least the devs update the models to have realistic cloacas, cuz that's what the players REALLY wanted. 🙄

The main issue that this game is facing right now is that the devs cant decide which of the 2 main types of communities they really need/want to support when they both need wildly different things from each other. The game does not have the framework that it needs for a true survival experience, and the most populated servers lean into the more arcade-y direction of a lot of this game and are the ones where you cannot lose your dino, so the survival aspect is meaningless. Meanwhile on the officials/the servers where you do lose your dino upon death, growing and learning the game as a new player is next to impossible given the games current balance state with apexes and pteranodons being so heavily favored by the devs, and thats not even talking about the clans which can ruin entire servers on their own.

Don't waste your time on this game in its current state.

-

Developers are very uncommunicative and leave the community without any sort of update for multiple months at a time. They've been doing it for years. At the time of this post there hasn't been an update in 2 months, which is the regular at this point. 

Official servers are full of giant 'clans', learning this game through them will deter basically any new player. You will rarely find yourself playing here without any friends. 

Unofficial servers were the lifeblood of this game before a feature called 'Autorevive' was added. This feature removed any sort of competition from the game and all community servers are now chill roleplay fests with occasional fighting, which has no repercussion. The no repercussion is good for new players to learn mechanics of the game as there is little to no tutorial but it is not a healthy system for 90% of the player base to be in.

Overall this game would benefit from receiving a massive overhaul. The developers need to choose a direction, stick with it, and market towards people who would enjoy that direction. It has a lot of potential to be one of the best dinosaur games out there do to the variety of interesting mechanics but it is not worth the investment right now.

  I do recommend this game now. I still think you should make sure it IS what you want since it can be time consuming (there's a lot of growing to be done). The devs are polishing and remodeling their playables, they're still supporting/updating older maps as they continue development and they're beginning to add seasonal events where you can earn skins and they plan to add a cosmetics shop (I believe you will be able to spend hunt points you earn from killing other players). So, that will add more to work towards and make your dinosaur more personalized. It's really forming into a proper game and there are all sorts of communities for it. There are servers that have the ""regular"" slow growth, servers that have the new Titania fast paced gameplay and there are chill servers that just allow people to mingle, nest and grow their dinos without worrying about fighting.

If you really want a dinosaur survival game, don't choose this, its a dying product because the community/balance are complete garbage, with some issues being over a year old and still not being balanced or the community still all wanting to play chill servers rather than any on survival servers (i dont exactly blame them for this because this game is just a glorified deathmatch which promotes clans if you play on the only survival server that has barely any players). Don't fall for this game as its just an addiction for most of the community at this point, just wait for Ark Survival Ascendant to come out.

Bobs problem stems from a few things that they cant fix without killing their community

1. Balance - This includes talent trees not being balanced at all and speed always being the stronger tree to go for, the next is size, bigger size allows you to not only facetank higher tier creatures, but it also lets you jump higher which in addition means you can fall greater heights, for some creatures like mosa this means you can thrash things to death easier, the next thing is combat, its ass. If you have played this game you will know that aquatics feel like a seperate game than land creatures who primally assride (so skill) and flyers are split into tropeo who is balanced and pt who is an abomination of the term op as of current, aquatics/semi aquatics combat is based on them darting which while people can argue its skillful, it is only more skillful than the skilless assriding that is land gameplay, not much more than that though, It doesn't help you have situations such as a lurd darting out of water travelling much faster than any land animal, landing on said land animal and facetanking it, not balanced and has been a thing since dart existed, the devs generally refuse to balance certain creatures such as megar who hasn't had any changes to fix the fact strong bones lets it take 2 apa kicks or just the fact a fully crippled megar can escape a combat survival sai, balance in this game is horrible with most builds being unviable and this is just looked over as you not choosing a viable build but what is the point of having those other builds if they are unviable. Now if they did fix all of the above, what would happen? well if size was balanced, which is what alot of the players play this game for is to get big and be op, there would be as much if not even more outrage as when auto revives got removed (when this happened they had to add it back or the devs would have lost their income) the next thing is combat reworked, this by default won't happen as predatoria the lead dev thinks assriding is skillful, but if it was reworked entirely to have skill involved, well darting would be gone which would make alot of the aquatic fanbase rage replaced with something that doesn't let you travel the map instantly, assriding wouldnt be viable anymore so alot of the mid/small tier mains would rage (these make up a sizeable amount of the community) and more complex movement introduced with more attacks for all playables, and if builds were balanced and actually taken into consideration for balance instead of just said as a ""bad build"" and left aside, then I think that would actually be seen as positive to the playerbase since they could play different builds and still be viable.

2. Community and Dev Relationship, It is known that the community of this game just strangles the devs when they do something they don't like and are one of the leading factors as to why this game can't grow, but why are they like this you may wonder, well its the game and what it offers, before titania, big creatures took long to grow (months to years) to get to massive sizes and other people would hunt them down, this was the basis for the clan wars and this hasn't changed other than the fact you grow faster and are easier to kill due to stat/talent nerfs at bigger sizes + food and water drain, this game turns into a clan game no matter and the problem is that isn't what the devs want but they never stopped it, so overtime the types of players that buy and STAY for this game are into the bland and easy combat + clan wars, this isn't like ark where clans are intended but can still be beaten by outwitting and outskilling them in pvp, bob was just meant to be a survival game where you fight other players, but the game couldn't retain the players it needed, only tryhards who could grind growth over and over game such as myself would play this game and such behaviour was rewarded massively, allowing such progress to dominate and affect people who don't play the game as often, while this isn't as much of an issue, not only is the stigma still there (ask any unofficial player to play official) but IF you wanted to grow big, you will still be targetted and outnumbered over and over again because well its allowed and intended. But the playerbase for this game is all about the ""skillful"" pvp or are just chill players, neither fit the main focus of this game and thats because the main focus of this game sucks and so people look to the alternatives and well thats how this games community developed and when the devs try to build upon their survival dream (albeit not in the best way) they get attacked and threatened or lose alot of players because its not what they want, many of these players buy multiple alt accounts for this game to have more slots, I myself never did this because Im not spending more money on a game Im aware is not going to survive as long as something like the isle (ass game btw but has a community that actually wants to play it for what it is AKA SURVIVAL) 

While I want this game to succeed, there is no saving it as the devs can't get past their community they created and never opposed until too late, this game is doomed to go down the slow path of being stuck with an awful community and not gaining new players who will stay, just look at the youtubers for this game, all they are is kill compliations which is an important thing to note, if you look at ark/path of titans/the isle, you will find that the most popular videos are just normal survival videos, not kill comps with edgy music in the background. I have made some good memories with this game and some close friends that I talk to still, so to say its all bad isnt fair, but those things are normal things you would have or do in any game you play for this long. Just remember this game doesn't offer what it says it does. unless you like surviving clans or roleplaying on chill deathmatch servers.

The community want's the easiest and less consumming time path to be powerfull and only care on what's best for them instead for the game's lifespan, wich is why getting feedback from the entire community isn't a good idea and I think the developers should focus more on being creative and not let the community restrict them from doing what they need and feel is necessary. For example: when Titania came out (the whole new map), many people started to get hyped for this game but most of the community started review bombing just to avoid the game getting sales (wich worked), just to make the devs revert a chunk of the changes wich mostly only benefited the actual game. They (the devs) wanted to extreminaty the free roam mode, wich was a bad idea, but they had to bring back auto revive because of the review bombing, wich was a mechanic that made the gameplay loop not existance at all. Despite it being ""just an option"" almost all the servers at the time had that mechanic; rewarding those that simply AFK and discouraging players that wanted to actually play the game.

After a couple months after the launch of Titania, the hype was gone and the server list became the same, where the Official server's where almost no existent and everyone playing on Community servers, especially the ones with the Auto Revive mechanic.
I also forgot to say that the game is currently bad optimized and quite ugly, wich is an issue since other games of this genre have become less laggy and beautiful at the same time, but overall, BoB is quite an interesting experience, expeccially with the newest mechanics like Mutations or the Talent tree. Also despite the goofiness, bullshit (in regards to the fact you can just ""beat the game"" by AFKing or the unbalanced talents and creatures, for example, small creatures like trope, ptera and Rex can just kill everything that they want to and also mosa's are too overpowered, since they can grab on things that look way bigger than it.

There are a variety of unique ""classes"" of creatures which can be played, they are: aquatic, terrestrial, flyer, and semi aquatic. Each creature has its own special mechanic or ability which makes it different from the others. For example, the Parasaurolophus has the ability to highlight predators which can alert fellow herd members of danger. Whereas the Saichania can deflect damage back to its opponents. Beasts of Bermuda takes survival to a whole another level. The game has a variety of mechanics which make survival easier and harder: Violent storms can cause extreme stress to your creature, which could kill it, eating healthy can promote a growth boost, a talent point system which allows the player to choose how they want to play, and a system of inheriting skins/talents. The game also has a reincarnation mechanic, which allows players to receive more inherits by maintaining a high trial score on their previous creature. This mechanic really spices up the gameplay as nothing is really lost. While graphically the game isn't the best, its recent updates to the ocean and natural lighting have made significant improvements to how the game looks. Some of the older models are extremely goofy and look almost like clay, but the newer models that are being introduced are much better in quality and accurately reflect the real life creatures. The older maps are poorly designed. They are all basically one big circle with little variation in each environment, which is really bad when you spend so much time on your creatures. The new Titania map solves a lot of the map related problems, making gameplay much more challenging.

I'm going to go through what I think is wrong with the game, piece by piece.

So firstly, rulebreaking/exploiting/cheating:
The rules themselves come across as a bit ambiguous. Playing alongside other players you aren't supposed to be playing with (they're playing dinosaurs you can't group with) is okay, as long as you don't get caught on video grouping up to hunt down and kill other players with evidence that you're actively colluding. If you do, you're given a warning first, so until that happens you have pretty free reign to do it without a penalty. It's a similar case with any other sort of cheating or exploiting, like clipping your character through terrain so you can't be found or hit in the head, using alt+f4 to quicklog in combat, or whatever other cheap thing you've figured out how to do.

The second and third kind of go hand-in-hand so I'll address gameplay and character progression together:
The hitboxes are pretty wonky, both for landing hits and receiving damage. They don't really reflect the attack animations or the character models very accurately. There also seems to be pretty constant bizarre interactions, even with sub-50 latency, like getting hit half a second after what should be out of range of those wonky hitboxes. Because of these things, fights are determined far more by number of players and the development of their dinosaurs, which brings us to character progression and optimal playstyle.
this is a link to the growth rates of the various dinosaurs, from the official discord: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/136968150225911808/824048075663867924/image0.png
As you can see, it takes a decent time expenditure to progress the characters. And it's not really based on playing the game, although keeping good levels of food/water/comfort helps, generally AFKing your character in an obscure location on the map to level it up before trying to use it to play works a lot better, since the game features permadeath -  if you die, you need to remake your character. To do this even better, you generally want to have a large group of people to do this with, so you can semi-afk more safely, and in an area where resources to increase your growth speed can be monopolized.
This is compounded by inherited talents. The characters have a talent tree where you can get various boosts for your character, and you normally get 20 or so by 1.2 growth, after which growth rates drop pretty severely, as you can see on the chart I linked. Normally, spawned characters get a maximum of 4 of these talents, distributed at random, and often going into talents that are largely worthless. If two players spawn an egg though, a third player can potentially get up to 20 of these extra talents, which can boost the normal talents above their normal levels (like a 3/3+2 for 5/3), and these can be pretty substantial, and give your character a rather severe advantage against others who don't have such things.
This results in a strange game, where the best strategy is just not to actually play the game. You find a group of players to make characters that are far stronger than what normal players will have access to, and spend a bunch of time not really playing while those characters grow, and then once you have them you don't really want to fight anybody who has characters on that level, since a lot of these large groups have truces with one another, so you go around beating down people who are far below a level playing field, and occasionally getting pretty upset when they do manage to kill you (the community absolutely despises the pachys, which, with some numbers and coordination, can isolate, cripple, and kill stronger opponents.)
These mechanics, as with most of the game's specifics, are never really explained in-game. You find out a little about it from other players, but I had to go digging for a lot of this information. And despite claims that this is just a product of it being an early access game, from what I can gather it seems that the people who invested a lot of time into that system don't really want it changed, and the devs are probably disinclined to make changes that would bother the most dedicated part of their player base.
As a final note, I don't hate the game. I think the dinosaur fighting with permadeath and high stakes is a fun premise, and it can be fun in practice, even if the combat is incredibly bootleg. But I don't think I can, knowing what I now know, recommend a game that so strongly incentivises and encourages, for lack of a better and less crude way to put it, circlejerking instead of actually playing the game.",1616264101,1691005152,False,1,0,0.45606696605682373,0,True,False,True

Edit: I have returned after a couple years and the game is still really fun! Although I prefer the original map, but that might just be the nostalgia in me (I did spend over 1,000 hours on it after all). I can't believe I used to be so bad at reviewing things. I mean one of my reviews on a different game was just ""bery gud"" and that was it. Anyway, I used to love this game back in the day but when I returned to play it again something was missing. This might just be me, but I find it really hard to find servers that actually have like a little community going on. This type of server was rampant back in the day and I even made some friends of it, but it's super hard to find those kinds of things nowadays. Maybe if I wait for a big update people will play a bit more, but I feel like the game has changed from a game where you can make friends easily to a bit more of a competitive system y'know? 
All in all, I still think it's a great game that deserves your time. 

I don't think this review should stop you from playing the game, this was just my personal experience but it might be different from a lot of others! I shouldn't stop you from trying this game out, so maybe check another review after this one if I'm causing you to make a decision.

[h1] BIASED EXPERIENCE [/h1]
I've played Beasts of Bermuda since mid-2019. My PC specs haven't changed since then.
My opinions have shifted dramatically over the course of development, and while it personally still isn't my FAVORITE game, it rests as one that still holds a place among them.
Recent updates have been very good for introducing new content and changing the way the game is played, making it more beginner-friendly and safe for those who don't play in larger groups.
Compared to the older days, I do thoroughly enjoy these newer versions of BoB and I find myself coming back for more far more often.",1611482840,1690928087,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

I enjoyed very little of it, but it's very addictive because it is a time sink. 90 percent of these hours are probably me afking in a corner of the map.

I can tell you the pros of this game pretty fast. It lets you grow limitlessly, which can be fun and rewarding. It also has a decent skin system that gives you full artistic liberty. Unfortunately, nearly everyone uses it to look like some kind of sonic OC. 
Now into the cons: 
Visuals:
It is visually appaling, the environments look like play-doh. Cliffs are nearly always rounded and never near 90 degrees at any point down the cliffside. Lighting has no clue what an opaque object is.  Ground textures are constantly visible under foliage and appear very flat. There is probably a roblox game out there that looks and functions better than this, and also has unlimited growth. Many of the creature models are outdated, and look very flat and under-textured.

Mechanics: 
There are many different ways you can make yourself grow faster, requiring various amounts of risk VS reward. Seeking freshwater, extra tasty plants/meat, going to world events, and making sure your comfort is high. Doing all of the above with grant you huge growth buffs, but only doing some of them is minimally rewarding. The risk is incredibly high, and usually results in death, so you're usually punished for doing the things that the game is mechanically trying to get you to do. At least on official. 
The diet system is a joke, it barely matters. Diets are easy and unrewarding to fulfill, basically a pointless mechanic. Coahuilaceratops and pachycephalosaurus actually have to do a small amount of work to balance their diets, but it's still not difficult or rewarding. The nesting mechanic is very basic, but does add to the experience, not really any complaints there. 
Combat is basic and usually a game of rock paper scissors, if the other creature is the same size as you. Some creatures typically fare better against certain creatures, and worse against others. However, if the other creature is just so incredibly large, it doesn't matter. You might be a para, and you can outspeed a rex usually, but if that rex is 2 or 3 times your size, it will more than likely catch you and 1 or 2 shot you. It basically comes down to who has more time to spend on the game. Additionally, many servers are overrun with large groups of friends who will kill only people they don't know. 

Community: 
I've spent most of my time on offiicial, and the community is toxic. This was a SUPER long time ago, but there was a time where I was trying to grow a mosa with very large other mosas on the server. I got stuck in a cave, and requested a teleport from the admin. The admin teleported me to him, and he was on top of a mountain with a lake that had a tunnel system. I didn't know how to get out, but luckily his mosa friend got on and was gonna help me out. The mosa friend grabs me and just plays with me for awhile, before telling his other friend I was there. The other friend, who is also friends with the admin, gets on and immediately kills me. The dude wouldn't even apologize. That's how awful this community is. The admin regrew me, but there was no revive system at the time so my inherited traits were different (Like actually just bad.) Also again, couldn't even get the dude to apologize. A grown ass man, mind you. So yeah, thats the official community. I haven't tried too many unofficial servers because the creatures on them are usually even bigger than official, so you die the same amount. The people on unofficial are usually more kind, but the gameplay experience doesn't really change. It's still just a competition of ""who can spend more time."" Also, there's a lot of rage whenever you kill someone else usually, people babyrage in global CONSTANTLY. Also, getting T-bagged when you die to someone double your speed and size is never out of the question. Happened to me earlier.

Balance: Nonexistent, just look up videos of mosas on youtube. It is ridiculous how powerful you can get in this game by being unemployed and just sitting at your desk all day. It's not like one creature is the issue, anything is terrifying once it hits a certain size. It took me around 10 hours for me to get my lurdu to 2.0, and that's without ever dying, and I still only ran into creatures that were much, much bigger than me. 

Development: 
The development is incredibly slow, I bought the game upon release, there were around 7 playables. As of today, there are 16 playables. There were around a total of 9 playables and 2 maps released over 6 years of development. They've added natural disasters as well. Very few patches are made for quality control. 

Price: 
There aren't many other dinosaur games like this out there, so it's hard to get a great idea of what it ""should"" be. Its a small team, so they probably need all the money they can get. It certainly doesn't feel like the money went back into the game though. It is cheaper than path of titans, but the same as the isle. If you want a dinosaur game, and you only have 20 bucks, I'd get the isle. If you got 30, its a tossup, both are great games, and both are much better than this for a similar price. 

Final Thoughts: 
Beasts of Bermuda is a time sink. If you just wanna mindlessly stare at a dinosaur at a computer screen and watch a number get bigger, it's the perfect game for you. If you want actually quality gameplay with balancing and some fun to be had, play an unoffical Path of Titans server, or The Isle. They're just better in nearly every way, the only difference being Path of Titans is more expensive. The communities for all these games is pretty much shared, but I have to say, Beasts of Bermuda really attracts the worst of em.",1690532792,1690532792,False,9,1,0.565217375755310059,1,True,False,True

july 2023: their is a running theme here Titains map STILL crashes my computer completely. im sorry but this is unexpectable this point ive changed my review from recommenced to not recommended. this needs to be fixed and this update did not. i've tried uninstalling reinstalling lowering all my graphics to lowest possible and yet it crashes my computer still. i can run red dead redemption 2 with high graphics no problem yet this specific map on this game does doesn't work and i would say its majorly less impressive graphically that rdr2 . i managed to play on it when the map first released but after the first game play i was never able to access it again without completely crashing my computer. i hope you fix it because the mapped looked really cool and i want to be able to access the new map but being deadlocked behind just the old maps it's not fun. if this wasn't such an issue that has yet to fixed or you guy claim to be fixed but never actually fix it then i wouldn't be talking so negatively because if optimised better this game would be incredibly fun.

16th june 2023: still runs like @ss the titina map doesn't even load and crashes during loading every time. and not only that im not the only person who has this issue. why is it so poorly optimised even when i set it on its lowest settings.my computer can run things like red dead 2 with no problem yes it has a genuine fit just tryna run this game. this game is really fun but its bad graphics with bad running. i dont mind lower graphics but if the game still decides its gonna die even with teh lowest settings then theirs no point. its a fun game but you need a good comp to run it apparently 

review at 5 Nov, 2021:i originally gave this game a bad review but after a few updates its much more fun and it works much more than it did before although i still do have problems dispite the lower graphics for a game in this genre it take a lot of my computers power i still don't know why. but despite this i have loads of fun playing this game no matter how goofy the thing looks. i would still recommend other games of this genre but if you are looking to be social and a more welcoming community then this the game for you.

Yet the game always gets quality updates, bug fixes, and additions. Note the Developer team is small. If you like Dinosaurs, give the game a try. I'm sure you'll like it. 

Here are some things about the game: 
You grow and grow and servers have the option to quite literally make it infinite growth. There are 2 types of main Gameplay loops, which would be Life Cycle, and Free Roam. Life Cycle you grow really fast, but you get more hungry the bigger you get. In Free Roam, you grow slower, but the community servers running this mode tend to be ""Auto-revive"" so you never lose your progress. You max your talents above 10.0 growth on Life Cycle, and around 5.0 growth on Free Roam. 

There's usually at least 1 server that's setup to be an entire deathmatch, so you can just fight and fight with no penalties. This is a good way to practice playing creatures that're in the game. 

The new map Titania is very large, even considering it's about only half done. You can go up to 2 hours without finding a player. That can be either a good or bad thing depending on your playstyle. 

If you love limited cosmetics, the earlier you get invested in this game the better, they hold limited cosmetic events 1-2 times a year. PS: They glow. But a glowing skin isn't limited to just the cosmetic skins, players can obtain a ""Bio"" layer in their skins if they're lucky enough, which glow. The game has an in-depth skin customization/inherit system, and has in-fact been improved since the latest update of writing this review. 

Having babies/offspring is a big aspect in this game, because your offspring can inherit talents the mother/father have invested into, which is completely RNG. Players can also give birth to incest Dinosaurs, some of which have a special model morph for them, which look goofy. Incest Dinosaurs usually get the opposite effect of getting inherits, they get negatives. 

This game has tons of content inside of it that doesn't meet the eye, tons more from what I've even mentioned. PvP is also super complex and diverse that you won't ever become perfect at it, something will always catch you off-guard. Prepare for getting good at this game, unlike other games like ""The isle"" where all PvP is just static and repetitive.

THE ONLY DOWNSIDE, is that almost half of the community hack, and keep coming back. However currently after the latest update, it has been temporarily patched. Obviously the Developers are aware of this issue and look for ways to solve these issues. My only suggestion to them would be to start hardware banning, and upgrading their Anti-Cheat. But that costs money, so help them out and give the game a try.

I have gone through phases of my life where I've poured my heart and soul into growing a dinosaur, while enjoying the vibrant and luscious environments, atmosphere rich biomes and locations while migrating for hours with the people that surround me.

I feel like Beasts of Bermuda is a game that you have to set aside a day for. It's a full on experience more than a game. I adore palaeontology and this is truly something to behold if you share my passion.
I would play this game any day over The Isle or similar MMO RPG dinosaur survival games. But i might be biased as this is one of the dinosaur games that i have had the pleasure to watch grow and develop in real time.

That being said the game is extremely addictive, The whole premise is growing a dinosaur. You start out as an egg or a juvenile and slowly grow into a massive, supersized elder that can take out armies with a clap of your tail or a swipe of your claws. This is a game that people and myself included can easily spend hundreds of hours on, for some people hundreds of hours on one dinosaur.
This has created an extremely toxic and vicious playerbase. i know its pretty common for a massive multiplayer game to have a pretty toxic or unwelcoming fandom. But Bests of Bermuda really takes the cake for the most awful people i have ever met while gaming. 
The game play loop creates a hostile forest environment full of giant monsters that are ready to kill you at any opportunity just to take out any competition. Everyone is terrified of losing their giant dinosaur that they have sunk hours into. This is doubled with the fact that the larger you are the more food you need to consume. Predators are killing anything, Herbivores in clans are ripping up entire sections of the map.
There are elitist groups of players that refuse to let any outsiders join them, their entire purposes are to exclude you and kill you before you gain the opportunity to infiltrate their growing lands.

It is impossible to make any kind of decent progress unless you are in a massive pack of self feeding dinosaurs with huge niches carved out. And even then there is every opportunity that they will hit their pack limit and kick you out, possibly killing you just to be safe.

I've also forgotten to mention the hackers, this game has a real problem with people exploiting it. Super fast dinosaurs and people that can one shot you are uncommon to find but fill the map, you never know when you're just going to lose your dinosaur unfairly.
The staff are also usually speaking to their mates to do anything about it. I've been in servers where several people were reporting someone for being outside bounds and the moderators were too busy telling someone to stop talking in all caps or straight up having a casual conversation with another player in global chat.

But i'd like to end this review by reminding you that this game is a magical experience when played with the right people, if you're reading this to know whether you should buy the game or not, I'm saying find a quiet server and just enjoy yourself. Remember that you're only playing a game, and not to get too attached to your dinosaurs. Remember that dying is a part of the game, and that KOSsing is just a social construct and the people who complain about it shouldn't be playing a survival game. ;)

I neither recommend or unrecommend BOB, i just have too complicated feelings for it. Steam wont let me post a review so i defaulted to recommend, even if in reality i'm probably more leaning towards unrecommend.",1688826678,1688826678,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Most servers have auto revive enabled which is one of the worst settings in a game with unlimited growth this means that you will be fighting people who can litterally just leave their computer on and their dino keeps growing until they starve but then they auto revive and just keep growing. Came back to this game after about a year long hiatus and its still as unbalanced as ever with all of the same problems its had for years now. Giant apocalyptic size dinos rule every server you go on and act as litteral whales who feast on new players. Growth times are also so dramatically increased that its now become common to see dinos that are pushing that 3-4.0x Growth. The game has a perfectly functioning revive mechanic thats actually balanced but it requires the player to work towards their revive and reduces their growth upon being revived. This system is rendered null and void by auto revive on death which means every server that has that setting will have people whaling out their time to become Gods in the game. At this point I could not recomend PVP servers to anyone wanting to play this game unless you to intend on just becoming a bloated abomination of a dino. There is no more skill left in this husk of a game its just who can grow the bigger dino by spending more of their time on the game and obtaining larger and larger amounts of stats to seal club the next player they see with. You can look up plenty of youtube kill compilations where giant dinos just facetank other dinos even in unfavorable matchups. The balance is gone the game is broken the only way to enjoy the game is to now whale out your time or play on a chill server and just remove the PVP completely because its ultimately all meaningless. The devs seem to have decided that infinite growth now no longer requires any effort on the players part because through the auto revive system a player can litterally just leave their computer on and afk in game for as long as they want to continue growing to even greater heights. If you have not already started growing your dino there is no hope for you for you are already an ant Titans walk the land and they have blowholes and very mean clubs with which they plan to bludgeon you with repeatedly until you learn your lesson. The fact that their are dinos that currently exist on PVP servers that are well over 6x the growth of the ""adult"" dino in this game is sadly to common for the casual dino enjoyer who does not have the time to shill out their life on a game they just want to play and be a dino in. Go buy better games that allow you to play without having to overcome someone who has spent thousands of hours on one dino become monstrous stat block that is effectively immortal because even if it dies it will live again and only grow larger.",1583873439,1686667450,False,0,0,0,8,True,False,True

A lot of Beasts of Bermuda is trial and error, learning how to play dinosaurs and discovering which talent tree suits you the most. You will definitely die a lot, in the start, but when you get to know the game, the experience is always worth it. I cannot explain to you the joy of being a pteranodon and getting sucked into a tornado. There are also a variety of play styles- personally, I prefer realism servers. It brings it close to The Isle in rules and real-life accurate gameplay, but it's so much more interesting with BoB's dynamic environment. It's definitely going to be boring if you join a server with no expectations and just try to wing it, but if you join a realism or semi-realism server's discord you can join groups and follow events like migration and seasonal changes.

The main point of this review is to let you know that, from my experience, it's better to play casual. Hop on when exciting stuff is happening, have fun with friends, and don't get sore over getting killed. If you treat it as seriously as you'd treat The Isle, the game is definitely more exhausting. Play for the beautiful map, the amazing dinosaurs, and hang out with other players.

I swear I was incredibly hyped for trying this game. After I had discovered the Isle, I was amazed that the whole dino survival genre is a thing, yet the game felt like something more entertaining to watch rather than play. Than I discovered Path of Titans, played it a bit on my phone, but the growth system put me off. Finally, I discovered BoB and fell in love with the promise of extreme weather conditions, wild fires, infinite growth, the talent trees, abilities unique for each Dino and even the graphics.

*What I like about BoB*

Indeed, the game has some interesting mechanics - I think the shelter mechanic is amazing and it gives a reason to actually seek shelter, the weather system and wildfires are cool (although they happen rarely, escaping the fire was the collest thing that happened to me while playing), freedom when it comes to colouring your dino, the map can sometimes be really pretty and there are moments like hiding in a bush from a pack of T-rexes and taking advantage of the perfectly blending colour scheme you adjusted 10 minutes ago, or simply joining a herd and exploring the map.

*What I don't like about BoB*

- General boredom and herbivore gameplay

However, my worries about the Isle being funnier to watch than play sadly applied to my BoB experience. The biggest sin of this game is that it is simply incredibly boring, and I mean: INCREDIBLY boring. Especially as a herbivore. You are randomly roaming this enormous map (with no minimap), and honestly I don't know how big you must grow to start worrying about drinking and eating. While playing on a life cycle server with X2 growth I was told that it becomes a challange after reaching 4.5 growth which takes 15 HOURS. The survival aspect is boring, it is not a tense experience you would expect but rather a dragging, patient anticipation for something interesting to finally happen. I've played the game for 10 hours but it feels like the meaningful gameplay can be narrowed into 30 minutes. It is 80% boredom 10% getting killed by a dino you don't even recognise with bigger growth and better stats, 5% being excited about joining a herd (and getting bored later), 5% something actually` exciting. 

- Carnivore gameplay, fighting system, sometimes movement

Maybe playing as a carnivore is better? Well, the survival part is a bit more exciting as it is harder to obtain food and the coordinated ambushes seem like a lot of fun. However, the game has two fundamental problems which ruin this experience, the first one being: Fighting against other dinos. It is TERRIBLE, it is not exciting at all, not strategic at all, often laggy and you never know wheter you are doing any significant damage. Also, you never feel truly PvP ready due to the infinite growth mechanic. The second problem is movement. It is not that bad, but it can feel really clumsy at times, especially when you try to jump. I literally spent 3 minutes trying to jump over a tiny slope. Imagine when such things happen when you run away from a carnivore or you try to catch a prey. It works fine most of the time, but at the same time it can be really weird when you, for instance, attempt to climb a rock. Ultimately, fighting is an unexciting chore in BoB and dino's movement can be clumsy and awkward, although it works fine most of the time. 

- Empty official servers, only private servers are playable

So what do you do in this game? If survival is boring and fighting is simply bad? You are dying of boredom. Furthermore, the official servers are dead so what is left are private servers where you can fight a decent numer of players yet you have to worry about numerous rules written in server's discord channel. And these rules are often detailed, not only ""herbis cannot group with predators"". This is the only way to play the game. It is just annoying and playing feels like a tiring roleplay rather than a computer game where your gameplay is constrained only by the ingame mechanics. 

- Steep learning curve and lack of access to knowledge about the game

And my last argument: learning the game is awful. The game is not ultra hard, but the access to any knowledge about its mechanics/ content is so scarce it is laughable. It makes player's initial experiences simply tiring. You don't know what dinos are a threat, what dinos can you fight against, who will oneshot you, what is the level of growth of your enemies. It just feels like a boring guessing game where you learn by trial and error, and remember that your wrong decisions can cost you hours of growth. Sometimes you just die so quickly you learn nothing. And sometimes you die as you are ran down by a bigger and faster dino.

*Vertict*

the game is playable and it has some highlights, but ultimately it is just boring. This is the feeling I felt throughout my BoB experience. Prepare for aimless roaming rather than intense struggle for survival in an unfriendly environment. Even when you join a herd chatting with ppl is literally more captivating than the actual gameplay. Fighting is uninspired and clumsy, movement can be awkward, its hard to learn how to play the game, global servers are dead so you must play on private ones constrained by a list of custom rules which make the game feel like a roleplay. 

I was really looking forward to playing this game but now I can admit it is a massive bait. The feeling of the game is just super off and I really doubt whether the small dev team will manage to improve it. I cannot recommend the game for the time being.

[EDIT after 10 more hours of playing (22 in general)]
When you grow bigger it becomes slightly more enjoyable as it is more important to seek food/ water and it feels that you are playing an actual computer game. Yet it takes so long and these early hours of growth feel so tedious I am not really looking forward to playing the game any longer. Even though I'd like to test more dinos, the fact that I must sacrifice so many hours to grow them if I want to have a more enjoyable experience discourages me entirely.",1685470786,1685781991,False,35,0,0.776858031749725342,3,True,False,True

Now with the recent update (1/27/23) The game isn't even a survival game anymore. Its a feed and grow simulator now. 5.5k hours in this game and 4 years in this game. I even found my husband in this game. And I can not recommend this game anymore. I can not play this game anymore. It used to be my favorite game. Now, it is trash. It isn't even worth the money.

Before Titania came out the game was worth while, you would work on your creature and survival was just that, SURVIVAL.  When you died you died. Yes you lost your good dinos. But thats the game, you came back stronger, and you learned from your mistakes. You would get nested in, get good nested dinos and grow them and love them until they died. And then when they died, you would move onto another dino or you would rage quit for a month then come back when you got bored (lol).

Now, you have Resurrection, and Reincarnation, both of which make it so that you have endless options to keep your dinos forever.

Then, Titania came out, Now nesting is no longer possible, and is useless, and you have gauntlet and you grow so fast that you get to 4.0 growth in less than 24 hours! Making it hard to grow. There are 4.0+ monsters roaming the map killing everything so easily.

Now, with this update, they have given the dinos a super power to control the weather, every 2 hours, your immune to weather, and you auto resurrect upon death, when you pledge to shrines you get specific OP buffs that that are game breaking. 

The game has gone continually down hill. And it has lost many players. It continues to lose many players. I give up on this game. Until it improves I am uninstalling it.


Edit: The game continues to be unbalanced and after the PT update the Devs have completely ruined this game. I am removing this game from my steam account. PTs continue to reek havoc on servers and 2.0s can kill 5.0 apas with 5 thick hide. Doing 580 damage a hit. Apex damage. Elasmos can kill big kronos within seconds.

Edit: The community is incredibly Toxic aswell, all the way up, Devs can be pretty shitty sometimes, and Forget about 90% of server owners, They WILL WITCHHUNT you outside of the game and discord looking for ANYTHING to ban you for from this KIDS Dinosaur game, it's incredible to watch friends get banned from servers for a piece of harmless art on the server discord that existed on the discord for less than an hour and get banned permanently for a completely UNGAMERELATED offence on a different server. There is no peace in this game, what so ever.
Let me explain: most servers are “Chill” servers, glorified chat rooms where you can grow to huge sizes while NOT playing the game. You can  turn on the game and go do anything else and you’ll get to size 5.3 in no time and then do nothing because it’s just an avatar in your chat room really. 
They tried to fix this with the “gauntlet” where you grow faster  getting to a decent size in one setting and the game is harder but most servers don’t use it at all because once you get to big it’s hard to feed and you die of starvation(kinda the point) And by the time they dropped that update most servers where “chill” servers. Normally the growth rate is painfully slow even on 2x to 3x servers. Where you invest 48 hours in a week to get to 2.0 and then get bored because at that size nothing want to take its chances with something that big and die themselves. If that’s not bad enough, the servers that do actually have any kind of game play have AutoRevives enabled, so when your 2.0 monster dies you didn’t loose anything and no risk or reward is given Dispite the devs giving us the reincarnation and resurrection mechanics no one uses, where for just a little bit of Work playing the game and growing Dino’s to sacrifice you could actually get the dead Dino back at a small grow penalty or just reincarnate so you can get inheritance based on your current talents 
The skin system is fundamentally broken,  you can spawn off an egg and just not have any control of what you look like, not because of your genes but because a whole section of your pattern just doesn’t work at all if it’s even there, some skins are so complex 95% of eggs hatched out of a pairing will just have to renest or reskin because their skin is busted. Not to mention half the skins in the game aren’t even available to the public all personal patterns for the skin makers and backers who wanted this shit show before it got to steam.
And I haven’t even gotten started on the ‘Rare’ bioluminescence, most any server you go to is going to be flooded with this ‘rare’ trait.
The community is toxic nowadays, hardly worth the bother on most places, you kill somebody and you get death threats on your DMs and/or are targeted because someone lost their huge big Dino and didn’t get their way after a frivolous report.

There are many positives, and they certainly (mostly) out-weigh the negatives, but that's what a review is for.

*THE POSITIVES*
-The development team is easily the kindest and most professional of the entirety of the Dinosaur Survival game mini-genre, being genuinely enjoyable to hold conversation with.
-While not perfect, this game has some of the best balance I've seen in the genre, with nothing truly being considered bad. Everything is well balanced, save for a few problem playables.
-Every playable has a reason to play it, with the fact that every playable has something unique, or a stat so vastly superior to something else that it makes it unique. Acrocanthosaurus' intimidating call, Saichania's damage reflection, and Tyrannosaurus' devastating ambush are great examples of this.
-There are very few game breaking bugs present, most bugs that would be game breaking have ways to circumvent them if said bugs aren't fixable that are built into the game.
-A game-play loop is present, encouraging active play and PvP.
-There are many goals the player can set for themselves past growing as large as possible. Nesting, hunt-point scores, and trials are all great examples of what I mean.
-The most recent map added, Titania, has a vast amount of biomes and points of interest, encouraging exploration.

All is not perfect with this game though.

*THE NEGATIVES*
-While balance is good for the most part, the problem playables mentioned above are often so over-tuned that counter-play is nearly nonexistent.
-The community is the primary negative with this game. The community of this game are some of the most horrible people I've had the displeasure of meeting online. The community is s bad that they actively discourage the addition of mechanics that make for a healthy game, many good decisions have been removed or replaced with worse versions of themselves due to the community going hog wild in the official discord. Some community members go as far as to send death threats and hate messages directly to the developers when a mechanic is changed that doesn't cater to them specifically.
-Performance is a major issue, with Beasts of Bermuda not seeming heavily taxing on a system, but is actually shockingly difficult to manage if you're not running a powerful set-up.

Overall, the negatives are certainly something to watch out for, but even with their existence, I would still call Beasts of Bermuda, at least for now on 5/12/2023, the best dinosaur survival game on the market.",1683924714,1683924714,True,1,0,0.492307692766189575,0,True,False,True

Instead, you have completely dead official servers and have to resort to private servers. The private servers, unfortunately, make up the most toxic community of players since League of Legends.

I think the worst thing about this game is that everyone just wants to be a dinosaur. What you get instead is a bunch of angsty, whiny, petty, power tripping admins. And that's not limited to the private servers - it's the same thing in the BoB official community. It's a gaming community that is run by a bunch of nasty, unpleasant people, that take more satisfaction ""getting you in trouble on discord"" than from actually playing the game. And that's what ruins this game - the entire structure of it enables petty personal squabbles instead of just straight gameplay. I never though being a dinosaur could be so dramatic, or with so many rules! It's rules, rules, rules, everywhere. The game doesn't self regulate at all. Administrators constantly over-police the chat, spending their entire days telling people what they can or can't say, what they can or can't do, while in most cases applying those rules unfairly to favor themselves and their friends. 

You actually have to record this game constantly if you want to have any sort of fun, because 90% of the time you'll die to what is considered a ""rule-break"". Then you have to go to the tribunal of narcissistic discord moderators to get your dinosaur ""revived"". 

I have 1554 hours on this game. This is a game that I want to love, but only leads to frustration and disappointed and the cycle ALWAYS repeats itself, it never fails. 

TL/DR: The game doesn't self regulate, so you are forced to engage with an incredibly toxic, and over-policed community. Unfair treatment and drama is completely unavoidable.

4/27/2023 Update: Jumped back in - the game is incredibly unbalanced. Pteranadons are a class you can play - they are capable of moving faster than your eyeball can track, doing as much damage as a Rex, go right through you (no collision), fly, and they come equipped with an extra life. They're punching way outside their weight class because no other class has talents to mitigate against their attacks. Pteranadons are flying around killing every other class in the game and the majority of them have absolutely no defense.",1647953295,1682598670,False,6,0,0.5,0,True,False,True

The overall balance and combat system in the game is so broken it feels borderline irreparable, which of course isn't true, but the devs aren't going to repair it, so may as well start there.

It doesn't really matter how much time or talent points you use in this game, because at the end of the day, the primary combat style is tailriding. Just don't get hit and you could kill literally God by eating ass. Of course this isn't true for all of the dinos, but for at least 70% of matchups in this game, that is the case. You could spend hours growing a rex, and lose it to a Velo which someone maybe used 30 minutes growing.

I do like how mechanically complex this game is, but a lot of it genuinely makes me wanna throw a baby out the window. This game is micromanagement simulator to a T. The primary reason why this game takes so much effort to like, is due to how unbalanced and crappy the combat system is, I feel like if the combat system wasn't so bad the game would definitely be more enjoyable. Not to mention some of the mechanics, especially the diet system, feel like they were just injected into the game because the other ""Big Two"" implemented something similar to it.

**********************************************************

I'll come back to this review to explain just a bit, and express how bad this game really is. Quite a few people are finding the one sentence review above helpful, so here's the main issues. I've also noticed this review is no longer find-able at all on the store page, for some reason.. So again!

The average time to grow in this game is fairly long, depending on the species of course. From what I understand, there is NO max size, you just grow exponentially slower as you age (really after hitting adult at around 1.2). While an amazing concept that can produce astonishingly large players, you'd be new to gaming if you don't see the eventual problem this causes.  

On top of that, add on the broken balance of the species. Carnivores, specifically (should add some of this can be debated, opinions vary) Acros and Mosas. The real issue with general balance is that herbivores are practically defenseless. If you want to play a herbi, you basically have a death wish in this, which is unfortunate they alienated that player-base so much. 

On top of that, clan warfare is very prevalent in this game, as you can gather from other reviews probably. I wont even try to explain it beyond the obvious, humans can be shitty on the internet. The artificial way they try to get around this is official servers vs community servers (BoB admins still oversight). Most servers are free for all graveyards, so the community/private servers come up with (typically really complicated and long) lists of rules players have to abide by or get into trouble. Feels like a child infested Garry's Mod server to be honest.

I will say, playing and growing as the dino does have appeal! There is satisfaction in this, I have had fun in this game. Playing as a birb is really, really fun when you aren't dying to another one in two hits. Flying around, and even to me, swimming around is fun and has plenty of eye candy.

All this sums up to waiting around for many, MANY hours doing practically nothing, and then a larger carnivore finally finds you and kills you easily. There are well polished mechanics, and then there's the rest of this garbage that probably will never change.",1619211221,1681967352,False,35,0,0.676828742027282715,0,True,False,True

All of this stuff about the game is amazing and its what used to draw me to this game and still does, but i can't find myself getting any enjoyment out of playing this game anymore since i began to notice how increasingly toxic the communities in all the servers are, there's always passive aggression and it always feels like that everyone in the game thinks they are better than every other person there. Everyone takes the game way too seriously and it starts to not really feel like that i'm playing a simple all-in-good-fun game anymore with the hostility involved.

This ^ is mainly the issue that prevents me from wanting anything more to do with the game, the gameplay on it's own is an amazing concept and even as an early access game it already shows potential to be a very amazing game but this kind of community isn't gonna do the game any favors. It's not really easy to find a decent group of people you can chill with either because they also have this same kind of behavior and generally people are always in more tight-knit groups that rarely socialize with outsiders but maybe that's just a me thing, i dunno. Imo it's probably better to play with people you know but then again maybe it's probably way better to just not play at all.

The older i got the more i realized this game is actually really bad after the several times i've tried to engage in the game i ended up not having a good time anymore and i've decided this game isn't worth my time so figured i'd say my piece on this game before uninstalling it. 

(Also because the updates it keeps consistently coming out with are fucking huge and taking up a bunch of unnecessary storage on my PC. It makes it harder for me to tolerate having it.)

If you're fine with passive aggression and people losing their shit at you over a silly dinosaur game regularly then this is the game for you but personally i don't recommend it in the slightest.

Tl;dr ::
-- This game is a lot of fun, and I highly recommend checking it out. The dinos feel great to run around on, nesting is a blast, combat can be fun, etc. Trust me, you want this game. Reject humanity, become dino. 

First, the Elephant in the room::
-- Yes, this game is in Early Access. It is not finished. It is utterly ridiculous to expect an early access game to come with all the bells and whistles of a full game. There are bugs, and imbalances that need to be fixed, and will be fixed as the devs continue to work on the game. Progress is on-going. This isn't like that one dino game I won't mention by name. The devs actually care about this one. 
-- Toxicity in the Community. It's a problem, but the same could be said for every single PvP game out there. That's just the nature of PvP in official servers, for every. single. game. I have ever played.

Why I LOVE this game::
-- As a disclaimer, I tend to play on community servers. Mostly ""Realism"" servers that have rules, and passwords, so toxicity is at a minimum, and is usually quickly dealt with by the mods. I tailor my experience that minimizes the level of BS I experience. 
-- Overall gameplay is fun, and satisfying. Yes, it can be a loop. Eat, drink, travel to the new area, eat and drink some more. There are also shrines you can go to to get blessings to help you grow, or make it easier to resurrect your dino when they die, or help in raising babies. 
-- Nesting/Babies are so fun. Not just having the nest yourself, but being the baby. You inherit stats from your parents, including the skins they have. It can make for some really cool looking dinosaurs, and you can get SUPER BEEFED if you're lucky xD There's also the rare chance you can get a bioluminescent skin by hatching out of an egg [or reincarnating!] which is super stellar. Albinism is also something you can get, which is pretty neat, but is also one of those things the devs need to work on. I've gotten some nasty, pastel rainbow-vomit ""albinos"" that uh... Well, they have to be sacrificed to the Dino-gods. 
-- Combat/Dueling can be a lot of fun, but depending on lag, and other factors, it can feel unfair and brutal. I'd say there's also a learning curve. You can just log in for the first time, dump all your stats in combat, and spam-click your way to victory. It takes actual strategy sometimes. [Combat is the main reason I avoid official servers on most dinos. I only play fliers or velo so I can run/hide.] 

My biggest ""beef"" with ""the dev team"" [I put in quotes because there's likely a reason, we just don't know it] is the neglect given to Velos. They have 3.... like, 2 and half calls, out of the 5 you're supposed to have and their feather textures could use a little tlc. They're a little too bright, and their friendly call takes forever to actually play. The 3 call [aggressive] sounds weak, and the submissive and alert calls just straight up don't exist. 

My second biggest beef is the ""nest raider"" talent. It's ONLY good for snatching eggs. Kidnapping babies is pointless and done only to grief and spite other players. Babies don't drop gore/food, nor do they have any hunt points. Killing them is pointless. And I get why. People are rude. But I think we should change nest raider/baby snatcher into something else entirely, or allow nested offspring to actually drop gore. Because in my opinion, it just encourages toxicity. I KNOW that's not the dev's intention, but it IS something that needs to be brought to their attention. 

Summary:: 
-- Although still in early access with all its flaws, I still have 1500+ hours and will continue to play until the internet dies. Thanks for coming to my tedtalk. 

Seriously. It's worth supporting the game. At full price, too. xD I'm about to buy it a second time if I can find the money for it. [disabled and unemployed, so it'll be a min ;-;] 
The devs are pretty good with communication on projects, they actively listen to player feedback. Which is rare, in games like this. 
Do it. Buy the game. This is peer pressure. Do it. [If you can safely, financially afford to do so!]",1681679064,1681679064,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Originally my review did not recommend this game, this was based on a Patch they dropped around Oct/Nov 2022 which nerfed so much functionality of the game. Private servers were nerfed, a lot of commands removed for Admins and map nerfs - but mostly. Chill servers received the harshest punishment for the game style they had chosem. It was horrific and I wont apologise for that original review, as the patch completely turned me off from the game and I lost a lot of appeal.

However.

A month or so (?) after this. I believe due to sheer volume of players feeling the same way, they reversed some of their big changes. This brought appeal for me back and I began playing again. Some things were still not right but the majority of changes they un-did started to change my faith in the developers that they were listening.

Fast forward to April and by far my favourite patch since the huge QoL one they did in December 2021. The Ptera model is *chefs kiss*, a lot of re-balances have been made which was long overdue (Mosa nerf, Elasmo buff for example) and Ptera balance changes were well needed. The developers have really really got it right this time and my love for the game has come back.

The seasonal skin they dropped is beauitful, but the fact they have allowed it to be unlocked in all server types this time has 100% been the right decision. So many people have been to unlock it and the fact it can now be used in Free Roam is amazing. I can see some changes to Life Cycle server which, may mean as a chill server we can move back to Life Cycle in the future, dependant on other frunctionalities.

All in all, it has made the game desirable again - what I fell in love with originally in Summer 2021 is here again.

-Nice customization for the dinosaurs. You choose the skin you prefer and change the color for what you like. And if you prefer nice and ""natural"" color? you just need to go in the setting and disabled the ""flashy colors"" .

- Very interesting talent tree. You can build your dinosaur like you want. 

- The gameplay is really less boring than The Isles. You need to keep an eye on the ""comfort"" of you dinosaur if you want to live and growth faster. Eat good food and balance your diet to have a bonus and drink fresh water. You cannot just sit and wait to growth in this game: The water source can drain out completely or your dinosaur will start to be ""bored"" and won't be satisfied anymore. So you need to move. 

- Another great thing about beast of bermuda is that the environnement is really ""alive"". Tornado, storm, fire and even flood will change how you'll play. You just CAN'T stay in a bush and wait to grow. It's really nice to see players on the map react to these element and try to survive. Sometimes it can be chaotic and carnivore will thrive during theses even, sometimes the combat stop and everyone just try their best to stay alive 

- The game is really well optimizated and absolutely beautiful! Less laggy than on The Isles Evrima or Path of titans in the time I write thesea words .

I had hopes for it, but as far as it is, its just not worth it. I know it's in early access and all, and it's nice they do updates for the game, unfortunately... None of the updates seem to actually help performance issues that this game is struggling with. Personally. i can only play as aquatics unless I want the experience to be a lagfest, which it is as either flyer or terrestial animal.

And changing up the graphics does not fix it. Which is weird, my pc should be able to run this without that much issues, considering that it's able to run other high graphic games and what not without problems, but BoB is nothing but problems on the perfomance front which is kinda sad.

But until they fix the issues that are causing it, because yes, at this point it must be something within the game itself and its perfomance that is the issue and absolutely NOT my pc. So yeah, again. Unless the perfomance issues are fixed, this game isn't recommended. It's just not enjoyable when everything lags and seemingly a lot of people play terrestial animals so playing as an aquatic gets boring cause you will literally be alone in the ocean.",1679515919,1679515919,False,12,0,0.58022463321685791,0,True,False,True

80% of the players are members of the LGBT community and very flippant towards people who are not. Especially the larger servers are affected by this.

It's actually a solid game that is very time consuming. Before the last huge Update there was no possibility to bring your dinos back to life. You usually wasted hours, days, weeks growing a dino for nothing because in the end he died and had to be deleted.
Playing in the game without a fixed group makes no sense. So if you don't have any friends, you have to find some nice people playing this - and this is not easy! 

Nevertheless, it takes a relatively long time to grow up. People who don't live in the main time zone can grow their dinos without any other enemies and dominate the map on weekends.

Pointless rules like dead body and pond claiming spoil the fun of the game. There are way too many rules to follow on almost any server. If you even scratch a rule, you will be directly beaten up by the admins. If anyone of their friends does, guess what? Nothing happens.

In this game you have to record absolutely every second, because none of the admins on the servers know how to read logs properly. If you don't have video evidence, you will get accused of scam.

All in all a purchase I regret, even if I had my fun with it. I won't be touching this game again anytime soon.
But once you notice that, you wasted 80+ hours on the game and you can't refund.


Edit February 2022: after playing another 40ish hours:
Game hasn't changed at all. Full of toxic, weird people. It's still nothing but an AFK sim. Nothing to do, people will randomly attack you before trying to interact and the ""Devs"" of this game are just not capable of doing a real game.

Edit November 2022: a lot of things in this game has been changed for the better, especially growth time has been decreased by far. I still don’t get how people spent 300+ hours of AFKing on a single dinosaur, it‘s way easier and more like a game than being an AFK simulator now. However, the “Pride“ community didn‘t really change, still butthurt for everything. Servers, their rules and the communities are still a mess and the devs of the game are ruining the game currently.

This game could be so much, it could be way better if mods, AI and custom settings were a thing. Will never happen. I‘m working on my own game right now. Similar to this one but with other animals and the possibility to add and change everything you want.

Devs going back on their decision to change direction of the game to stop auto-revive servers dominating the population and killing regular survival servers to the point survival servers completely died out. Auto-revive was originally added for admins to do events like purge, however server admins abused auto-revive into a game mode which the devs didn't intend the game to have. Devs stating they will remove auto-revives regardless of how players feel and change the direction of the game to their vision caused pro auto-revive players and non auto-revive  players to fight over the game modes in official discord and in game, just to return to auto-revive server domination in a survival game. Causing discord between players for no reason. Nearly 5K hours and I would have recommend the game for the first 4 years, this last year has destroyed the game. This last patch Titania was suppose to change the direction of the game to bring life back into it by changing the end game loop and forcing new maps and updates to have to play survival with a life cycle vs auto-revive always staying the same size and never losing your Dinos. Instead, it reverted back to the stale game it had become with a lousy end game loop and left the other half of the player base frustrated with the game, that had finally gotten back to the way it had originally been for four years. Sad day for BoB, the future of this game is absolutely uncertain at this point. I'd advise [u]NOT[/u] to buy until things settle down and to see if the game reverts back to 100% auto-revive servers with zero survival servers left.",1668757228,1677620279,False,7,2,0.513928115367889404,0,True,False,True

The game has steadily gone on a downward spiral for about 2-3 years now. Which is mostly due  in part to the Developers continually making balance changes that we're in no way equal. 

Some creatures (Acro, Coah, Rex, Mosa, etc) aren't ever meaningfully nerfed, they'll get a lovetap in terms of tuning down some non-important part. But overall still much better than most of the roster. 

Other Creatures (Para, Apa, Ptera, Itchy, etc) have gotten nerf after nerf, making them kinda pointless to play. You're essentially growing a walking meat snack, that is going to die no matter how you play. 

The Devs have no clue on how to balance the game anymore. All these pointless additions (Shrines, Trials, Resurrect, Reincarnate) have done nothing but cause headaches. Poor implementation, and totally unasked for. Factor in how there really isn't anything to do in the game besides fight or interact with other people. 

Of course sharing any of this insight will get you banned and silenced. Because the Devs have a direction for the game and do not want to hear any nay sayers. Aside from their staff they pay, when one of them gets screwed over in game by one of their balance fallacies. Oh man, better get that changed right away. 

Bob has always been poorly optimized, since the first time I played it's never run smoothly and has your comp running a marathon. This game has been out since 2018 (Forever right?!), and still hasn't been even half way optimized. The Titiania map has made the issue even worse, lag all about, textures bugging out, falling through the map. 

Toxicity has been rampantly out of control since launch. People can say the worst things you could ever hear, yet most of them won't get as much as a talking to. Whether Official or Private servers, if the Devs or Admins like you, you can get away with murder. Bullying, making others feel like S'hite, racist slurs, overall childish demeanors. Global chat is a cesspool one shouldn't have to be exposed too, similar to Overwatch's. (I know you can turn it off)

Un'til there is meaningful reforms in balance and game direction. I won't be returning whatsoever. The last update with that blanket skin that is server specific and the current idiotic map, did me in. Which is a pity, I used to have so much fun playing. 

Now, I have no interest at all. I suppose it could be chalked up to things constantly being changed when there really wasn't any reason. The Apa for instance, why not just make a new Sauropod? Same thing for the Meg and Para, all that work to revamp them when other creatures could've been made. Or perhaps balance taken a little more seriously than how the map looks or Dinos look, aesthetic is nice and all but shouldn't be the main focus. 

Anyway, thanks for reading my semi rant. 🧡💜💙",1548633855,1677440387,False,0,0,0.541520535945892334,0,True,False,True

Game mechanics? Interesting. You get basic survival of Eating/drinking or you'll die in an hour of gameplay. Add some Tornados, fires, flooding, stressful rain, and that will be your pve mechanics. 

Pvp mechanics are not skill based. They're based on afk time. Your dinosaur will not stop growing, and only gets stronger with time. Nesting also makes your dinosaur stronger. Devs have backtracked on their mechanics by nerfing each aspect BECAUSE it's so abused. 6 friends growing together have a stronger advantage compared to a solo player. A 2.0 dino will almost always beat a 1.0 (Someone who afked for 100 hours has a stronger dino than someone that played for 40 minutes). A well nested dinosaur will do better than a counterpart at the size. Certain dinosaurs have been essentially made redundant because their niche is has been countered by ""updated stats"". Like a Velociraptor was intended to work as a pack to kill slow turning dinosaurs. They have no pack bonus. Most dinosaurs can pivot fast enough to hit the velos. Pterasaurs have been dwarfed by Tropes. Rexes still trump all in face tanks. Marines for some insane reason, travel 600 feet in the air. Don't expect realism from this game if that's your go-to. Nesting was a good idea, but the talents are so painfully required the devs decided to nerfed them so new players had a chance to grow (they still don't). A 3.0 raptor will do 350 damage to a 1.0 apa doing 150. That apa is bigger, and has more hp, but loses to ability and dexterity. The balance/ecology is lacking severely. 

The devs are losing people and are struggling deciding which audience they're trying to support to the point that AT THIS MOMENT, only had their official servers and 8 community servers with a population, divided between chill (no pvp) and normal pvp servers. New players are constantly destroyed by veterans. Every community server has rules because base gameplay isn't strong enough. 

And said this from day 1, Their graphics are vastly outdated. Their newest animations are a nice upgrade, but don't counter the ""plastic toys"" style.",1677288339,1677288339,False,34,1,0.744271278381347656,0,True,False,True

 +Graphics are okayish (sadly can't say the same about animations)
 +Many cool mechanics from comfort to giant floods that fill entire map, fires and such. None of existing dino games has so much stuff in it
 +Good variety of playable dinos
 +Map Editor that allows server owners to edit the maps (tho sadly that makes them even laggier)
  
And those are all the pluses. Now for the cons: 
-Extremely, extremely badly optimized. It was bad since the beginning but after the last big patch with a new map it's TERRIBLE. Now, don't get me wrong - I have a pretty good PC that can easily handle RDR2 on max settings with 60 fps. Beasts of Bermuda, however, takes literally all of my Memory and almost all of CPU even on the lowest settings! Especially this new map. I can't even imagine how could they ""achieve"" this. 
- Bugs everywhere. Trees growing in the air, dinos falling through the ground, getting stuck in animations and a lot (I mean really A LOT) UE crashes. 
-Devs literally spit on their community. Of course, blindly following your community is never good but god these devs ignore everything. Balance problems? They don't care until somebody from the staff team gets murdered several times by something broken. Furthermore, they don't even fully remember their game, literally FORGETTING about MAIN mechanics that are already in the game like they did with elasmo grabbing. Devs, sadly, think they know the best and, in the end, they are actually losing player base (on all charts you can see how much did active player amount decreased after last major update compared to what it was before. I get it, they are *indie* company and can't know everything about game design and such but, god, there are some things you have to learn instead of saying ""it's my game and I decide how do you play it"". 
- Overall community. Well, it's more of a game-type problem rather. Overall gameplay promotes agressive and toxic behavior. If you want lots of drama, insults and betrayals, this game is for you. 

 Well, what can I say. I have a lot of hours in this game and I am really sad to see what happened to it. I really wish devs actually studied and asked around on ""how to gamedesign"" and code rather than go all in thinking they know better than anybody.

.... this...game
is a huge let down - it IS quite hard to put into words...
all i want to know is WHY!? 
when the devs' said this was a game about FUN and even kept mentioning to people who wanted more realism that it was about fun NOT realism - then WHY with every update is the game getting more realistic?
when they said that it would include uncommon dinos ""except the rex because it's our favourite"" - alarms bells went off [as anyone from TI will tell you what happens when creatures get favoured by the devs; especially the rex] - but i believed in the devs promise of uncommon dinos and instead we got common pachy, para, rex, velo...
they said this game wasn't about realism but that was a lie as any unique features that looked fun [the velo's 'superjump', the icthy's & mosa's dart/leap got nerfed in distance] got removed [honestly, the sai's spike shield is the only 'fun' mechanic left - but i don't doubt that one day, that too will be replaced] [the ory's sand attack is more 'below the tail' making it useless, the apato's tail whip range etc]... - and yet as THIS is the direction their going why are there 3 piscivores that HAVE to eat meat when they should be fish ONLY?
why won't the devs' just come out and ADMIT that they really what their game to be carnivore only? - the carnivores out number the herbis [even more so now then before] and they've even made 2 herbis carnivores! SORRY 'omnivores', it doesn't make sense to do this!? [their even trying to put in 'measures/diets' to get people to move about more - but i've just spent the last 2 days camping the same small spot with no difficulty -.- ]
their small playables are EXACTLY like TI, POT etc - their useless and only included for 'token appearance'  - why are there no more smalls, they can clearly manage? [and why is it only the carnivores get the interesting mechanics; like climbing]
..

the only thing this game does reasonably is that rival shores has some nice enviroment diversity [the water is STILL bare] - 
there is more to explore then the other games but that too wears thin, 
the talent tree makes some creatures feel very customizable [not all, as a large chunk doesn't seem to show any difference making the dinos in question and use of growth points extremely redundant], 
the skin customization is VERY PLEASING it is one of the only 2 good things about this game [pity they STILL haven't fixed you not being able to SAVE your skins so you can turn the game off and go to sleep/do something more worth while - instead your save skins only stay untill you logout...], 
growth is just as atrocious as the other games but feels more horrendous because they were suppose to have put in buffs [food, water, comfort] to help ease the pain of growing but it doesn't, 
they added a feature where you regain water in certain rain conditions [like TI but not as good], 
the weather and 'events' are the best you will see in any of the games! [and it is a blessing when they changed the rain audio to actually SOUND like rain not a tin roof being rumbled on - not so much when they nerfed the tornado to ignore certain creatures...]
balancing of creatures against eachother is...well...can swing either way [depending on your own skill, how crap the stat changes are/aren't despite your buffing them, and if the game feels like playing nice and not suddenly deciding to drop you into the oceans of hell]

yes, this does come off as abit ranty - but i can't take having ANOTHER dino game that feels and acts like it's ripping off The Isle - i wanted THIS game to be unique, have it's own style [one of the things that drew me - apart from having multipul dinos [use to be 8 dropped to 6] was how COLOURFUL the world was! but then they nerfed the colours, oh it's still colourful but has lost the vibrance of what drew me ...for being more 'realistic' and stand out from the TI-clones but over time it's just started to be like them...

seriously, if you want to play The Isle but with slight stat-customization and more skin choices then give it a go - but the novelty will quickly wear off once you realise it's just TI with more colour

every so often i come back to see how this game is doing, but then i'm reminded of why i can't stand playing it anymore [too 'the same as the others' for my liking] and am now regretting not being able to refund it [and regret that with every update a server i fell in love with, because it was trying to put the FUN BACK into this game, is being handicapped by the developers themselves]

only play this if you want to sit, chat, afk, kos, waste time, pvp, randomly spawn/fall through the map for no reason [a velo i had fell through the map and drowned from just clinging to a rock!?] or go play one of the other games mentioned [apart from Bo9500 as that hardly runs at all!]

do the devs realise that if they did a single player [a TRUE singleplayer, not the ""it's really just a server you host and you have to ALWAYS be online""] then they would have something that outshines the competition? [think about it, take what you have now and turn it into a single player experience, even if it had basic runaway AI, it would put in the FUN you keep saying this game is(n't) - the weather, the colour, the cast, the enviroments, devs you already have the ingredients to make it! you could even add something to the water at last and make that come to life]

but as for me, i've tried to give this game a chance, i kept hoping against the inevitable tide of updates that kept smashing my face into it ominous rocks and am now tired...i'll still pop in and see whats changed [because hope is a B] but it's very clear the direction their taking this...
but hey, if you have friends then you might get a few kicks out of this [but when your alone you'll realise what the rest of us have]

maybe, someday in the future my rating may change - maybe they'll realise that they were listerning/reading to the wrong comments/people [""it's not realistic enough!""] and remember back to what they said THEY wanted this game to be...

It has many unique features that set it apart from other dinosaur survival games and turn it into a unique, irreplaceable experience that can be fun and full of variety. It's not realistic looking visually, but instead they embrace the fact that they are a video game through having many unique gameplay features and goals.

You start off as a baby and grow to adult and beyond. Your growth never stops, but being larger and stronger comes with the cost of being less agile and being hungrier/thirstier. You can manually choose to disable your growth if you find the size you're at to be the most manageable.

As you grow larger, you earn talent points which you can use to enhance certain stats in different skill trees. Most creatures are viable spec'd into any tree (no ""pro gamer best loadout"" that you'd have to google to learn about) and you can tune your gameplay to your pleasing. The game also has nesting, allowing babies to inherit talents from their parents--inherited talents allow you to have more talents than you could choose to spec into yourself

There are a boatload of various stats to watch for which make gameplay feel varying. You have a comfort stat which is reduced by stormy weather or being in proximity to ungrouped creatures and is improved by being by friends, in shelter, or eating certain herbs. Drinkable water can shrink away and refills in rain, and can also get dirty which can inflict debuffs if you drink too much. Healthy foods give you satiation which keeps you full longer. Surviving involves far more than just eating, drinking and not dying.

You are rewarded for almost everything you do in the form of character points. Exploring, visiting new water sources, killing players, traveling, surviving bad weather, etc. all give your character points which make them worthy sacrifices when resurrecting or reincarnating another character. When your character dies, you don't lose them but rather that slot becomes unplayable and you can choose to resurrect it (maintaining close to its previous growth) or reincarnate it (respawn as a baby but with the chance to inherit talents from yourself), both of which costs points which can be paid for by sacrificing other creatures to it.

Associated with this system are the various shrines around the map. They are of 3 kinds, representing the 3 different kinds of earnable points (survival, combat and speed). You can pledge to a certain shrine to improve your point count as well as deliver items between the shrines to earn buffs.

For the most part, the majority of these features are well explained in the game and the game is easy for new players to adapt to. Status effects all have tooltips that tell you what that status effect does and, if it's bad, how to fix it. Shrines have descriptions for every action you can do with them. Scent can be used to smell almost any creature, object or water source to learn about it. The game is very complex and diverse yet easy to digest.

BOB is overall a fun game full of variety and things to do. Personally I find it to be the least rage-inducing survival game because I can enjoy it from any perspective. You don't lose everything when you die, you grow pretty fast, there's pros and cons to being almost any size, and there are plenty of activities that don't involve being the biggest strongest baddie in town. You can get just as much enjoyment being a little burrower digging a tunnel complex as you can being an unkillable monster.

The arcade-style gameplay may not be for everyone, but I highly recommend you give it a try. It's definitely a unique and detailed experience that offers something no other dinosaur survival game does.",1546328743,1676329773,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Yes, the game is very flexible, you can make a lot of different skins, you can specialise a dinosaur to be good at a specific thing, it has an okay player amount, but my issue is the community. It is EXTREMELY toxic. You get people saying slurs all the time, and the only popular servers, the staff don't care at all. They treat those servers awfully. I cannot begin to tell you how much stress and depression this game has caused me, and it is very addicting so it's hard for me to quit. Usually I end up leaving the game in tears, because of the type of people there. If you insist on playing, I just recommend turning off global chat. It's nothing but toxic people, who don't care. It also doesn't help, with the fact this game isn't really aimed towards kids, and therefore has no chat filter so people can say what they want and they don't care if they get banned. The most toxic is by far deathmatch servers, steer clear of them. Aside from the community, the game is pretty good. There are TONS of bugs and game breaking glitches, though. Combat is extremely hard when a lot of the hitboxes are broken and people abuse them, or when every single server has massive amounts of ping (for everyone) and people just teleport about. You could spend hours and hours a day growing something that means a lot to you, and as long as you're outnumbered, it's all gone. There are servers that revive your dino automatically though. To avoid as much stress as possible because this game is filled with it, I suggest doing auto revive servers, or chill ones. Even though, it's not how the game is intended to be played. But I did warn you, filled with toxic players, who tell you you're shit no matter what, and constantly make out like they're better than you. There is also skins which are impossible to get and it's so annoying. They priced these glimmer skins in pre-order for a RIDICULOUS amount and nobody has them anymore, why would you make limited things in a dinosaur game that nobody has? That's all for now just, be prepared. Without the community being toxic it's pretty fun to play hence my hours.",1676141649,1676141649,False,21,4,0.646267473697662354,1,True,False,True

This game has so many things you can do in it. You can improve your dinos through deity trials and nesting with better mates. It is a bit power creepy but I have always been a fan of asymmetrical gameplay. Not everything in life is fair so why should games imitate that? Especially when I'm just tryna relax and play a dino game. Plus this game has the best flight system. It's physics based and is so much fun just flying around dodging trees.

(Because how could I be hatched in otherwise. Unless the parent accepted my request.) And I was demanded to leave and forfeit the egg that I had gotten. Doing this to new people on your server, is not professional and not very nice. So I left it. This game as a whole is just riddled with toxic people, and it makes enjoying the game very difficult. So no I don't recommend getting this game, until the devs do something, to make it less toxic.",1674938539,1674938539,False,5,0,0.518496692180633545,0,True,False,True

Review:
THE GAME:
Hardcore Survival - Beasts of Bermuda is a hardcore survival roleplaying game where you play as one of 18 (with more on the way) different dinosaurs, from groups like Carnivores, Herbivors, Aquatics, Semi-Aquatics, and Fliers. There are no AI dinos(except some small food dinos), every single dinosaur you see is another player that has their own unique arsenal made to survival, and even kill you. This game has a very steep learning curve, and you may spend the first 10 hours wondering why you're dying so much, but after some time to learn how to interact with your chosen dinosaur, other dinosaurs, and the world, you will quickly learn how to survive to adulthood with almost absolute certainty on any dino. This game is a HARDCORE survival, it is not for the faint of heart. You will spend 8 hours on a dino only to have it die in 12 seconds of combat. Don't lose hope, however, there is a revival system! Join in, bring friends, join a group, be creative, screw around, and have a good time. This is no dinky survival-craft, it's hard, it's scare, but it's thrilling as well.

Chill Roleplay - If Hardcore survival is not your cup of tea, and you're looking more for relaxed gameplay, and just want to roll around on some fun dinos, there are Chill servers. These servers have lots of rules, but are intended for players to experience a more relaxed and roleplay oriented type of gameplay. Less risk of death, more time exploring the land and interacting with other dinosaurs. This is not my cup of tea, but it offers a great experience for the players that want to jump in and play the game, but not worry about losing all their progress all the time.

THE STAFF TEAM:
This game is the lovechild of a passionate development team that is constantly in contact with the community through their discord, listening to the community, providing updates, and asking players for direct feedback. There are plenty of examples of the players being unhappy with certain things/updates, and the developers listening to that feedback and making changes to help people better enjoy the game. This is the most impressed i have been with a development team I have ever been, and it reminds me of the level of activity you might see on large private servers for other games, with constant activity from both the developers and the moderation team. I recently joined the moderation team for this game after spending hundreds of hours enjoying the game. In an attempt to keep this review neutral, I will only speak on my experience before joining the team. Before I joined the moderation team, I enjoyed the moderation and development team. I constantly saw them in game playing their own game, and had the pleasure of both playing alongside them, and fighting against them. This is what ultimately spurred my decision to apply to join the team.

THE COMMUNITY:
This is a hardcore survival, if you are the type of player who gets angry and rages, then you are going to experience a very toxic side of the community. If you are the type of player to shrug off some upset players, then this community is just fine. In my experience, people are always happy to make jokes and join in on jokes, and new players are always supported by the community, sometimes after some joking/teasing, though. The discord is an active place where community members discuss the game, share artwork, contact the moderation team, and form groups. Perhaps its because of some of the other communities i have been a part of, but I disagree with players that claim this community is overly toxic. I feel like a few bad eggs don't ruin one community, unlike games that are full of toxic people left and right(looking at you league).

BUGS:
This is an early access game that is under constant development, so there are certainly bugs, but there is also an active QA team that works on seeking out and handling these bugs. I haven't found any bugs so far that game-breaking, but I do experience the odd bug now and again. My most recent experience with a relatively large bug went like this; players were experiencing issues with some of the portals in game(velociraptor slingshot type stuff), the bug was reported, 2-3 days later a patch was released, and no more flying velociraptors. Existing/known bugs are minor/irrelevant, and it seems like the quality of the game is constantly increasing.",1674813018,1674813018,True,29,5,0.699422478675842285,3,True,False,True

The devs have shown time and time again that they don't care for the community by ignoring or dismissing the player base on various changes they disliked, and ignoring serious balance issues and long standing bugs. 

For example, Velociraptor is one of the older dinos and has a unique system of grappling onto terrain. Except it doesn't, the climbing has always been broken with the dino constantly detaching from surfaces and falling to the ground. And now its even worse with surfaces being inconsistent of what you can and can't grapple, and it straight up not working at all most the time. Yet despite it being one of the older systems thats extremely buggy and had attention brought to it many times, as well as ruining the dino since its a core mechanic for them, and they KNOW its been broken since it was added. Yet they haven't fixed it at all. 

(Ironically the day after I make this they add a patch that removes a lot of scuff from velo grappling)

Far as dinos go. Realistically dinosaurs take forever to release. People have donated  LOTS before to get them to make specific dinos for the game if you want, but in reality it'll likely be years before they release and its bit risky committing to such a big donation since there is no wait time you can check in on when they'll be released.  Donated dinos also prioritise the person paying them over the playerbase, they yell about wanting to be realistically accurate but will make a herbivore eat meat if the donator wants them to. This wouldn't be as big an issue in some games if it wasn't for the fact  dinosaurs very rarely get released so when one is it'll likely be a donator dino, so having a random person deciding stuff like that regardless of what the playerbase thinks of it  when you so rarely get new characters isn't a good idea.",1673602053,1673671835,False,3,0,0.523573219776153564,0,True,False,True

I still like the game however, its more about getting away from a potential fight for me, you can always go around to explore, do your trials etc.

Nesting or trying to get the best dino possible is also something you can spend your time on.

Players are a big mix between scaring you for fun, chatting in local for a few minutes and then leaving and just murdering you the second you spawn in.

The lead developer doesn't know how to interact with his community considering he told his community to ""go fuck yourself"" within the discord because they pushed an update and the player base did not like it.

The updates within the past year have been nothing but worrying to the veteran players of the game. The devs have allowed a certain play style within the game since Beasts of Bermuda had been released and now they're trying to take this play style away slowly. By doing this; unofficial servers have had to close and communities which have been around for ages have now gone or falling.

They do not seem to have any compassion or appreciation to these certain communities who have kept their game alive for such a long time. They don't get any ""thanks""; they get unexpected changes which have not been communicated via the community and then have to panic and scramble to try and fix what they have broken for their own communities.

They keep taking things away and then giving it back after the community rages. They have made so many mistakes with community trust in the past year that no one trusts updates or the developers words anymore. If they want to take something away they might as well rip the band-aid off instead of allowing players to waste time on something they plan to change. They give in to the community because they're more worried about them paying bills irl, which they have admitted to within the discord. 

If they want their game a certain way they need to stick with it and understand they won't make everybody happy regardless of what they do. They've been in development for years; as long as they communicate upcoming changes instead of surprising the community all the time, they wouldn't have as much backlash. Yes, you will always get some and it's pretty much unavoidable but if you want your game to be a certain way, stick to it. Don't let the community dictate your game.

I used to love playing this game, but as the developers changed in attitude, updates that are ruining veteran play styles and unexpected changes with no communication. I had to walk away from this roller coaster of a game.

I hope it changes for the better for my friends who still play it. but with how things have been within the past year I don't see that happening.",1606231786,1673478852,False,1,0,0.494923859834671021,0,True,False,True

DO NOT install this game if:

You want a realistic gameplay;
It is not realistic, skins can be any color on the RGB spectrum. They made some dinosaurs diets inaccurate- eg; Pachy is an omnivore in this game. There are shrines of deitys placed around the map that you can pledge to for a better reincarnation/resurrect on a dead dino. There are also portals.

You want a non-toxic gaming experience;
On official servers, KOSING is not against the rules and neither is spawnkilling. This means that you can get killed from another player right upon spawning, even not being able to play the game depending on how many times it occurs. There are herds and packs in the game, but only certain herbivores can herd with other herbivores. (This was not a thing in the past and any herbivore could herd together before.) Carnivores can only pack with the same species. Most of the players will probably let you join them, but there are a few ""biome owners/clans"" that own a specific area of the map due to how powerful said clan is. There are also rule-breakers that never get caught, or are let go. The only thing that counters toxicity is that you cannot bully anyone in global chat, and cannot use slurs. EDIT: Targeting is no longer a rule...

You want fair fights;
 I cant explain this unless you decide to buy the game, but the fights are absolutely wack. An example is a dino of a smaller size might be able to kill a larger dino. This also depends on the number of dinos attacking or being attacked.

DO buy this game if:

You like fantasy games and dinosaurs that can look like clown barf

[h3]BACKGROUND[/h3]

[b]Review status:[/b] Please consider this a [u]neutral review[/u], as my observations and opinions are mixed.

[b]Playtime:[/b] 4,000+ hours on my main account, not counting my alts. Probably close to 6,500 hours total. I have been playing PvP/PvPvE for years, so cannot afford to go idle too often. I have maybe 500 hours on a trusted chill server out of my total playtime. I purchased this game 1 January, 2019, and contributed security critique pre-Steam; this is a cumulative review spanning over 5 years.

[b]Knowledge:[/b] I frequently test all aspects of the game I can that relate to balancing. As to why, information online, even pinned in the official Discord, is out of date. I update myself on values (ex: base Damage) regularly too, as I own a server that does not allow mixed genera herding so I use this data to calculate truly balanced group limitations. This data is located [url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kFPNV6yQXIVz4iHXBPUFOXOU88xShgtIbs4xITr8Brk/]here[/url]. I was previously on the QA team (pre-NDA) and quit.

[h3]CURRENT MAJOR GAME ISSUES[/h3]

If you have ever had Family Sharing enabled at any point, you [i]will[/i] experience your characters wiping on both accounts unless all of the player's data is erased from the server. Family Sharing remains enabled despite (according to my research) being able to be disabled (either through Steamworks Portal - exfgls specifically which is a bool to ""Exclude from family sharing"" - or a Steam API shared game/ownership check).

The game, for over 4 years, has had no rigid development plan as compared to late. As such, almost their entire community formed based on player content and the many available possibilities for server types owners could cultivate. With the launch of the new Titania map, the team initially planned to replace a game mode the majority of their community loved and was built around with years of history. This was to be replaced with [i]the team's[/i] (and not even the entire team's) idea of a game mode. All servers were expected to assimilate, which would have effectively destroyed many preferred play styles which had brought in hundreds of players and server identities. Despite a lot of our players disliking the new, fast-paced arcade-style game mode called Gauntlet (the new Life Cycle mode), server owners were ignored and made to feel like we simply could not even begin to comprehend this all superior, specific gameplay style. It was only after backlash we warned of that the old Life Cycle mode quite literally everyone was established around and enjoyed was returned and renamed to Free Roam. This initial unwillingness for feedback was and is concerning, and soured my passion for this game.


[h3]OBSERVATIONS[/h3]

The following is a list of objective notes on the game:
= the balance issues can be glaring at times, and the informed pleas to fix or improve are drowned out by biased players that will rage about and claim the game is dying if their main playable is nerfed in the slightest for balance;
+ the game has made considerably more progress than other Steam dinosaur games;
- important or potentially important balance changes and fixes are withheld until the next major update or major hotfix update;
- there are periods in which crashes will plague servers or clients, but such a period has not come in quite some time – fingers crossed such times are in the past, though currently there is a nasty memory leak bug so laptop users beware;
- playables are either nerfed far too strongly (minimum of two total nerfs) or buffed far too strongly (minimum of two total buffs), contributing the most to major balancing issues excluding issues related to exploits (as seen with Ichthy in December 2022);
+ the ability to make custom, modded maps (although the tool is somewhat limited, I've made great use out of it with my experience! I know so many other players absolutely adore the editor too);
+ by far the most intricate skin customization systems I have ever seen, MMO games aside, and if a pair nests their offspring actually produces a mixed skin with many more layers to customize as they essentially have two skin patterns (or more, depending on the generation);
- poor optimization;
= customizable Growth rates for servers, which is great for different types of servers but causes some similar types of survival servers to compete with ""no, we have a faster rate"" --> ""no, WE do"" (with the highest rate being a ridiculous X2);
+ customizable game mechanics for servers such as food drain, water drain, water dirtyness difficulty, plant respawn, weather, and more; and
+ customizable, genus-specific Growth caps and Soft Caps for servers, which have been critical balancing tools my server is extremely appreciative of


[h3]OPINIONS[/h3]

The following is a list of subjective notes on the game.

- An “apex” class does not belong in a [b]competitive PvP-survival game[/b].
I understand Tyrannosaurus is a fan favorite, but having the most speed (with 'Ambush), health, and damage of all predators is a bit much. Tyrannosaurus players that understand their arsenal and mobility wipe out entire groups of players.

- Not enough tutorials, confusing for new players.

+ [b]Don't have time to self-nest with a partner? Reincarnate![/b]
No, seriously, this is a very OP catchup mechanic. Nesting requires many more resources and reincarnation inherits seem to be multiplicative with Trial scores. Trials are essentially quests, such as travel distance.

- [b]Infestation of private (unofficial) pay-to-win servers:[/b]
[url=http://prntscr.com/1125d3b]click here to view[/url]
Even if they don't involve legal tender, you can still purchase OP items with points such as food, Growth storms, and teleports. If you see a private server ""rewarding"" donators, these are micro-/macro-transactions and [u]not[/u] donations. These servers, at least those with unregulated donations that are likely making huge profits, should be ineligible for the Community Leader BoB status.

+ I prefer this game somewhat more than other available dinosaur games. When Path of Titans is complete and if they deliver as they promised, I'll still be playing some Beasts of Bermuda (and PoT, too, of course).

- Players are often overly sexual with each other despite not knowing each others ages. I would say this is out of the team's control, but at minimum officials should be better moderated and chat filter configs should be available to owners.

+ There are in-game resurrection and reincarnation mechanics, which prevent you from losing your creatures you become attached to! This does not defeat time sink value.


[h3]CONCLUSION[/h3]

I lose my patience with many aspects of the game, but altogether enjoy it every now and then. I will say I am most frustrated by major flaws in balancing and the team's behavior regarding their new game mode. Many people affirm that perfect balance is not achievable, but I believe at least some semblance of balance should be considered vital and prioritized along with bugs and exploits. A lot more focus needs to be placed on QA/bugs.

I have returned to the game, with my own server (while we were only planning for PoT enough members desired a BoB server) and as such play it again. I find most other private servers unbearable, but note I am picky with rule quality. I also hate servers with micro-/macro-transactions with a passion.

Be careful what private server you choose to plant your seed of nostalgia on, and note officials are chaotic and that's where many players go to blow off steam. I understand a dinosaur simulator game is extremely cool, but be careful where and what you choose to play.

I don't get much time to play games anymore and before the update the game rewarded people for AFK growing an insane amount of hours which made being competitive as a weekend gamer not realistic. But since the latest changes and shrines in place you can grow much faster; there is no longer need to rely on nesting to get good dinos. You also have to keep on the move if you want to maximise your creatures which also stops people from camping out certain zones and blocking them from access. Top tier update 10/10 imo.

The character creation is extensive, and allows for funky colours if you so desire them (unlike The Isle) and it's all accessible from the start (unlike PoT)
The maps are visually interesting, unique and have plenty of landmarks to help you find your way. It's also not too big so on a full server you're almost always at risk of bumping into someone, keeping you on your toes constantly. They're also better optimised than The Isle which runs like it's mining crypto in the background. 
There's actual gameplay mechanics like the skill tree, nesting, dynamic weather events, stress etc which all help it feel like a real complete game, unlike the others which are still very lacking any sort of satisfying game loop.

However, it isn't without flaws. As unless you are fully aware of Every build, exploit and more you're probably going to die in an incredibly unfair way, and opinions are mixed if they're ever planning to fix this part of the game. Currently, in my opinion, it's the most complete and fun online dino game out there, but it has to continue to develop it's self should PoT catch up.

Poor balancing wrecks the game and its overall ability to be played in a enjoyable or competitive fashion. Official servers are pretty much kill on sight free for alls. Private servers are more reliable but the issue comes with established players on those servers gate keeping or targeting players. There are always ""meta"" builds and dinos that will reign supreme no matter the size or build of their opponent.

The Life Cycle game mode is a hassle and not rewarding, grow to 1.32 fairly quickly just to play food simulator and endlessly hunt down charcoal to keep your dinosaur alive. Not able to find any? Looks like you start over at 0.8 or reincarnate for some RNG based roll on your traits, and they can be worse than what you previously had! You also lose your skin, or it becomes bugged and loses some of it's layers. So long beauty!

Free Roam is more relaxing, but more devastating to die on, unless you go to an auto revive server. You can grow and not have to worry as much about eating and keeping your dino alive, but one wrong move or battle and you either pay a hefty price in the form of sacrificed dinos to revive it, or you reincarnate as mentioned above and lose all the time you spent on your dino. If you go to auto revive servers it's fun without the hassle or loss though!

The community can be hit or miss depending on the server you visit, some are more toxic or friendly than others. I've had a majority of good experiences, but a few sour ones as well to be honest. There are plenty of players willing to help others learn the game or about their dino!

As for the dev team.. It's a big yikes. If you join the community discord you can expect some form of shade from the dev team to be thrown at players. Be it just shade or borderline verbal ab**e. They are very hostile to players who prefer Free Roam and Auto revive servers and when offered feedback on the game to further improve said topics you can expect some form of verbal backlash. They don't hide the fact that they want the game to move a certain way with their ""vision"" and that they don't care what the community wants or prefers.

Pre-Titania changes, the game was pretty good and seemed to be moving in a positive direction. Afterwards however, I feel like there are too many mechanics and balances that have been overlooked to the point where the game has become such a hassle and hindrance that the game is moving in the wrong direction. Coupled with the toxicity and hostility of the dev team with how they treat their player base, I will advise players to look toward other animal sim games.",1672193930,1672193930,False,17,1,0.635071992874145508,0,True,False,True

[b]The developers refuse or unable to fix the only major problem in this game: [spoiler]the toxic servers/admins[/spoiler][/b]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
While the game itself gives a wonderful environment to walk/swim/fly/eat/nest as a dino, this immerse experience will fade once you play more and more. Due to an inability (or intended?) decision from devs, as the only server options are the following:

[u]1. if you want EU ping (lower than 200):[/u]
- Russian servers, where you get killed/exiled just because you can't speak russian
- Empty servers to experience the environment just by yourself
- And toxic servers, which comes with or without rules, aka [b]loopholes[/b]. These are made by server-owners to overwrite the game-mechanism for their own taste (hunt limit, pack size, mixpack, etc). While server-rules have good intentions, they are mostly made in a shady way with several loopholes, which benefits to the side what admins choose. This can be really-really situational, but as you know, the house always wins. If admins says their friend not rule broke, then they did not, and you can piss off, no mater what your lawyer says. If you kill an admin or his/her friend, you will be targeted by a ""mixpacked"" or ""boost growed"" group, just close enough to not ""break a rule"" and hunt you - and just you - down. This won't end even if your dino is dead and you make a new one. Your name will be a target just because you pissed off the ""maffia"". If you had this problem, then you know which servers I talk about. And just to not stop here, if you know what direct/indirect Pay2Grow means, then you know which servers I talk about. They ignore and support unfair gameplay for own fun, causing terrible social-environment in game, and if any problem comes up in chat, it just getting pushed to ""post it on discord and leave from global"". Try to resist or say anything against it, you are free to leave ""their"" server AKA banned.

[u]2. if you are fine without EU ping (200 and above):[/u]
- Teleporting AKA ""rubber-banding"" dinos. Bite twice, damage none. Ofc, no real help with this, ""just record it"", report it, wait few days/weeks for a ""review"", and might or might not you get back your dino, just to die like as you did before. And I not even mentioned those proxy/VPN chineese players with minimum 500 ms ping. You see something heading to you, then you see your health jump to half from nowhere, and suddenly now those guys are behind you.
- Don't be silly. Do not think toxic servers are just with EU ping, but now with extra latency.
[u]3. bonus option:[/u]
- Make your own server and pay monthly fee to play alone! Because who would play on a new/weird server where there is no corrupt admin. Don't joke with me.


As long as the developers not take out the control from admins how their game should be played, whom are responsible for toxic environment, I [u]do not[/u] recommend to buy this game.

my fiance tried and failed to get me into this game several times, but with the release of the titania map the game is, to me, finally worth playing. it no longer takes 100 hours to grow your dinosaur and thus it's no longer rage inducing to LOSE your dinosaur that you waited so long to grow.

What pred did is a step in the right direction but I still can't forgive him for what he did. A player by the name of Nightstrider made a review https://steamcommunity.com/id/AutobotNightStrider/recommended/719890/ and so the big boy dev pred came in and strong armed her to change her review or be hard code banned. If you need anymore context there here is the link https://imgur.com/a/P8gDx13?third_party=1#_=_

So for three days or so we fought telling the dev's that ""taking away commands that people use on there own server is bad"" After saying this that seem like a eternity...two brain cells rubbed together and pred finally seen the light. Taking away stuff from the players is a bad idea and you don't make money. Who knew. With this change there might be hope for the game BUT! Just because this turn around happen does not mean pred will go back to his old self.

So I will go over the pro's and cons

Pro's
- Dinos can be any colour you want
- There many dinos you can be (carnivore or herbivore and ""omnivores"")
- You can mate and the babies can get some good traits
- Trait system that you can get extra point's into a skill (Some can make you have more hp, get more food while eating and so on)
- Can revive your dino if you have points to do so

Con's 
- Every update brake's or take something away you can do with your server
- The game is not optimized and need a game pc to play it (my friend needs a new pc just to play the new map)
- Dev's make the game THEY want and let the community suffer
- Community can be very toxic 
- Clans will take over a server (mostly official servers)
- Most dinos are very unbalanced
- It's been almost 5 years and very little has been done to the game
- Take's a very long time for update's

Now is this game a buy or pass. I was in the middle with this game but now pred is asking for more money...with a plushie...pred...you dun goofed your game. You took a bunch of commands for admins to run there own servers. Found out that taking things away means no money so now you want are money from a plushie. What a insult. Don't buy this game

Update: 2022-12-21

The dev's added dlc that you pay that does nothing other then if you die it just bring up new death message...",1551465105,1671653765,False,0,0,0.459154367446899414,2,True,False,True

My favourite part of the game is the weather system, the eating and drinking (which is sad to say) the reason i like the food and water/ weather system is because of the-
A.) food being able to over feed and saturate your Dino giving a meaning to hunting EVEN more as a Carnivore and like wise with water and the saturation visiting new watering holes for extra boost in growth. 
B.) the weather system is amazing its great, the rising tides and looking for new shelters is really fun and forces players to get closer to one another and the aquatics come in more as-well.

On the other hand the games community is the most toxic I've ever played on; i'd of thought that players with 2k-6k hours or more! would be more welcoming but for voicing an opinion about the game i get backlash and not a civil one, most of the comments are very dry and rude, understandably they're kids that absolutely fine however admins of servers are quite the same most of the time.

I've really tried to enjoy the game but its so un-fun, i think about 100+ hours of really trying to enjoy a game kinda shows how boring it is. I've come back several times trying to enjoy it but can't ever seem to get stuck in. If you're really thinking of getting this game ONLY get it to play with friends or join a GOOD community as most will be toxic. playing as a herd/ pack is really really FUN! its downright enjoyable!

At the moment, the Shrine Blessings do NOT work half the time, and my dinos keep falling through the ground and dying. The playerbase is also still relatively small and unbelievably toxic. The issues with community server limitations still exist. The game is definitely still in a better state than it was previously though. Although I still can't recommend it for the price, this is a step in the right direction.

 I'm hopeful that the hotfixes will eventually iron out most of the new bugs introduced by Titania, and that the new mechanics will push toxic players onto the non-gauntlet servers. Beasts of Bermuda still DESPERATELY needs to give server owners more control over their servers though. The current game really only allows one or two types of server styles, and if they don't appeal to you, you're SOL.

* ORIGINAL REVIEW *
Summary: Game is buggy as hell, updates are inconsistent, routinely destroys days of progress. Extremely unwelcoming to new players. The community is universally toxic. The devs maintain complete control over unofficial servers and it's strangling the game to death. Go play Path of Titans instead. It's not a Steam game, but it offers everything this game does while actually being fun.

I cannot recommend Beasts of Bermuda in its current state. Also the developers have a serious control problem when it comes to unofficial servers. And the communities, both official and in unofficial servers, are THE most toxic ones I have ever experienced in a survival game. Even Rust has a better community. And the Rust devs actually update their game regularly and don't abuse their power in unofficial servers. I foresee Beasts of Bermuda going down the unfortunate path of many other forgotten Early Access games while its competition continues on.

The game is incredibly buggy, crashes frequently, and you can lose DAYS of progress when it does. The game mechanics are certainly interesting, but in a lot of ways I think it's trying too hard to differentiate itself from the other available dinosaur survival games to the detriment of the actual gameplay. The growth system is fine most of the time, but it means that if you want to play this game you HAVE to dedicate all of your time to it or you will be immediately bodied by people who have spent the past couple months AFKing to grow their dinos. Even unofficial servers are extremely unfriendly to new players in this regard. In my opinion, it just isn't worth the massive amount of effort. I have dumped 93 hours into this game, most on the same server, and I am still constantly having my experience ruined for fun by people bigger than me. 

And on the note of unofficial servers, the amount of control the devs have over what you can and cannot do on YOUR OWN SERVER that you may have paid upwards of $50 for is insane. You cannot make the game a more tolerable experience for other players - you HAVE to play the game the way the devs want you to. You cannot grow other peoples' dinos as server staff. You cannot alter their talents/skills. You are EXTREMELY limited in how you can control everything from growth rates to resource rates. There is a reason that every one of the official servers never has more than 40 people on them. The fact that the game forces you to use the same  mechanics that make people avoid the official servers leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Ultimately, I fear that this is what will be the downfall of the game: its lack of creative freedom. There is no escape from the problems that make Beasts of Bermuda my least favorite of the three big dinosaur survival games out there.

In BoB's early days, there were plenty of reports of the devs abusing their powers on both official and unofficial servers. While I personally have not seen this, I 100% believe it still takes place. The devs, even on your own unofficial servers, have a level of complete control that no server owner can possibly have.

I really wanted to like this game. I spent 93 hours trying to like this game, and I just can't. I even tried to start my own server, paid $35 for a server host, only to find out that the game HAS to suck. You can't change it if you try. You are so limited in what you can do with console commands and server config files that you might as well not have ANY control. And there are dozens of console commands that exist, and are super useful, but YOU aren't allowed to use them. It's extremely disappointing, because this game has so much potential.

As it stands, this game is not worth the price tag, or the time you have to spend to get to a point where you can experience something approaching fun",1661669706,1670374183,False,30,0,0.733001768589019775,0,True,False,True

Full skill tree with actually difficult decisions and unique build options, unlike Path of Titans very limited pigeon-holed build options.

Relaxed Diet system that rewards proper care but doesn't thrash you for not being perfect.

Full skin customization with filter options to transform obnoxious skins, which pleases both crowds of ""I want highlighter pink dinosaurs"" and ""I want grounded color schemes on dinosaurs""

Large player cap servers, the main server I play was 280 people and ran smoothly.

Actual map distribution, you discover people roaming regularly and not only at hotspots.

Much better suited towards casual play than The Isle, more in depth thoughtful decisions in build than in Path of Titans, decent update pacing, and a beginner friendly reworked UI and basic tutorial.

Okay, new update got me. 


----------------------------------------
Warning: Foul-ish Language Ahead. (censored but still just a heads up)




..



..

Okay..



Dear god help me, where to start. I wanted so desperately to love this game because it seemed to focus SO hard on community and communication initially, and I feel like the games of late have missed that mark SO HARD.. 


The growth system/Skill tree system seemed SO good at first. 

A good mix of skills(until you realize 80% of them repeat across all dinos), no real way to tell metric wise how they REALLY worked, but still not terrible.

I saw a Leaf-A-Saurus Rex whoop the hell out of a Chomp-A-Saurus Rex once.. Looked like combat MIGHT BE Balanced! 

I was all in. 

I rotated and tried every single dino available hitting atleast 1.4 with each. Some i liked more then others but I started picking up on some severe issues.. I thought to myself, Cant be that bad with 50+ players each on 5-6 different servers (some around 100-120, but MAJORITY more south of 50-60)

Dear lord was I wrong. 

Absolute f- garbage communities. I'd suggest old a- Halo Voice Chat over this trash. Admins are NO help 80% of the time, and to me, a complete joke both on, official servers 2-6 specifically, & majority on the other servers that sit above 50-60 active players aren't exactly something to write the mates about either. 

I've watched time and time again for requests being submitted to admins via /all chat (like they requested in the server intro) that go unanswered. Resulting in newbies dying to douches just trying to be funny cunts to their friends, while simultaneously ruining the experience for the old players trying to get some new blood into the game, and the new. 

There's frequent abuse by changing environmental conditions at will for a specific group's personal convenience or gain regardless of the detriment to others.  

And f- me running sideways from Monday till Sunday's light fades... The Dino's are terribly unbalanced...

Even if they were, basic issues like the camera angle limitations the game has, coupled with STUPID things like the INSANELY SLOW initial movement mechanics from crouch, prone, and back up... or trash a- rendering of object distance prevent any Dino, beefy or smol from escaping the easily found groups of 8-15 carnivores that get around normal grouping limitations communicating through discord & f- unsuspecting people up.

-tornadoes chase you and rip trees out of the ground while your hiding in them
-floods make the almost entirety of land available to marine dinosaurs
-perk trees that give the game more direction
-skin customization is REALLY detailed but also tailored to the lazy ;)
-you can get struck by lightning but there's a weather resist talent that provides immunity to death from it
-raptors can climb surfaces and nest in trees (not megaraptors)
-there's no growth limit
- devs are constantly pushing out new updates, contents, and bug fixes
-if you lose your dino don't worry, you can sacrifice one of your other dinos to ressurect it
-when nesting you pass on traits to offspring, this eventually leads to godly inherits!
... or incest- there's a feature that allows you to see who you're related to so make sure you check that
- oryctodromeus can burrow underground with creative freedom... think: digging in minecraft
-The underwater biome has been completely overhauled so it's not a dead lifeless husk
- now with ai!
- drinking soiled water, eating mushrooms or rotten food will make you sick and you will almost inevitably die
-flying dinosaurs can swoop down and kidnap your hatchlings
- water dinos can go through underground tunnels into watering holes
-running up hills slows you down, running down hills speeds you up unless you change that in the talent tree
-certain mechanics like blue crystals, carrying trinkets to shrines, a balanced diet, baby buff, eating dandilions, drinking clean water, and being close to friends can increase growth rate
new mechanics allow you to carry a trinket from one shrine to the other and get a blessing from that diety. blessings give you massive boosts to mating and giving your babies insane inherits, surviving the elements, increased growth rate by 50% in exchange for 75% food and water drain (careful) and being able to bring your dino back from death for 75% less cost with 50% food and water drain.

- new map titania is alot more realistic an absolutely gorgeous but challenging in equal measure. 
-new weather added: WILDFIRES! what's that smell? is something burning?... quick! grab the eggs! we're running out of places to go! all the carnivores and herbivores are being pushed together but the only fight they're interested is the fight for air. the only option left is the ocean... but it's filled with waiting teeth...

- dino models are alot more realistic than they were

-if you don't like how bright people's skins are there's a filter in the settings to change that

- if it's too dark press these keys `gamma3

- you can now summon your friends from across the map when they spawn, no more spending hours walking around!
-all previous issues have been resolved, there are now penalties for killing within your group and meshing etc.
- be sure to have recording software because reporting ppl on discord is the only way to stop rulebreakers
- being sick will inevitably kill you so don't eat or drink anything questionable
- official servers are toxic ofc 
- people are really choosey about their mates
- because the devs are always changing and improving the game it is prone to glitches after updates but they fix it pretty quick",1579019172,1669754638,True,3,0,0.520387411117553711,0,True,False,True

The last update really was a huge shot at Chill servers, and our playstyle, but, my review is now positive because ya'll listened to us by letting us:
- Play on Titinia on Free Roam instead of being Gauntlet locked
- Reinstated Growth Storms / carcass dropping on Free Roam, regardless of map
-  FIllAllStats no longer dirties dinosaurs (We find this useful for event purposes, when we need to shed fat instantly, so thank you)
- Auto revive has been brought back to Free Roam gamemodes

Thanks for listening to us. I think I can speak for most of us that we love this game, and did not like the direction it was going. It's nice to have the dev team listen to the criticism, albeit harsh, we only are because we want to see the best for this game, that we have put thousands of hours into. I have about 3,000 hours if you include my alternate account. 

One more gripe is the issues on Volcano Bay. I know this map is an abandoned project -- however the fact that the developer team has left it as a ""canvas"" map for us to play with, and design on, and KNOWING it has a HUGE RAM issue and not fixing it. I realise it may not be important, but you should either:
a. Remove the map due to its absolute RAM eating issue
b. fix the issue if you intend to leave it as something for us to play on / play with.
Instead of saying: ""Don't play on Volcano bay, it's bad and we know it."" Again, I realise Volcano Bay is not NEARLY as important as, lets say, QOL updates for Titania or just updates for Titania itself. 

I love BoB and only hope for the best.",1669045003,1669045170,True,33,2,0.750755071640014648,0,True,False,True

I know it's not fair to judge a game based off the people that play it, but this game makes it really hard when you're forced to group with people to play the game. It's almost impossible to play this game without a dedicated group. It's easier now with gauntlet, but I swear this game just draws out the worst in people. I may just be a snowflake, and most people who play this game would probably call me one, but I really can't recommend this game to anyone until it has some improvements.

this game has come a long way since I started to play it, alongside the games growth and updates so has the community. 
in total i got 3 accounts for this game because of how fun and addicting it has been and still is!
older bob and the older updates was more of a social sim tho with afk chill growth meanwhile the new update are more a full on survival experience no more easy game mode and I like it.
i think this is a healthy direction of this game. 
from the old game when it took 14 hours for Apa to get to 1.2 in adult size
to now take less then 4 ish hours so you can enjoy yourself and the experience faster. 
all tho i like to play more often i dont get punished for not investing months worth of hours into the game just to get big no more and thats awesome.
now its more of like jump in grow for an hour or 2 then go make chaos.
This is a good game if you can ignore the Community antic 
its an inexpensive game that i would recommend to try out, there is allot to be explored and allot to see and experience by the world building and map alone via 'Titania'
the different random mutations you can get thought hatching that makes you different from others,
the inherits you will get base of your parents and luck 
but in the end you will rise agains the odds base on how fast you are to learn and understand the dino you play, you skill will be your name and tittle!

this tho is not the case and the devs love there game and want it to be a better experience but they also tired of having there game played as an afk simulator or easy mode,
this was made to be pvp survival game, you are meant to die one way or another but you dont really lose the dino that you so love, you can easy resurrect it or just not do the Gauntlet to make it easier for you to play.

Sadly tho the community has tho taken up war against the devs and warning everyone that this is a bad game, (lies, misinformation and bias standards imo)
so I wanted to say this every player you meet on here will have there own take of the game and we all have our own preferred way of playing this game!
but it would also be nice if the community would stop being somewhat Entitled to have there voices heard and there for shooting themselves in the foot to badly revue bomb the game then cry that the community is dying,

Each dinosaur has, at minimum, two skins to choose from and a limitless color wheel. You can go super realistic to super neon in appearance. There are environmental factors that impact your survival such as tornadoes, wildfires, and storms. It gives the game a more dynamic feel in surviving other players and the environment. 

My only complaints would be the problematic clans and an inability to survive on more popular servers without knowing people and being a part of the cliques. The fact that creatures have limitless growth (which sets BoB apart from its competitors and I actually enjoy, for the most part) lends to a lot of toxicity as well in people wanting to be the biggest with the best talents. So much so that you will sometimes find it difficult to get nested, especially by a carnivore. 

Other than that, I highly recommend the game. Especially if you have friends with which to play and enjoy it with.


EDIT: This is a review I wrote in June 2021. I see a lot of people have flooded in and given bad reviews in light of the recent update. Which, to be expected. The BoB gaming community is sadly very toxic. One only needs to join the Discord community to find out that much. Anyway, here's my updated review:

Customization and environmental factors are still great and diverse. The new growth system of growing much faster at a cost is also a great implementation. It's nice to see some balance brought in so it's not just people growing relentlessly to huge sizes. When it gets to be too much you can also reset your growth back to 1.0 in size which then collects ""experience."" With this experience they want to, eventually, bring badges and cosmetics into the game and use the experience to pay for these things. If you die, you also reset back to a smaller size, I believe around .6? But you do not collect experience. 

Clans are not so much of an issue anymore and neither is needing to know people or having friend groups to play with as you can now enter the game and play as a solo creature to higher growths.

A big down side to this game? The community is toxic. This is still an early access game and I think a lot of people tend to forget what exactly that means. It's not polished or refined. Titania as it stands now has a lot of potential. The implementation of the very immersive and large chunk of map they released as well as the new sickness mechanic and having to actually pay attention to what you eat is great to see. I hope to see more updates in the future that encourage survival-based game play.

That said, I'm glad they're also implementing ways for their chill servers to still play and thrive and hope that they implement further server customization than auto-revives alone.",1625468463,1668746055,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

As of 11/17/22 The dev's have announced they will be re adding these features into the game as ""Free Roam"" I appreciate the dev's for listening to their community in order to make it a place where everyone can enjoy the game in a way they choose.  Take of this as you will

As you can see, I've spent a copious amount of time playing this game, and this is only the one account with almost equal hours on the other, and I've enjoyed a very large portion of that gameplay! I've made a lot of friends and had some really funny, fun, and special moments playing the game and meeting other players who I'm still in contact with daily. Unfortunately with the newest patch that is to be released the developers of the game have shown that the opinions of long-time players and their wishes mean very little to them. 

Over the past few weeks, they've turned a deaf ear to those who want some server customisation settings to remain in the game and have instead blown off every single concern with the reply ""This wasn't how the game was intended to be"" The alienation and blatant disregard for the player base, especially after many have bought multiple copies of the game in order expand their experience is downright disgusting shows a lot of the personalities behind the dev team and their care for their players. 90% of the player base played on private servers for the reason that they could choose the game play style THEY wanted within rule sets they wanted. 

Yet the dev team has called that level of customization ""Damaging to the gameplay loop"" when it's exactly what many players wanted and enjoyed. Sure the new game mode sounds like a blast for a short period of time, but arcade-type fast-paced game styles have no staying power for me (It was the reason this game appealed to me and I left the Isle) But I would much rather prefer to have the option of multiple games play styles available at all times.

At this point, I very much regret having bought any supporting merch and recommending any friends to this game and highly recommend you don't purchase the game either. If having the game mode/style you currently enjoy and love ripped away from you with little notice seems like something you're into, go ahead, because there's nothing saying they won't like the new game mode ""Gauntlet"" Either and just completely remove that from the players who come to love that game mode as well with just as little warning.",1665280810,1668738938,False,65,1,0.730442225933074951,0,True,False,True

It's extremely frustrating to grow a dinosaur for ages just for a small dino to come and tear you to shreds because it either caught you while resting (takes eons to stand up from that, in which case you are probably dead anyways) or just gets behind you and mops the floor with you.

Edit: This game also has the most toxic community i have ever seen. People will pretend to be nice then murder you, call you all kinds of horrible things, team up in big groups and laugh at you when you die and say it's your fault that your fresh spawn rex dies to 4 teaming dinos, saying its a skill issue.

BoB has weather, dino traits, droughts, and little things like that.  The traits are really cool and the water sources drying up forces you to move around.  However this definitely feels more arcady.  It also has the severe issue of butt riding.  Velo can take down a rex any day.  Just have to hop in behind the rex and he can't out turn you.  For that reason alone I don't like the game.  BUT theres many other dinos to play, but big carnis are unplayable specifically the rex. Rex is made to be ""the most powerful carnivore"" it's the weakest because it can't fight anything. It needs a tail whip to break bones to keep people from riding the tail. I can assure you this is NOT how things worked in prehistoric times. It's absurd to think the Tyrannosaurus Rex was killed by other dinosaurs chasing it's tail till he died. It's ok to give a powerful weapon/creature/vehicle (whatever) a weakness, but the weakness is so severe that it's worthless and in the real world a Rex would've never made it to adult if this ACTUALLY happened.

If i wanted to play the isle, i'd play the isle.

The strategy of doing what they want to do with the game; following their ""New Vision"" rather than listening to the community and supporting private servers keeps hurting the experience. Rendering several dinos unplayable and ""out of the meta"" for long periods of time makes it feel unbalanced and unplanned.

Some of you may recognize my name, or even recognize some of the communities I have been in such as Overgrown, The Burning Realms, Edge of Extinction, and Forgotten Realms. I was staff for 3 of the 4 listed servers here.

I want to do this review like I do all my other reviews, but before I do I do want to touch base that I do not hate BoB. I do dislike the dev teams direction with the game, but my biggest issue isn't the dev team either. Its the utter lack of sensible, realistic, and non-toxic staff, owners, and players of the community servers for this game. I will go into that in more detail however.

[hr][/hr]

[h1] Community Server Hell [/h1]

Look, as someone who has played on some of the largest servers of BoBs hayday, and been staff on them, I will come right out and tell you. No server is unbias. No matter how unbias they attempt to be, someone higher up on the chain will always have bias tendencies. Even if they claim they do not. I do not recommend the community side of this game AT ALL. 

To be honest, that is a real shame. It is almost to the games detriment that I, and many others, simply cannot recommend the community aspect of this game. When compared to the Isle there is on thing that should be evident, this game focuses much more on community, nesting, building groups, and allowing players to actually create friendships. The Isle's limitations on only being able to talk to your same species in game is not present here in BoB, making it possible for others to actually make a wide variety of friends, and encourage different types of gameplay. The largest, and arguably most unique, aspect of BoB is its community building.

However, BoB's devs do not care too much about the personally created communities, and instead opt for constantly revolving and changing mechanics. They are still unsure what they want the final product to be, leaving a lot of servers in a sort of limbo. It is not just that however. BoB's community servers are often left unchecked. Sure, I do not expect the devs to be constantly checking in on community servers. That would be unrealistic, but the fact that some servers can blatantly lie to the community, and abuse the power they have and be given no punishment is ridiculous. Someone who was known for admin abuse, killing and deleting dinos, and even banning players they didn't like? Their now a staff member for the OFFICIAL BoB servers. You know who you are. You know who I am. 

My point is, BoB does not care for the community that literally made them who they are. If not for the community, BoB would be like every other game of its typing, left in [u] Mostly Negative [/u] hell. To touch base, the 4 community servers I listed above are all dead now. Burned to the ground for the absolutely awful things they had done o not only their players, but their staff too. The owners of those servers will be able to make new ones if they so wish, and in almost all the servers above, they should not be allowed to do so. That is the opinion of a previous staff member anyway.

[hr][/hr]

[h1] How Is The Game Though? [/h1]

The game is really honestly your standard fair for this genre. You create a dino, either by literally CREATING the dino, or just selecting an egg. You choose an egg, you chill in it for a while till you hatch and you grow. You get inherits, either from your parents if you chose the egg route, or from randomly selected genetics if you spawn in as a dino. 

The game overall is more of an AFK style, that recently is trying to change that meta to more of an interactive standpoint. The largest issue with this, is that fact that they now punish long time players with large dinos. You could lose a 3.0+ dino to a game mechanic because you're too large to maintain your food. Why? Why would make a dino so large it literally CANNOT MAINTAIN ITSELF? Especially by changing the rules out of no where so that it literally just cannot maintain itself. That makes no sense to me. 

Regardless, there are some decent (only decent though) dinosaur selections. They have some skins, and there are special and rare skins out there that only people who INITIALLY supported the game in the early years of development have. These skins are not obtainable by any means other than mating, and will not be available for unlock again. Personally, its kind of silly but I suppose if you're going to pay nearly 2 grand for an apa skin.....

The gameplay itself is similar, but not the same as, the Isle. The Isle and BoB do not however suffer from the same issues. The Isle suffers from a pure lack of community, making it impossible to truly ever feel like you're a part of anything ever. You're just a deino floating down a river. Nothing more. BoB suffers from an utter lack of direction. Is it PVP? or PVE? Is it both? Is it trying to be casual? Or competitive? Is this more about exploration? Or more about survival? BoB literally does not know what it wants to be, and that makes it utterly impossible to know what the meta will be like 6 months from now. Right now, the meta is casual chill play. Will it be that way in 6 months? Who knows. The devs certainly do not want it to be casual and chill, so if they get a say (which they unfortunately do) that meta will indeed change over the next few months.

[h1] Summary? [/h1]

Basically, my TLDR; This game could be good if the devs would make up their damn mind about what its SUPPOSED TO BE. And if they actually tried to MIDIGATE the actually terrible community issues they have in some form or fashion. This game right now sits at a LOW fucking 4 for me. Its not a 3, the game is actually nice when you find a decent place to exist for a few hours, but the rest of the time it is a half assed nightmare that truly just feels like an amalgamation of all the worst aspects of the Isle, and then threw poorly managed communities ontop of it.

As it once stood, Beasts of Bermuda was a dinosaur survival game. Like POT or Animalia, it has somewhat of an ability system, a talent tree where you spend points. It also has a wide variety of dinosaurs on their roster, including Terrestrial, Fliers, Semi-Aquatic and Aquatic.

If someone asked me to suggest this game, I would of, but now I don’t. This is due to the newest update, where the developers introduced an entirely new system of life and a brand new large map! 
Doesn’t sound bad, right? 
Wrong.

Many people have been waiting for the newest map, Titania, for years now. However, on their discord, it was revealed that this new map would be locked behind a new arcade styled gameplay called “Gauntlet”. This is where you grow up to a certain point (1.32) and can then enter the actual gauntlet mode where you grow 15x, trying to reach the top of the leader board. Eventually, you are forced to be solo because your hunger is too great at that point, and you’ll mostly die of starvation. 

No sneak peaks, streams, nothing about this new gauntlet. This new system came way out of left field, and was not stated previously before hand or in the game description as what the developers wanted for their game. As far as the community knows, BoB was life cycle, like The isle. This completely came out of nowhere, and for many of the community members, was distrustful and wrong to do.

“It’s an early development game”. That might be so, but how many times do you see a game that’s been up for nearly 4-6 years change the basic premise of it with no previous insight that it was supposed to be this way? In the discord, the lead developer said that this is what was always intended, but not once were the community given any insight on that. 

Not only that, but many things were removed in favor of “What they see fit”, which includes Damage Nerf when having a high friendship grade with pack-mates, Removing Auto revives (Where your dino could be automatically revived upon death in your creature select), removing admin spawn growth storms (Buffed the rate you grow, which was great for realism or to servers!), Locking the new map on a arcade based mode and not making it optional, as many, MANY large servers have requested, but denied. 

Eventually, the old maps will be forced to switch to Titania and it’s Gauntlet mode, as many don’t wish to see happen.

They have not listened to their community nor have provided adequate information about their plans for the future of their game. They are driving in hopes a “New player base” will keep the game afloat, completely ignoring a large out cry of their community asking, pleasing and begging to not do what they have done.  

This isn’t a dinosaur survival game anymore. It’s essentially like a Worm.io or Roblox dinosaur simulator, just you never stop growing until you can feed yourself anymore.",1668107409,1668107409,False,11,1,0.564291417598724365,3,True,False,True

It has been quite a blow to the more relaxed servers with recent updates taking away a large chunk of their abilities to provide their servers with what they need in terms of food, growth storms, fun events, etc. 
I do not see the point in creating a game that allows its players to host their own servers, but then take away the ability to run those servers as they, the players and hosts, see fit.
The staff will not listen.
All they seem to care about is making the game played ""their way,"" and to heck with everyone else and their reasonable wishes.
I do not see BoB lasting much longer even with new updates planned when over half of their player base consists of chill players. They may keep a small number of bullies and people who suck up to the dev team, but is that really in the best interest of the game? I would think listening to your majority players would be a more sure-fire way to make the game the best it can be for EVERYONE.

For almost 4 years now the game run on a Lifecycle style, allowing for slower growth yet more to do whilst you grew your dinosaur. After these years the devs suddenly announced a change of gamestyle, introducing ""The Gauntlet"", an all new gamestyle that's essentially meant as an ""anti-afk measurement"" and to bring in a survival aspect (as if it didnt have that one before...)

In order to enfore the Gauntlet, they shut down a lof of the features servers had the ability to use to cater to their communities (especially autorevive and admin growthstorms) and warn people that they're about to play an ""outdated version"" of BoB when entering these Legacy servers that do not run Gauntlet.

They are making server owners and staffs life harder with taking away their abilities to enforce their servers gamestyle, even after gathering lots of negative feedback about removing autorevive and making Titania locked on Gauntlet.
We're constantly told ""we're reviewing all feedback, we read as much as we can!"" but nothing more. Maybe a casual discussion here and there, which is fine, but honestly? That's not enough right now...
There's many bugs that have been brought up several hundred times at least by now and nothing seems to happen. People cannot play Lifecycle because it's bugged to hell and back with the new patch and it's driving people away.

Oh, Titania? That's the new map. Too bad you don't get to play it if you're running your server on ""Legacy"" or don't like Gauntlet as a casual player. It's locked and unplayable if you're a simple Lifecycle enjoyer.
If you don't want to play Gauntlet & starve at growths larger than 2.0, you may pause growth at 1.32 and just hope the local 3.0 hardcore rex players aren't out to get you.
Because Gauntlet has a leaderboard for highest growth achieved before dying and believe me, this made the community so competitive that people are really pulling 17 hour sessions to grow.
Literally, this patch has changed nothing in regards of people supergrowing in long spans of time because in the future, you'll get rewarded for that!
Yeah, they plan on adding stuff to buy/get when you're above a certain growth and believe me, people will pull allnighters for these rewards.

The sad thing is, I don't mind Gauntlet at all. But removing admin access to viable commands and abilities and essentially (and pretty obviously) making ""Legacy"" servers boring with taking away anything fun they're really out to kill any server that is not Gauntlet.
A huge chunk of the community likes to paint these changes on ""clans and toxic kajiu dinosaurs"" as if only these two types are playing the game and enjoying old BoB/Legacy.
Many servers have a huge chunk of their community just being enjoyers of slowly growing your dino, nesting players, socializing and not being overrun or forced to stay at 1.32 in order to not starve.
""B-but everyone was so big already, how can I catch up as a newbie?? Now I can grow a rex in 15 hours on Gauntlet!"" yeah and everyone around you is hungry, so they'll eat you nontheless. There are many servers out there that are newbie friendly if people just looked for a bit instead of judging from the 2 servers they played on for 1 hour. 
Also, if you join a game that's been out for years of course people are larger and have better creatures. It's natural. You wouldn't join Overwatch and then whine how everyone that has played for years is higher ranked and plays in better leagues than you.

This game is not really newbie friendly, not even with Gauntlet. It's confusing, has many mechanics people don't grasp, you cannot eat without getting sick... 
A slower start into the game with communities that aren't competitive because of a leaderboard and staving creatures would be nice, but as we all know, Legacy/Lifecycle servers are full of AFK people that love to eat newbies with their 5.0 creature /s
As soon as Gauntlet has done it's part people will leave again, I guess.
I just hope that they won't forget who shaped their game and who brought players in, because it sure as hell weren't the Offical servers. 
Private servers made the game, kept it alive, and now they're getting spitted on if they don't run Titania and Gauntlet.

-The new map, Titania is beautiful, and the love the devs put into it is very clear.
-The dinos are great, their models and textures, as well as the freedom to customize them with pretty colors is astounding.
-The RPG elements are a nice touch.
-Being able to pick between carnivores, herbivores, as well as flying and marine reptiles is a big bonus not a lot of dino games have.


However, on the bad, there's plenty, namely the community.

The game is early access, and I feel like if you're going to pay for a game, it should be done. But, I'm patient, patient enough to where I hope I'll change this review to a positive one at one point further down the line, but, my patience with the players is a whole different story.

I hope this is just me, and not everyone when I say I haven't met a more toxic community of players in a dinosaur game, I genuinely wonder how some of these player's home lives are, and who fucking hurt them enough to go onto a dinosaur video game, and actively go out of their way to ruin fun for other players.

As of this review, I re-installed the game today to explore this beaituful new map, Titania, and within the first three minutes of spawning, and finding food, (which was bait, by the way) a pack of raptors swarmed and cannibalized me, before picking up my body, and leaving it in the same spot as the rest of the food they left out for bait.

- and before anyone comments, yes, they were fully aware of what they were doing, and they didn't hide it at all, I'm not happy with those players at all, but I'm more unhappy with myself for expecting the community to change after a while.

But keeping the theme of this toxic community, how is the PVP? Awful. Let's review what you can do in PVP:

What's the meta? Ass biting. What is ass biting? Shoving your face into the ass of an enemy player, and chewing on it until they die. How do you counter this? You don't. Your dinosaur's turn radius is very slow, even on smaller creatures, and for larger dinosaurs, such as T-Rex, or Charchardontosaurus, it's agonizingly slow. If they add a manual turning radius, this whole issue would be nullified, but, they haven't implemented this yet, and it's such a small issue, they likely won't notice it.

What are the other methods of combat? Not much outside of ass biting. Dinosaurs do have special abiltiies, like Lurdosaurus being able to charge as a good example, and it's likely why a lot of players play Lurdosaurus outside of it being new. All the other dinosaurus focus on attacking players from behind, because they know they can't do anything about it, and by the time they're fully turned around, they've already turned with the player to get at their back again, or they're already dead.

But there must be punishments for cannibalism, right? No. There aren't. Can you report players for cannibalizing you? If you're on a community server, yes. If it's official, ""Cry about it.""

So how do you avoid all of this? Make friends on the game as soon as you can. Get into a pack, and your chances of dying are significantly lower, but never zero. But you'll likely just be the one abusing people this time, and I say this very, very confidently, because especially for a survival game, where sometimes if you're a fresh spawn in a server, and you run into a group of much stronger, better equipped players and they kill you, you're just unlucky, and you have to mentally dust yourself off, and start over.

But not in this game. That group of better equipped players will ass bite you to death, say ""GG"" as if they did anything that was remotely skilled, and likely insult you afterwards, whether you were the same type of dinosaur as them or not. Bonus points if they're mix-packing with herbivores, because at least then they're being honest about their intentions in wanting to ruin other people's fun on a video game.

I've been here since everything looked like paper mache and the Utah was in the character select list in red letters but wasn't playable. It really has come a long way but yet fallen so far. There used to be passion and hope but now it seems that the only concern here is money. Beasts of Bermuda used to be a game that strove to be better than other dino games with more content, player originality, and over all more things to do than just grow and kill. That doesn't seem to be the case anymore. 

The Devs have stated that they think losing the original player base and gaining new players in their place is healthy. They no longer care about people who bought their game years ago because they already got the money from them. If they would actually sit and look at their player base as a whole and not just their new players they would realize that the old players are the ones buying from the shop and therefore can still help support the game. Also NEWS FLASH, old players are the ones rebuying the game for their friends or alt accounts. I myself have bought the game no less (but probably more) than three times for other friends to join and play with me.(not doing that anymore) In truth it is us, the original players, that are bringing you new players and if we leave your funnel for new players shrinks drastically. 

They also fail to realize the benefits that private servers give them because they do not receive as much money (if any) from them. But I would like to point out the fact that you can literally see how many people are playing at any given time. Private servers allow for there to be more players online than the game creators can provide which boost the numbers. Having a higher active player base increases the chances of new players coming in to buy the game. This means more people to buy from your store and increase the numbers further so an endless cycle of people coming in to buy your game and store products.

Game glitches, exploits, and bugs that have existed for years still don't seem to concern the developers at all. They've claimed to fix some but only have made them worse and created new ones. Some exploits aren't even considered exploits anymore but rather normal game play. They favor certain dinosaurs. These dinosaurs continue to get buffed meanwhile the less favored get nerfed. Sometimes to the point of unplayable.

For those who haven't played the game Saichania and Apatosaurus are meant to be herbivore boss battles, much like rex and acro are boss battles for carnivores. Yet the developers only consider these players to be food and nothing more. Yes it has been stated in official, herbivore players are only there to be food for carnivores. Acro is hardly a boss battle dinosaur anymore however, thanks to the newer player base who always choose rex to win. I have always considered Rex to be ""Baby's first dino"", well this just kind of proved it. 

Their reincarnation system was honestly a stroke of genius in theory but sadly not worth your time. I have repeatedly seen dinosaurs who are very small that don't do trials at all reincarnate and get literally GOD, meanwhile large dinosaurs with all champion trials (meaning they actually did more than sit on their rumps and grow) reincarnate to get Dog Water. The breeding system is ruined. Taking 2.0 critters, both with synced builds and five GP from each will no longer get you a decent dinosaur. You may breed all day and all of your babies get 4+s in inherits if they are lucky to not get a negative. For players who don't understand I'll make it a bit simpler and plain to understand. If your babies don't come out well nobody will want your eggs. So no baby buff for you. Congratulations, you found the perfect mate and you are both big with Good Parent, but your babies still come out the same as if you both were small with random builds and no GP.

The new Map that everyone has been long awaiting for is supposed to be a breath of fresh air, a new place to explore, and a more solid ground to walk on and not fall through. But the disappointment just bleeds from the seams that are duct taped and glued together to keep this game alive. The amount of loading that this game now suddenly has to do is ridiculous. You load into the server (without crashing) just to load in your character menu, to make a new dino you load the carnivores, then you load in a place to spawn, now lets load in your skins, good you've selected everything, now lets load in that you've spawned and oh wait you crashed. Just to get into the game you've loaded for 10 minutes, only to lag everywhere you go. Good luck finding your friends in this unfamiliar blip fest cause you really aren't moving anywhere and have no way to tell where you are going as land marks are almost non existent. Oh and the critter that you just worked days to get through this busted reincarnation process just died and you can no longer get it back because they took out the tedious work of reviving it. Auto revives are also gone so good luck chill servers, you can no longer support your players.

My take on this? It is the player that does nothing that gets everything meanwhile the player that actually plays the game without cheating and as intended gets nothing. Don't even think about breeding because your babies will all be garbage. Don't play Saichania because a rex doing exploits on you is considered normal game play now and expect to be nerfed again. Don't play apato because it can no longer protect it'self. 
(remember these are BOSS BATTLE DINOSAURS)
In fact, herbivores are only to be food so don't play them at all. 
(wonder what carnivores are supposed to eat when the herbivore population finally realizes that developers want them to just roll over and die. Oh yes each other ^^)

The Devs are so worried about their limited funds and having to go back to their original jobs that they are willing to dump their most valuable assets to their game's future, the original players and private servers, in favor of bugs and new players (a temporary fix) to keep the game in development and grab cash from them and hold out a little bit longer.

When a system is designed to gift the lazy and punish the players who play the game as intended the game is no longer fair (there for not fun)

When a specific player base is favored the other leaves (meaning the favored then suffer soon after and guess what? LEAVE)

When all players leave they take their money with them (when the money goes so does the game)

This is your future Beasts of Bermuda, you can roll over and let it happen with tears and a finger pointing in the opposite direction looking for someone else to blame or you can get up and do something about it.

Forgot to mention that the developers don't take well to their games being given honest and constructive criticism so I may get banned for this. If so I will be sure to save this review and put it up in other places. As well as taking it to Steam. But it doesn't have to. You could instead learn from this and take the time to improve yourselves and your game. Or don't and let things burn.

-Physics on some dinosaurs is down right broken. For instance, aquatic dinos can launch way too high into the air even with out the proper points allocated.
-Combat (while tail bites do a tiny bit less damage) is ultimately a butt biting competition and is more frustrating than engaging.
-The grouping system is nearly always broken and often times renders players unable to group even after restarting the entire game.
-Stress I somewhat enjoy, is forces players to follow unspoken rules and to seek shelter rather than camp hot spots.
HOWEVER sometimes it can be too much when it comes to some weather events. One moment you're walking, it's windy sure, but no threats in sight then you look and you're in the red.
-Balancing is all over the place and while I love the points system sometimes they feel too drastic.

Sure, some of these can be excused with a 'this game isn't meant to be realistic' and to that I say sure I understand that, and I know that it's not, after all you can be a bright pink rex and can pray to a shrine to become a horseshoe crab.

[EDIT]
So AFTER this recent update this game is going in a totally different direction and as a consumer I am NOT happy. The devs are completely disregarding their audience and doing things that are GOING to kill their audience base. They need to first understand their audience. And I get it, it's your baby, but when you release content for other people to experience you want them to have GOOD experiences. It can still be a survival game while being auto-revive. Removing damage debuff from friendship levels completely removes the need for that feature. What's the point of packs and herds if you can't protect each other from one another? If it's because of one dino then nerf said dino coughmegcough.

When asked why they weren't listening to their old player base, and the risk of losing those who were used to the old version of the game ( hint a lot ) one of the administrators, Mr. Spoon said: ""The thing is, communities and players constantly recycle. If we look at it from a practical point of view for any early access game, having a healthy cycle of new players, new communities replacing player and communities that no longer want to be part of the game because it's changed is actually a healthy thing believe it or not. A playerbase that doesn't recycle can stagnate and cause development issues simply cause no new players are coming in, therefore there is no new revenue, which means development slows down or halts because suddenly a game can't afford to pay for their animators, modellers or even themselves.""

So clearly the developers don't care about their playerbase.  Not only that, but it became blatantly obvious that the developers do not care for community servers because they do not profit from them. ""The only people a community server financially benefit are the server providers.  Again, this isn't to say that we don't appreciate private servers running on the game. But, I feel like people don't actually realize that the server providers don't actually benefit the games they run on the way people think they do."" 

Also, Predatoria said, ""I quit my job as an electrical engineer to work on bob full-time.  I do not want to have to go back to working a day job and delegate bob down to a hobbyist project again.""

Don't be fooled.  They only want your money.  And if that means making a whole new game to draw in more dollars so they can keep doing this.  What will they do when the game is done?  How will they draw people then?  How long will this stay in early access?  Just don't even bother at this point.

My server, my love, my entire thing i put into doin with my friends, my allmost familie, gets trappelt by the devs.
we were a half chill half pvp server with OUR OWN, FUN Map. I used to to maps on other games or design shit.

the map tool- poop. most assets are making it lag and i had to relearn everythign to make a GOODish map for our server.
the game itself. i LOVE it, it better that the isle and path of titans.

i used to love the devs, yes they where a bit wonky but that was the beast of  bermuda community was, wonky.
now the recent update... well made a BIG impact but in a bad way. we used to have a insta revive server so we could fight without fear and yes loosing your dino is part of the game but at the same time we grow fond or our littel ones, be it sparky the 5.0 itchty or our sammy the fodd apa.

my final note is.

buy the game. play with friends like i do, ppl you love and enjoy , make new connections and PLS

BoB is a nice dino survival pvp game in development, hanging between more accurate realistic looking models of creatures and less realistic gameplay mechanics. [b]If you want full realism in every aspect, then this game is not for you.[/b]

You can play solo or group with other players. You can play on official servers (sadly placed in east US only) with very minimal rules and default settings  or hop into community servers where you have to learn by yourself about their rules (you may want to join their Discord servers for full information) and customized settings. [b]If you want single-player experience, then it's not game for you obviously.[/b]

Game offers a lot of freedom in skin customizations, but if you don't want see rainbow dinosaurs of other players then simply head into settings and enable filter that will mute their too saturated colors to more mudddy shades (it won't affect how you see your own skin). Skins system also allows for having mixed skins when you hatch from egg, inheriting random colors and markings from parents. [b]But let's not forget that this is not a [i]dino breeding simulator[/i] game.[/b]

You can grow giant, but the bigger you get, the harder it becomes to stay alive because you get hungry and thirsty faster. Most of recent negative reviews comes from players who loves to spend too many hours on growing giants, especially on so called chill servers (where attacking other players is usually not allowed and most of players are often afk or just sitting in one place and chatting together) and with latest update it's faster to grow but is much harder to survive at bigger growth in the new version of life cycle mode. [b]But keep in mind, this game is not a [i]growing absurdly oversized dino simulator[/i].[/b]

The game is pretty, with the models being updated to somewhat accurate representations of dinosaurs. The game is picturesque, though leans a little too bright on the color scale. The combat is nice, and leaves options dependent on skills chosen with certain dinosaurs.

My reasoning for not recommending this game is that the developers do not usually listen to their playerbase when it comes to major changes or ideas. They leave it up for around 30 people to vote on within their own clique, and decide based on that or whatever the higher developers choose to do. 

This latest update is nice, great even, with the map and the various models and fixes, but it is soul-crushing in that they force everyone to conform to one play style over all, when in the past there were multiple play styles to choose from, which in turn generated interested parties from different play style enjoyers. 

With this new update, I have heard there there will not be updates to the older maps or game styles, so any one who wants to continue to play on the play modes they were in beforehand are just unlucky, and must either play with older un-updated servers or conform to the new somewhat more combat-centric play style the developers thought that everyone ought to enjoy.

I no longer want to be a part of this game community as closely as I had been before due to these specific changes in play style and previous decisions on the developer's part, as someone who does not like PvP and who struggles with competitions overall.

What the actual hell guys, this game is getting worse and worse by the update. The new growth system is a joke, the hunger/water is ridiculous, the restriction of admin/private server owners abilities to customize the game and have events to keep their own communities going and happy is being ripped from them. Like, this new map is big, but its laggy, why are their loading screens now? There use to never be a loading screen, and now here we are, back to the early 2000's with some loading screens. They do not seem to care about their community, the ones who built their game and got them to where they are. And now here we are, thankfully I didnt spend more money on this game.... And im a guy with over 7k in Star Citizen, at least I still have faith in SC, but BoB has now dropped off the radar of hope. Saddening. 




Ok not sure how to make this out. This is by far my favorite game to play. I am on it everyday and love playing the game. However after this last update, the sounds, are horrible. I have no other way to explain it. Just, the vibe it gives off is maybe, they recorded the new walking on grass sound with a low quality mic and walked/dug on some sand in minecraft? thats basically how i see it. Not only that but it seems I can no longer tell what direction something is coming from. It use to be, you hear a sound in your surround headset and you can look right to where that thing is. Now, I just spent 5 min running around jungle trying to find what was making the loud thundering sound, and finally found a full grow apa making its way across the island. What happened to the directional sounds? Maybe thats just me tho. The new dino size is, well, underwhelming. They use to make it so you could easily size something up and you would want to fight/not fight something based on their size. What use to be a show of pure work and time now is diminished. The talent point reset and renumbering now scales to size, so rather than getting a point to put into something at a specified growth rate it is,,, not sure. But large dinos lost talent points and smaller dinos gained points. This basically once again, takes away from the time you put into a dino and diminish your accomplishments. The time you have to put into a game and work on something can sometimes be very little. For someone like me that takes 5-10 times longer to grow a dino due to my work schedule means that losing work like that, is basically a slap in the face. Now one can argue, that means smaller dinos can catch up and it takes a lot longer to get ahead of the smaller dinos. Now age and experience doesnt get you as far ahead. Anyone can come along and grow a dino up in a few hours with a friend and find you in a bad spot and set you back 20 hours of growing. Guess I will just have to ""get good"" 

My favorite game. Went from being what I play 30+ hours a week, to not even sure I want to play it at all, in the matter of ONE update. Damn.",1647397721,1667612341,False,3,0,0.501639306545257568,0,True,False,True

Ive spent quite alot of time of this game and i loved the times that i had but with this new update i think its time to hang up the hat and call it quits. Players have been waiting YEARS for this new map update so ofcourse everyone was excited to hear it was coming soon. Except... the devs (just like with EVERY UPDATE AND PATCH) throw something in that ruins the game entirely. Right now theres a few options in the game that make it fun and enjoyable for EVERYONE. For example, servers can customize to the point where some can have 2x growth and autorevive so if youre looking to just kinda chill out and not wanting to play a fast paced survival server then you can. Well with the recent update coming this friday that will all change. They announced that there will be a new ""Gauntlet mode"" that will be forced onto players that want to continue growing their dino past 1.3 (adult). Now really the ONLY thing that set this game apart from the isle and path of titans was the infinite growth. But with this Gauntlet mode, it makes your food and water drain SO FAST that you literally cant do anything but search for food/water. Its not fun at all unless youre a hardcore pvp player, which, 75% of the pop in this game isnt.... The devs are pretty selfish only thinking about ""their vision"" for the game which yeah i guess go ahead its your game but they players are what make your game ALIVE. The community is also toxic as hell so if you have a child that wants to play i wouldnt reccomend. You go to their discord and its nothing but the hardcore pvp players insulting those that just want to have a fun time. They cried and cried that auto revive was ""taking over the game"" (which... is a good thing? people really enjoyed it????) but now that its being taken away and people are upset, they are insulting those that are upset about it even though they were just whining the same way about it being there and the devs/admins never say a word. I garuntee 90% of the positive reviews here are them and their 20 alts trying to review bomb to make it look like people enjoy these updates, but i promise you its only a handful.  A good chuck of the games population right now is chill based, and with the update coming im seeing more and more people drop from the game as this new update will make chill servers harder to function. What do the devs have to say though? ""we didnt make this game for chill servers"" 

Okay so great way to say ""fuck you"" to alot of your loyal players. Its honestly laughable at how badly the devs are ruining their community and game.  I honestly wish i could be offered a refund for the 300+ hours i lost to this game.

Devs will add options for private servers only to take said choices away months later because its ""not how the game was intended to be played."" Okay but then why give the option? Despite server owners paying to run said servers the devs shove their playerbase into the dirt and force those servers, that should have choice, to run exactly like official servers do, it is miserable. If anything, the ability to customize a gaming experience is essential for games such as this, something the path of titans devs understand fully.

How come hardcore BoB players and the devs of this game are scared of giving the playerbase choice and options, yet PoT isn't? Despite its own flaws, PoT has its own vision and doesn't compromise on said vision, but the devs of that game understand they have a wide variety of players with different playstyles and criteria to enjoy their experience that may be  different from their own vision of their game. In turn those devs offer a wide array of server customizing abilities, which goes a long way to crafting a completely different gaming experience if that community wishes. Tired and want to take it easy? There are servers that are made exactly for that! Want hardcore gameplay? Well they have that too, and its made possible by these amazing server custom options. The devs can make the game they want, but us players can CHOOSE the gameplay style we want for that day, or even hour before we switch.

Yet BoB devs like to force everyone to play one way, removing most, if not all, private server customization, essentially forcing these server owners to pay to run an official server, its actually rather scummy. They have that same ""my way or the highway"" attitude that the isle devs have, leading them to not listen to any of the players, even those that state their concerns respectfully. Do you like 2x growth? Well too bad, it will probably be removed as an option in months because these devs have a track history of giving server customization options, only to rip them away when a good chunk of the playerbase has already grown attached. 

For a game that's supposed to be a dino SURVIVAL game, all the changes coming with titania, and may even come to the rest of the maps, that are NOT optional for private server owners may I remind you, makes this game feel more like a battle royale, favoring fast pace PVP gameplay, and literally no other aspects. Might as well just go buy primal carnage at this rate with the way this game is going, cause it seems that's the desired gameplay, just without humans of course. Except, in primal carnage you can respawn and jump straight into the gameplay right away after you died. Whereas Bob, if you die five minutes after hitting 1.2, you'll get clapped by a nested in superfreak with godly talents, and you are forced to restart your growth, taking another few hours to be MAYBE viable in a fight.

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn.
Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I...

My own opinion of the game:

I myself find this game great and is one of my favorites of the 3 DSG So Dino Survival Games. Among them are The Isle Path of Titans and Beasts of Bermuda, but everyone has his own favorite.  I like to play BOB with friends, alone it is very difficult. Playing on community servers is at your own risk.  However, even on community servers there are good servers that are fun to play. I personally use a community server, because the growth of the dinos is usually faster than in the offi. 

Gameplay:

The gameplay of Bob I find very interesting and fun, but it also sometimes leads to frustration. There are environmental disasters that can make the difference between life and death. This feature is not yet available in The Isle and Path of Titans. Nesting is also fun and was something special from the start. There are also different effects that the dinosaur can get, from diseases to full belly, there is much to remove these effects (if they are bad) you can take herbs, plants to get healthy again.

Criticism:

There are of course still a few bugs but most of them are harmless and make you laugh.  BOB might be a bit too hard for some people, especially for beginners, because they get killed all the time. Also about the balancing you can argue, because there can be players where the dinos are over 3.0 growth but you have to play for a very long time, a beginner has no chance. The community is also rather toxic on the road, especially in offis where there are almost no rules. Many players kill you then for no reason or even as a herbivore although you are the same species or also a herbivore.


Recommendations to you:

My recommendations to you is if you want to play Beast of Bermudas, then best with friends not alone and look for community servers that you find sympathetic.

Right now private servers can edit the map and also the confiq of the server, but with the new patch coming out, any future maps coming out, private servers will not be able to confiq the server the way their community likes. 

This is what made bob different from the other dino games.  The ability to customize your sever.  The Devs are leaving us in the dust.  Now it will be just another isle/POT clone.  From a marketing standpoint and game design, why take out what makes your game unique?  

I love to pvp but i also love to chill and be on servers that have settings i enjoy.  Over half of the population plays chill, and they are about to lose half their player base.

The lead dev can be very rude and blunt on their official discord showing that he only cares on his vision and not the player base in my opinion.

I hope the  devs listen to their playerbase and keep their private server confiqs the way they are right now on live.

Yet despite that I found a wonderful group of friends who helped me learn the game. Some of these friends I still know today.... That being said

I can no longer keep my opinion to myself, having watched Pred turn a blind eye and protect devs who victim blame and tell people who come to them with serious concerns that its 'not their business' Lets say some of those accusations were indeed false, the brutish way the BoB staff have handled these is a absolute PR nightmare. And I will tell every parent I know that has a child 'DO NOT LET YOUR CHILD PLAY THIS GAME' it is toxic, holds a primal 'tribe mentality' and there are a lot of very bad people who would do horrible things to your kids. Staff have responded to valid concerns with 'Well it didn't happen on our servers so there is nothing we can do' the problem is, these people met their victims BECAUSE of your server.

All of this is horrible enough on its own, but now that people are speaking out about it Pred is hard code banning people from his game until they change reviews which is breaking Steams TOS, and, is a violation of freedom of speech, simply because someone, who clearly stated it was quite possibly simply a rumor, stated that there 'was word around the grapevine' that pred tried to stiff Grumpy out of his money. Which in my opinion the case was moreso that pred was asking grumpy to do something without payment for it, grumpy denied this and pred's reaction was to throw a tantrum and deny grumpy's payment. But being it is my OPINION, there is nothing pred has against me legally. Also the fact that after strong-arming a player by hard code banning them from the game until the point where they change a part of the review you tell them, and i quote ""Also, for the record, it's pretty shitty to throw up a negative review of a game you literally spend 10 hours a day playing..."" is not only abusive but just plan harassment. Yes pred, how dare someone not like your game but still want to play with their friends.... how dare!

Preds response to this? Well i cant prove it but it seems that conveniently after everyone posted a response speaking out about this HIGHLY illegal atrocity of preds strong-arming and bulling of legitimate reviews he would have not bothered the time with had the review not been getting so much positive reactions. A surprising number of on liner positive reviews such as '2+2=5' and many others from players who have less than 15 hours total play time start appearing.... almost like a attempt at vote padding, though perhaps I'm simply reading in between the lines...

When a Dev of a game turns a dino simulator into a hunting grounds for staff and FNG clan members perhaps those looking to buy the game should purchase a blender, then stick your money you would have spent on this game in that instead, you would get more out of your purchase then.

To start off the developers of this game do not listen to their community, what once was planned to be a dino survival game is planned to turn into an arcade type game that requires you to be more pvp oriented. Despite the community actively advocating for these changes not to happen the leading developer came out with statements which are summed up to he doesn't care and that because the game is a beta he plans to make the changes regardless of the communities uproar. 

The real kicker about this is that these communities of players who are against the changes were kept in the dark for so long about any changes. We've been eagerly awaiting a new map to drop 'Titania', a map that has been teased for over a year (going on almost 2)  only for it to be locked behind a new gamemode that is unfamiliar to it's entire playerbase and is --NOT OPTIONAL-- says the lead developer Predatoria. 

As a player I personally feel as if this should be optional, and that's all a majority of BoB's community is asking for. But they've never cared about their community, updates are far and few with more and more upsets than positive feedback with each and every one. 

I recommend you not waste your money if you were interested in a dinosaur survival game. I only wish I could be refunded for mine.",1664396544,1664396544,False,14,1,0.579943835735321045,0,True,False,True

The game is essentially nothing more then a meat grinder fueled by the rng hell that is the inherit system. There is very little communication on what updates will hold, nerfs and redesigns that completely change the main gameplay loop come without warning, sometimes rendering weeks or for some months of progress nonexistent unless you wish to grind to the new growth that is required to have your points back.

Be aware that the game will continue to punish you for investing time and playing it seemingly every update, while continuing to reward those who have given it far less. Its horribly unoptimized, they nerf dinosaurs into complete unviability where they are often stuck for weeks to even months despite outcry, there hasn't been a public test the past few updates, patches come out with with bug after bug despite apparent testing, and we're still stuck with bugs that have been around for months, or even years.

I can't recommend it what-so-ever, but if you still wish to play give it another 10 years so that it can escape Early Access hell and decide what it wants to be.

I do not recommend joining in at this point due to the fact that you will continuously be dissapointed as your favorite dino gets nerfed more and more until eventually it is unplayable.

1: The game is buggy as fuck. People can so much as lose a rare dino or a dino they've put shit tons of work into because they've fallen through the map and theres no way to get out. you can eat a tree and get stuck in the resulting mesh because for some reason the devs made bare trees twice as large as the ones with leaves. Sometimes you eat and it just doesn't do anything. sometimes you'll be flying through a cave and get immediately killed for no damn reason. you jiggle through the ground, sometimes rocks don't act like rocks, some abilitys just don't wanna work when you need them to. ect. ect. its the most unstable game i've never played and I have nearly 6,000 hours in ark. I know unstable.

2: Imbalanced as fuck. Some dinos are just bad. Lurdosaurus and Parasaur are both slow and incapible of fighting back, itchy is slow on land and basicly gets bullied in the water by the aquatics, pteras are just moving buffets for tropeos, and Saichania are just all defense. meanwhile you have the coah, a dino that can shoot you across the map by just looking at you funny, the rex, a large tank with several chainsaws attached, the mosa, a dino that can grab pretty much every other dino, even ones it looks like it shouldn't even by able to move, and drag them into the ocean, and the velo, a running bullet with a hitbox half its size. all of the abilitys in this game are so cartoonishly over the top I can't even take it seriously. jumping out of the water is cool and realistic for a marine creature. being able to turn yourself into a rocket is not. Velociraptors where fast. not fast enough to run at the speed of light and launch themselves across the ocean.

3: The devs make inconsistant, wildly sweeping updates. Recently they've made some dumb descisions in their updates they do make, see other reviews for that, and thats even if they update at all.they just keep throwing out teaser after teaser after teaser after teaser with the promise of ""SOON! we promise! heres another meaningless video/screencap of yet another thing you've already seen last year! we promise! we're working on it!"" over and over. they tie smaller updates into larger projects, meaning if you're waiting for your favorite dino to get a rework, or for them to add a new feature, thats just too bad. they're gonna release it with the huge map update that will take them 3 fuckin years to even get halfway done. and when when they inevitably remove a beloved feature of the game they'll make the sorry, transparent excuse of ""We never expected players to use the features in the way we coded and finalized into the game and that where perfectly fine untill right now when we decided we hate our playerbase, fun, and our game!""

4: Community is hostile as fuck. the pvp servers are full of some insanely toxic people (What you killed me how DARE you I will revenge kill you then scream to admins when you kill my 6 adult trexes), as expected, but pve or ""chill"" is just as bad if not worse. Today i've finally decided to leave the hellhole of a chill server I found myself in. everyone there was cliquey, hostile, toxic, and on the level of a highschool bully. if they don't like you, IE you stand up for yourself when you're called names or insulted, you're one of the ""bad ones"" if you don't completely suck up to everyone and tolerate being talked down to and excluded from everything. admins flat out ignore you if you need help or ask a question because you're not one of their precious patreon subs or you don't give them free art or regularly serenade them about how they're such good admins. even though they barely ever do their job and theres like 2 people out of 10 who actually do admin work. ntm cowtowing to everyone with a shitty pc when they complain about lag and ruin the experience for everyone else. ""hugs and kisses mradmins OwO I drew ywe dwino. can I have a free reskin pleasies? also this person didn't let me walk all over them can you sabatoge them? also the cave everyone hangs out in is lagging my trashware pc pls remove X_X"" its the same in every damn server. choosing a server in this game is just picking what flavor of bullshit you want to endure. 

This isn't even mentioning that you can litterally pay the devs thousands of dollars to make any dumbass change you want them to. this is why the coah, a creature that didn't even have the teeth to chew meat, is an obligate omnivore. you want a firebreathing tapajara? a flying stegosaurus? maybe a titanoboa that can grant wishes? well its yours, just pay the devs $7k and they'll add it for you! doesn't matter what the other players think about it. and if your precious overpowered creature needs a nerf, don't worry. they'll just nerf acro again and call it a day.

This game has probably one of the most toxic player bases I've ever seen. It reminds me a lot of ARK in all the worst ways.
The amount of players also seems to have gone down since the last time I played. I remember that the official servers used to be packed, but now there's only like... 10 players?
I also agree with the other reviewers who say that the game is VERY unfriendly to new players. I wouldn't exactly call myself a noob, but I'm more of a casual player. Still, you'd probably have to be some kind of ultra-pro to even have a chance in a fight.
To be honest, I can be a good sport about being KOSed, but what I'm NOT ok with is being insulted afterward.
I wanted to get better at evading or defending against other players, but the wiki is really unhelpful. I also don't really feel like I've learned much from most of the times I was killed, since usually I was basically just at the wrong place at the wrong time.

Dinos are unbalanced. Comunity is mostly toxic ( there were people that would create a comunity server, admin abuse and then record it for youtube to get views ) and made of private friends groups ( experienced and mostly skilled players ), they would create a gang of 2.5+megs or 2.5+ acros with insane stats, and then absolutely slay every other dino on the server. That just takes away so much fun because usualy you play with random players who dont know how to fight ( thats why server dies, people just are so scared to lose their dino to them that they will log off as soon as they see them online ). You cant even join an old server because everyone is 3.0+. Lately there are no good survival servers just deathmatch or chill ( you just sit there afk going nothing ). Theres a pattern in that game - a comunity server is made then it dies after 30 days and you lose all the dinos you have. Official servers are pretty much dead. There are hackers in this game using cheats that shows other player locations for a long time, people know about it but theres no way to prove it to report it to devs even in spectate as admin. Nesting is knda useless now its only for colors because reincarnation is just way better.

Realy i dont know the way to fix this game i was enjoying this game way more before sai update, it went from enjoyable survival game to sweaty pvp and targeting 24/7. I was enjoying the only 1 dino slot with perma death. I think its the comunity and balance issue. I would like to see a nerf to acro heal and stress resistance ( maybe put it higher in the survival tree ) and fix its hitbox, remove friendship damage reduction, buff to sai walking speed, a new herbivore between para and pachy to counter megas maybe a maia from the isle ( paras are just snacs to megas just 6 of em stack on 1 and when a meg bite a pachy for 350 health 30 inj and 50 stamina damage what is it suposed to do ). Buff to elasmo health its just 2 shot even at 2.0 and no they arent the fastest marine it doesnt matter anymore with the inherits. Right now aparto is just a joke it was a great dino that people loved to play and sudenly turned into the least favourite. Jungle trees ( the uneadible ones ) everyone hates them they have to be eather removed, remade or enable to knock them down.

I saw new map sneak peak i dont think the amount of work is going to be rewarding at the end i think its just going to be a combined copy of all the previous maps without any outstanding new biomes, new rocks, cliffs or terrain. Im not excited for new comming lurdu remodel, devs didnt show any of the special abilities for it and if its going to stay like it was its going to be absolute garbage.

I tried to give this game a chance several times but I am just not feeling it. It feels empty and not that good imo. Maybe it's just not for me but if you are a true legacy player of the isle you'll never want to play this game. Just play The Isle if you want to play a GREAT dinosaur survival game and read this comment before you buy... i had high hopes for this game as I saw some youtubers play it, I wanted to give it a go and just nope I'd rather get my money back. The weather system with the floods, fires and tornadoes are pretty cool though!

No,
To anyone who is new to the game, it's not for the faint hearted. The amount of toxicity within the community is disappointing. Too much slander, clans, targeting, harassment, server staff abuse, etc.
If you want to play it for fun good luck to you, there are very few nice player groups.
If you care about your time this is not the game. It takes hundreds of hours to get good dinos that stand a chance against big super bred clan dinos and even then you don't really stand a chance.

-Ignoring their player base on an early access game
-pc requirements listed do not allow the game to run smootly (Amended after DX12 was added)
-recent changes cause it to be near impossible to know if you can hunt a target safely
-when you've been killed you lose your dino unless the server has auto revive on or the server allows requested revives
-added a debuff on top of size changes so people can't hang out in caves but at the same time the size change was so people can take shelter in caves.... (make it make sense)


overall 1/10 it's become a shitty guessing game with no real winner and the only real reason to play is hanging out with people you know on chill servers (no killing allowed) I'll continue to play so i can hang out with friends but until the recent changes are fixed i will not remove my review.

 fun fact this is my first ever review meaning this game is so bad right now that I went ahead and took time out of my day to write a review, if that's not an indication of how bad this game is I don't know what to tell you.

On 15.03.2022. A decision has been made to drastically change growth scaling after 1.2 growth without a community poll or any kind of vote, when the community spoke out, the developers started locking channels and banning people from their official discord server.

TL:DR; i usually dont make serious game reviews but this is by far the best dinosaur creature simulator game out there rn (IN MY OPINION, OBVIOUSLY, THIS CAN CHANGE IN THE FUTURE) if you can get past the ""cartoony"", colorful graphics (which i personally dont mind, you dont have to be brightly colored if you dont want to) and occasional drama between children who probably play the game all day and never log off lol Beasts of Bermuda has great game mechanics for its genre which will never leave you mindlessly afking in a bush for hours on end, i strongly recommend this game if youre looking for a break from the isle or interested in refreshing, interactive game play from the dinosaur role-play game genre

pros: weather/natural disaster system (tornadoes, floods, lightning storms as of this review), the nesting system is absolutely fantastic and feels rewarding at times as both parent and baby, TALENTS (FINALLY, A REASON TO GROW FOR REAL TIME HOURS ON END IN A CREATURE SIM), flying and aquatic game play that has decent and pretty fun controls, buff/debuff system which can boost/hinder your dino's quality of life forcing you to actively seek out fresh food or herbs to keep up comfort, some dinosaurs have combat abilities (sai or anky has a shield reflection ability that reflects bite damage back to the attacker for example) which makes combat more interesting, active developers with an active discord that posts development updates 

cons: this community loves drama and making a big deal out of their pixel dinosaur dying so be prepared for toxicity as always, there arent a lot of active servers (maybe ~4-6 active servers with at least above 40 people on the daily) and you may see many of the same faces which could be a negative thing with the somewhat toxic player base, again this game is relatively new and thus lacks a lot of graphical and audio polish so if youre looking for ultrarealistic dinosaur simulator 2020 id suggest finding a different game lol, also no allosaurus in game yet come on devs, pls <3",1591234845,1661552179,True,6,2,0.559821724891662598,0,True,False,True

Even the skin system is great and the RPG like elements with the builds can be good. However thats where the good parts of the game end. Every server is full of people just sitting in caves or on a rock somewhere AFK growing. Why? Because the only way to kill something or defend yourself against something is if you have the bigger dinosaur. This devolves the game into a mess of server admins who play favorites with players who have the largest dinosaurs on their servers. Want to hunt another dinosaur? Good luck hunting the player who has spent hundreds of hours of just sitting in a cave AFK. Want to have a fair playing experience like The Isle or Path of Titans? Good luck getting half of the staff of community servers to side with you over their friends. 

Overall, the game has a lot of good parts and it truly can be fun. But if you don't have the time to spend just sitting AFK while in a discord call for several hours on end instead of going out and doing the very things that make games like The Isle, Path of Titans, or even Animilia Survive then don't bother buying the game.

Because how the game currently is casual players basically CAN NOT play with much enjoyment. I can not tell you the amount of times I’ve died because someone picked a meg or mosa or megaraptor or tropes and there friends grew to unnaturally large growth sizes and I could not have done a thing to fight back except try to grow to a unnatural size as them, or play velo or ory that are optimized for AVOIDING anything bigger than it. This basically means that means that the less agile giant herbivores and carnivores are not available to have fun with as any giant megarap or Meg pack will shred threw you.  And sense the “consequence” to getting bigger is having a bigger stomach more than likely anybody who is this big and a carnivore will kill you on sight regardless if your there own. Honestly I would love this game 10x its current state if any server had a growth cap of 1.5 or something cus that would make it Much more casually viable than its current state. TLDR if you don’t have time to grind a dinosaur game, get the isle, better looking and better gameplay for a anyone who doesn’t have “a second life for grinding”.
But idk maybe I’m gonna overdose on copium any second now 🤷

I've been playing actively for 8 months or so, on various servers. My first experience playing was struggling to survive on the Officials. Yeah, don't play those, they are FULL of toxic, rude and aggressive people who KOS, rulebreak and do not play fair. 

The game is a survival game, YES, i expect PVP, but the Official servers are absolutely godawful and a joke, rampant toxicity and KOS'ing is not fun or fair.

I am a fan of AFK growing, I often play with friends and enjoy chill servers or fair rules survival servers where I can enjoy game play and don't feel like quitting because people are making the space hostile and unfair. There is a huge difference between fair PVP and being toxic and rude. 
I like survival servers with auto revives on, most! Although I AM a fan of survival gameplay, perma death after months enjoying an animal you have grown sentimentality attached to isn't fun to me. Unlike the Isle's flat rate of growth, where I know ""I'll be grown in x amount of hours and if I die its less work to get that size again""  BoB takes much longer to get big and it's a matter of months, longer. (I love infinite growth though, its unique!) 

Some may disagree, but I personally find BoB more of a comfort and chill game and would rather relax and breed for inherits/duel friends, try for rare skins, and PVP WITHOUT permanent loss and having to start over from the bottom again and again. Auto Revives ON makes this game better! 

Pros: 
-Beautiful setting, the environment is fun to explore and take screencaps of, I feel immersed and relaxed 
-Heavily customizable skins and fun breeding for mix skins and rare skins!
-Map editing 
-Environmental dangers (tornadoes, flood, fire) keep you engaged and immersed (and sometimes scare you lmao)
-Sound design 
-More gameplay features than similar games (Breeding mechanic, skins, inherits,  customization, abilities to spec into, weather system that impacts your animal, infinite growth, upcoming lore?) 

Cons: 
-Official servers are a JOKE, don't play them, they're 1000% toxic and stupid, it's not worth your time. 

-Steam/BoB currently are having crashing and lag issues, especially on heavily customized maps, it's super frustrating atm 

-I wish playables released faster, and PLEASE I beg, give us more slots, 6 is not enough, especially with several new animals planned in future! 

(Half joke) BoB give us the Utah, we want itttttt, hand over the giant fluffy!!

There's a staple 'no mixpacking' (grouping up with species you shouldn't) to make kills rule, which sounds fair enough at it's surface. However, they have few to no systems actually coded into the game to prevent this, either via damage reduction through long term proximity to players you shouldn't be hanging out with, or by implementing a ""reduced damage from multiple sources"" sort of setup. There is a stress system in place to stop you from sleeping right next to your enemies, but this doesn't seem to be enough for the developers.  

This situation turns a fun dinosaur survival game into a crime and punishment simulator, wherein socially disadvantaged players make a whole game out of ""catching you in the act"", crying mixpack at every inconvenience. You must either obsessively record your gameplay and report any infractions against you by literally turning footage in on a third party discord server, or raw dog the server (the manly path) and accept whatever inconveniences come your way.

I can only imagine how much actual dev time is taken away from this project on the sheer merit that official staff are forced to review crime scene footage and pass judgement based on hearsay.

A lone Coah crossing the desert should be unsurprised to find velociraptors nipping at his heels, only to turn north and get charged by an acro that's not even aware the raptors are around. As it stands, all these hungry predators that just wanted some meat are now criminals.

Criminal Dinosaurs.

There's a lot of fun sapped directly out of the gameplay because of this; The drama of getting your kill then having to chase the raptors that wanted it in the first place is a situation that can only occur by breaking the rules. Why?

I don't want to respond to a police report because I killed something when I was hungry. I want to be a dinosaur.

Not only does it often crash my graphics card, it has come extremely close to blue screening my computer on multiple occasions. If the developers considered optimizing their game even a little, it would be on its way to a good game.

1. Poor moderation on official servers. Hackers and harassers unchecked.
dev gives little to no care to the moderation of official servers. I've experienced hacking, harassment, and foul behavior all of which has gone unchecked. They expect you to use a buggy recording system that crashes your game when you fast forward, so that's hour(s) of watching footage just to hope you're sending the right video. And even after all of that frustration, you have to hope the support team can actually realize what's going on and get the target banned, which doesn't happen that often unless the rulebreak is something even a toddler could notice.

So, let's say you actually got that foul person banned. Well guess what? They'll be back. Pretty damn fast too, might get a week of safety from that person if you're lucky. Then they'll come back and target you again so you have to hope you can get them banned by repeating this process all over again.

They do NOT moderate their own servers, so they never log onto their servers to check for any suspicious behavior. They simply let it happen, and the only sufferer is YOU, the player.

Yes, unofficial servers are an option, but most of them add so many rules that playing just isn't as fun as it could be. Official rules could be solid if they actually enforced them, but they don't because they clearly don't care.

2. Too much time to get a good character, easily lost in mere seconds
It takes months if not actual years to get a good character grown just for it to be wiped down to a day of progress with one fatal blow. As I've said before, there are hackers and people who will generally target you and your big dinosaurs. I'm all for pvp but having people log out their creatures so they can ESP hack you from across the map just to log in and ambush you is not even close to a fun multiplayer experience, not to mention hard to report without video evidence which many players are unable to get.

Combat in general becomes less fun when you realize you're about to lose months of hard work because you were forced to fight the wrong guy. This happens more often because official servers absolutely allow birds to scout for other players despite 'mixpacking' (two unpackable creatures working together to hunt) being against the rules. Contradictory if you ask me.

3. Balance makes combat frustrating and not fun at all

Poor balance isn't fun here. It tries to combine realism with multiplayer combat and it doesn't mesh together well at all. Most 1v1 scenarios are one-sided and the game not balancing itself around these is already enough to be a bad experience. We have a creature who can 1v1 anything and win with this trait only being justified because it is slow. And a creature who can pull you into the water to drown you with absolutely no way to fight back (you cant even attack while drowning. Fun, right?)

The rules play into this as well. You can have a raid of 100 rexes working together to hunt on an official server (their max pack limit is 4) but if a singular rex chooses to work with a velo they get banned. This is in no way balanced and very contradictory yet again and makes little sense.

0/10, having me and my friends be constantly harassed coupled with bad balance and massive loss of progress per death makes for a bad experience. Don't buy this game, it's not worth the suffering.",1659530989,1659531253,False,13,0,0.569803893566131592,3,True,False,True

Steam has finally asked me for my opinion of the game, as I'm uninstalling, lets give you a 9 month, total of  2500 hour, ""I bought this 3 times"" review.

Despite what I'm going to say further down, I LOVE this game, So we will start out with the good.

The Gameplay, while basic, is engaging and the combat gets your heart pumping. The Customization, both in play-style and in appearance of your dinos lets you play how you like. Want to be a stealthy T-Rex stalking through the underbrush? 100% doable. Want to play an Apatosaurus who can outrun the above rex? Also doable. Even more wacky things like ""Jag-rex"", an T-rex build that plays semi-aquatically are up for grabs and usable. The Limits are endless. While there are some rules on the Official severs, none are over-bearing, And if you don't like them, there is also community servers.

Before I continue, I'd like to give a shout out to a few of the mod-team, as going forward I seem to have a less then shining opinion of them. Official server mods Zunaria, Skoll and TeaTimeJess, and Official server Admin Mr.Spoon, Ya'll are great, and I'd like to thank you for putting up with my regular drunk ramblings in global chat, and the sheer amount of shit the community gives ya'll. Ty so much.

But where there is good, there is also the bad

Now, if you are on an Official server, you are basically REQUIRED to have a recording software of some kind if you want to report any rule-breaks. No the Xbox game-bar that comes default with your copy of windows 10 won't cut it, the anti-hack blocks it.
Since I installed coming up on 10 months ago, I've been in 2 server-wide civil wars (one of which is going on right now) which have caused who knows how many people to refund the game already. Both could have been stopped if the mods didn't turn a blind eye to problems for fear of being called racists. 
Most community servers are either dead (population of 10 or less) or stricter then need be with their rules

Before you buy, things to keep in mind/ get in advance : 
-Get Medal, OBS, or some other third party recording software other then the Xbox game-bar
-Keep in mind, you are going to die, ALOT. Don't get discouraged if you die
-Find yourself some friends to play with. This game basically requires you find yourself some friends, Solo play is NOT enjoyable and you will burn out quickly
-If you play on the Official servers, ALWAYS Ask for an Admin ticket, most mod staff has shown over the past 9 months to be as reliable as a dull pocket knife.

Since the game is only multiplayer there is no other experience than 3 kinds of servers:

Free pvp, where everyone who is bigger than you one shots you out of existence even if you take the slowest and tankiest dinosaur because the game has no balancing.

Semi-PvP where server rules determine you either only hunt or fight when you are starving or those where you are allowed to hunt realisitc.. just that herbivores are allowed to mix in heards and coas or sai alone can put out 3 carnivores by themselves so you either hunt other carnivores which is extremely rare or you try hunting 10 different herbivores in one group because servers like ""Karma"" do not follow their own herd size rules

No pvp server where you sit around all day to make your dinosaur bigger and maybe do PvP duels which are just as exciting as watching someone play the game like that.

You either play one of the broken dinosaurs or you are just something to bully for others. You are either a OP killing machine that can take out smaller carnivores, such as the velo, just by being around them with stress and intimidation which basically means you die by being around a bigger dinosaur (Very funny as velo or bird btw). Or you are something that makes fun to play such as the divebomb Pteranodon.. just that you divebomb, will die 90% of the time because its hard to pull off to not crash into something or getting hit when you try to hit a dinosaur just to deal 1/3 of the damage the OP dinosaurs would do.

The game basically: Die to everyone or sit around and do nothing, both takes hours if not days of playtime.

But before I dissect why I don't like this game and why I don't think more people should get it, I'll praise some of the things I can appreciate. 
- Diverse roster of playables
It's refreshing to be able to play as terrestrials, aquatics, or flyers. 
- Talent tree
It's nice to be able to customize how you want to play- to an extent*. (* = if you play PVP, you're likely just going to go one specific build that almost everyone else has if you want a chance at surviving.)
- Skin system
Honestly my favorite part of the game. The way skins can mix and mutate is phenomenal. Well done.
- Configuration/customization
Since I've started playing and the time I'm writing this, the developers have increasingly listened to player feedback and added more server customization and commands. People can add stunning features to already existing maps and gives players some variance in the maps they play. Also well done.

What I don't like about Beasts of Bermuda, and why:
- Balance issues
This is an ongoing complication that can understandably have some lenience as the game is early access. A lot of the scaling is broken, and though they keep trying to chip away at this scaling issue the developers have yet to be successful. I personally wouldn't recommend trying to put up with it until they do balance it, just to save your mental health.
- RNG
The very reason I am writing this review in the first place. Ever since the trials system and reincarnation were implemented, more and more hours have been siphoned out of people simply because your rewards aren't really up to you- just a random number generator.
You can sacrifice hours that you will never get back grinding for good trials on your creature only to not be rewarded for any of it. Your chances of your reincarnation meeting your standard are completely random. In my opinion, it's not a feature you should bother yourself with if you know your hard work could be for nothing.
- ""Passion project""
I use this term lightly, as it has been so long since I've stepped foot in the cesspit that is BoB's Official Discord that I'm not sure if the game has become more since then. With this game being a passion project, there are usually huge content droughts. Moreover, there seem to be no clear goals for the game. The community is fed breadcrumbs of content to keep us interested while they knowingly prolong the waiting period between patches. It's ridiculous and disappointing. If you do get this game, don't get your hopes up waiting for anything- it's either years away or will inevitably be postponed. 
- Community
I may be as soft as your mom's right tit, but the Beasts of Bermuda player base is one of the worst ones I have seen. There is rampant toxicity, abuse from sever owners and administrators, and millennials that can't go 2 seconds without saying ""doggo/pupper"" and ""eggu/eggo."" You will kick the stool from under your feet because of the foul things people say. This is, of course, in no way the fault of the developers. However, when cliques form because people know how broken grouping as large creatures is, there might be some blame. 

The list of issues go on, but I can tell you they likely fall under one of the grievances noted above.
If you want a game to play casually, one where you can make steady progress and be consistently rewarded for your efforts, Beasts of Bermuda is not for you. It will frustrate you, consume your time to borderline unhealthy amounts, and emotionally abuse you with you being incapable of breaking away. 

TL;DR: The game is toxic and addictive. I quit cigarettes easier than this heap of diapers.",1606250054,1658456385,False,0,0,0.571199238300323486,0,True,False,True

The game itself is good. Not balanced, but good. Has a interesting mechanic, for me is beautiful, has a unique style. I really like how the game looks, sounds and feels.

The player base, that gives meat on the bones of the game, is almost dead, consisting mainly of hard core fans with thousands of in game time, and the cringe in chat is so strong your teeth want to fall out. 
Servers are either empty, or with about 30 to 50 uwu dinos that will kick your ass. This makes the whole game consisting of walking for hours and then being dead 3 seconds after meeting another dino. 

If you have time and determination to put days upon days in this game to try to catch up, and to ""play along"" some cringy RP just to stay in group, that this game is for you. For me, no.

I know developers can't actually do much to solve this, so the negative rating is not for them, but just to give new players heads up on what to expect. I am also happy to gift this game to whoever want to try it. I am done with it forever.

If you don't want to fight and are a super fast raptor, a pachy can catch up with you because they have 10x the number of hours on the server as you and they are as fast even though you dumped all points into speed? It sucks. It is not fun.

Aquatic creatures are even more boring. Do you like staring at empty ocean?
Flight is okay, but other birds will just chase you down if you are on a populated server (again, no growth limit, so if you run into someone bigger than you, you're probably going to die because they are faster, have more hp, and do more damage).

The water level system could be cool, but honestly it was just frustrating, especially when combined with the above.

Customization is cool... except everyone is a neon monstrosity. It's jarring, but there are filters. Use them if you want to make the game harder for yourself because then the dinosaurs are camouflaged instead.

I think that this game offers an experience wich you'll never forget of. 

FOR THE ONES THAT WANT TO BUY THIS(The thing everyone has to know when starting)

Get some friends to play with in this game, it's much more fun and you can join groups with other players too. If you don't have friends that are willing to join you, feel free to find a nice server, join their discord and community site/forum if they have one, and then you can find your group right there, sometimes people are amazing and sometimes they aren't so amazing. Either way, ALWAYS PLAY WITH A GROUP and find your pack cap on the server's rules (always try to be a full pack). Nothing will stop you with a pack that large and you'll find this game 1000 times better while having someone to play it with.

THAT'S IT, ENJOY THE GAME, SEE IT BY YOURSELF AND STOP LISTENING TO OTHER PEOPLE'S OPINIONS ON EVERYTHING THAT YOU ARE WILLING TO DO!

In every single server there is a group of this sweaty, touch grass kids who don't sleep since the launch of a server just to get big in a week and literally kill every single person in game. You grow a sai for lets say 16 hours, some sweaty ass kids on huge megs or acros (they love those dinos, since they are the most broken in game) in a big pack come and kill you. That is 16 hours of wasted time, you wont get that back. Now lets say you grow for 200+ hours, and again some sweaty ass kids come and try but fail to kill you (or you kill them first), they will do everything possible to get you killed (rule break  type of ways, exploits, hacks like a radar), call their friends on a different dinos to go get you. You will constantly be the targeted. Now they grow and get big and their pack gets huge. There is literally nothing you can do to them, or against them if they finally catch you, unless you got a big/huge  herd, BUT THEN those sweaty ass carny players start crying that its unfair, and some servers change rules to favor those type of players. So think it through, while it may be fun in the first hour or so, its a huge time sink, and those hours you wont get back. Im done with Bermuda, it became.. actually it was always a trash game, with the most toxic and nasty players.

I also want to add the carnivore side of the story in-case you think its just shitty to play on herbivore. 
Some servers have huge herds with crazy limits (i don't like to be part of those groups because they usually know each other very well, and for a long time too, So even if you make an attempt at trying to be friends with them they kinda shrug you off or ignore you), like 15  member limit or more and it can be like 4 apas 6 sais 6 coahs etc. (THESE RIGHT HERE are apex herbivores and in a pack they are basically untouchable). So if you would love to play some kind of carnivorous dino like Rex or Acro (alone) forget about it. The only thing you'll be doing is running from big carni clans, constantly hiding and of course you will eventually get killed once they get you. 

THE only plus is the devs added reincarnation mechanic which lets you basically remake your self with better stats without needing a partner and its very good (luck based, and depends on trials but still will give you a lot better inherits than thru nesting with someone).

Edit:

Some servers are changing to survival auto revive mode (where you dont lose dino progress) which is great. They got a few rules here and there but nothing too harsh. Now that you dont lose progress its easier to play,  and you dont have to worry about the sweaty clan kids waste your precious time.",1653415952,1656056226,False,58,9,0.787003397941589355,0,True,False,True

I loved this game for quite a while but it has gotten to the point that you need to get to a growth of over 4.5 to achieve all the talent points possible in the talent tree.

This game is for the people who are social outcasts at school and get bullied, they are able to vent there frustration out on random strangers, to be able to potentially ruin someones day and take solace in the fact they are superior to someone at something.

Once again, i will say i do recommend this game in some fronts.. In others? Yeah, no. But today is where i change my tune: I do not recommend ANYONE buy this game. Lest you feel as i do right now.

Now, where shall i start...

This game is good. I will say it, it is a good concept. However it depends on how you like to play it. Me, i dont like being hunted down and killed repeatedly by the same group of people or having someone request to be in my egg only for them to hatch and then a bunch of people show up cus they told them where we were or were purposefully screaming their head off.. That is why i choose to play in Chill servers - the Official servers, while tolerable with friends, are very toxic and just an experience i do not care for and do not recommend to new players.

IF you are new to the game, join the discord, or voice your opinions against such a mode you will be readily told that 'It is how the game is suppose to be played' an argument that is not actually true. The game was made with multiple modes and, none of them are 'The official way to play'. The way a player plays is up to them - not the devs, not another person. They spent money on this game, so, who should tell them how to play it or, as of current, force them to play it differently?

There are premium skins in the game, which i mentioned in my previous review, which you cannot attain unless you participate in events and thus you can have them unlocked but other players who dont have it unlocked? Cant have it, can't pass it on and may at some point be unable to even get it from two players with the skin who nest. This is very unfair to new players who join, they're basically being told ""Ha, you want this skin? Too bad."" And in some servers it's practically impossible to get some of these skins as the owners will not nest for just anyone. I would LOVE if the devs fixed this. I dont want you to remove the skins, i dont want you to make it so everyone has access to them right off the bat - make them part of a DLC (nothing outrageous..) or add them into upcoming events. I want a chance to own these skins and im sure multiple others would to. The skins we do have access to have no balance. Some are lovely, others? Completely bland and hard to make actually work. Others are too busy.

Memory leak was an issue for a while and i am not entirely sure if it has been fixed. I've seen that it has, i've also heard some players complaining it hasn't.. So maybe it's fixed? I'm not even sure at this point, it's not been addressed by devs or anyone.

Moving further along, growing large? No longer a feature, essentially. Before the current patch a 4.0 meg was roughly twice the size of 1.2 meg. Now? They're only slightly larger. Thus, growing big is practically pointless in chill servers and impossible as it becomes impossible to sustain them in survival servers at least. Your goal in survival is grow, renest, grow again, renest again and try and survive all the while against other players who WILL spawn kill you/on-sight kill you.. And then you have to jump through hoops to revive your OWN creature or start a new which means you spent X amount of time on a creature only to have it taken away in a few moments by another player who's spamming 'GG' or the laugh emote that tropes do or any other sort of toxicity. THIS is why i do not recommend survival servers - they are the worst game experience you can think of. They are fun, but, when you factor in the childish players you're bound to come across? Not worth it. They never have mods on them, so, reporting? Pretty much pointless, who's gonna stop them? nobody. Official servers pretty much have no rules since no one is there to enforce them. That's another reason why i like chill servers. They have rules and staff to actually enforce them.

When it comes to chill servers, you do now have a few things to worry about though. You can't grow and be the large rex you want, or the titan apato of the server.. Nope, even if your server's growth cap is set to 20, your size will be only slightly different than a 1.2 dino thanks to the new growth cap they input into the game. Why change things that didnt need changing? You have a dinosaur you are really attached to? Well, hope you dont mind a random player getting a random egg from said dino that spawns around the map (though, dont worry, you wont be marked as a parent and it wont be counted toward your trials) with YOUR skin. This is honestly the worst mechanic out there. cool random eggs, but they can get our skin from them but we wont even be marked as their parent?? Gonna be pretty obvious who a parent is if they end up with a clone of said parent. So why not just mark them as parents?? Better yet, does this mean you can still get incest/inbred eggs? Probably! So, it's a worse mechanic since you WONT know what parents you're getting. You are better off with making a spawn dino yourself.

Official servers are very toxic and if you're new to the game i do not recommend playing on them first or at all as it will leave you with a sour taste. Even then, some rented/player-hosted servers are equally as toxic and full of cliques. However, there are some good servers and i recommend if you do buy this game to really look into them. Don't just go ""Oh, a chill! Cool."" Look for one you actually like the people in and enjoy being a part of.

The developers do listen to their player base, BUT, and i add this message with a grain of salt - They will only do so if the issue is thrown by a majority. And i mean, a MAJORITY. As in almost the the entire player base. If it's half or a small group of people? Their ideas aren't even considered. Many players dislike the new growth. MANY OF THEM. This isn't just chill servers hating this new growth, no, it's the players who've managed to survive in a survival server for ages to now have a giant megalo, megaraptor or rex and are now stuck with a non-intimidating beast that is no bigger than it's 1.2 counterpart. Why grow big if you look no different than the smallest of your specie? That's literally what this game is pushing. They're really pushing on the survival servers, making changes that further point to 'how you're suppose to play the game' and that's gonna cost them US - Players and buyers.

Furthermore, the discord server is toxic. How so? Well, if you post suggestions or opinions? Expect them to be torn apart. Expect people to tear you apart, argue with you over the tiniest things, and be blatantly rude for no apparant reason as that was the entire experience i had. No constructive criticism, just pure rudeness. No apologies, no warnings to the players being down right rude, nothing. You will be attacked for suggesting things that could make the game more appealing/better. Keep that in mind..

As someone who spent money on this game, has bought it for friends, who has met friends on it and who does love-hate it?

Then there's the new talent update. Max growth prior to patch: 3.8. After patch: 4.9. Why was this changed? You know how hard it is to get to 3.8, and now, you're asking players to grow to 4.9?? Really? Even on a chill server with constant GS and baby buffing - that's several weeks worth of growing depending on the creature being played. Survival servers? kiss the idea of being 4.9 goodbye - it'll never happen. You'll die before you can get to 1.2 usually.

So, once again, i don't recommend this game.

I'm seeing a lot of game reviews in forms of complaints about how the communities are toxic, that there's too many rules in too many other servers, how it's unfair that there's dinos out there that others don't stand a chance against, and how they can never grow past 1.2. Yes, having a good community helps, but everyone's giving a negative review because of the social aspect of the game, which isn't fair.

The developers aren't in charge of the community. The [i]community[/i] is.

What the developers [i]are[/i] in charge of (outside of the official servers) is developing the actual game, and honestly I love what they've created. The visuals, the audio, the talent system. It's one of my favorite games. They have [i]developed[/i] a very good game that I enjoy. Does it share a lot of similarities with The Isle? Sure, but seriously, how else are you going to make a dinosaur simulator? They've also created plenty of unique features and I thank the staff for their continued hard work and making something that I greatly enjoy.

The traits system is by far one of my favorites and really plays into the lifecycle simulator where just like real life, animals that survive due to good traits can pass those traits on to their offspring where the offspring can have an even more useful mutation of those traits to make them extremely successful at surviving to pass on their own genetics.

I'm also extremely happy with how highly customize-able the skins are themselves, a lot of community members are very creative and have come up with memorable skins. And for those who want a more immersive experience? Custom skins can be turned off via a menu option to replace everyone's skin client-side with more natural skins instead.

This game is still being updated and worked on, and so far I've enjoyed each release and have always appreciated the fixes.

[h1][b]For the Customers:[/b][/h1]
I'm going to write a heads up for players who are considering the game or for those who don't realize what the point of the game is.

[b]Don't expect to live long because this is a [i][u]dinosaur lifecycle simulator,[/u][/i] which is basically a roguelike.[/b]

This game has a steep ""success"" curve. A lot of players don't realize that they have to have skill, intelligence, wisdom, luck, and patience to play. They're going to have to know how to do combat, figure out how they want to grow their dinosaurs, pick their battles, keep an eye out for threats, hope to god no one hungry spots them, and accept failure because that's just life.

No matter what you do, there's always going to be a high chance of death. That's how it actually is in the wild. Because of this, life doesn't aim to have an individual to survive but to only survive long enough to reproduce. The breeding and inherit system encourages this to get better dinosaurs to further help that individual and therefore the species survive longer. Whoever can adapt the best with the most useful skill has a higher chance of surviving longer, but not forever because again, some of the game also just relies on luck. It's how actual evolution works.

On proper servers, rule-following players deserve to play as their large elders because they've put in the hard work into achieving that size.

Update: The game now offers a revival system to get back your dinosaur through sacrificing others as fodder and a small price of growth, or to reincarnate for free to give you a similar dinosaur with similar traits that's sort of like nesting yourself in! Extremely balanced and helps level the playing field while avoiding the grief of having to completely lose a favorite.

[h1][b]For the Communities:[/b][/h1]
The [i]players[/i] are responsible for the social and server aspects outside of the official servers. Yes, a lot of them aren't going to be what you like. A lot that don't have much in the way of rules are ripe with toxic players (seriously, you can't expect an online game to [i]not[/i] have toxic players). Other servers that do have a lot of rules can have toxic staff.

There's a few things that can be done about this. One is to just find a new server. If you only want to grow a dinosaur, there's plenty of peaceful servers. You can't expect to get big if you're going to make risky choices like hunt others on survival servers. Another is to make your own server with your own rules to fit your own wants.

There are a few diamonds in the rough, though. I find that semi-realism servers (not roleplay servers) that have a lot of rules have less toxic players because it helps prevent wholesale slaughter of other players for no reason. But these servers also stay clean because of the [b][i][u]community.[/u][/i][/b] Staff aren't omnipotent. The community needs to actually make reports (most need video evidence so be sure to have something like OBS recording) so that staff are aware of problems and can take care of it.

It is up to the community to help build a better server, and everyone needs to work together to make it happen.

[h1][b]The TL;DR/Actual Review:[/b][/h1]
The game itself is great and a lot of fun, you just have to comb through and pick the server that suits you best and work hard at growing a good dino. It's best to think of this game as a soft- or semi-roguelike where the difficulty randomly changes. Unexpected things can and will happen, and the times where I was startled by another player and caught in a life-or-death fight-or-flight situation that got my heart racing was when I had the most fun, not to mention when I was able to catch a break and find laid-back players within the chaos who just wanted to relax and meme. 

The game itself is overall excellent, the developers did their part and are still making great updates and patches, but it is up to you and the rest of the community to find and make better servers.",1647465390,1654754015,True,4,0,0.494560569524765015,0,True,False,True

Pros
- Active Dev Team
- Interesting Nesting and Skin Mechanics
- Interesting Talents and Inherits Mechanics
-Good weather Mechanics (Tornadoes, Fire, Floods)

Cons
- Poor pvp (Play the isle if you want better. You either kill in 3 seconds or die in 3 seconds rarely is there inbetween)
- Poor Growth system (The Isle has a better growth system that is more fair. This game makes it so you grow forever...so dont have a life)
- Crashes and Lags a good bit
- Maps become very boring very quickly
- Dinosaurs, while looking better, cant match up to Path of Titans or The Isle
- Day and Night cycle is uninspired. (In the Isle the night is utilized in some dinosaurs making it more fun at all times)

Final Thoughts: Want a better dinosaur game? In my opinion The Isle's Legacy version is better than most. This game has a good skeleton but the way they build on that foundation is what makes it bad for me. My main issue is the growth system. I really do think there needs to be a cap on dinosaurs growth because it only hurts people who don't play 24/7 and lets be honest...growing sucks so growing forever is not fun at all. On any server you go to you will be knocked down over and over again due to massive dinosaurs that take months to grow. This game does not give new players a chance, it is for the players that have been playing for a while. 

On another note, lets say even if you do grow big. The second your dinosaur is killed...there is weeks just wasted. At least in other dinosaur games it takes 8-10 hours most to grow your dinosaur and then it stops. Losing 8-10 hours vs weeks is a big difference. If it wasn't for this I think I might actually play this some more. Anyway, if you have a life I don't suggest this game. Go play Path of Titans or The Isle, you will find it less infuriating and more welcoming. 

Yes I have over 1,000 hours...I have uninstalled this game cause I am just done.",1605054036,1653931976,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,True

For me, this game is neither recommended, nor not recommended. Im very on the fence. Due to the fact this game milked out 2k+ hours of content for me i am going to give it a positive review. These are my thoughts about funne dino game, despite having quit. 

This game is recommended if: 

- You have ALOT of time on your hands (this game is addicting as f***)
- You like skill based PvP and enjoy your average dino game PvP
- You like grinding and can handle loss of progress
- You like dinosaur games for example PoT or The Isle
- You have alot of friends that also play (better with friends) 
- You do not mind or can handle toxicity to an extent
- You like hardcore survival play 
- You do not mind being addicted to a game with a very simple concept yet you have withdrawal symptoms whenever you're not playing 

This game is not recommended if:

- You do not have alot of time to invest into the game 
- You do not like being almost inferior to other players (Linking into time invested)
- You do not like PvP or the style of PvP dino games offer (although there are ""chill servers"")
- You despise dinosaurs (doubt) if you're looking at reviews lol
- You cannot handle toxicity 
- You are a solo player and do not enjoy playing multiplayer or randoms (this game is playable solo, but difficult) 
- You do not like the survival genre. 
- You like immersive dinosaur experiences, this game offers many colourful, unique mechanics other games do not offer such as talent trees and RGB Dinosaurs sponsered by Razer.
- You do not like unbalanced play - due to the systems this game can 100% feel unbalanced and it is a pretty hardcore survival. Very unforgiving.
- You do not like drama - This is not an issue with the game at all but holy shit you will want to plug your ears with rocks and mute chat sometimes conflicts between people are bound to happen especially in the style of game this is where you have to group with others to do well, and it takes alot of time to get big etc all it takes is one of your new found friends to go lmao i want to switch to a carnivore, they kill you and then you hate them forever and everyone hates everyone. (worst case scenario) and i think personally ive been through multiple petty wars, chose sides over petty things and it has made people quit the game overall to the point where whenever someone mentions clan war i want to close my game crawl in my bed and cry.  

OVERALL this game is worth it if you like the listed above. And it will eat away at your time. Whether its grinding for the perfect stats/colours or going on a crusade. Thanks for reading and i hope this was helpful.",1607219415,1653925443,True,0,1,0.476190477609634399,2,True,False,True

Keeping in mind, if you want your dinosaur back from any rule-breaks or bugs, you have to leave it dead for that entire time. 

The Official server community is very toxic. Alot of people like to point at Official 2's ""Snowy Mountain Packies"" as being a major problem, but they rarely leave their mountain. People regularly get driven off-server by the community, and its honestly kind of sad.

You don't do anything besides eat and drink water until you die from someone else. 

You keep playing it because you think once you have gotten big enough in the game (your dinos grow) you'll start having fun. But it takes tens of hours to reach certain sizes so you mostly hide or afk or stick with a big group.

Most community servers have ""rules"" in place to help balance and gameplay, but they all suck. The name of the game is to break as many rules as you can without getting caught. If you are someone like me who plays by the rules, you will lose and die every single time.

Recording your entire game time is ""standard"" so that if someone breaks a rule you can report with proof. It's super cringe, doesn't work and ends up wasting so much time for nothing.

This game is a little better than the other dino games because this one has a cool talent point system that you get points as you grow. Also you can have eggs and the skin system is really cool. 

Never buy this though, not even on sale. The time investment is too high with zero pay off

However it is an easy fix. no creature should be considered better then another, rather as tools best used for different tasks. Time spent growing in order to unlock gameplay is not a good balance Mechanism. Growth cap needs to be added eg 1.2/1.5

(if talents where a percentage base EG +1 talent= 25% improvement it would have Significant effects on gameplay caused by players. currently talents are a set number +15/+25 improvement per talent. not a percentage based of the creature, as a results talents have little to no impact this removes alot of gameplay choices made by the player)

Except it has glaring issues that is rarely addressed. 
A couple of which being:
Some dinosaurs mainly herbivores in a vain attempt to make them viable and playable against carnivores have become too easy to play and effortlessly kill bigger more dangerous dinosaurs with ease. Instead of defensive mechanics the community as per usual finds ways to be sweaty pvp goblins that run around all day killing everything they see for sport. In fact I'd say the developers encouraged this behavior by tracking stats for the amount of kills one has accrued in the dinosaur's life time. 
It's understandable that the people playing are people and not animals driven by instinct. But it becomes increasingly more like a chore to play bigger carnivores than it does playing smaller faster and not to mention deadlier herbivores that dash out from nowhere regardless of environment like they are ambush predators. 

If I had to make any changes it would be to give stronger and stronger buffs to dinosaurs that are the least played. And handicaps to the most popular dinosaurs to make things balanced in regards to the competitive natures of the people playing the dinosaurs. 

I'm not very well coordinated in my day to day life. So I make a build along the lines of staying alive rather than PVP or breeding. Despite surviving to elderhood and surviving fights against other dinosaurs that aren't meta. I'm consistently dying to pachy/lurdu swarms running around the map killing everyone. This entirely turns me off from the game along with others because I can't play what I want and die to fair fights. Instead I am punished for not being pvp meta trash.

there are many different servers to play on, and the events are hella fun, mostly the purge event... where there are no rules during that event hehe.

A huge problem with the game is the fact that you need admins, metaphorically they are a band aid for a shattered pelvis. you need admins to fix the MANY glaring issues with this game (ie getting stuck, scouting, mix packing, cheaters etc), when you hunt someone, they can report you if you did not hunt them correctly, they can send a message to a group of people in discord, and they will vote on whether or not you played the game right in their eyes. This makes the game less of a game and more of a dino politics chatroom. So lets say you're a big dino on a server, a solo player (btw solo play is damn near impossible in this game unless you're a flier) all that will happen is every one who is in a clan will target you to kill you so they can be the biggest dino on the server. If they cannot kill you, they will report bomb you until you get a 30 day ban from the server. So instead of playing the game, these people will just bitch and moan til they get what they want, sadly this works more often than not. The game rewards you more for afking and growing with a group while watching a movie than you actually going around the map and being active. Most players do not have a hunting mindset IN A DINO GAME WHERE YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO HUNT. everyone is always just hiding somewhere afk more often than not, at that point you're not playing a game, you have a screensaver on.

+ Unique mechanics: Deadly weather, including tornadoes and world ending floods. Tree climbing Velociraptors. Baby snatching Pterosaurs. Tunnel digging, cucumber obsessed Oryctodromii blinding you with sand. The comfort system means you have to take care of your dinosaur in ways that are not limited to just eating and drinking.

+ Good selection of dinosaurs with unique attributes. Land, sea and sky are all represented.

+ Fully developed nesting system

+In depth dinosaur customization, including appearance. (can also be a con, see below)

Cons:
- Questionable game design decisions resulting in very poor balance. (herding/packing mechanics, unlimited growth, etc)

- Toxic community, at least on official servers.

- Game is basically unplayable solo.  Persistent groups rule this game, if you don't have one, you will die early and you will die often.
 
- Neon dinosaurs thanks to customization. If you do not engage a game option to filter skins (which also make nearly all of them look worse) you will be confronted with neon, Skittle colored dinos that resemble plastic toys instead of living creatures.

Overall, Beasts of  Bermuda offers a somewhat unique take compared to other offerings in the genre. Its a game that definitely has a lot of character, but is hobbled by some glaring (but fixable) weaknesses.

Edit as of 5/1/2022:  Changing my overall view from borderline not recommended, to recommended.

But after a while of sitting on this I feel like I have to say a little something. As someone who used to play every afternoon and played for a total of 1500+ hours, grew a character to 3.9+ size which took over a year of dedicated daily play, playing on all types of servers in my quest to try everything about the game: official-survival and unofficial-chill and everything in-between...


I'll start with the positives because despite my ultimately negative review, I actually love this game a lot. It has a semi-realistic art style with a compelling character roster full of flying, swimming, and running dinosaurs. The skin system is very cool, has a heavy procedural element where a child's skin is a mix of the parents' in some often delightfully bizarre looking way. The animations are not always the best quality but they are on average pretty good. The game is packed with interesting niche features that add tons of the flavor that is so often missing from video games in general, such being able to grab bundles of world objects [foliage, shells, etc] in your mouth and even other players. Your character getting fat when you eat a lot is one of my favorite visual details. Flying as a bird dino is A++++++.


However... they keep chucking these features at random and not listening when players express serious dissatisfaction. For a recent example, my no. 1 favorite feature was the old formula for converting play time to model size, the 'infinite growth'... until they got rid of it. This was a cornerstone feature of the game for as long as I can remember and the removal came as a big shock. This is what caused a lot of controversy in the community recently and is PART [but not the whole reason] of why this game has gotten bombed with so many confusingly written & negative reviews; the purported balancing update where the devs decided to, understandably, change how large creature stats worked. But the balancing update came with some annoying and highly unpopular visual changes tacked on. Why did you get rid of one of your most compelling features, which was the cosmetic aspect of 'infinite growth'?


More importantly though, there is always so much toxicity in both the community and even from the devs specifically toward players who just want to have a choice in the matter. This is something that I felt could've been a configuration option for SERVER OWNERS, who already had the option of capping out player growth. Who already have to pay lots of their own money to host community servers of this game, the community servers that help keep it alive. The toxic 'official or u aint shit' PVP kids can cry all day but the metrics don't lie: PVE aka CHILL has a place in keeping BoB from falling on its damn bad-decision-making face. The official servers are so un-moderated that no one wants to play them but the most toxic of players, and these are the loudest most annoying players on the Discord that love to start verbal arguments and use personal attacks as though they were teenagers. For some reason they are essentially given a platform despite how much they seem to annoy even the developers.


This highlights the main reason for my review, which is... the severe lack of respectful communication between devs and players that is eating up this game. Without players, this game would be empty. There is no AI. There is only a huge, often boring grind. The real entertainment of the game is found in the interactions with other players. But outside of the handful of well-moderated community servers, players of this game tend to be incredibly toxic toward both the devs and each other, both on Discord and in-game; then the devs sometimes lose their patience and retaliate in unprofessional ways, which while understandable is not good. Stoking the fire, the devs tend to be very stubborn and volatile about 'vision'... I'm not sure management understands the proper application of the phrase 'kill your darlings'. This frustrates the players too much, causing them to lash out inappropriately at the developers. To be fair, it's often a waste of their time to attempt constructive criticism as it often gets ignored these days. Bit of a Catch-22.


The development Discord where testers are gathered, official events are held, and announcements/patch notes are posted comes to mind as a particular example. It's not a great place to be, to put it plainly. Lots of players shouting over each other and visibly straining the few moderators/devs that bother to try herding them back into some semblance of order. I've seen better managed Discords many times that size and actually had to leave the BoB discord after a while due to the sheer lack of constructive content outside of the announcements channel, which I now read mirrored on... a community hosted PVE server's Discord. The community server Discord, hosting thousands of users, is well moderated and the players are extremely respectful. Some community servers are much better places to be than official, in more ways than one.


I would highly encourage the devs to consider a different model or approach to gathering feedback and testing of this game, because it seems like it's taking a toll on the ability to remain professional on both sides. Players shouting each other down in Discord all day and night, calling each other names, flaming so hard and bullying anyone they don't agree with; this isn't a good environment for ANY dev to have any sort of clear or remotely healthy thought process. The chaos of the development hub really reflects in the rather disjointed and imbalanced quality that the game itself has right now.

Thank goodness the devs recently opened the game up more for servers to customize their experience, as they used to sort of force everyone to play Dino Fortnite, even if they didn't want to.

Lets start out by saying what I enjoy about the game.

-The talent trees are great and allow you to experiment with different playstyles like baby/egg snatching. Injury/bleed dealing, fast speeds or a defensive build with healing and health, you have the choice to better your dino!
-Many different playables in different biomes, you can have 3 aquatics, 2 semi aquatics, 2 flyers, 6 carnivores and 7 herbivores. And you can fight in the sea, land or in the air!
-The dinosaurs have abilities to strengthen them in battle or to help others!
-The arcade like survival the game has to offer!
-Devs  and staff are pretty fun to have banter around and are really responsive
-The game is going in a much better direction making it more enjoyable for all players and not just the giants (people that play the game for weeks/months to kill you with stats)


Now lets get onto what I personally don't like:

-Giant dinos (2.0+) this just ruins the game for anyone want to have fun. These players have fun at the expense of others and cant be killed because they have a massive stat and talent boost from the balanced growth (that being 1.2) Never liked this and it usually puts me off playing on some servers.
-The community, atm the community seem to attack the devs for changes they dont like that affects growth, it has been VERY toxic almost every update and its getting really petty, not all the community is like this though, alot of people are very decent!
-Inherits, these literally make and break the game. They are completely RNG until you find a nesting pair of dinos with similar builds or to complete trials. you can get +2 inherit which can make a talent have 5 points invested into it, This really breaks the balance of the game especially when clans/group of players farm these.


Conclusion:

The game is going in a FAR better direction to make the game more enjoyable for all players wanting to play.
If you want a dinosaur game that isn't too realistic and want to have fun I will recommend this game.
I can't wait for future updates that are similar to the para update (talent point change via growth) and had an amazing time playing until I met giant players, that's where the fun ends and you get stomped easily.
Devs are lovely people and a laugh to talk too in the official bob discord, would join again :P

Be warned, there is ""elitist"" people that feel growing big to stomp players that are smaller a good thing and that its what you should aim for, no you shouldn't.

This game definitely has the addictive factor to it, but not for the right reasons anymore.

The devs seem to be all over the place on what they want to add to the game, keep adding sneak peaks to things the players don’t really care or haven’t asked for. I get the game usually has to follow the original creator’s design, but I think somewhere he lost himself and probably doesn’t even know what he wants anymore himself.
The players have been asking for a new map and new dinosaurs for SO long. We’ve seen glimpse of the utahraptor and heard talks of possible remodels of the current dinosaurs for so long. Instead, unless you lash out 3 000$ like the person who donated for the coahuilaceratops (don’t remember her name sorry), new dinosaurs aren’t being released, or not the ones the players are hyped about. The megaraptor is technically the latest to have come out, and that one was definitely a surprise to its player base.

The player base have also been anticipating for this new map for a LONG time, since the new changes the devs implemented on the current maps just so heavily impacted the game that the maps aren’t designed anymore for how the players play the game. Water satuation makes you last longer without dehydrating, which is great. But you have to worry about the water’s cleanliness and how “boring” it gets before you are forced to move out to more dangerous places that may just be controlled by a clan or a group of people mixpacking together to control that area. They somewhat countered that with letting the private server owners to change their maps a bit, which I feel like is a lazy way to pass on the responsibility of making maps. Maps modified by the private servers owners are clonky and very buggy as they aren’t meant to be in the game. Just weird.

There’s also the most recent patch that just completely fudged up water visibility, which I have the strong impression that it was not even tested by the QA tester and just rushed to be put out so the players shut up about no updates. Not the way to go really.

All in all, I’ve noticed for the past few days an “exodus” of people who had taken the time to grow their dinosaurs really big just because the game is simply not fun anymore. I, myself somewhat of a casual now, deleted everything that I had and uninstalled the game. It was a fun year and a half/two years while it lasted for me, but I feel like the game just isn’t what it used to be.

The devs claim they are trying to make it more solo friendly/small group friendly, yet implements stuff that actually make you having to sweat out even more to even be able to barely survive. Addiction at its finest. 

If you can, avoid this game. 😊

If you want a dinosaur game that can keep you engaged for hours, this is definitely the game for you. Despite what the recent reviews say, they're the old players who got massive, ran clans, etc, and didn't like the recent balance changes to make their apex clans running of the servers harder. 

I've been following the games development for years now and have many hours across accounts, and almost every update has had positives, and they do in fact listen to their community. The ones that are review-bombing right now are upset they can no longer terrorize and kill smaller people than them so easy.

In comparison to the other dinosaur games out there BoB stands out for multiple reasons.

- Unique gameplay styles for every dino
- Different niches that are filled
- Infinite growth
- Multiple dinosaur slots!
- Talent trees, you can specialize how you play!
- Weather

While the game may not look too realistic if you were to compare it to the isle, it has the replayability that Isle does not. With BoB you can keep perfecting your build and there is always something new to the game that you may not have recognized before. 

There is no tier list of dinos, and this game does have a massive learning curve, however once you're in, you get hooked, which is why mostly everyone leaving a review has thousands of hours. It's a very addicting game that gives players lots of free-way on how they play, what they do, and more!

The first and obvious is how well it differs and succeeds among other games of the genera. This game, being a Dinosaur Survival game, has a lot of competition in the form of The Isle and Path of Titans, both of which are incredible games in their own right. However, Beasts of Bermuda, more commonly known as BoB, does differ a striking amount, not all in the good way either.
Let's start with what it does best. BoB makes you feel like you're playing in the shoes of a prehistoric animal, with it's comfort system specifically. Things like weather, other creatures and even being in certain areas of the map can cause your comfort to decrease or increase respectfully.
That's about the only thing I can justify for this game among it's competition however. Other parts of the game feel flawed with a lot of what makes BoB different done better by other games. For example, the skill tree. The skill tree in BoB allows you to gain skills that can either help you in battle, survival or movement. This is meant to not make the creatures feel so class based but instead fluid and differing depending on what the player wishes to focus on. Rex's aren't always going to be slow lumbering damage dealing behemoths and instead can play a more swift hit and run style of gameplay. This, in my opinion is done better by Path of Titan's ability unlocks for their creatures. Simply by giving their creatures interchangeable abilities to suit their play style feels more thought out and works a lot better than changing the actual base stats of your chosen creature.
Furthermore, the balance of the game feels completely out of tune. It suffers from what the early Isle had to face with, small and fast dinosaurs riding the heels of the larger slower ones who couldn't do much about it besides walk in a circle and hope to bite them which, even then, isn't usually an instant kill. Once again, comparing BoB to it's competitors, both The Isle and Path of Titans have already found work arounds for this problem, giving most if not all creatures the ability to attack from behind or get behind the attacker.
BoB is a fun game either way and truly it's how you as a player choose to perceive it. It can either be a really fun, group game to play with your friends with hours of replayability or, in my opinion, a clunky, unbalanced mess of a game that hasn't learned from it's competition's failures.",1648409881,1648409881,False,8,0,0.521897852420806885,1,True,False,True

Kill animations are bland, graphics aren't as good, game mechanics are so/so, and like everyone has already said 100 times, this game is much more ""arcadey."" 
   I think the thing that bothers me about this game most is the map(s) that I have played on. Everything looks so out of place and poorly designed. It's like they couldn't decide between making a realistic looking world or something out of spyro the dragon. This is a theme that permeates almost every fiber of this game. It is a game that cant make up it's mind and does everything half as good as other games that already exist.
   Gore is almost non-existent, almost childish. Probably a conscious decision to make the game more inclusive so they could sell more titles. It feels like this game would be right at home on a cell phone, something a mom could hand to her kid to keep him occupied for a half hour while she shops. 
   Things that are not good or bad: It doesn't have that constant fear factor of the Isle, you aren't constantly stressed you are going to walk head on into another dino or off a cliff. Everything in this game is very visible due to out of place color morphs and Mario like world.
   This game made me realize something important, I don't give the Isle enough credit. That game is truly groundbreaking despite toxic players and a snail like development pace (also dev's who don't listen to the community at all.) The Isle does something that no other game I have played comes close to. And even as my frustrations grow with the slow pace of updates and new dino's, I have to keep faith because they are doing the survival game so much better than anyone in the same genre.
The positives of this game is the ability to play as more dino's, that's about it.",1648227274,1648227274,False,5,0,0.505851805210113525,0,True,False,True

It's a repeated trend, you will read a large number of reviews talking about the issue, the situations they have gotten into, the negative experience they have had vs larger players, oversized groups and clans, and the inefficiency of smaller growth.

That is until the last patch as of march 2022, which took a step towards curbing the power struggle by raising the bar that a new/solo player is at, and narrowing the gap between those oversized players vs the rest.  If you are someone who has been shunned from the game in the past, become frustrated by the constant death loops, or have been put off trying the game since it seems to require too much circumstance to get into; this is the update for you.
You now have significantly more talent points to spend at 1.2 than you previously did, in exchange will have slightly less talent points at massive growths.
Combine this with the server generated eggs from existing dinos of the server and reincarnation, two systems made as ways for any player to step into a server and be viable, and restless debuff to curb cave afking.  Additionally previous updates which have added more config controls for private servers, including faster growth speed, have spiced up the experience of each server vs another for players of different styles.
It's certainly put the game in a better place, the power divide isn't so suffocating anymore.

Which brings to the next issue, the suffocation;
You can directly compare reviews from before march to ones after march and see they are contradictive, it's like the real time example of what all the old reviews talked about.

It was charming in it's own way, and you got to be big colourful dinos, with actual builds. There's a breeding system that people love and use to build a perfect dinosaur, and have spent COUNTLESS hours doing so. I myself included there. It's cute, I loved making new friends and playing with old friends, and it had a lot other dino games didn't. Despite all the toxicity, and clicks that seemed to rule over survival servers, I spent most of my time on a chilled out server where you all just had fun, and that was how I liked to spend my time! 

The games updates have continued to give us things that were/are pointless (although cute and funny) and things that have been broken for a long time have yet to be addressed or fixed.

I can run RDR2 on 4k and my computer is cold as ice, but if I start this game for 4 measly minutes, my computer is ready to bake cookies on it, not to mention the more I run this game, the more haggard my system /sounds/. It is completely killing my own and my room mates PC. I highly doubt backface culling is on for everything in the map, and the game is so poorly optimised.

This game DUMPS at least 200-400 gigabytes of data into it's files DAILY for me, effectively leading to crashing, computer clutter and deterioration, etcetc. It is /not good/.

They decided to scale down the player models to the point that you are up close and personal with the maps textures, that when up close, are not pretty in the least. I understand they intended for players to now fit in the cave systems without having to edit the map, but in doing so, they ruined a fun aspect of the game (you were a big dino) and now we are forced to look at the ugly textures that could pass from farther away. In my opinion, this is a lot more work than redoing the cave system, or sizing up the cave/mountain that people could no longer fit in. I can only see this being fixed if they revert the sizes, or entirely redo all the textures on the map so they no longer look like poopie-doodoo. The game was something in itself to look at, and people always nitpicked it for being ugly even if it wasn't, and now it kind of really actually is... aside from the dinos... that now look hyper detailed and completely out of place next to the chunky, pixelated rocks, ground, trees etcetc. 

Additionally, they changed the point system to make it even harder for the survival players to gain anything, effectively nullifying the update where server admins could up the growth rate. It's right back to growing and gaining slowly for everyone. This, in my opinion, from a fellow game artist/maker, was a very bad decision. 

In conclusion, a lot more harm comes from updates than good lately, and not necessarily for the game in it's entirety, but it's players. I would like to revisit the game once it's complete, or if something has been done to fix the serious downgrade to it's once alluring concepts and features. 

I've also heard of toxicity in the actual official game community itself from the higher ups, though I have been too afraid to go look around myself. 

I love this game, I really do, and I'd love to change my recommendation for it, but as it is, I can't tell my friends they should purchase this right now.

The game has some pros and cons that you should consider before buying, most of which have a good possibility of being improved down the road.

PROS:

-(sometimes)interesting and dynamic gameplay, including growth, herding, a comfort system and a talent system
-in-depth skin customization
-fairly well thought out survival mechanics
-a wide variety of dinosaurs to play as, all of which have unique and engaging mechanics
-playable marine animals
-2 playable pterosaurs, with some of the best flight I've ever seen from a dino game
-dynamic weather that can range from a slight breeze to biblical level floods which cover most of the map with water
-semi-decent gameplay balance, infinite growth is still somewhat strong but much less so now as compared to previously, good for players that like combat rather than sitting around watching numbers tick up

CONS:
-sub-par graphics, bad lighting, mostly ue4 marketplace assets for map design

-gameplay is incredibly high risk/reward, since growth is not capped, any death is very punishing. Reincarnating can lead to some decent rewards in the form of better inherits, but this is rng, so it can also be risky. You can also revive dead dinos thru the trial system if you like a dinos inherits which is nice, but the game still has an issue with respecting the players time.

-animations are somewhat sub-par, massive dinosaurs can seem to tiptoe as if they weigh nothing, along with some animations not scaling well with growth. Also, saichania's run animation

-due to gameplay balance issues, pretty much every server (yes, even officials) has at least 2 pages of rules, most popular servers have corrupt mods/admins (including officials). This can be frustrating for new players to get used to, but its pretty tolerable on officials- At least when compared to the fucking wackadoodle batshit insane rules on unofficials.

-aquatics, while seemingly fun are incredibly tedious, owing to the fact that there are 3 playable aquatics and 2 semi-aquatics, meaning that aquatic players have a very limited amount of people to interact with, even on servers with 100+ players. Oceans on any given server are also dominated by massive aquatics that patrol the water and basically make the oceans unplayable

-map balance is a huge issue right now, with herd god spots, apato god spots, easily camped caves which basically turn into cuddle bunny saichania roleplay orgy pits, and small maps which make it hard for new players to reach adult, stealth is also not a great option since some simple graphics adjustments can make even massive boulders disappear. 

With the latest infinite growth nerfs, I think i can tentatively recommend that new players give it a shot. I'd suggest growing something like meg, para, orycto, lurdu, pachy or velo before jumping onto some of the bigger dinos, as their growth can be pretty long, you might not even really experience any gameplay before your 2 hours of decision making is up.",1545603094,1647630645,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The whimsy of Beasts of Bermuda, its fleshed out nesting mechanics, and the ability to grow to the kind of gigantic dinosaur all of us dreamed they were in our youth was the core draw of this game (at least for me). The recent update seems to be focused on a forced PVP play style and realism, but those are not what a lot of players like about this game and why it has received such mixed reviews lately. If any person wants to play a suitable realistic dinosaur game, I would recommend The Isle for those players, and that's what I play myself when I want that Walking With Dinosaurs experience. I hope the devs are able to find a good balance between their vision for the game and what the player base has enjoyed for so many years before it was undone with this patch, even if that seems unlikely at this point.",1647620322,1647620322,False,10,0,0.504532814025878906,0,True,False,True

For whatever reason, the devs seemed determined to screw over their OG player base and berate them whenever concerns are raised, or god forbid, those players get angry. 

I loved this game, I have nearly 1k hours put in on mostly community servers and very recently started playing official (a mistake). Do not buy this game if you give a single shit about your dino that you may spend weeks or months breeding and growing, because the devs can, have, and will utterly screw you over and then give you the finger if you protest. The entire point of this game is growth, you get big, you get points and then breed for a better dino, and maybe try for a pretty rare skin in the process. Ever since the devs nerfed the growth to a crawl past 1.2 it has inspired nothing but an unhealthy culture of no lifeing the game in order to get those talent trees filled to be viable, and produce offspring with good inherits.

If the staff gave two shits about 'addiction' they wouldn't have nerfed the growth. Honestly the only 'stand out' thing about this game is being able to grow to silly, unviable sizes.  

This game is also riddled, and I do mean riddled with hackers and people who have found ways to exploit broken mechanics, and it's most obvious on the official servers. Clan wars have utterly destroyed O2 to the point if you spawn on the wrong island you will be killed. You try and next X dino that a clan has dibs on? You will be hunted down and killed. ESP users are common and it's very blatant, people are openly using sandboxy, and the easy anti cheat does nothing but cause startup issues and crashes. I've seen everything from people giving themselves endless stamina and health to absurd damage on builds and sizes that shouldn't be dishing it out. Don't bother reporting it, the staff will say it's a skill issue, glitch, or exploit that they'll do nothing about and send you on your way!

And let us move onto the juicy bit, this most recent update that walked back both sizes and stripped talent points from large players. While some rather like the update I very much doubt these are the people who lost 12- 20 talent points, and thats half a tree mind you. Months, if not a year of work and dedication stripped away, pushing that mile stone for a maxed tree into unreachable territory that encourages more far more unhealthy playtime. The devs have stated the game is based around the 1.2 size and I don't understand why they don't limit growth to 1.2 if thats the case. There were better ways to go about this, and frankly the game needs to be restructured before they push away a majority of their players, or have far better communication towards their community. This was not an update they should have dropped on people, and I foresee many more like this in the future. 

all and all I dont recommend anyone play this game, you'll never catch up to people using cheats or to those who have time to sit in game all day to grow. If you do manage to grow to a large size, prepare to have those achievements ripped away at a moments notice. I personally have never managed to get a dino over the size of 1.7, and even then that was on a small, quiet server. Be wary before dropping money on this game.

I wouldn't recommend it. Due to the toxic clan filled community, servers, players and the addiction to getting big then burning out due to boredom or dying. I mean I loved playing it, meeting new people, cool shimmer skins, fun mechanics but after the updates and patches most of these fun features were removed, with these recent patches they have nerfed what was meant to fun about this game, they say they don't want people to spend extreme amounts of time getting big, so they increase the size where you can fully max your talent tree, which means people will just try and get to that max talent point size yet again.. which doesn't really fix the problem with people who play 200 hours or more a week, they also nerfed the size of bigger dinos so you have no idea what is 1.2 and 2.0 until you get 4 shot by a dino you thought that was 1.2. If they made this patch as an unofficial server option I wouldn't be as upset, I understand it's their game but still.. not telling the community, giving a small announcement, even giving them a choice to voice their opinions or atleast suggest other ideas before the patch.

After learning that the dev told his own community ""xxxx you all"", watching upset people being told by several members of their discord to cry about the update, oh and if you mention you play the game a lot they will tell you that you have ""no life and need to touch grass"" (I guess enjoying a game a bit too much and playing it for a few hours makes you a no lifer...) and looking at their community discord and watching a early donating member of the game harassing someone and not being punished while people get muted for lesser actions doesn't feel right.

This game about dinosaurs is great but i cant really help it but say that it is an unbalanced and unfair mess that will haunt you until the time when you stop playing and even afterwards it will haunt you. I started playing not too long ago and i quit the game for some time because i got frustrated over the fact that if you try to grow anthing to a desired level that you want to reach so you can hunt others, be big, etc. is going to end in crying, pain and agony. You will have to go through HELL to even get to 1.3 as a rex which i got to after about 35 hours and then it ended in me getting killed after i walked a few steps and got gang banged by 3 megs and a tropeo. 
I have LOST MY MIND on this stuff and i was playing in total for about 550 hours. Not that long of a time if i would compare it to others who have played it for way longer than me. But this game will literally break you because of dying to bugs when you fall through the map, drown in a cave that is flooded but you dont know that and generally to KOS players that dont let you have fun when you just want to walk around with a big dino that you were proud of growing all that time, but it just doesnt matter if all those hours then end in a few clicks on a mouse because of the unbalance in growth in every direction, bad hitreg which results in them hitting you, but not you hitting them, etc. . I got killed a lot of times, but i still pushed on with the little of my god damn patience i still had reamaining. All of that patience dissapeared after i got killed a final time as i mentioned that 1.3 rex up there at the start. I realised that it is just not worth it playing the game that i wanted to play so much and was excited when i found it. And even when there is the option to have multiple dinos so when you die you can just respawn on an another one. I dont care anymore because it will all end in the same way that you will DIE to aggressive herds, KOS giant apexes that have been on the server forever. I quit this game for the time being because i dont want to experience any more pain with this. For dying over and over again is not something i want to do. And if someone says that ''Well, actually it is something you have to put up with and endure.''. Just no, no i cannot put up with it if i spend hours in the game, struggling to survive because theres not enough food anywhere, scared of every other dino such as a ptera or tropeo that could be a scout to some group that will kill you on sight for it to end in a few clicks.

Now i know the devs want it to be more ''player interactive'', so that you as a player dont sit in a corner of the map and not see anyone or go anywhere. That doesnt happen because that player is more likely to go to the selection menu and play something else like a ptera / tropeo or just log off and close the game. I really dont know how they mean ''player interactive'' because when you try to do that, you mostly die to others such as apexes that do KOS because its their lifetime jobs or herds that are aggressive and will hunt you down because they want to. And when you actually find someone who doesnt run or kill you, you exchange some words and youre both gone in different directions. Truly the experience they wanted.¨

Well I hope you enjoyed my ''rant'' that is from the eyes of a player that really likes Dino games and alike but these days it is just terrible. The Isle in my opinion is more robust on the side of dinos, maps, etc. But someone will say ''But The Isle in in development for a longer time and... blah blah blah'' and so on. 
24.01.2021
As of now a new update is out. And i have to say that they really stomped the scaling of dmg, stamina and ability pools because before this patch i just bumped into a 2.0 mega that did 500 dmg to me a 1.3 rex while taking more than 1k dmg so i really hope they really thought the heck out of that.

15.03.2022
The newest patch is more bad than good. I get it that it is supposed to be a balance for survival servers (I think atleast) to level the playing field for smaller dinos, but chill servers got absolutely dumped by this update. Now you almost can't tell apart a 2.0 rex from a 3.0 rex, making trying to fight someone even harder than it was. Smaller size dinos will be fighting a rex that looks similiar in size to them, but is bigger by the number and then the smaller dinos die. 

Now for the rant of someone who plays on a chill server and doesn't want to go on a murderous rampage all the time. This patch by itself ruined growing on chill servers. All in all it's gone as you won't get to giant sizes as you were once able to. Having the ability to grow to big sizes and look cool was one of the aspects of this game. Therefore it's just really bad to do such high size reductions. If it was an option in the server configuration to reduce model sizes to ""gameplay balance"" I would be totally fine with that. Keeping the chill servers as they are, because people want to get somewhere and see their actual reward. Now there is nothing to gain from it. Before the update you could see your progress when standing next to a tree or a natural formation, but now you will ever hardly see the difference all because of balance. Now I know they will add elder morphs, but at that point this game is starting to be basically The Isle 2.0 and not the super awesome game where you could grow big when investing your time into it. No more big apas, rexes or megs being able to jump so high all in the name of balance for players that want a quick repetable game like The Isle. :/",1605085380,1647546783,False,3,0,0.512853741645812988,0,True,False,True

This review is subject to change. 

...

The game still gets regular updates and as it is I am not in the market of saying a game ""Has Potential"". I will comment on what it is *Now* not what it could be later. 

It gets seemingly regular updates and there's a lot of work still to be done as of writing this review but as it is right now the whole game is a glorified walking simulator. Your only enemies are the admittedly wonderful weather algorithm and other players. Of the two the weather is more interesting. There are fires, droughts, lightning, heavy rain, tides, tornadoes, fog and extinction level flooding. 

Admins can now customize base maps to create a unique environment for their players to walk around. I do not know as of yet if they can tweak the weather generation system to be more or less violent but I have seen the oceans disappear in a drought and the entire map vanish under 300 feet of water. Admins can now also control several parameters on the servers including but not limited to: Growth rates before and after adult stages and the revive system. 

You can lay down, sit and sleep, you have 5 different types or roars for emoting, there's a global chat, edibles around the map that spawn for carnivores and herbivores and a ""Comfort"" system for your dinosaur that can actually kill you if they get too stressed so you have a reason not to take your Rex across the ocean, stay in a cave for 3 weeks real time, huddle up next to a group of enemy dinosaurs, or stand in the rain and wind. There's a perk system so you can spec your dino into specific things or become resistant to others but you will have to spend perks in the order that they come in the tree and you cannot simply add 1 perk to all the previous skills and then 3 in the one you want. (Basically no Min-Max)

You do require a mate of the opposite gender to make eggs and there is a breeding system with inherited stats that may or may not pass on to your offspring that the Comfort system also plays into (for mothers) but there's not a lot of information about it beyond speculation and player testing. Colors from parents and grandparents also play a large part and inbreeding penalties are a thing. 

Combat seems okay but frankly I haven't tested it much as eating real people makes them extremely salty. 
(As of editing this has been alleviated somewhat as many private servers now hold Free For All days with Auto Revive turned on and many others have raised the speed in which Dinos grow)

My biggest hangup about this game is that the PvP environment still is not... great. But it is better than it was. You can lose a lot of progress on your creature by losing a fight and even with the resurrection and reincarnation mechanics it can be frustrating or downright off-putting to try and be antagonistic or a predator. 

Let me explain: 
Resurrection: When your creature is slain or dies you can sacrifice other creatures you have played to bring it back to life at a slightly younger age. Your genetic inherits (latent perks from breeding or growing) will come back as they were before but you will have to remove some perks until you earn them back through growing. Easiest way to do this is to raise a tiny fast-growing dinosaur and perk it into the same trees as the one you want to rez and then sacrifice it. 

Reincarnation:
If your creature was killed at an older age than 0.8 you can simply choose to make a new one based off it. I have not thoroughly tested this system. I'll come fix this when I understand it better. 

There are no NPC dinos in any mode (at the moment) and I don't know if there ever will be. Most of the servers are too dead to warrant removing spawn gore and it can take *days* (real life days) on vanilla-rate servers to grow a dino to adult size (1.2) if you don't have time to sit and wait in real life to sit and wait in a videogame. Even with the new resurrection system in place growing new dinosaurs to sacrifice to bring your old one back from the dead is more of a hassle than just growing a new one probably would have been.

TL;DR 99.99% if this game is sitting on your butt hoping no one eats you and avoiding the rain. It's pretty and making a dino is cool but there's nothing to do, nothing to hunt that won't get mad at you and stagnates fast.  There's a point you realize that the biggest dinosaur on your server is just the guy with the most time to waste. 

Private Servers on the other hand can hold events, turn on auto revive to reduce reluctance to actually play the game or up growth rates to also reduce time-loss related fear of death. The game is fun when predators are scary, but it is *not fun* when a getting killed 4 times results in 6 hours of lost progress.

There's still work left to be done, as expected in EA, but there's a good amount of dinosaurs to choose from, you can customize them, breed them, and survive against PVE and PVP. I am very hopeful for this game and it's direction.

My complaints lie mostly with some balancing problems, mesh issues, and other minor things that I know are already being worked out in development. I would like to see our server admins have a little more community control, personally. 

All-in-all, I love this game and the people I play with. :)

EDITED AT 1,100 HOURS: I take back the nice things I've said about this game. The only thing that's actually good about it are the hardworking community admins who pay out of their own pockets to run servers they have virtually no control of, for a broken game that's apparently not much better now than it was years ago when it first got kickstarted (not my words, just the complaint I have heard so, so many times from many long-time players). Public testing for patches is skimpy. Sure, patches come with bugs, it happens. Game breaking bugs every single time? Nah. This last time managed to screw up every other server, and patches to fix things have managed to break more things. This, stacked on top of some of the worst game optimization I've had to endure. My own $1,500 custom built gaming PC has suffered, and I have known countless others who had to completely replace what were otherwise good PCs because of the constant memory leaks and piss-poor optimization. I want to love this game so badly, but the sour attitudes between Community Leaders, Dev Teams, and Discord Moderators is wild. Every gaming community has some wacky shit and problems, for real, but if you can't even be transparent about your game's mechanics? What chance does the rest of the game have?

Ofc, bring any of this up in the Discord and you'll get Moderators and Blind BoB Worshippers telling you you're crazy or wrong. Sure, Jan. I'm dumping this game as soon as my preferred one gets it's pre-release. This game is a lost cause and I regret burning 1k hours of my life on a bottomless pit that will never leave EA.

Edited January 30, 2022: They have finally, ultimately, pulled through and provided a lot of the things I had huge gripes about; community owners can now manage their own servers on their own terms. Have your pointless upvote back, BoB.

Another Edit March 16, 2022: Do you like you game being ran by a controlling, tantrum throwing dev? Do you enjoy being given something the whole community begs for for years, just to have game progress squashed in the next major update? Do you like being given the options to have choices, but not actually allowed to upkeep those choices because the Dev thinks everyone is playing his game incorrectly? Do you get off to paying a sniveling brat developer your hard earned cash to hear about how said head developer ""works 80 hours a week to get complaints every patch released, Fuck You"" in a public discord server? (Screencaps exist, just ask anyone.) Do you enjoy endless yanking around, drama, and the most incomprehensibly unbalanced and poorly optimized game that memory leaks your computer into a coma? Go ahead, drop some cash on this game, because it's the trash fire you've been looking for!

I regret ever up-voting this again, and I hope your game falls and never recovers. 

Pro-tip: maybe if you did surveys once in awhile you'd be able to know what anyone wants. Unfortunately Mr Amazing Head Developer, you're deeply out of touch and are super obsessed with ""my way or the highway."" You're a terrible businessman and even shittier dev.

Seriously, while the game has interesting mechanics, such as land, sea and air playables, digging, climbing, talent system, overgrowth, near unlimited color options, etc. the game play itself is hilariously unbalanced in the favor of herbivore mega herds.

The devs have made getting big literally useless now, the models barely grow bigger, the talents are all fucked over, and they are plastering on new updates to hide the true decay that has happened. You have to grow to nearly 5.0, which can take half a year in 2x growth or over a year in normal growth, to have all talents. And what does that give you? A barely increased size, a small amount of damage/hp increase, where the smaller packs/herds can just murk you if they want to.

I will mourn the game I knew over a year ago, but I don't trust these devs to ever return Beasts of Bermuda to the glory it was when I first started playing. And yes, as a new player, those days were hard but I enjoyed every bit of it. They have destroyed absolutely every little thing that made this game a unique, beautiful place to spend your time.

Great survival game with PVP elements using talent trees with varying ways to buff your dinosaur's different abilities; how well it swims, how well it fights, how well it runs, etc. This also supports replayability, as you can try out tons of different combinations of specializations. Great PVE elements in the storms, as you have to run to find shelter if you aren't specialized to endure them - and try not to drown during floods, tornados or fires!

Trial feature is a little complicated for new players, but once you figure it out it helps with replayability a lot, too. If your dinosaur dies, you can reincarnate it and regrow it again, and it may end up stronger than before if you had enough trials! You earn trial points by hunting, traveling, and all sorts of other activities.

I have three accounts with each having over 500 hours clocked on them. I’ve been someone who has played on both officials and private servers while having more of a preference towards Officials. I play just about anything and I am even someone some might consider to have a ‘big dino’.

I’ve been someone who played small things and was a new player. I’ve also did my time to become a veteran player and have something big.

I’ve met a TON of wonderful people on this server but it’s difficult. With patches like the recent one, it’s hard not to feel like the Dev/Mod Team aims to punish certain players because it doesn’t fall in line with their playstyle on any given day. Most of the Dev team don’t even play their own game let alone for long periods of time to know the players let alone know how some of their own content works.

- The game is filled with Chinese and Russian players who enjoy cheating to play and they specifically play in massive clans on servers and drive other players away with their KOS mentality. I for one enjoy the PvP elements of this game but there is a line where too much becomes too much. The population on servers die because of these tactics and the team will complain about it happen but sit by and twiddle their thumbs on the situation(s) even though they adamantly admit they KNOW these players are using something between hacks and cheats to get these massive dinos in a short amount of time on these servers that poison the population.

- Yesterday they decided to downscale bigger dinos. So my dino that is just about 3.1 is heavily dwarfed to look petite. When I first came to this game and seen a big dino, in my awe I said I wanted to be that big one day. And I did along with many others who worked hard to survival and battle our way through wars, conflict and fights on official servers just to survive. I feel like that in and of itself is an accomplishment. However yesterday, they stripped that from some of their player base – that even stretched as far as people on private servers.

- During this patch they also decided to ‘stat squish’ basically. The smaller you are, you get a lot of points while anything on the bigger spectrum takes even longer than before to earn your points. At 3.0, I lost 10 points from my talent tree yesterday which was quite disappointing. As if it wasn’t hard enough waiting for a point to roll over to put into our trees (the bigger you are, the slower you grow, the longer it takes between points) they wanted to take more away from us that we already earned.

- In truth, I could technically live with all the points listed above. It would mean having to adjust my play style to suit the changes. However what I could not be okay with was that they wanted to force people to nest in randoms on servers. They didn’t like the fact that people were selective in who they choose to give their eggs to from their dinos. Most people are careful and skeptical of such when you have hackers/cheaters on a game that will take anything OP, grow it massive and use it to KOS entire groups on a server. Heaven forbid people be stingy with builds and stats of a large dino they put the time and effort into growing. Heaven forbid they didn’t want stuff like that to get into the hands of the wrong people. Now? It's forced in a way. They save people’s dinos into a server database and the dino technically can be paired/nested with anything of the same species and different gender to create these ‘abandoned eggs’ to put out into the world at random for ANYONE to take. I don’t like the fact they force you to nest with people you may not even like or may not even know, even if it IS at random, and then want to tell you the illusion of “Well you can still nest”. Yes, people can but the fact you take that choice from them to suit your desire is kind of appalling.

To touch on the egg issue, I get it that it was put in to help facilitate new players with getting nested eggs, even if it IS at random, but I don’t understand why they’d do this if it has a chance to be incest and the egg literally spawns anywhere on the map, solo. With nothing sitting on it the egg is in the open for 10 minutes until you can hatch. That's a long time in the open. In addition to that when you hatch you are 0.1 with no one to care for you. It’s hard to navigate the game when you are that small, move at a snail's pace and if you are new to the game entirely? Good luck on finding food or water on time to even survive long enough. On Official servers? Good luck in general because people fresh spawn kill stuff there so much, nothing stands a chance. This is not new player friendly.

- My next gripe is with the Dev Team itself and how they conduct themselves. I’ve played this game long enough to see a few Lead Devs on more than a few occasions ‘lash out’ but the fact that they are unwilling to listen to their community and basically gives them snide remarks, accusations, gaslights and have very poor, venomous responses to a community and people’s opinions is perhaps the worst thing of it all. It’s poor business practice. Being told to get over something or being ridiculed for having an opinion or being belittled because you play the game more than them (and as a buyer and consumer of their product) you really have no sway, say or place in their Discord. You have to sit down, shut up and play what they give you. A lot of it is very backhanded.However; despite this, I have come across some very sweet moderators who really do enjoy interacting with the players but that is very few and far between.

I will be uninstalling and taking my time elsewhere to play something else until BoB decides to shape up. The Isle, Path of Titans or a whole slew of other things on Steam from other companies and developers who prioritize their customers, listen to the people who put the money in their pockets and who actually don’t treat their community like garbage when something doesn’t fall in line with their ideas or narratives.

I made a review back in 2020 recommending this game. I changed that review back in probably February of 2022. I am here again to just give people an idea of the inside of this game before purchasing.

Over the years I have played and watched content, jumped servers, jumped and run clans; staffed and co-owned servers. I have 7 copies of this game. I've seen enough and just about had enough.

[h1]I will begin with the negative as this is what I am cautioning players of[/h1]
☒ A of mechanics in this game are hard to follow and can be hard to learn. Worse than Isle because of the unique ability availability per dino. Alt biting, jump turning, directional attacks on certain dinos, change of hitbox on stance, B-Hopping etc.

☒ Nesting system has been busted for ages and stopped working as intended a long time ago

☒ The entire community is toxic, no matter where you go. Maybe some lovely people here and there. Keep those ones around.

☒ Clan heavy, learn fast or die. Lots of cannibalism. Species KOS because the damage scaling system was adjusted back in 2020, clans are even more amendment to get rid of competition ASAP. Reincarnation system isn't helping with that.

☒ Grow for a few hours on a super cool dino, die in 15 seconds, revive and repeat. Reincarnate? Risk low trials and a less than ideal dino.

☒ Reincarnation is currently broken in regards to trials. Trials cause too many variables for the RNG on the new dino.

☒ Trial, inherits and infinite growth systems can be complicated for new players

☒ Gameplay is no longer rewarding. Growth scaling was nerfed and talents after 2.0 have had their time extended to acquire. Damage can be matched by inherits even between 1.2s and 1.8s depending on the dino. Only perk of growth is more talent points and more HP to scale.

☒ Bucket load of bugs that were never tended to but always get released and somehow are not able to be replicated. Players are able to do so, however.

☒ Private servers are not ideal to play on unless you can find a fair and just place to go. A lot end up using the power they have to run their servers as if it was a country in their palm.

[h1]Now for some other things[/h1]
[b]These are unique aspects of the game rather than specifically positives. There is both pros and cons of these points but just read as you please![/b]
☑ Unique infinite growth feature taking away the completion of a dinosaur in a way

☑ Talent tree and point system allowing players to actually create a build as they please

☑ Nesting system for inheritance allowing people to get even better stats than a spawn dinosaur *sometimes

☑ Spawn dinosaurs now do not have negative inherits at all and *sometimes have increased chance to match stats of nested dinos per RNG

☑ Reincarnated dinos have an even higher chance to get better inherits than spawns and *sometimes nested dinos depending on RNG and trials.

☑ Most dinosaurs in the roster have a unique ability and/or talent in their trees so players can strategise and utilise their talents

☑ Unique skins and mixed skins from nesting allowing players to create unique skins and be known for their skins/colours.

☑ Unique and now incredibly rare glowing skins (Shimmer, Glimmer, Rune/Sacred dinos)

☑ In-game revival and reincarnation system for players so they don't have to perma die or require nesting. Great for solos but complex to explain to new players.

☑ Newer models are average and boxy BUT some animations make it worth the gameplay

☑ Server administrators have the ability to add assets to their maps to make them more unique

☑ Server administrators have the ability to reset talents, change genders and reskin players if they wish to do so.

At this moment. I DO NOT recommend this game. It's current state is not ideal. It needs a lot of work and the community needs to be listened to. There needs to be a balance, which has been lacking for quite a long time.

The new update has brought a lot of bad news. Yes the animation of a paras waving their booty is really cool, but it's just a veil to what's underneath it all. Players who spend many hours are punished for having achieved high growth on their dinosaurs. Hitbox repair - I can understand, it is easier to find a shelter from a storm or tornado - I can believe it too, but taking their talent points away from them is really not fair, especially since when you reach growth 2.0+, time collecting skill points is really long and time-consuming. If I remember correctly, it takes from 6h to about 10h to earn one skill point, depending on the tier of the dinosaur we play. Adding the fog in the ocean again makes playing aquatic dinosaurs pointless, because you can see practically nothing but yourself and maybe 5m ahead. Before this patch, a lot of owners server were working to spice up the map as they added some life to the empty spaces, and now the devs have taken it and make the ocean depressing, sad, empty and unplayable again.
For several updates, this game is really going in the wrong direction. Devs do not ask for the opinion of the community, and when they do it after the fact, they do not intend to change it anyway. Many players can see devs' attitude towards their community.
This patch was one big ""fuck you yall"" to the players who played, spent tons of hours - whether it's chill servers, survival servers or semi-realism. The community, however, does not forget and knows how to show it, despite the fact that it is silenced on discord by bans, time outs or mutes. The game had potential and is now being killing by devs. Congratulations, you are killing your community slowly, but very effectively.

Listen. If you're looking for a game with great controls, great graphics, and no major bugs or glitches, you should stop looking at early access games. 

However. If you're looking for a fun time, manageable wackyness, and a mostly great community you've found a game worth trying. 

This game has its flaws, but if you find a good server they have systems in place to prevent that, and help you with any progress you lose. Its the perfect place to play with friends, or find new ones. the babies are cute, and have little noises they make specially for different points in their life. (*little baby murr here*)

Genuinely I tried to have fun with this game since I have friends who own this game and do play it enough. I do not believe a game should have servers with extra rules to make the experience fun, and many of the servers have that. Growth takes forever and you only end up growing to 1.2 to be gang-banged by another group with a growth twice the size of yourself. The only good thing I can say about this game is the offspring and talent points system. It's refreshing to see something new that impacts the game, but unfortunately it means nothing if the largest players dominate the server. No matter what dino you are, do not expect to live long. Even if you resurrect your dino it doesn't mean anything since you'll just die over and over, which then you waste time trying to resurrect it.

TLDR. Pointless waste of time to die by the bigger dinosaurs.",1646096663,1646096663,False,60,9,0.668999433517456055,4,True,False,True

This review is mainly based on the actual game itself, NOT on any socially related baggage or drama that some players have been so inclined to complain about. It's like saying a quality meal at a restaurant sucked because someone was screwing around at the table next to you. Which makes NO sense whatsoever! So anyway...

Things I like: 

>>Not only do I like the fact that each creature has their specialties, their strengths and weaknesses, but I thought the ""talent points"" system was an awesome concept. So the player still has the freedom to tweak their dino stats to better fit their play style. 
>>Realistic Causes and effects. Like if you land too hard as a flier, you can break your bones. Pools of fresh water can shrink and degrade in quality as they are used, but to be replenished my rain, etc. 
>>Customization is great! All you have to do is pick a pattern, and you can literally make a rainbow dinosaur! Go nuts! lol
>>Adjustable Graphics, also accessible in game, not just in the menu. This is very helpful if you are worried about running the game in real time. 
>>MANY SERVERS TO CHOOSE FROM. Yes, some reviews on here complain about bullying. It happens. What do you do? CHOOSE ANOTHER SERVER! Try it sometime! XD 
>>Graphical detail and audio quality is very nice! 

Things I don't like: 

>>Servers can get laggy with 50+ people! It's not just me, I have an almost gigabit connection, yet I get some choppy frames when I'm near a group of other players. Would be nice if there were other measures besides sacrificing some of them sweet graphics 
>>Eating and drinking is a little buggy sometimes. I find myself inching around and mashing the F button a few times just to do so 
>>A few dinosaur info pages are missing! When I click on ""creature select"" a few of those info pages are missing, but those are still playable. Just needs a smol update on those

Overall, great game! I can't wait to see what future updates bring!",1642132321,1645863540,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

There's a healthy amount of different creatures to play with two fliers, several aquatics and semi-aquatics, herbivore, omnivores and carnivores.
PROS:
1. A lot of quality of life features such as food carrying, baby carrying, perks/buffs for living in groups, etc.
2. Growing number of dinos and playable creatures. As far as dino games go, the updates are frequent enough to keep the landscape changing and improving at a moderate pace. (Not a lot of great examples to compare to but compared to Isle's glacial update speed, this is leaps and bounds better as far as improvement and frequency goes.)
3. Dynamic weather and water/ocean level systems.
4. Seamless growth. Watch your trex go from a precious little lizard of a squirt to the mighty king of beasts the species is famous for.
5. There are a few community owned servers that host a set of different rules including semi-realism or no-kill servers. As well as the official servers which have no rules apart from common sense such as no cheating and whatnot. Find the server that fits your play style best.
6. A nesting system complete with playable eggs. You get growth improving buffs when you have young children nearby, giving an actual practical reason to nest and risk life and limb to keep them alive.
7. Customization. Various unique skins per dino, designed in layers which you can color and tweak to your heart's delight. The nesting system also has a genetics and skin inheritance system so you have a chance of getting a mix between two parents' skins if you are their baby. And you also inherit colors. The only downside is that you can't change the hue of those colors if you were nested.
8. Adjust your creature's strengths to fit your play style. Wanna be an aquatic megalosaurus? There's perks for that. Wanna be a fighter velociraptor? There's perks for that. However, this brings us to the first of the cons..
CONS:
1. A gigantic size and skill point advantage that makes it EXTREMELY hard to catch up to the competition if you are joining a server that already has dozens of 1.5+ growth dinos. The player base on this game is MERCILESS. Trust no one who is not a part of your group and even then be wary.
2. Certain dinos need some work. I have been mowed down by giant flocks major damage causing pteranodons as an adult megalosaurus. Picked up by a mosasaurus as a decently sized apatosaurus. Etc etc. Needless to say that balance needs a lot of work.
3. Growth on many creatures takes HOURS to get to a strong size. And during that time you are extremely vulnerable to stronger, faster creatures. There is little to no way to avoid being targeted as such, even if you live in a group, you're more than likely to be a target to the experienced hunter. Life as a carnivore is also difficult. There are natural spawned ribs but no large group of carnivores can live off of just those very well. So it's often required to hunt or cannibalize to survive.",1619979226,1645852383,True,2,0,0.502211630344390869,0,True,False,True

Cons IMO:
Limited active communities
Toxic(non official) servers/toxic server owners

Not a lot of problamatic bug fixes(Some dinos are significantly weaker that others of the same size class)
Difficult to understand shrine system with reincarnations 
The majority of players are kids

Pros IMO: 
Unique talent tree
Great Breeding/familial inherit system
Unique skin customizations
Reincarnation/Resurrection elements.

1. Official Servers. There are some mod i love and others....i and many do not. for certains reasons including being biased even tho they will say otherwise it is clear they are.
 When being reported you get an instant ban even if you havent done anything wrong, what happend to innocent untill proven guilty, get two sides of the story before insta ban (unless hacks ect).
 i get that most mods have their own thing to do, or deserve to play the game themselves, BUT they DID decide to volenteer as mod, but you hardly see any on at all and tickets can take up to days to be responded to or even be forgotten about. mods tend to also blame the games buggy-ness with your latency for no reason at all even if more than 3 people can see it for themselves. 
I feel like if people who are not fluent in English and speak in global (rulebreak to speak anything but English) should be asked and told in their native language instead of English to either speak English or not at all, instead of being angrilly told off by irritated mods to speak English.
 There are also EXTREMELY suspicious cases of mods  'protecting' certain people from reports saying its 'coincidental'  or  it can be 'proven' to be true otherwise. 
its such a shame to see a really good game slowly dying off mainly due to these problems as i have had 20+ people help me write this and there were plenty more problems.

Should be less about whoever hits who first wins because it only takes tops 4, to more of a combat system. The combat mostly just feels like ganking or being ganked not a fight, but the mechanics and concepts are definitely strong. I think reincarnating should have more of an effect as well, if it's going to have perma death there should be a benefit to not wanting to just leave the game when you get killed, your persistence should be awarded a bit more than it is. Also maybe a more clear concept of how inherits work. Do you randomly get them or is it due to exposure to things? Just some thoughts but have to say once they add more features definite 10/10 it's a Dino MMO that has no subscription, amazing idea, just needs more features.

I recommend it to anyone who's wanting to find a chill game where you grow your own dino and possibly create a family. I will preface that this is not a noob friendly game. If you join without having a friend who already plays, it might take some time to get used to it, but you'll eventually learn the mechanics and make some friends along the way. This game has its fair share of toxic players, but there are plenty of good people in the game too. If you're just starting out, maybe play around in the official servers, and then when you're nice and ready to put a bit more commitment into the game, join a community server. There are plenty out there that have rules that might cater to your play style. There's a server advertisement channel on the official discord. Peruse around a little and find one that seems fun! 

Your first experience with this game very well could be you spawning a new dinosaur, dying instantly to someone who happened to be nearby, and seeing in the all chat gg ez get gud kid, and that's okay! 

Dying is a core mechanic of this game. I know it sounds weird seeing as how this isn't a Dark Souls game, but dying lets you learn from your mistakes. Maybe don't trust that type of dino instantly just because they're also an herbivore. Maybe that area of the map is a hot spot and you should try and find a way around that portion of the map if there's a pack of something there. You'll learn the ins and outs of the game through dying. Don't let your death deter you from having a fun time.

The biggest one right now being that if you die within 15 minutes of getting on the game, you still have a 15 minute timer before you can switch to another dinosaur, unless you create an entirely new one, but with only 6 character slots for the 17 (currently) playable dinos, that's not always an option.

The skill trees are better than they were when I originally made this post a year ago, but theyre still filled with pointless skills that are usually at the base of the tree so you HAVE to invest points into them so you can get to the actually useful skills.

They have balanced the growth more, but the game STILL is not for the casual players. Once you hit 1.2 of growth, the rate of growth drops dramatically, practically coming to a grinding hault. After that its hours and hours and hours of sitting around waiting for .001 growths, and often times DAYS for that .04 amount of growth needed to get another skill tree point (which you get to waste into a skill you don't even want) If you can't dedicate your life to this game, you don't stand a chance against those who can, because they have far bigger dinos than you could hope to achieve with many more useful skills.

And the devs seem h*llbent on making some dinos unplayable. IRL hunts are ALWAYS difficult and dangerous to predators. Prey can either outrun their predators, or fatally harm them. But in this game, the devs are pretty much making 3/4 of the dinos into dodos. Just walking meals meant to be slaughtered without any difficulty to the predators. And they've said as much too when nerfing many of the dinos. I LOVE para, but they dont stand a chance against ANYTHING. And velos? Why is it that something smaller than an apa's toenail can kill it? IRL, they wouldn't even be able to get through an apa's skin. The dinos need SERIOUS balancing.

Waste your time making neon dinos only to join a server with 10 people and to be killed over and over as a fresh spawn for no gain to the other player. I got this game while out on Covid leave and played for the week.

Cons:
- You could 400 hours in this game and get little to no combat experience due to low player base 
- Low player base means just sitting in one place and listening to music
- If you fight someone they will more than likely hunt you down on another dino
- With low population I see no reason to hunt other people when there's spawn gore
- With Low population if you aren't in a group be prepared to be hunted by people who are bored
- Trail system is complicated 
- There's nothing to do most of the time but sit and watch a sky box
- gameplay isn't rewarding 
- Spend 10 hrs growing a dino only to die in a 1 min fight that's just tail biting. 
** boring combat and abilities. **
________

Pros:
- I've met a lot of new people from playing. 
- The newer models look nice, seems like the game is always slowly updating with new features. 
- Dino models are nice for drawing refs.

Some advice if you want to get this game: 
** Start out as an egg and hopefully you'll have parents who can show you the ropes while also having protection. 
** Feel free to ask for help in global, a lot of seasoned players love helping out noobs as quick as they love to kill them over and over for a laugh. 
** If you don't like the neon colors there's an option to turn it off. 

** Download Tik-Tok and enjoy your time sitting around doing nothing, only moving when you need to eat or get water , join a discord and chat in the background.",1643154769,1643154769,False,4,0,0.553959548473358154,6,True,True,True

The customization is unmatched by similar titles and there is infinite replay-ability as each life will always be uniquely different from the last. There is a system that allows you to revive or reincarnate lost creatures which really helps soften the blow of death and prevent players from starting all over again from square one if they die. The game is still in early access and still contains many bugs and outdated graphics, however the developers are very passionate about this game and pour their heart and soul into it. Despite the tiny development team, updates are very frequent, especially compared to other similar titles.

Unfortunately, I cannot recommend the game in its current because of two major reasons.

Firstly, due to the infinite growth system the way the talent/inherit system works, there is simply a massive time sink needed to be invested for players to able to be competitive. Combat for many creatures boils down to exchanging blows and whichever creature has the better inherits/is larger usually wins the fight. Farming for good inherits takes time and growing to a massive size takes a ridiculous amount of time. The good news is, is that the development team is actively attempting to fix this core issue with the game, and many things like reincarnation have been added to help close the gap between casual players and hardcore players, but the bad news is that this development has severely stunted by the second reason I cannot recommend this game.

The second reason I cannot recommend Beasts of Bermuda is that a massive part of the player community is extremely toxic. There is a lot of drama that goes on both in game and out of game, and it really sours the experience. Most of the toxicity outside the game itself resides in the game's Discord server, where a very loud portion of players will actively protest development, attempting and (sometimes succeeding) at slowing down, stopping, and even reversing balance and mechanic changes that will move the game forward but will disrupt their positions of power over other players. Its very sad to see the potential in this game but watch the development team appearing to walk on eggshells around their playerbase, I am unsure of what the future holds for this game and if it will ever escape from the rut that its in.",1642794992,1642794992,False,2,0,0.518840432167053223,0,True,False,True

Unfortunately, I have to give the game a thumbs down for certain reasons. 
One of the main reasons is probably this incredible toxic community behind this game, especially bad on the Official Discord.

I have met many toxic people in other communities and that there are such people is also normal but HERE .. I have never seen such an extremely toxic community at ANY online game. 
Honestly? It's even sometimes so bad when you follow the official Discord as if the people there are all .. are misanthropic.

In my opinion, every online game stands and falls with its community, because ultimately it is the community that brings the money to the game because merch, accounts etc. are bought. 
The Beasts of Bermuda community is simply cancer, a malignant ulcer that harms the game in the long run.

if you follow the official discord, unfortunately the lead devs do not always give the impression as if they really care for the behavior of the community, which I personally find very unfortunate. 

On the other hand, this behavior of the lead devs speaks for itself and you immediately know where you stand here.

Otherwise, the game is not really balanced and I hardly think that people play the game because of its ''super'' combat system, because there are already better Dino Survival Games out there.

Personally, I just hope that the entire beasts of bermuda team will get a better grip on their community in the future, that the lead devs will show a more professional appearance and that people who publicly denounce you or others in the Discord and call them whatever will be put in their place in the future.",1642534343,1642534343,False,3,0,0.510271847248077393,0,True,False,True

This is a ticket I put in after I got banned for 7Days. The admin deleted the post and closed it before i could copy the last few messages. He basically said this post wasnt going anywhere and couldnt explain the rules and how i broke them. This game will crash and burn if they keep playing favorites towards certain people in it. Makes gameplay very frustrating.

The sad part is i like bob a lot just wish they took a little more time when they write their rules.

Bushu — Yesterday at 1:39 PM

i was ban and im just trying to figure out what the incident was so i can appeal it. guilty until proven innocent is kinda ridiculous.

[1:40 PM]

o2 Bushu 76561197975179316 i record all my play

[1:41 PM]

164 hour ban with no warning or evidence for the accused is not how you should run a administration

[1:45 PM]

i have hundreds of hours of video. and i dont mixpack so kinda need to know when this was so i can defend my self

Bushu — Yesterday at 2:10 PM

i stream and this is kinda how i make my living so id appreciate the understand of urgency

mbiggiani — Yesterday at 3:12 PM

Hello u/Bushu we will review this, thank you for your patience

mbiggiani — Yesterday at 3:25 PM

u/Bushu i'm afraid after review, mixpacking is confirmed. Since this is your second offence, this ban will remain in effect for 7 days.

Bushu — Yesterday at 3:25 PM

second offense?

[3:25 PM]

i have never been accused of mix pack and i dont even have a chance to defend myself

[3:26 PM]

i have recordings of everything.

mbiggiani — Yesterday at 3:26 PM

You have a meshing offence from December 29th.

[3:26 PM]

If you have recordings please share them.

Bushu — Yesterday at 3:27 PM

u want 150 some hours of recordings?

[3:27 PM]

i need a date and time of the offense so i can pull it up

mbiggiani — Yesterday at 3:27 PM

The offence was on January 12th

[3:27 PM]

A coah killed a rex right after the rex killed an apato

Bushu — Yesterday at 3:29 PM

? how is this mixpack? i was told in game t hat after a fight is complete u can engage

[3:29 PM]

and the rules dont specify this so i have to go what the server is telling me in general

mbiggiani — Yesterday at 3:30 PM

Who told you this? If it wasn't an official staff member then its not good advice necessarily.

Bushu — Yesterday at 3:32 PM

official staff members arnt usually on when im on. if you can show me the rule that states i cant killed a dino after he kills another dino ill agree with this. it states if a fight is happening not if a fight is completed

[3:32 PM]

If a fight is happening and it’s not possible to group with a player (Example being a Megalo and a Para working together to kill a rex.) you cannot involve yourself in the fight. This is clear mixpacking if you do

[3:32 PM]

if a fight is happening

[3:32 PM]

it wasnt happening

[3:33 PM]

cant involve yourself with the fight. there was no fight cus it was over

mbiggiani — Yesterday at 3:33 PM

Mixpacking is not allowed on the Official Beasts of Bermuda servers. Mixpacking is defined as animals working together that normally shouldn’t be able to in a fight.

Mixpacking includes, but is not limited to, the following scenarios.

- Engagement -

If a fight is happening and it’s not possible to group with a player (Example being a Megalo and a Para working together to kill a rex.) you cannot involve yourself in the fight. This is clear mixpacking if you do.

Since the second fight happened quickly after the first, it falls under this rule

Bushu — Yesterday at 3:33 PM

oh so theres a time frame

[3:33 PM]

whats that

[3:33 PM]

cus i dont know when im allowed took

[3:34 PM]

i feel you guys are jsut making stuff up here

[3:34 PM]

this is very unclear

[3:34 PM]

if its 30sec or whatever then ill count

mbiggiani — Yesterday at 3:34 PM

Its a case by case basis depending on the context and situation at hand.

Bushu — Yesterday at 3:36 PM

so you are playing favorites then? if its case by case do you just change the time frame to whatever you want. if this was stated clearly i wouldnt have and issue here. and u quoted it. it states ""if a fight is happening"" NOT happened

[3:37 PM]

its clear happening and happened

mbiggiani — Yesterday at 3:37 PM

I can assure you thats not the case, we access each situation fairly.

Bushu — Yesterday at 3:37 PM

well theres no other reason it appears. can you explain what i should do next time?

[3:39 PM]

a dino killed another dino then i killed it. from what people say in all chat, it is not mixpacking. the fight was over and according to your rules its not ""happening"" how can u say this is differenty

[3:40 PM]

admins are not on and rules are not clear. and i get 7 days ban. the mesh was explained to me by an admin when it happened and i never did it again. the mixpack was never explained

[3:41 PM]

how can u ban me without a warning or explaination of the rule when the rule is clearly not clarified

mbiggiani — Yesterday at 3:41 PM

Well, if you ever have any questions about the rules you can always use bob-questions and we can clarify any concerns you may have. However, ignorance of a rule is no excuse for breaking said rule.

Bushu — Yesterday at 3:42 PM

ignorance ? your right! whnen it says ""happening"" and you guys interpret it has happened. that is ignorance

mbiggiani — Yesterday at 3:42 PM

Is there anything else we can assist you with today

Bushu — Yesterday at 3:43 PM

ya you can explain the rule

[3:43 PM]

when am i allowed to attack someone after a kill is made

mbiggiani — Yesterday at 3:43 PM

As I said, its a case by case basis but generally you should not be attacking someone right after they have fought as they are in a weakened state and it can be considered mixpacking.

Bushu — Yesterday at 3:44 PM

oh so where stated in the rule cus i wouldnt have done that

mbiggiani — Yesterday at 3:44 PM

Many times people will respawn or call their group mates to attack a weakened person, which is why the rule is as it is.

Bushu — Yesterday at 3:44 PM

oh ok didnt know that eaither

mbiggiani — Yesterday at 3:44 PM

We can certainly add on to the rule to clarify it so this situation does not happen again.

Bushu — Yesterday at 3:45 PM

so your admitting its not stated

[3:45 PM]

come on man

[3:45 PM]

this is worng and u know it

mbiggiani — Yesterday at 3:45 PM

Thats not what I said. All I said is we can make clearer what is already stated so it does not cause confusion.

Bushu — Yesterday at 3:45 PM

this cant be the first time this has happened either

[3:46 PM]

so your implying that its poorly stated

[3:46 PM]

its not even stated

[3:46 PM]

poorly

[3:46 PM]

i have 10 people in discord chat stating they dont even know. the weakened state is new to me too

[3:47 PM]

no one knew that

mbiggiani — Yesterday at 3:47 PM

Up until this point nobody had had any concerns about the rule, so we figured everyone understood it properly. But if thats not the case we certainly want to rectify things.

Bushu — Yesterday at 3:47 PM

like these are things we need to know

[3:47 PM]

lmao u know thats wrong

[3:48 PM]

ok so my understanding is. a rule thats not stated/clarified from your words. your banning me for 7 days

mbiggiani — Yesterday at 3:48 PM

I can have the administration look into this ticket for you as I understand you are not satisfied at this time.

[3:49 PM]

I think a lot of people are put off by the somewhat juvenile graphics in comparison to its more realism pointed step siblings, but the game is still gorgeous in it's own manner and has a ton of great mechanics. 

Pros
+Great implementation of systems such as diet, breeding, genetics and weather/catastrophes
+Decent roster of dinos for land, air, and sea
+Fun skin system and rare skins obtained through luck/nesting
+Game is well optimised and looks good
+Mitigation toward losing your grown dinos via the shrines using reviving and resurrection

Cons
-Yes, the community is sometimes quite toxic, you might find there is a lot of arguing about rules and rulebreaking. Some people just get hella salty, too. Personally have not found it as bad as the Isle and can't speak on the official mods, but I play on LFAW and Tacano and always have a good time. You just have to accept in a game where rules have to be manually upheld by a group of mods running it on their free time that the system is not going to be perfect. 
-Combat feels a bit janky and frustrating at times, and my biggest gripe is that there are still no physical indicators for your opponents health whereas in The Isle Legacy you can gauge HP based on physical injury. 
-UI in game (especially to access player list and groups) is super wonky at times

It's extremely difficult for new players to enjoy the game. Juveniles cannot combat sub adults, or even adults. They are destroyed by everything. The learning curve is quite large.

Many time the game fails to feel like a game anymore and ends up feeling like a chore or a job. Everyone wants the best dino, but to get good dinos you need to sink hours into the game.

Even if you manage to get yourself a good dino, many games of the feature are very punishing which begs the question whether hours worth of growth is worth fights that last minutes.

This game really can be fun with forming a group and going out on an adventure with some packmates. The skill tree is an awesome thing that makes you really want to progress.
With that said, this game suffers the same issue as other games like the Isle and that's with the absolutly harsh growth system. Not only does it take a stupidly long time for you to grow your ideal animal, but it is very easy to die during that time from things not your fault (mainly other players who always Kill On Sight). What makes this feel so mean spirited is the whole thing with having to restart your animal. Yes I know there's ressurections and such, but those are only earned if you have other animals that can actually make it to adulthood and not die from bad rng with other players. It is extrmely brutal to have to restart pratially all of your progress just becasue some jerk decided to bully you. I know Growth is meant to make you feel like you earned your animal, but it really just makes you feel defenseless and weak while you wait for your animal to be good. I feel like something that could help is make juveniles unique in the sense of havingaabilites the adults don't (such as being faster, climbing trees, etc.) And providing a less punishing save system that just resets your animal to 1.0 if you die or your last growth progression, so it doesn't feel like those 2 hours you spent walking around only to die by a random Mega were wasted.

It was fun, colorful, and had a lot of unique creatures that no other dinosaur game could compare with, and best of all, growth took so little time that it wasn't truly difficult to actually jump into the game.

Now, scroll ahead to late 2019, where growth was significantly slowed down. Personally, this is what began the downward spiral of this game. It would take up to 16 hours to get any medium sized dinosaur to 1.2 (the typical adult stage in this game), with the shortest period of time being 2 hours for the Velociraptor. While it was annoying, the smaller players could still feasibly compete with the big bois, as long as they had dedication and played smartly.

Skip ahead, even further, to the dreadful 2020 Rex Update. Talent Trees were completely reworked and damage scaling received a SEVERE nerf, making it to where grinding for inherits and spending your entire life on the game is the only way to compete on servers. These changes made Inherits the key to glory. If you have good Inherits, you can beat anything, regardless of the size difference. But, at least if you killed the overpowered players, they're gone until they grind up again.

Following this comes the Shrine and Resurrection system, which made the prior changes even more imbalanced. Truly, the only way to fully succeed is if you have +2s in various talent (which takes serious dedication and hours of trying and luck to acquire), as once you die, you can simply resurrect yourself to regain your lost inherits and launch straight back into the game to destroy anybody who dares rival you.

Ever since this update, I haven't seen a SINGLE consistent server. Balance is off the charts, only inherits and group size defines how well you'll fare, and once a server achieves large, 2.0+ players with OP inherits; it's done for.

The game is ridiculously unbalanced and addicting, and honestly, it is not worth the purchase. No server thrives for more than a month, and if it does, it'll be overrun by players with ridiculously overpowered inherits with 0 way to trump them. The game is not good for new players looking for a fun dinosaur survival experience. Back with old growth, old balancing (while crazy, it worked), and the old system where you starved the bigger you were, Beasts of Bermuda was an amazing game. Now though, it's not a game worth your time. It's a game full of chaos and unbalance, and truly, this is not the Beasts of Bermuda I grew to love.

I have tons of amazing memories from this game, but continuing to play is truly just out of nostalgia from what the game used to be. It's not the fun experience it once was, and it's time for me to finally say goodbye.",1596834924,1639172100,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Keep in mind that a lot of what I’m about to say is my personal experiences with the game and that I am a very experienced PvP player that just wants to enjoy a dino game.

Good


1. No other PvP survival game has given me the amount of excitement this game has given me in a long time. This game offers many different unique creatures to pick and choose from with all of them being able to kill each other if you have the skill to do so which means that I can be the smallest thing in the game and still kill the Apex creatures if I try.

2. The different creatures this game provides makes me feel like I actually have options to play when I’m choosing a creature rather than just “Choosing a worse Rex”. There’s aquatics, Flyers and even a creature that can live underground.

3. As a player I can choose what I want my creature to do, so if I want to be fast I can invest in speed talents, if I want to hit hard I invest in combat. This makes me feel like I can choose my own destiny instead of being locked into a specific playstyle like The Isle does where we all more have the same stats when at adult growth.

4. The skins I can make with customization can be hilarious and fun making it very artistic and creative when messing around with skins. I personally find Barney Rex very fun to play as since it shocks most players. While it does get rid of the realism you can always turn on a filter to prevent seeing stuff like that.

5. Nesting (While not really my thing) is pretty fun and unique. Unlike the isle, BoB’s nesting system allows skins from both parents to mix making for some really cool colors and patterns to form that normally would not. You can also get better talents by nesting, meaning you can be faster and stronger than normal.

6. The no growth limits in this game can make for really fun fights. Its really fun as a group of 1.0-1.2 acros (Normal Sized Adults) to try and kill a 1.6 apato (Oversized Adult) or vice versa and getting big yourself/with friends is very rewarding.

Bad

The Community plays a big part into what this game is but they are also the biggest problem as it can get very toxic depending on the subject. Most of the bads I will be talking about will be about them.

1. Not the friendliest game to be a noob in. As a new player there is quite a bit to learn as there are many creatures, matchups, maps and mechanics to try and work with and I have found not many people are willing to share their knowledge of the game despite being veterans. Personally I will try and help new players when I play with them but I know some people are shy so I want to say here don't be afraid to ask! Many people like me would love to help/guide you.

2. It can get pretty toxic when a large creature (2.0 Apato or 1.5 Acro for example) dies. The reason being they spent hundreds of hours growing and they feel entitled to get it back no matter the reason they try and grasp for. Depending on the server yes they can get it back but at the end of the day most deaths are just from people who want to PvP and end up winning. If your new and reading this, dying is okay, getting past 1.2 is a great thing! But keep in mind that is the endgame for you and anything past that is just nice.

3. If you like killing, be prepared to be hated/witch hunted. If you are anything like me and like PvP you will not be liked. BoB is a survival game that has PvP in it and this can cause a lot of toxicity with players as people spend hours and hours online to get bigger. This will cause players to Grief, Threaten, Troll and just overall bully you and I want to say fuck that, This game is meant for PvP you dont play this game to sit around for 10+ hours unless you play on a chill server. For new players seeing this please do not become hateful of the PvP as just like games like Ark and Isle the PvP for the most part is what makes this game fun. Some tips I will give players is Change your name a lot to prevent things like this from happening but even then people will save your steam account to keep tabs on you.

- can be fun on occasion. Fighting on servers with other players is very fun sometimes
- fun skin system 
- interesting mechanics

Cons 
- SALT. who the fuck decided that.
- creatures grow extremely slow, and when they die you lose a ton of progress (IE your time you spent sitting in this game) and get nothing in return. 
- skins are limited if you're not nested. 
- some species lack skins(Saichania has 2, for example) and while they're expecting a remodel, this has been an issue since the first model was released. 
- only fun with friends 
- dying as a creature you're attached to can set players off playing entirely.

EDIT; As of the July 13th update, There is now a resurrection mechanic built into the game, Which allows for players to choose sacrificial offers out of their creature slots. This will count towards the trial point cost of whatever they want to resurrect, And when all three trial costs are met (Speed, Combat & Survival) the previously dead creature will be returned, Granted its growth will be set back a bit. This *somewhat* mitigates the point I was trying to make here, As the frustration of finally getting a good roll of the dice and barely getting to play with it before being essentially one-shot by someone who has way more time to spend on the game, And then *losing* said good roll and never being able to play with it again (Unless you hang out the discord servers and can pay for revives, Which I don't do for personal reasons) was more than irritating, And genuinely made me stop playing.

As of October 17th, There is now a reincarnation mechanic- Similar to the resurrection mechanic, But different enough to be valuable. It can only apply to creatures that are 0.8+ in size. It costs no trial points to do this, But trial points will enhance inherits, If you do well in their scores. Your old previous creature will be gone forever. However, Your reincarnated creature will have a similar appearance and similar inherits to the old one- ""The juvenile will receive a skin/inherits that would result from the reincarnated creature breeding with itself""

This, And the introduction of Omnivores brought me back to the game. It's definitely improving now.",1621578769,1638282124,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

I absolutely do not recommend this game to anyone who thinks that surviving solo or in a group of randoms is viable. Its not.  

This game requires having a large group and tons of time to enjoy.

At this point this game isn't even a survival game because you really have no defense against the dominant players on any server, you will be nothing but fodder for them no matter how big you are because they will always have something bigger or just outnumber you and they sure as hell wont let you join them unless you know them irl. you cant hide, you cant outrun them and you sure as hell cant fight them. it literally takes a extremely determined person to even try to enjoy this game as many just quit outright. also all it takes a google search to find hacks for this game which i am convinced a large number of the players use which just makes things worse.

Some recommendations to make this game better would be to either increase growth rate beyond 1.2 or to just remove unlimited growth and remove inherits from breeding because this is the heart of the extreme toxicity this game is know for. make it so that inherits are limited and can  be earned by all players evenly and not just players who can afford to sit around in large groups all day long or players who know someone in a clan. these mechanics create such a huge gap between players i don't even see why the developers thought that it would be a good idea because new players don't stand a  chance. the reincarnation and sacrifice mechanics are a step in the right direction but still requires tons of time and doesn't shorten the gap between the players.

In short good game ruined by horrible and toxic players abusing mechanics to bully all other players on all servers.

In this game you  play as a dinosaur. You can start out as an egg meaning  the eggs are layed by players, or you can creat one by selecting  an existing one. 

Pros
graphics are decant
It's challenging evn if you aren't  facing the risks of other players killing you
nice weather system  

cons
the game devs removed the ability to host your own servers forcing you to rent them.
 some of the meshing does not align
Large dinos get stuck between trees even though you should fit.



Despite the negatives I would recommend this game..

 If you looking for a more of a pve experience check out  the servers (private) that has chill in their name. Pandanomium chill is a active good one. It is Pg 13 though
Dragonstone is semi chill. There is  killing on this server.",1636597774,1636597774,True,2,0,0.496503472328186035,0,True,False,True

The endless growth provides for a system where newer players to the game have a small chance in succeeding on their own. The communities are divided into massive popularity contests forming small groups of friends that all help protect each-other. Now this may seem like a good thing provided there are multiple groups in the same server, but, in most cases there is one dominant group of friends that makes it very difficult to survive for everyone else.

Pros: 
- It can be fun with a group
- The dinosaurs are kind of interesting
- Being able to choose your colours makes making new dinos fun

Cons:
- The combat is basically my dad is bigger than your dad. What I mean is thanks to unlimited non capped growth who ever is bigger will 90% win over a smaller dinosaur. 
- If you don't have a group you will most likely die before reaching 1.2 growth unless you are an oryctodromeus.
- Only american servers for official servers.
- Most if not all communities you join will have already established clans that effectively control the server and more often than not if you hurt the fragile ego of any of these groups prepare to have every dino under the sun come after you. 
- mechanics breed toxic behaviour.
- You are REQUIRED to have some form of recording software if you wish to play this game.
- Its so easy to cheat/exploit/break rules (even after adding anti cheat, 3 years after release I might add) that its very hard to judge if players are playing legit or not.

BUT...
I give a massive thumbs down on how the developers operate. Yes it's early access so expect issues, but come on people, you waited until prime time to shut down 5 out of 6 of your official severs which hold upto 150 players each, leaving 1 server that holds 20 max. WITHOUT notifying your player base before hand, slapping an update for us to download (which we appreciate) and then when we take to discord for an ETA the management refuse to give one out.

i suppose on the flip side its prime time so time to move away from beasts until they fix there problem in house and communicate with there player base.",1634764271,1634764271,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

You can be an aquatic specialised trex or a 'quick' sauropod. It is cool in the fact that it has animals for land, air and sea, also exciting are the random disasters like forest fires and floods. Unfortunately however this is where the cool ends in my opinion.

The main issue is the balance and the community behavior. This game is super unbalanced and dinosaurs can grow forever. Initially this seems cool until you realise the guy who sat afk for 20 hours will kill you not matter what. Its a competition to grow that people can't keep up with unless they also play nonstop. Also herbivore players tend to sit at a watering hole for hours seemingly not even wanting to play.

Its really just a dull game, you wander around and grow your creature (wait) for a few hours so you can compete. If you are even more unlucky you are then pecked to death by flying velociraptors.",1634618340,1634618340,False,2,0,0.494699656963348389,0,True,False,True

Dinosaur games, theres a lot out there and a lot of appeal. The Isle, Path of titans, and Beasts of bermuda i see as the Triangle of the dinosaur survival genre.(Ark survival evolved is human survival, and any others arent relevant enough yet)

Beasts of bermuda is... Toxic. You hear that word a lot on the internet and its got a negative connotation. Well, its true to an extent, but why do i think this. The playerbase.
Bob servers gnerally revolve around dominant clans on most servers with less rules and lazy admins, especially true on officials. Not only that, but the gameplay of bob makes it really hard to enjoy if you are dying a lot, Im not saying that like its not obvious dying sucks in a survival game, im talking about the WAYS you die in this game. 
Mosasaurus: talk about a braindead and debilitating creature to die to. Ever want to feel helpless? no counterplay? Watch as hours of gameplay is gone is a fight you can abrely fight back in? thats mosasaurus, fuck the design of this character more than anything else, as a person that hates feeling like he has no options this character is one of my most hated video game characters EVER. Only character i have real salt toward.
Tropeognathus and Pteranodon: Sure dying to a fast and lythe megalosaurus is bad, especially if he butt rides your character, but dying to a flyer that can travel the map in minutes, and deal 200+ dmg out of nowhere? really cool to die to especially since counterplay is basicly find a rock or cave, which is boring as hell.

I, recommend this game, if you have an iron will and can withstand torture, toxicity, and pain. It is rewarding sometimes, but if you arent addicted like me, the benefits dont outway the downsides, atleast for now. the community tends to lean more on the toxic side, but there are small communities that are nice every once in a while.

Before I made many excuses, but I realize now that Official servers should be setting a high standard. it's where new players will go first, it's where the first impressions of BoB Are going to be made. 

And as of right now, Officials suck. Straight up, SUCK... They are filled with racists, and targeting. No one seems to care about that though, mods never seem to be around when the awful people start to crawl outta the wood work. 

Yesterday I played for 2 whole hours, and the entire time a few people made fun of Chinese people, by mocking their English speaking accent. (basically the equivalent of pulling back your eyes and yelling HERRO. IMO)

No one in the server said a thing, no players or mods. 

There are trash rules about meshing as well, as if meshing is the worst of officials worries. 
If you don't want meshing, fix the poor map design. Fix rocks meshes then people wont mesh. 

I love BoB, it has fun features and mechanics. But they set a poor standard for their servers, where new players will first be greeted into the game and I guarantee most will come away with a sour taste in their mouths. 

DO NOT play on officials. Is it fun? YES. Is it good? YES.
However, poor community ruins it. If a place isn't fun and welcoming, it kinda ruins ever enjoying something to its fullest. 

Just play a community server, they are much better. If you find one with good rules, you will enjoy your time in BoB.

However, the community is one of the most toxic and polarized communities I have played with since League of Legends. Honestly, for a game with so much interaction with the official staff members, it is shocking just how toxic the community is, and how many of the players are actively cheating just to stay competitive. Lets face it, one of the critical UI components of this game is an unintended aftermarket mini map that lets you see where everyone is, and the number of players who casually mention it or refer to it in conversation is staggering. I am not a code writer nor programmer, but in my opinion having played this game for an accumulated 3k+hours between my alt accounts, a community only gets to the point where the majority of players are cheating more often than not for two reasons, 1: the staff/game code makes it extremely easy to manipulate, and/or 2: staff behavior itself influences and encourages the toxic behavior either by not adequately protecting or supporting their active non-cheaters by incorporating some form of anti-cheat or other work around and acting on individual cases as fast as possible, or by brushing off or in some cases even punishing players for playing by the rules because those non-cheaters are easier to observe making mistakes than the cheaters are. I stopped playing multiple times due to flagrant favoritism, and the constant cheating/hacking I would encounter, its not fun to spend 30+ hours growing a dino you are happy with, then die because somebody somehow has more hp than you do with full fat and 5/3 talents, or has tracked you down because they can see through walls or simply uses the aftermarket mini map, then just be brushed off by staff for your suspicions because they are unable to prove esp or location hacks. and even when they do ban a player, they are on again within hours using a different account, and the same hacks.

- It got a lot more bearable to look at after their graphics update a while ago, and they're updating a lot of the models and animations, which is something I really like to see. The LODs can still use some balance but it's sooo much better, and that's a small visual opinion thing anyway. It's an upgrade from the past.
- There are some cool powers your dinosaur can have on paper, and you might get there, depending on the server you play on. It's highly beneficial if you are able to become the offspring of someone because these traits can be passed on, giving you an advantage.

But overall it just takes way too long to grow your dinosaur, and not enough to do in the between moments. Weather helps! I loved that fire was added! But it's not enough, since this is a game that's in the PVP genre. There is so much down time in this game, and I've tried many many many different servers in my 156 hours as of making this review. I think one of the problems is how reliant players are on shelter for the comfort of the dinosaur's growth, it makes this bottleneck sort of play-style where there are fortresses that players live in/at instead of moving around the map, and that kind of limitation is something I find so boring. Why do we want to spend 10 hours in a cave again? 

A gore being too big to carry is one thing, but these herds that just sit at lakes or ponds and just never move drive me crazy, it's like a meta around really sedentary players. It feels like a handicap somehow. Now now, Timmy, the doctor said you can't move that much while you play your dino game.  Being solo is basically a death wish, and it's a common understanding that if you don't hook up with an established discord or your own group of friends, you just don't survive; miscommunication can be deadly, despite the debuff to friendly fire damage.

if you're a beginner to this game, i'd advise against playing official 02 - you won't enjoy it there. official 03 has the same ruleset as 02, however with a far smaller community. i had some good times there while i played it.

PROS
many mechanics! i never found myself getting bored of this game. nearly every creature in this game has its own ability. for example, the oryctodromeus has a burrowing ability - allowing you to hide away in a perfectly customized burrow.

there's also an aquatic realm, with three creatures. kronosaurus, mosasaurus and elasmosaurus. it's a very unique part of the game, i'm kind-of sad it's not focused on too much.

there's a variety of different servers you can play on, each with different rulesets (except for the officials). there's ""genres"" of playstyles (such as chill servers, survival servers, deathmatch servers, etc) that allow you to have a varied experience.

if you have friends, this is a wonderful place to be! even if you don't have friends (or friends that want to play this game), you can easily make new ones as long as you're not a jerk. a great way to start is by taking an egg, which is an option you can choose right off the bat.

CONS
the community can be extremely toxic on official servers, particularly official 02. it's extremely stressful, especially if you're diagnosed with anxiety like i am. i never enjoyed it there, though thankfully, i found a server i enjoy.

it's quite unfair for solo players. they're thankfully trying to fix this, especially with the newest patches but there needs to be more.. if you don't have friends and you want to play on officials, it can be a bit rough.

there's also clans. jesus christ, the clans ruined most of the game for me for a long while. if you anger one of their members, chances are, you'd be targeted for your remaining time in that server. sometimes, you don't even need to anger them - if you get big enough, you'll likely be hunted down.

despite the cons, i still find myself enjoying this game. though a particularly stressful one - it's an enjoyable game nonetheless.

[b]EDIT:[/b] allow me to elaborate further about the state of this game other than being ""haha funny""
[b]
The Good:[/b]
- The development team, despite being relatively small, obviously appears to care a lot about their game.  They seem to be putting tremendous effort into graphics upgrades that ""beautify"" the game.  Normally this would not and should not be top priority, but it is definitely a bonus if better graphics are your thing. 
- The skin customization and settings options to make skins more ""realistic"" are relatively top-tier for a game that fosters customization and nesting for skin-mixing. In this regard, there is something for everyone. 
- The choice of talents on each creature tree is stellar, and makes sense for MOST creatures in the game to have.  Being nested in further increases the amount of traits your creature can possess through the ""inherit"" system - being able to get up to a +2 in whatever talents the parents had possessed in supernested offspring, or a chance for -1s in incest offspring.
- Each creature in Beasts of Bermuda is viable in their own way.  However, there are numerous balance issues, especially in regards to growth and supernesting, which will be pointed out later. 
- The flyer class is a much-needed refresher in this small niche community of dino game connoisseurs.  Not only does if feel wonderful to fly around as a pteranodon or a tropeognathus, it's easy to learn and yet hard to master in its own right. 

[b]The Okay:[/b]
- Combat is generally fun. However, ""generally"" only being in the sense that it is mediocre-ly enriching and rewarding, but not necessarily as enriching as the current combat systems of EVRIMA and Path of Titans for example, and not as rewarding as most games that require a fair amount of grinding. Simply being rewarded ""hunt points"" I don't think is fair to a player after spending a limitless amount of time growing and becoming connected to their character. 
- A lot of the assets I recognize from the Unreal Engine marketplace. This is not a big deal in the slightest to me, but at times there is a weird mish-mash of mesh styling that I think is probably just a ""me"" problem.
- Aquatic gameplay is a thing. This would be a positive if it wasn't a ""sit-and-wait"" game right now. 

[b]The Bad AND Ugly:[/b]
- The community is a mixed bag.  You can either meet really cool people or really nasty people. There's no in-between. Probably hypocritical, but people take this game so goddamn seriously sometimes I feel the need to remind them that YOU chose to treat the game as a time sink, and that dying is a part of the game. 
- Speaking of which, I dislike how I have the unfortunate disadvantage in the current state of the game of having a life to live offline as well.  Therefore, it seems every time I am able to come back to this game, once I make it to 0.9 on most carnivorous land dinos, without fail, a mega-pack of supernested 1.5+ grouped clan members will cannibalize me. Playing solo shouldn't necessarily be rewarded, but this appears to happen in groups of three or more too. 
- Balance is a never-ending battle, and understandably so. Once a new balance patch is implemented, it appears to break a lot of the ecosystem previously built, and usually comes out of absolutely nowhere (looking at you, megalo bleed)
- Every server is infested with those damn little feathered rats who will assride you to death each time you encounter one.  I'm guilty of this too - but I think that's mainly about how the game is balanced right now. 

I still have an unreasonable amount of fun playing this game, despite the list of complaints.  A time sink/grind game? Sure. Frustrating as all hell when you lose your creature? You bet.  A worthwhile bonding experience with friends as you assride that 1.8+ rex in Jungle as a pack of 2.0+ velos? Absolutely.",1631922752,1632703734,True,16,4,0.69642716646194458,0,True,False,True
719890,100004593,76561198925114638,0,2,55225,0,21800,1705712843,"I have invested a lot of time into this game before writing a review. And I've come to the conclusion that I feel like I'm in an abusive relationship that I can't escape, and I just keep coming back to it for lack of anything else available... Here's what I mean. 

I feel like the game itself sets it up to breed toxicity and favoritism. How you may ask? I think it all stems from having an unlimited growth cap. Everyone is always trying to become the ""bigger guy"" and people will suck up to the ""big guys"" so that they have protection, sometimes the big bad's are just normal players who have a network around them for protection. Sometimes its admins abusing there power.

This also means that when a big bad does finally get killed they try to find ways to get there dinos back by claiming rule breaks, glitches, or sucking up to admins and brown nosing till they get there big dino back. Or they rage quit and verbally abuse someone or target the ever loving hell out of them until the person is forced to stop playing on the server. 
Oh and then you have the servers with frickin rules longer then the US Constitution in them, and they only end up protecting carnies or the already big dinos on the server. And its laughable when you see pack limit rule because no-one follows them at all. They just set up outside discords to coordinate everyone on the map so they can claim the're not over packing. Its great getting steam rolled by these massive packs, you maybe 1.2 but your sure as hell going to feel like a juvie getting curb stomped.

9 times out of 10 you run into community's like these, you may get in and think ""Hey this seems like a good community maybe it will be different this time"". Boy are you fooling yourself. After you read the pages upon pages of rules, you'll finally start playing only to realize, your the only one trying to follow said rules. And you'll realize that everyone is finding and abusing every single loophole they can find. And then you'll realize again that like the other servers there is blatant admin favoritism and brown nosing going on. Where does that leave you? Yeah, the poor sod feeling like a juvie as there getting munched of by a rex who's wasted way to much of there life growing a fat, jowl flopping, waste of space.
Now I am not saying every single admin or player of BOB is toxic or acts this way, and maybe there's a server out there (probably a tiny player base) that is decent. But this is a very real problem.

If any of you haven't notices the very specific examples I have given, well I'll just tell you to make sure you get it.
Every example I used I have either witness happen or have been the victim of it.
Just recently I have stopped playing on a server where I was repeatedly verbally abused, and rule broken on.  I left before I could be targeted. And to be honest I didn't go back because I feel like the moment i'm seen back in the server I feel like I'm going to be hunted down by brown noses and constantly rule broken on. And the whole server knows I can't record myself at all and therefore would have no evidence to defend myself, because witnesses even if there admins do not count. (great system guys) 

Please tell me how am I supposed to enjoy this game when I am constantly exposed to the pathetic side of humanity, who hide behind there keyboards and abuse others? There's a difference between some good ole' fashioned banter between rivals and then verbally abusing someone. People can just be down right cruel to one another as if we're completely forgetting that there's a very real human on the other side of that screen. Someone who could be 13 years old and still trying to figure out what it means to be kind, moral and compassionate? Have we all just given up on the notion of leading by example? It doesn't matter that this is a Dino game, the game is fake the players are very real people. Its shameful what we are willing to do to one another when we think we can hide behind our screens. 

I know I have digressed a lot from where I started but I just want people to know a bit of what there heading for before they spend there money on it. And if you didn't feel like reading the encyclopedia I posted i'l break it down into pros and cons

Cons:
-Unlimited growth.
-Breeding ground for toxicity and admin abuse.
-Very small number of good, fun people to play with.
-Gaslighting.
-Brown nosing in order to actually play.
-Verbal abuse/extreme bullying. (and also never listen to admins if they claim they wouldn't be able to find the chat logs of the abuse. Its all logged they just don't care enough to make the effort to find them)
-Pages of useless rules that just make admin life living hell.
-Game play that encourages a crap load of afk growing.
-extremely unbalance field of play.
- cartoonish dinos 
- I could go on but my hands are freezing and I want Hot Chocolate.

Pros:
-Fantastic breeding mechanic. 
-Inherits
-decent variety of Dinos to play
-Good Weather variety and interaction
-The single fact they have dinos for the land, sea, and sky's!

Now I hate the thumbs up or down, I'll put thumbs down simply for the amount of cons, but I'm also going to give a rating on the things I find important.
Rating: 1-10 (1 horrible - 10 fantastic)

Community: 3
Game Mechanics: 8
Game growth: Negative 12
Growth time (1.2): 7
Dino Variety: 7
Graphics: 5
Overall Game Review: 5
Level of announce due to afk growing? off the chart.
Conclusion: growth needs to be capped, yes I know there would be an uproar but seriously they'll eventually see that it was needed to actually play BoB as a functioning game.

I would just like to leave everyone not feeling attacked or let down in anyway, please just remember that this is my opinion you don't have to attack me for it. You can have yours and I can have mine, we don't have to rip throats out about this, at the end of the day it is just a game. I just wish more people could be a little more empathetic to one-another.",1632678449,1632678449,False,77,0,0.797816336154937744,13,True,False,True

Properly great if you are a discord groomer, too.

The map dynamics and interactions between different dinosaur models are both very unique. There is definitely a bit of a learning curve - I would take time to join a server that fits your needs (probably a chill server at first) and then maybe move on to a more intense PVP-oriented server. Official servers are mayhem, although private servers aren't necessarily exempt. The game is relatively ""balanced"" but there is infinite growth.... What this means is, it pays to be someone who can dedicated A LOT of time during non-peak hours to safely grow a dinosaur. You will be outdone by someone has seemingly managed to pull of 80-hours in a 3.0 sea creature that will genuinely oneshot you. Eggs are essential to the game in terms of the inherit system, and if you are on a PVP server your likelihood of receiving a good egg is minimal. The servers are riddled by clans who refuse to lose their edge on the server and with this in mind scouting is a serious issue. You can see where you will find this game to be a  challenging experience at first. If you would like to seriously play this game.... Make friends on your server. There is an endless amount of hidden allegiances and in most cases such as Rex, Mosa, Birds, etc, you cannot play solo. Find an herbivore herd that also plays other dinos and you're set. 

Find friends, find a clan, realize that clans scout and cheats, some hack, and make a note to enjoy the game for its face value. 

Final note: Don't play solo.",1631949807,1631949807,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Funnily enough, infinite growth was the reason I turned away from the game in the end. Growing was not fun but instead anxiety inducing. I would have all dino slots full with stuff I was afraid to lose. Servers without rules just aren't worth it because you can be killed in an instant randomly and lose things you can't get back. This game quickly became sitting in a cave for hours doing nothing just trying to avoid others and get as big as possible. I was not enjoying anything. I found myself searching out servers with growth caps trying to fix the terrible imbalance I was seeing. I realized then on growth cap servers I was pretty much playing The Isle with improved nesting, worse graphics, and the same combat so I begrudgingly went back to The Isle. 

I don't really know how I feel about this game. I don't think it's poorly made, maybe just not what I am looking for. You can only be killed by huge birds that run servers so many times before it gets dull.

Update: the game has added resurrection which while making things less frustrating, has simply slapped a bandaid on the rampant balance issues. What good is res when you can be a large dino and still get killed by birds that have the advantage of flying away, healing, and coming back? Either birds need a drastic decrease in their health pool or need to do less damage. A bird should not be able to survive a bite from a rex, fly off, heal, and come back and chip away at that rex until it dies.

1.) Dinosaurs, really cool and models get updated. The newer versions are really awesome.
2.) There are a few maps, but I find them rather well distributed and have weather mechanics which is really cool.
3.) The perk system is interesting and I really like it.
4.) Continuous growth is cool and perhaps one of my favorite aspects to this game. 
5.) Community is fun, there are a few large groups on official servers, but the trick here is to go to an unofficial server that is more to your liking. Officials is more for fun / chill rather than serious gameplay if you don't like a crowd. If you do like big clans, with a lot of disputes, then go official, you just need to be accepted first, but I did not find that hard to do. Yeah, some people can take joking a bit far so there are a few complaints from other players there, but again my experience did not bring any toxicity to me.

The nesting system, in which you can hatch a player, is certainly a boost to the average alternative dino you pick at the screen the first time. Not only is the hatching process well made, it provides additional points for you to inherit and distribute for your perks and get tougher.

The weather system really shines here, there are forest fires, hurricanes and floods. These do change the playing field and throw a curveball at you and the players on occasion, but it's always exciting.

There is also a resurrection mechanic (which I rely often on), you can res a creature you really like at the expense of some growth and by sacrificing other dinos you have (gets worse the larger your dino was) . I have not found this to be overly punitive and it works rather well to remove the ""frustration"" of losing your main dino. Repeated resurrections can get costly however, so keep that in mind.

So why not recommend it, right? I mean all these points are really interesting, no? Indeed they all are and kudos to the devs on the creative aspect. The issue that plagues me is that I have a few games to compare this one too and all those wonderful pieces I mentioned earlier have trouble coming together in a consistent fair way. While other games lack perks, or weathers, or growth, you always feel in a playing level with the opposition somehow. Here at Beasts of Bermuda, you will encounter a lot of situations where there is nothing you can really do but let your dino die. 

The ultimate issue? Beasts of Bermuda is more of an RPG of sorts than a survival game in terms that you have perks/size that increases your overall stats, so naturally bigger dinos will be stronger as they should be, and it's fun at first. The issue is when you treat this as a survival game, now I understand why other survival games do provide some form of limits and caps, this way you will not be outclassed by smaller species, you will know your prey and your foes rather clearly. Because Beasts of Bermuda is so wacky, survival takes a back seat and it comes down to whoever has the most stats, naturally skill can turn things around, but there is a limit to how much you can do at overwhelming odds.

I think that Beasts of Bermuda could really benefit from better hiding spots, like more dense jungles and foliage (at the expense of hardware, so not sure it can be pulled off here). Another option is to provide AI for a more PVE experience with friends, that would be something which would really stand above the rest of the competition for sure.

There was and still is no point in refunding this game, I got my hours off of it, it was fun but ultimately it fell a bit short against its competition, but with the previously mentioned Resurrection mechanic things have certainly improved a lot. 

I do have faith that this game can expand to a greater audience at some point. I will keep following news and updates, maybe things will turn around in 6 months to a year. Hope this helps if you are pondering getting this game, there is enough going on for the curious ones, but if it is survival you want, that efficiently simulates an ecosystem, this is not it.",1631349860,1631349860,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

I've had this game for awhile (maybe almost 2.5 to 3 years now?) but only managed to force myself to play 50 hours of it. So far, being big is all that seems to matter and you get screwed by everything bigger than you most of the time. Combat is button mashing and spamming clicks, or having more talent points sacrificed in movement speed if you want any hope of getting away. Not that you will, since other players know where you are at all times because of scent that works more like a radar to ping your next victim. As well as scout pteras and tropeos that are on Discord with a pack of no-life killers.
If you play on Official servers, nobody follows the rules. Hacking is abundant as well as gangs that use easily abuseable builds and dinos to kill everything they can for fun, because this game has nothing else going for it other than it's intensely toxic PVP player base.
If you go on Unofficial or Community servers you may have a better time, but their rules can be just as jarring as Officials. However, their rules are enforced to a fault. Some have nasty, power-hungry admins that like to domineer players while some others may join in on the rulebreaking. Nobody will talk to you, either. Players speak at you but hardly listen, making organization impossible unless you buy this game for a group of friends to play with you - hence why the Discord gangs have the upper-hand on most servers.

The only few good things I have to say about it are that it is slowly improving in it's graphics. The new models look fantastic and the scenery is majestic. The ocean is so lifelike and beautiful. The weather really makes you feel it and it's awesome.

There is the Official servers, one maintained by the developers and their staff. There are very few rules here and it makes for an extremely toxic environment. You could log in for the first time on these servers and immediately be killed because a certain group has people all over at spawn-in points killing any person who appears so they will never lose their position of power on the server. The developers let these things happen on their own servers, yet seem to encourage new players to start in these toxic environments?

Then there are Unofficial kill servers, servers where PvP regularly happens but actively policed by server admins who enforce rules specific to their server. The lesser of two evils, as spawn killing as described in Official servers is against the rules. Still, you could spend hours, days, weeks, months of your life investing into your creature only for it to be killed and you having to start all over. For some it suits them, for others not so much.

The third type of server is the Chill server. PvP is very controlled and are restricted to duels or admin-hosted events. Outside of these, players spend most of their time socializing, nesting for skin combinations/inherits, growing creatures for events, or maybe even role-playing. These types of servers are very popular and contain most of the game's population.

For some reason that I cannot fathom, the developers cannot stand the idea of Chill servers, and have actively worked to have them destroyed through game updates that would include things that either break features that Chill servers utilize, or implement mechanics that make the lives of Chill players harder. As an example, a future update that the devs have bragged about coming up with is you will no longer be able to sit still for a certain amount of time before you start taking debuffs to your creature. Last I heard the time limit was to be five minutes. You will literally have to move every 5 minutes if you want your creature to have baseline growth and comfort. This will be done simply to spite Chill server players, and it has not been the only thing the devs have done, either. Some changes were made in the past that weren't even added to patch notes, such as the sudden inability to create mix-species groups, which was thankfully changed when the Chill community created enough of an uproar.

This level of animosity towards a group of players from the developers is something I don't understand, especially a group of players as large as it is. They will deny it of course, but if you are a Chill player and have been experiencing this discrimination first-hand, you will know that it is entirely intentional what they are doing. They are alienating a large portion of their playerbase simply for not playing the game the way the developers want them to, and frankly it's unprofessional and petty and I expected better of them.

Should you get this game? For what it is, I suppose it's the bottom half of just alright. Over half of the dinosaur models look out of place because they are seriously out of date in comparison to their remodeled stuff. It's also worth noting that certain creatures have been remodeled multiple times while others have been left untouched and in a pitiful state simply because the person in charge of remodeling doesn't feel like doing them. There is also a memory leak that has been going on for a very long time that will essentially force you to restart the game after a while or the game will crash. Also I would not recommend going to their official Discord server and offering any suggestions. It is an echo chamber for the developers, the Kickstarters, and the people who want to kiss the previous two's boots. Unless you are in one of these three groups, suggestions are typically downvoted and ultimately discarded.

If you want to play a dinosaur simulation with mature, open-minded developers, with beautiful top quality models and environments, balanced combat (in comparison to the other two big dino sims), then play Path of Titans instead.",1561794228,1629146684,False,1,0,0.505537927150726318,0,True,False,True

----the rule situation----
This game is plagued with problems of rule breaking going rampant and unpunished. entire official servers now sit dead. the only one with any population is 02, why you ask? because there are clan groups that just go around wiping servers. for those unfamiliar with dinosaur games it is against rules on most games to mix certain species because they can just overpower you easy. Think of a carnivore working with a herbivore to kill everything that isnt in the clan they are in. The servers are rife with it and its pretty hard to get devs to do anything.  Is someone hacking? good luck there too. ive reported multiple people for teleporting under the map and they simply get a week temp ban and are back to kill you.

You can choose to play on an ""unofficial server"" but this is a choice of evils. they tend to have rules but the problem there is the big groups on unofficial are more often the ones who are better at lawyering the rules for free debuff free revives or there is some person who is friends with an admin that gets away with everything.



----The growth problem---
When you spawn a creature in it starts small as a fresh spawn or if you are hatched in it is a newborn. Growth is a stat gained over time that both increases your size and stats. the thing that makes Beasts of Bermuda different from similar games like ""the isle"" or ""path of titans"" is that whereas in those games this stat is capped and your dino has a max size this isnt true in BoB. You start either around .4 or at around .1 for hatchlings and grow from there. adults are both stronger and bigger than you so if they attack you lose no questions asked and this will happen often as people are extremely toxic. with no cap they will quite literally be thousands of health ahead of you and they will roam the map killing any smaller dino so nobody can grow to challenge them. 

----the gameplay itself----
this is one of the strengths of the game, gameplay is fun and crisp! You can tell the devs have made a point to prioritize gameplay over graphics. Every dino has something unique and fresh to bring to the game. Hands down one of the best things about this game is flyers. i feel like an actual bird and the mechanics and controls are simple one you learn the hotkeys. Land dinos have different mechanics and aquatics all play in unique ways. i really cant complain about game play at all. the passion the devs have for the game shows here.

Yes, it is buggy. Yes, it isn't graphically amazing. But the game makes up for this with very caring developers, a mostly friendly community, and hours of gameplay which revolve around various mechanics you won't see in other games.
A lot of negative reviews you'll see will go something along the lines of ""buggy, get The Isle instead"" due to people not understanding the concept of ""Early Access"" it seems.

As others have mentioned, this game is absolutely ruled by those with dedicated groups/clans.  Playing solo and wanting a fun experience just isn't going to happen.  You can join random groups that are made in-game, but nothing compares to the absolute coordination of a dedicated group/clan with proper voice chat.

They did just recently implement a resurrect system for dinos, but it requires points gained by sacrificing your other dinos.  After sacrificing one or more dinos to resurrect a dead one, you still lose atleast .2 growth points.  .2 doesn't sound like a lot but can equate to 10-20 hours lost of growth time if the resurrected dino had a high growth.

Good part of the game

Nesting: as said in above you can nest dinosaurs but there is a talent called ""good parent"" that can help amplify the growth buff from the baby dino. you can get only 3/3 good parent as like all the other talents in the game. or you can get a lucky +1 and +2 inherit. the more good parent the better the inherits on the baby. with +2 good parent you can get 5/3 if both parents have 5/3 good parent the baby has a high chance of getting good inherits( yes the good parent on both parents combine) if the parents dont have good parent or low gp (example total or 2 or 3) there is a chance the baby can get - inherits that does the opposite (Example with -stoic you take more knockback and cant pick up as much heavy stuff)

Variety of dinosaurs to play
In the game you can play aquatic dinosaur,a flier, land dino, and semi-aquatic
so if you dont like playing that specific dino type you can swap to another. whenever you want

Multiple dinosaur save slots per server
you can save a couple of dinosaurs per server allowing you to grow multiple dinosaurs without having to switch to another dinosaur to play what you want.
The bad part of the game

Growth

You never stop growing. unless there is a growth cap you will continue to grow but eventruly you start growing really slow about 1.0-1.2. the reason why this is bad is sometimes playing rex,acro,mosa,krono you can be killed by some basement dweller that plays the game 24/7 and has a 2.0 and above dinosaur that will outright kill your dinosaur as you are way smaller than it.

 Ptera clans

There are clans of people who play the ptera as it has an talent called ""piercing beak"" and you can deal tons of dmg and injury dmg if you have the ""injury"" talent.  you can also deal more dmg if you have the talent 3/3 or gotten a +1 or +2 piercing beak inherit. this limits what you can play. cant play meg,trope,para as you will be killed by gangs of pteras that will continue to peck you to death until you drop dead. or get lucky and kill one of them. but they will of course always come back for revange of their fallen teammate. i have died multiple times as trope to gangs of pteras, and was killed within 30 seconds on a meg i was playing.

Clans. 

Some clans decide to reserve eggs for only there clan members so there clan can have better dinosaurs than other players because of the good inherits they have gotten. also sometimes people nest with an alt account or another play and reserve eggs for themselves until they get the inherits they want. 

Admins

Some admins on servers will ban you for stupid things without reason, some admins will ban you sometimes for not breaking a rule. sometimes insulting an admin they will ban you(mute or perm ban you) because they are soft and cant take insults.

Toxic Players

Not all players in this game are toxic and they will rage when killed, some have called me rude things,offensive things sometimes and have to be stopped by the admins or either server muted to stop harassing the player.

Agressive Herbis

Some herds will have some herbis that are just agressive. with examples of not letting get a gore when there friend or herd member has died(some servers the herbis can decide if you can take the gore or not, if not the gore stays there) sometimes they will attempt to attack carni players when in sight of the herd (mostly pachys) for no reason. just to simply kill them.

Herds

One of the laziest things you can possibly do. most herds will have giant 1.5+ to 2.0+ and possibly above dinosaurs because they sit in a herd all day and most carnis know not to mess with a herd as there could be a apa, a sai that could kill their dinosaur. but sometimes carnis do attack herds (mostly rexes,meg groups) most of the time there not successful as the entire herd destroys them with there big dinosaurs, yet some carnis are successful of killing a herbi.

Big map

This is a problem with all dinosaur games currently on steam, the map is simply too big and so dinosaurs are scattered across the map. there are gores which the player can eat if there a carnivore but it does not have satiation that helps the dinosaur grow faster which you can only get from killing player dinosaurs.

Final Comments.

If you are still willing to buy this game after reading this review then make sure to listen to all the things ive said about this game, be prepared.

The game demands that you spend hours upon hours, otherwise you'll likely never make it to full adult or beyond. 2.) The playerbase is extremely toxic. This varies per server, but servers such as The Forgotten Realms, Officials, and some others can tend to be very toxic and unforgiving. 3.) The game gets extremely repetitive. Many players will find themselves in a loop. Spawn or get nested in, grow for a few hours, and die, only to repeat the process. The talent tree system and inherits help to lessen the repetitive nature of the game, but it is present regardless.

I would like to say that with 882 hours on record at the time my review was made, and 1910 by the time my review was updated, that I have seen a lot of the game, both good and bad. It's rapidly becoming a game I have regretted.

There are things that have come to happen that I wish hadn't, and some that I have enjoyed. I'm going to update them as is- the positives and the negatives.

[h1] The Positives: [/h1]

1. Beasts of Bermuda (BOB) has a lot of freedom other games don't. You want to make a dino that is entirely speed? You want to do the zoom? You can do the zoom. Outrun all the other dinos with your speed. Be the meme.

2. You can make any color of dino that you want. Bright pink? You can do it. Bright blue? Yep. You wanna play camo dino and hide from the world? Absolutely.

3. The community. This one is a good and a bad, so keep this in mind. The community can be very good, if you find a great server. I for one found an absolutely amazing group of people to play with, and met people that I would genuinely call my friends for the first time in a great many years.

4. Limitless growth. It isn't really limitless- you reach 100.0 and that's it, but feasibly your dino actually starves to death before then, but it's actually a great lot of fun try and striving to reach 2.0. On official servers, 2.0 is a huge achievement. Unofficial servers are different and shouldn't be treated the same.

(Edited 7-13-21) Although you're more punished for growing bigger than 1.2 now... But that's something you should learn by browsing youtube. It's full of plenty of people who will educate you on how the game actually is, better than the store page ever will.

[h1] The Bad and The Ugly [/h1]

(Edited 7-13-21) Warning: Hard truths are difficult pills to swallow. 

Edited (7-13-21) 1. I've edited this one again, because I no longer fear the repurcussions. I was given what appeared to be a game wide ban until I complied with Predatoria's wishes and removed the original comment, otherwise he would not remove said ban. Whilst also being very rude to me during said discussion, to boot.

The original cause of the ban is long since a thing of the past that people don't really discuss anymore, but point stands- this happened, in the game. Be careful what you say if you buy it- you don't have freedom here.

2. The constant clan wars and unfair justice system. Kind of self explanatory there, but I'll extrapolate. Do not play BOB if you want or expect any degree of fairness from the moderator team. They had to recently add a rule to the official bob discord that the, and I quote, ""-Placing real world money bounties on players."" was not allowed. I was a player that had a bounty on me, and was terrorized and harrassed for months by a select number of people that I won't name.

People who lost weeks upon weeks of growth in the game weren't permitted revives, either, even with video proof.

The punishment they received when it all came to light? A short ban, where upon returning, they immediately tried to attack again. And no repercussions, to my knowledge, came of that either.

3. Blatant favoritism. The admin and moderators will deal devastating punishment to anyone outside of their friend group for the slightest of things.

No mixpacking is allowed on official- mixpacking is specifically stated as groups of people not allowed to group together (acro and a rex for instance) assisting each other in hunting another creature. I've seen this rule broken before, many times- but no one stepped in, even with video proof, to make right the things that were targeted.

4. While this one isn't as bad now, there is still an unpleasant amount of distrust between players to staff. There are a scant few that are somewhat decent. But they are a few gems in a field full of rot. If you were to talk to the general populace, you'll find that most of them turn to other players for help instead of moderators.

I've done it myself when my dinos have gotten stuck.

[b] You should not fear the people who are supposed to help you. [/b]

5. The community. Like I said, this is good and bad. The good is- friends. Absolutely friends. The bad? The unregulated toxicity that can run rampant, and has to be kept in check by players instead of the people supposed to regulate it.

6. The fact that the development of the game seems to be guiding it towards an Isle 2.0, despite the player base as a large not wanting that.

The lead developer is pretty obviously in dislike for the people growing big dinos- and at every turn, more or less makes an update that manages to punish them. You don't get a good game, or keep a player base for long term, if you punish the people for doing what you made the game for- to play it and grow big. To have fun, make friends, and to create a unique social community within each server that's brought to life.


(Edited 7-13-21) A new patch came out today, so I am extrapolating a little on this.

I'm not going to go into the previous upgrade, with fires and how nothing can out run them- but more into the factor of today's update.

A poll was placed on the official servers regarding the populace's thoughts on implementing mixherding limitations. The general consensus was ""I would not change official play, but would allow server owners to config variables for mixherding."" alongside ""Some species should naturally dislike each other.""

They took these results, and today, immediately implemented hard limitations. As in, because of the location and types of some species (read, Semi-aquatics being a death sentence on a mountain) it is complete and total segregation of said dinosaurs.

This is basically the Isle 2.0- and removes a critical aspect that made BOB, well, BOB.

On top of this, it was expressed many times that people didn't like an update to one of the menu's updated looks. It wasn't until people were complaining IN GAME to the DEVELOPER that they listened to these complaints.

This is not a game you should buy if you want your voice heard.

That being said, it is still fun. It does have aspects that are fun and free. But don't get attached or expect anything you say to be heard.

I don't know if this is an aspect they are going to keep, as they're only intending to 'test' it, but given how they haven't 'fixed' the rivers with the dirty water update... I wouldn't hold out hope for it.

Buy it at your own risk, folks. When I first joined, this was a 9/10 game. Now, I'd rate it a 4/10 game.",1611340219,1626214903,False,255,7,0.884515345096588135,72,True,False,True

First off, it's a PvP survival game with way too high stakes for almost no reward at all. It takes about a day to get a half decent dinosaur levelled up, and for a top notch dino it could take a week or more. The loser in a fight completely loses their dino and all the time they put into it and the winner gets some food that's a bit better than what's lying around all over the map. 

The dev's plan to implement a system where you can trade one dino to revive another, most likely trading one days worth of work for another not solving the high stakes issue at all.

Furthermore, there's no AI enemies or dinos yet. This makes the gameplay as you're trying to level your dino either very dull on low population servers, or very risky on high population server as you stand out like a sore thumb since everything moving and making a sound is a player. This makes the first problem even more frustrating. 

The survival aspect of the game is dull and without any depth besides weather, and the PvP is so costly you'll do very little of it for your time spent. 

These are just the most core problems with the game, leaving out problems with balance, rules and resulting toxic playstyles of which there are many. I'd suggest waiting until the game has proper AI implemented to purchase, and to never play solo.

ps: Being able to phase through your opponents and attack them from the inside isn't ideal as most dinos are rather long, slow to turn and can't reverse, and it's easily taken advantage of in combat.",1625634712,1625675126,False,3,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,True

With that said, it can get a bit dull after a while. It can get like a glorified chatroom if you let it, though that pretty much comes with the genre. I like it though. It's fun to experiment with all the different pattern/color options, and I love that you can be an aquatic or flying dino and explore the seas and skies.

Of the main games in the current ""dinosaur survival"" genre, I think this one's actually my favorite. It may not have the most realistic graphics, sure, but it's still a pretty game in its own right, and its game mechanics are a unique addition.

Playing BoB in a community-run server can be such an enjoyable time when you're hanging out and growing your dinosaurs with your friends; it's honestly surprising how much you get attached to said dinosaurs as a result.

The same cannot be said for some official servers and some community-run servers. I nearly gave up the game as a result of losing one of my favorite dinosaurs to a situation which should have and could have been stopped before it happened; but the people who were supposed to have my back and watch out for me failed in the worst way possible. It may not mean much to most people, losing a fake dinosaur in a game online, but when you spend over a week's worth of hours on a dinosaur and it is lost... it can really feel like you lost something which meant the world to you.

That aside, I return again to the topic of the good servers I mentioned before. When you finally manage to find a place you truly fit in, and enjoy, the game becomes a whole different experience. I recommend this game, not for what it is at a base level, but for those nuggets of gold hidden among hundreds of other servers which just didn't give you the experience you really wanted.

the nesing is also a meachanic which surprised me how well it is thought out, good parent which is a talent you can build inot on the as previously mentioned talent tree, max it out and you and your child get all the benefits, the bigger your dino the more likely the child is to get good inherits which increases the survivability or combatibility of your dinosaur, a player gets a new good dino and the parents get to grow faster

While it may not have the high realism graphics and build that makes you feel on the edge of your seat, constantly looking over your shoulder like the Isle does, what BoB does have allows it to stand out as its own game.

For one, the amount of customization to your appearance in phenomenal. Skins allow you to pick and choose, and the mixing from nesting can be either catastrophically hideous or absolutely gorgeous, with enough room for one to fiddle and still adjust whats there. What absolutely sets this game apart, however, are the mechanics. Every dinosaur has its own role, its own skill set. From Acro's that can screech at you to drop your stamina and attack power, to Ptera's that grow stronger when they dive, to Mosa's that can snatch the unsuspecting drinker to the oceans depths, every single dinosaur feels unique. No two dino's are the same, every system feels like thought and heart were put into it. Diving creates momentum when travelling long distances, burrowing can be used as both defense and a trap for the unaware. There is SO MUCH to this game, that its easy to be entertained for long periods of time exploring various caverns, nesting for those gorgeous glow in the dark colors, and so on. Not to mention the weather, the talent tree that allows every player to build their dino how they want to play, this game may not have the looks of the Isle, but it has its own niche in the sort of miraculous content it offers.

I play both, I love both, because both offer their own thing, and are only comparable under the loose definition of ""games that let you play as dinosaurs.""

You also have to fight against flyers which are ridiculously busted, seagulls taking down multi-ton carnivores and tanking bites, literally retarded.
 
Words cannot explain how unfun the players make this game, the game as a whole promotes having no life and rewards you greatly for it. You have to resist the urge to commit a hate crime and just don't even bother playing the game solo, you'll get jumped by a stupidly large pack of social rejects with 200 hours on each dinosaur. It's not a question of skill but a question how much time you're willing to sink in to be overpowered and shit on everyone and everything.

For some reason, the game also gets laggier literally every update, never seen something so unoptimized, puts my graphics card into fucking overdrive on the main menu. Even Arma 3 runs better than this shit.

Cannibalism is everywhere with no penalties. Growing stuff stops being fun at 1.2 growth (Typically several hours, or more.)

AKA Pteras because theyre scared of fighting a small rex but not another Ptera. As you will try to find prey on land other pteras are constantly trying to hound you. I get fights in the air could be fun but they're not fights. Pteras ambush and rely on one big hit so by the time you realize another ptera is trying to kill you its too late and you're unable to run away.  Fliers are also DON'T WORK because cameras for land creatures are unintuitive - what I'm saying is you will be stuck with your camera facing at your dinosaur and unable to see the sky properly. This game is Fliers of Bermuda not Beasts of Bermuda. 

There are more issues as well that make the game anti-fun to a general audience. Constant Droughts of content, and balancing updates. Also because there's no seperation of regions on offical servers you'll find asian/euro absolutely rampaging on ""US"" servers in groups of 5 while everyone else is asleep.

Beasts of Bermuda, after returning to the game what feel's like years after my previous review and having accumulated an extra 291 hours (totaling at 302 hours) I've decided to update my review, so what's changed? Sadly... almost nothing.

BoB inherently still has nice idea's but overall still fails to execute them in any meaningful way, combat feel's otherwise weightless and uneventful making winning or loosing a interaction mutually underwhelming or in some cases aggravating, and the drawbacks of questionable balancing still persist (example: a 1.0 megalosaurus, ichthyovenator, etc. can be killed by a persistent 0.6 fresh spawn Tyrannosaurus, especially if it get's behind you and takes advantage of your differing turn radius,) the infinite growth system continues to further create's a disconnect in balance as unless you are the first to reach a large size or avoid playing around other players in a given server, waiting for the server to become empty or low on population, it is likely you may forever remain small while the largest players will forever remain large until they choose to off their animals by some means and so on.

Fully aquatic animals remain otherwise pointless to pursue growing as most other playable's can easily avoid ever needing to come within range of the ocean where you are locked to for most of your play time, and the ocean's are so barren and lifeless it becomes dull swimming around to begin with, I feel fully aquatic playable's would benefit from being removed until there is a greater diversity of them and then being placed in their own game mode designed for them making it worth the time and effort to grow one, where as the main game mode benefit's semi aquatic animals far more as they can reach the places most other playable's can and effectively take advantage of waterways and lakes, two games in the same genre as this one have proven such by introducing Sarcosuchus and Deinosuchus respectively.

Another issue I feel is mechanics wise every animal feel's mostly identical and can be changed out with little notice, while each have unique ""special abilities"" with differing effect's activated by pressing Z they rarely do enough to be notable and most player's rarely use the abilities in combat and some are much too similar to justify. My main example is the Megalosaurus' ability and the Acrocanthosaurus' ability, the Megalosaurus can mark animal's it is facing and display their stats to itself and their party (when upgraded) while the Acrocanthosaurus has an ability that marks an animal it is facing and display's to them and their party that the target's stats have been decreased by a specific amount (changing based on upgrade.) On paper these sound different enough but in practice they may as well be the same ability as at the core they share the same inherent idea and are almost never used or in fact useful in combat. See also how all three aquatic animals share an ability to pick up smaller player's and drag them underwater, or how both semi aquatics share a dart forward ability that does some damage.

Now this isn't without saying there haven't been improvement's in the time since my previous review, graphically the game has improved although it has only reach a point one of it's competitors reached back in 2015-2016 and hasn't much surpassed that, the game run's much smoother and before upgrading my PC I found that some less powerful system's can currently run the game perfectly well on low to medium setting's, ability power needed to attack in order to defend yourself or hunt another animal does not dry up as fast as it once did unless using a special ability (instead of 3-4 regular attacks you can reliably execute 6-7 regular attacks as most animals before needing to wait for your ability bar to refill,) some of the animal model's look really fantastic (unfortunately the models often look better outside of the game as individual render's than they do in game,) and the upgrade tree's are now more useful and are potentially perfect bases for each animal to become mechanically unique and diverse.

Overall the game needs a few thing's before it can be worth any considerable amount of time for a player. Animation's need to be improved across all animals to make them feel more alive and create a sense of weight, the current best example in the game is the Tyrannosaurus secondary bite where it steps forwards and bites down in a arch in front of it making it the both the most efficient and most satisfying attack in the game, the walking animation is also rather weighty and feels nice, the run not so much, the infinite growth system needs to go, 1.0-1.3 should be the max an animal can reach naturally and the player should be given talent points for upgrade's over time instead of growth, more intuitive and easier to traverse maps as having to essentially crawl everywhere worrying that the slightest change in elevation may be the fall that cripples or even kills your animal is not fun, and much more impactful and diverse special abilities among animals or otherwise unique mechanics that make each animal feel like it's own unique experience.",1546302656,1622850696,False,8,0,0.574803590774536133,0,True,False,True

And in this game, these no lifers can get ridiculously overpowered since getting a strong dino is grindy af due to extremely slow but unlimited growth and talent points inheritances that puts normally created dinos (created in character creator, not bred by good parents) instantly in a big disadvantage for the rest of the game. This obviously kills all the balance and fairness of the game. 
In theory, the growth could be capped, but there is no popular server that does that at a reasonable point (4.0 cap is basicially no cap), because, as I said, almost everyone in this game is a no lifer that enjoys unlimited growth. 
It's literally the South Park episode ""Make Love, Not Warcraft"", but in reallife and with permadeath. For casual players, it's not fun. Don't bother if you have a life apart from this game.",1622809436,1622809436,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

If you're looking a community based dinosaur game you're at the right place, because this game primarily plays via community effort and survival - if you're solo and don't know what you're doing, you're pretty much dead or at least very vunerable.

Pros:
- The game is easy to understand. Each dinosaur has it's own unique abilities you can easily test out and get into via playing for a bit or watching many of the countless guides already on YouTube.
- Dinos actually play a role in their groups or within their species. Due to their unique abilities a lot of dinos can work together in either groups or generally with their own kind to extend these abilities to their full potential. If you play in a mixpacking group, everyone can fullfill a certain role.
- The nesting. It's been much fun to nest other players, playing with them and seeing them grow older, using the talent tree to produce better offspring, renesting yourself to be stronger or just simply to roleplay herd life. With the mix-skin mechanic you can also get very unique dinosaurs from being a hatchling.
- Growth: Growth can be pretty fair and forgiving in this game, depending on what server you're on and if you're solo or in a group. Many dinos have an okay-ish growth time and are usually pretty good at 1.2 - 1.3. The larger you get, the more talents in the talent tree you can achieve.
- The talent tree is pretty open and has lots of different abilities for different dinos. You can uniquely skill your dino however you wish and combine as many talents as possible. You get talent points by growing.
- Lots of active servers and playerbases.
- Nature events such as Growstorms which make you grow faster. Wildfires, Tornados, Storms, Flooding, Thunderstrikes - there's always a reason to keep your eye at mother nature, if you're not running from predators. It's very engaging and sometimes risky, but it requires you to actually be active ingame.

Cons:
- Official servers are really, really toxic. Your best bet is to find a non-official server with a ruleset you feel comfortable in. Keep an eye on the community that surrounds you. If you don't feel comfortable, don't try to squeeze yourself in. It'll save you a lot of time.
- There's no respawning. If you die, your dinosaur and all your progress is gone. Unless the server you play in allows revives (often times paid revives via fictional server currencies) you'll need to prepare for ""loss"". Keep that in mind, since a lot of dinos require lots of time to get big.
- Yanky hitboxes, meshing, animation and whatnot. It's an early access game, so I won't be too harsh. But be prepared for glitches, being stuck and falling through the map and drowning. 
- If you have a low end computer, this game might suffer from FPS drops and lags. Especially during Tornados or fires it can get pretty laggy. 
- You'll need to find someone to play with. This is not a requirement, but being solo all the time puts you at risk of being killed pretty quickly. Having a herd or pack to travel and life with is much easier than being solo, unless you're a huge dinosaur that can defend itself. Most servers can have pretty big apex preds.

Tips:
- There are quite some good PVE servers that aren't fully chill neither fully PVP. For example, Blue Sanctuary is a german & english speaking server with a chill community that allows protection via Spawngore, has a revive system and a support system with helpful mods & admins you can contact in case of questions or emergencies. The bilingual nature of the server makes it easy to navigate and almost everything is translated incase you only speak one language (or only english).
- Don't get too attached. You will lose your dinosaur.
- Record everything. EVERYTHING. Most server only value reports if you have video evidence of something happening. While this is understandable, you should be prepared to provide lots of clear evidence if you ever report anything.
- Most servers have a discord with all of their rules and events and whatnot. Better join those discords before joining the server so you get the rules right.
- Use chillservers and flyers to learn the maps, caves and what not. This can help you if you're playing on a PVP server and you need to know good spots to hide or chill in.",1622683403,1622683403,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I think that Beasts of Bermuda, on its own, is a wonderful game with an incredible amount of potential. Each of the playable dinosaurs are unique and specialized in their own certain ways which makes gameplay fresh and interesting. Each map layout is incredibly diverse and feels as if actual heart was put into it, rather than become an endless jungle or a meaningless beach as far as the eye can see like a certain other dinosaur game. In the future, I don't doubt that Beasts of Bermuda has at least a chance of taking over the scene, but I'm not writing a negative review simply for the game itself. Yes, it has plenty of bugs, but all of those pale into comparison when looking at the major factor behind this meager rant.

It's not entirely the game. It's the playerbase.

The official servers are generally a cesspool for players simply looking to go on a killing spree, regardless of who you are or what you are. From fresh spawns to dinosaurs with dozens of hours poured into them, it doesn't matter - they're just more targets for these sorts of individuals that group up, dominate a server, and slaughter everything in sight. Just spawned in as an Apatosaurus? You might get ran down by a Parasaurolophus that has been stomping every juvenile that spawns close to it. Just hit 1.2 on a Tyrannosaurus Rex? You'll probably be sent into orbit by a toxic Pachycephalosaurus player. These tightly knit groups and clans generally target any solo players they can come across, regardless of whether or not they actually need the food and mostly because they do it for fun. 

So, go onto an unofficial server, with rules and regulations, right? The same thing happens there, but now you're generally plagued by toxic and abusive administrators that get kicks out of pushing around people in a children's dinosaur game. Most moderators and admins which I've come across are downright abusive towards players, and even in the most rule-heavy servers, cannot give a coherent answer or reasoning for their actions at all. I've heard horror stories of admins breaking rules for their friends and permanently banning players on a whim, wasting away countless hours poured into several dinosaurs over pointless rule violations. I've been threatened with warnings for simply swearing in chat in casual conversation, and I've seen players be warned or banned for the most trivial matters simply because the admin refused to hear their side. The private groups here are far worse than those on the officials, given that they are so dedicated to the game that they will always have larger, more powerful dinosaurs which they AFK grow, as a result of private nesting and utilizing alternate accounts. Which these servers not only enable, but end up fully encouraging because they're so dedicated.

I thought that the recent update would dissuade AFK growing in general, unfortunately. I think it's the main reason that BoB is so braindead boring at times. It hasn't, save for perhaps encouraging some vague semblance of traveling the map for fresh water. Otherwise, some players are so specialized that they receive little to no debuffs from drinking dirty water at all, given that they have countless points and skills to spec into. What about wildfires caused by storms or droughts, though? They simply log out and AFK grow something else. Unfortunately, like every other survival dinosaur game on the market at the moment with a functional growth system, Beasts of Bermuda encourages AFK growth and using numbers constantly: you find yourself a group, you settle at a body of water, you bring food to yourself, and you either hide or you sit and wait for the next growth point. That's just for terrestrials. For aquatics, you simply sit behind a large rock, hope that a massive mixpack doesn't find you as you're eating gore or fish, and occasionally come up for oxygen. Despite the rich diversity in playable dinosaurs, BoB falls underneath the same boring gameplay loop that turns The Isle into a dinosaur walking simulator as well, but you switch out the walking with napping. 

Solo play is, to say the least, downright impossible. You either find yourself a group, no matter what you are, or you die to a group yourself. If you're a carnivore, you'll be hunted down by your own kind. If you're a herbivore, you'll probably get hunted by most carnivores as well, or brutalized by private friend groups that are bored out of their minds and are looking for a reason to kill other players, usually justified by ""You're drinking our water, die!"" or ""You're eating our bushes, die!"" - fliers are generally in the same spot as well, though fortunately the aquatic playerbase is so dead that you don't have to worry about too many issues. But when I'm warned by other players to log off when playing a certain dinosaur because ""**** just logged on and they have a huge Rex that will kill everyone on the map for shits 'n giggles"", there's an issue. When there's an uncontested, unrivaled pack of carnivores or invincible herd of overaggressive herbivores that march across the map, and nothing in the game's mechanics can do anything to stop that, there's an issue. When I can spend days growing one dinosaur and finally leave whatever spot I've been AFKing at, only to get obliterated by the first pack that sees me - the same pack that has been wiping out players for months because nothing else can compete against it - there's something wrong. 

Beasts of Bermuda is a wonderful game with some glaring issues, but a complete wasteland of a community that makes me *proud* that I come from the Dark Souls fanbase, which... honestly isn't even that awful to begin with, in comparison to the actual manchildren I've bumped into on this game alone lol. Maybe this game will improve in the coming years. Maybe the community actually isn't as bad as I personally make it out to be. But, right now, it's not worth spending your money on unless you enjoy mind-numbing, boring AFK growing that inevitably ends in killing someone else's AFK grown dino or dying.",1622250636,1622250636,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

The reason for this is that i think that comparing this to other dinosaur survival games would be more accurate in determining if it was a worthwhile investment.
Things i think it does better than the isle:
-Map (The Isle's maps are so big and most of the space is unused)
Traits, Scent, Weather, Communication System, Flight

I really do like the premise of the stat system. Where you get buffs and debuffs from certain environmental conditions, i just think a lot of them seem really dumb. For instance, simply being near a larger dinosaur for long enough just kills you because stress I guess. If anything, it seems right if a buff were given instead, like maybe adrenaline giving you a speed boost to attempt escape from a larger faster creature. I think that water getting stale from drinking from a certain place for too long is kinda dumb, but i guess it incentives people to move around so.

Scent is good in this game, it actually allows you to judge how far a corpse is away. Flight is pretty good, the idle flight could be faster but eh not my biggest beef. Controls are easy to get a hang of. Plenty of channels for communication with others. Weather is mostly fantastic i have to say, i have yet to see a wild fire but i think its a dope concept in theory. Maps aren't overly large like the isle's.

That being said, it still suffers from the same things the isle does, namely growth times and kosing.
I could go on and on why i fundamentally believe growth times exceeding 2 hours make the game too punishing, annoying, frustrating when killed and ultimately boring because it forces you to wait hours to actually play the full game. There are friendly servers if your into that. I'd just prefer a better balanced overall game or better yet, a game where server admins can set growth times and other various things. Maybe i'm wrong about all of this and just retarded.

Anyways,

 Isle is not that bad, only 1-8 hours to become a full adult. Live Die Cry laugh and Repeat.
But Beasts of Bermuda.......Some dinos like long necks and rexes take DAYS of IRL time to grow big enough to survive a fight. Good dinos take MONTHS, even with using alt accounts to maximize growth with comfort and baby buff. Live, die, Live Die DIe die die die die inside die die die die die die....uninstall for a year, reinstall because ""i wanna be a dino"" live for a week and die. live for an hour and die, live for a month and die. and die and die and die. Uninstall. That is the dino survival game loop. Install, play, suffer, play, suffer, play until you figure out your addiction to pain and suffering is actually really bad for you, uninstall.
Survival games need progression, but there is a cancer in these dino games. Eating the time and lives of the players like eldritch soul sucking parasites. 
Solutions for this are pick more terrible weaker creatures like gali or tiny velo.....but there is no real solution in development yet for the amount of loss in these games. ( the idea of sacrifice one good dino to get another back goes so far beyond bad its downright sadistic and evil, please don't implement this)
So...flip the script. Do Survival games need progression? How does one progress as a dino? Why does one progress as a dino? Why is time the cost of progress instead of luck, skill, problem solving or effort? Could progression be QUEST based instead of TIME spent playing bush simulator? How about checkpoints?
Devs....please. Your survival as a non human dino game with a talent tree has such a unique market and so many fun twists. Its beautiful but leaking the sour sweetness of rot and decay of infected pus and ooze from the wounds on the souls of the playerbase whose YEARS of life dino-game devs have devoured. These types of games aren't good. They are addicting. There is a difference.

The game has a lot of promise, HOWEVER. At the moment it seems Herbivores have a distinct advantage over carnivores especially when it comes to the Pachy and the Parasuar. We *were* having a great time on an official Life Cycle server I had formed a pack of 3 adult and 2 juvenile Megalosaurus and despite our best efforts, the ramming from the two of them, was absurdly effective agains us. We SHOULD have been able to kill them easily, however on multiple occasions it seems as though it isn't possible to win a fight against a herbivore. They tend to hunt carnivores, rather than carnivores hunting them, simply because they have a PVP advantage. That will really need to change if the game is to succeed moving forward.

I have played this game for many many years, I do speak from both witnessing common issues to experiencing them myself. The game is fun and amazing to play but These topics will touch on some major issues about the game.

Beasts of Bermuda’s mechanics for it's game are Amazing! It's truly a fun and an amazing experience. Floods and weather always make things fun to survive. What’s not fun about this game? Well it's the infinite growth..Yeah it's a cool idea to be a giant 5.0 Rex or Apa or anything… But what’s not is any other person trying to grow a fresh spawned creature is NOT going to grow.. The reasons

1.If you are not a regular you are nothing. Groups might not accept you, and you’ll be killed for being unknown. How to combat it? Take an Egg and talk and get your name out there and known, play constantly to keep your name in the community. 

2.Fresh spawn = useless. As a fresh spawn in a server that's been up for months, a fresh spawn is absolutely the worst. You might get lucky with RNG, but most likely  unless you waste hours into Pure luck. You are not going to be as good as a hatched egg from any creature. The only benefit? Not related to any other creature, so you can breed with everything. 

3.If you're not 1.5 you wont matter. Doesn't matter what dino you are. It used to be 1.2 was O.k, since you got your final talent and could breed. But servers are up for so long that everyone is 1.5 or 2.0  Your 1.2 Sai isn't going to live against Two 2.0 Acros. Doesn't matter you're dead. A way to combat this? Don't have a life and play it all the time. Or accept you wont get that big unless you become a regular.

4.Twitch groups and feeders. There's a big problem with Feeders and Twitch groups, and even Clans. If you aren't part of them you are hunted. Not necessarily target because you aren't one of them.. They just don't kill their own so that leaves only the ones who aren't their own and if they rule the server then you are the odd one out. Feeders are people who have paid accounts and/ friends who grow a creature and then have their ‘Main’ dino eat the other for infinite food while they grow in the back of a cave Until they are 1.5 or bigger. No real way to combat.. You can report them to server admins, but it's a hard one to prove if they are or not. 

5.Servers are up for so long Everything's 8 generational eggs and are all 1.5+  even if you make it to 1.5 as an Apa, it won't matter, You only have 5 inherit points while this 2.0 Acro have 25.  To combat this, take an egg, and do not do a fresh spawn.


All in all
If servers were wiped every few months things would be more even, or with creature caps for certain dino's like Apas and Moasa can go to 2.0 but Rex’s can only get to 1.7 and Acros 1.6 and so forth. Balance the world out. 

As of now, most servers have been up for months, every dino is massive and have been bred in for perfection. And any new players are at immediate disadvantage. Fresh players to old servers are playing a game that’s stacked against them.",1621602634,1621602972,False,45,0,0.764455676078796387,3,True,False,True

Aside from T-rex and MAYBE Acro (When fully grown, good luck trying to get an Acro that big) every land carnivore is weaker than every land herbivore. Not only are herbivores allowed to group up with any other species of herbivore, but if you do the same as a carnivore, you are banned from official servers. BTW, aside from hacking or cheating, carnivores mixing up with other carnivores is the ONLY rule. (Yeah totally fair guys) Herbivores should either be faster OR stronger than similar sized carnivores. Unfortunately, about half the herbis are both. Lurds, Paras, and especially Pachys are the biggest offenders. (With Pachys being able to escape Rexes and Acros easily and kill or break ANYTHING that isn't a large fully grown carnivore) Not only are they stronger, but because of the rules, herbis are nearly always able to grow very large because they group up with other herbis to cover weaknesses and/or have these ""Wombo Combos"" such as having a herd of a few Pachys grouped up with Sais. The pachys are fast and do stupid amounts of injury damage. (Literally one hit and you have a broken leg and cant escape) and then the nearly unkillable but very slow sais are able to catch up and kill you. ON TOP OF THAT because herbis group up in big herds and are totally safe, they can abuse the breeding system to breed super powerful dinos making the already overpowered herbivores even stronger than the carnivores that are rarely able to survive to adulthood let alone breed. A few herbivore species are balanced in my opinion. Apas and Sais are fine because they are slow, hit like a truck, and are hard to kill, but are easy to avoid. Pachys and paras on the other hand, are both fast and stupidly powerful. If you are near a hill and a single pachy on top sees you, you are very likely to die and if they have a single buddy of any species, you are certainly dead because like I said before, a single hit from a pachy will bust your leg and you will be unable to get away and unless you are a fully speed invested Meg, you wouldn't be able to get away anyway. (Megs are supposed to be the fastest land dino, but for some reason pachys can run downhill faster than a fully speed invested meg with their charge attack) Pachys are the biggest offenders by far, but Lurds are really bad too because they too will sit in a herd totally safe, then once they are big, they venture out and kill everything they come across be it Ichys, Elasmos, Mosas, or Kronos. They are fast underwater and do stupid damage so unless you are a VERY big Mosa or Krono or a fast Elasmo, you are probably dead and if there is more than one, you are certainly dead if you can't escape, even as a big boy. Really Elasmos are pretty safe from Lurds since most build speed, but if you don't see them coming they can kill you very quick. Don't even get me started on the community because holy shit League of Legends Players could learn a thing or two from these masters of toxicity. There are a few nice players here and there, but the vast majority are ""kill everything on sight"" herbivore players. Don't think that playing a herbivore makes you safe from pachys either. Pachy players tend to attack other herbivores if they aren't in their herd too. There is literally no gain from them doing this either. they just do it to ruin other people's fun.

TL:DR
Game is great conceptually, but extremely poor balance (Very underpowered carnivores other than T-Rex and T-Rex takes forever to grow so good luck getting big enough to defend yourself) and incredibly toxic player base (In official servers.) ruins the game for anyone that doesn't like sitting on a hill somewhere afk growing for IRL hours in a herd of herbis.",1621068075,1621068075,False,6,0,0.523204922676086426,0,True,False,True

It was a bit overwhelming: the traits, the comfort, the saitation, Bias, on top of the normal health, food, water, and stamina. It took me about a little under a year before I started to really play it and now...as you can see by my 1000+ hours, I play it too much xD
My favorite part about this game is the colors and the 'genetics'. You can get inherits for traits based off of your parents if you are born from players or at random if you area  'fresh spawn'. There are pros and cons to being hatched from an egg or fresh spawning.
Each dino has different traits. Most of them are the same, but most dinos have at least one or two traits that are specific for them and only them.
 I adore the customization. I know some people don't like ""neon dinos"" (totally understandable) but I'm ALL FOR IT HECK YEAH! -most of my dinos look like a child vomited paint all over them. I love it.

If you hatch from an egg, you have the chance to get mix skin or one of several rather rare mutations. This makes for some fun experiments with mixed skins and colors. I once had a dino with 4 different skins on it and it looked like a computer glitch (Man I love that apa!!)

There's also what I think to be an amazing variety of dinos that you can play that other games don't offer.
Carnivores-Rex, Acro, Velo, Meg, and icthy
Herbivores-Apa, lurdu, ory, pachy, para, and sai
Fliers-Ptera and trope
Aquatic- Elasmo, Krono, and mosa

And even in those catagories there's sub catagories of semi aquatic and dinos that rather eat fish over other meats, herbivores that need seaweed instead of plants.

There is a lot to this game if you are willing to try it out. And the devs are constantly putting out fasinating updates, changing dino models, adding dinos, changing mechanics, adding skins, and so much more!

They are inhabited by players (and admins) whose idea of fun is to take their overgrown dinos out in  packs and attack new weak players as if its some kind of worthy challenge. Now yes, the game is pvp, the purpose is to survive for as long as possible. But you are always going to be prey to these people as you will give up before you get even close to being competitive. In my mind, any server that allows such behaviour is to be avoided. They dont deserve any new players to their population.

Some servers have rule based PvP. Those are your best bet. The rules are usually designed to limit spam killing and to force players to act in a more structured realistic manner. You will need to try a few to find one that suits. Keep in mind there will still be players who are ignorant of, or dont care about rules. You will still get killed, but you have a far higher chance of surviving and actually enjoying the game.

There are also ""Chill"" servers. Or PvE if you want to call them that. I'm sorry, but these are boring as hell. If you just want to sit about doing nothing. Growing a dino for absolutely no purpose because you dont have anything to do, then go for these. If they had NPC dinos in the game. Chill servers would be my preferred type. But they don't, so they're not.

As to the actual game, if I'd written this review a week ago I would not recommend it. I played it many years ago when it was first released and when I returned recently I was shocked at the lack of development progress. However, recently there was an update to the game that gives the impression that the  devs are actually now making strides, and have hinted at a lot of new future content.
The gameplay itself is simple enough. You spawn (or are hatched) as a young dino, and you try not to get eaten for as long as possible. There's a plethora of dinos to pick. Herbivores, carnies, aquatic and flyers. Each with their own strengths and weakness, and play styles. Too much to cover here.  As your dino grows, you earn talent points (or inherit them from parents) to customize your dino even further according to your chosen playstyle.
Graphically the game looks good enough. Not cutting edge graphics, but they do an adequate job of creating the right atmosphere. Weather and lighting effects add to the ambience. Combat is a little bit wobbly. Often you can go a whole fight without knowing if you even damaged your opponent until they drop dead. But there's still a sense of predatory satisfaction when they do.

All in all, if you like Dinos, and can handle the frustration of being killed regularly (at least until you learn the ropes) then you will most likely enjoy the game. Remember to try numerous servers, and not the official ones, theyre not fun. Also, if youre wondering if this game is better than the similar game on Steam whose name I wont mention, then yes it most definitely is (in my opinion)",1620128899,1620146047,True,8,3,0.605638742446899414,0,True,False,True

There are players who main on flyers, alternate between their full-grown carnivores to prey on creatures that their birds cannot successfully hit, and use this as a regular method to bring easy gore back to their flyer herd. On the less populated servers this can quickly overwhelm anybody just trying to play and have fun. These players suck all the fun out of the game when they purposely go out of their way to target/single out others with the sole purpose of bullying/harassment instead of surviving. Especially when they run around in local chat announcing that they are only there to harass you (unprovoked) specifically, whilst passing up many other gores and players.

I won't be fully negative. Here are a few positives:
- there's a wide range of dino-types that you can get: terrestrial, aquatic, semi-aquatic, and flyers
- the dinos that exist are all very varied in their game design, and every dino is unique in their mechanics: pachys can charge and break bones, sais(like stegos, but with armor and club) that can reflect back damage done to it, and acros that have roars so intimidating that they decrease the damage of anyone roared at
- Packs/herds can make for some fun times
- infinite growth means you grow... forever... until you become an effective god
- talents mean you can specialize your dino into something special: three trees are for mobility, damage/hunting, and survivability; you can min-max or generalize to your leisure
- inherits come from your parents(if you're not a spawn); parents at 2.0 growth and a high good parent score(that's a talent you can get), you can start your dino off with pretty good stats
- plentiful amount of servers that can vary with their rules
And then... the cons:
- flyers are effectively unstoppable, ESCPECIALLY because of the new flyer added in, not DESPITE(screw tropeos, the players that play them tend to be cancer)
- game mechanics for each dino varies wildly in power, and are outright broken sometimes when scaled up: a tropeo flapping its wings can deal more damage than someone biting(...yes you heard me right)
- infinite growth provides infinite linear scaling, which scales these monsters up to the point where they become unkillable; and while more growth = more food requirements was an attempt to balance that, herbs have no issue with that since food is plentiful, and carnivores can just hunt anything that moves, including tiny creatures that want to grow to those same godly levels
- talents make giant growth levels even worse, as a well-optimized big dino can still trump a smaller dino with more aggressive traits in strength, speed, and stamina(in short, specialization doesn't mean shit to a god) 
- inherits can make miracle babies, which make them even more unkillable when they're big; and if you think that you can get these incredible inherits... good luck, because there's no doubt a long list that you're not even on
- inherent game mechanics are busted: knockback, injury, etc.
- more likely than not, a server will be filled with angry, toxic-ass players
Now I thought i could handle it, but no... first was me getting killed by three tropeos that AFKed for 80 hours straight. And the last straw was me falling to my death after being launched bc I accidentally walked under the feet of an Apatosaurus IN THE SAME HERD AS ME(wasn't his fault, really) All of my time spent on my dino, wiped away in mere seconds.

To start with, the reviews are mixed because of the community. I did hop on official server two...and...in less than 1 minute I did see what they meant by the toxic community. I didn't bother however playing on official servers outside of seeing if it was true or not (and it is), I more spent a lot of time looking at private servers to find one fitting. Which I did and its a chill PVE based one. 

So this review is based on my experience on that server, granted its early impressions but its good enough to know how the community is, and a good idea of the game.

So, I chose Ory because I thought they were the cutest (and smallest) dinosaur. I was planning on going solo, but I was invited really quick into a group of Orys. Despite my stupid newbie questions, they have been extremely patient. Very nice group of dinosaurs, and I was reborn into a beautiful tropical green bean dinosaur :)

As far as gameplay goes, Ory is cool because you can dig and make an actual home. Not sure if other dinosaurs can make a home, but its a neat building mechanic. There is also a lot of cool varieties of dinosaurs, many obviously not realistic, but you don't buy this for realism but fun and lots of gameplay content. A lot of negative reviews knock this for lack of realism, but that isn't the point of this game. Though, the biggest thing to work toward that is really the entire gameplay is breeding and progression. Since there is an infinite amount of progression and getting your favorite ""skins"".

Is this solo friendly? Well...not really. The game is highly group oriented. This would be a negative rating if I was going solo, there'd be nothing for me to do and no progression or cool skins. You must interact with others in some way. I got lucky with a good group, and if I went solo like I planned my experience would be highly worse. RP is light, but its there (at least with the group I ended up with).

As for the negatives? Well the official server (#2 the most popular one) was sure bad. Realism isn't really there, but again that isn't the point of the game so that isn't actually a reason to give a bad review imo, it be like giving dark souls a bad review because its too hard and/or too dark of a game. The community is definitely a good reason for a negative review, and you really need to find a private server that fits you or you won't be having a good time at all.

Overall, this has been a great experience. Maybe its because got lucky and got into such a good group early on who has been incredibly patient, and I avoided the official servers from the first moment got on. As a mostly soloer (but I do group so a semi-soloer I suppose), this is definitely a bit outside my comfort area, but...there is no force voiced chat, so for me that makes it perfectly playable. Its when voice chat is forced that would ruin the whole thing for me and why I actually solo because everything is voiced these days.

So to sum it up? Well, do you care about realism or fun, tons of content and gameplay? If the latter, its for you if you find a good server and group, if the former then this isn't and won't ever be your game. If you only play on official servers however, well...stay away...the toxicity is bad, though I've seen worse in other games, but its pretty bad.",1618769865,1618769865,True,26,1,0.739025473594665527,0,True,False,True

Couldn't have been more incorrect, this game somehow manages to have such dedicated players that they would stay on a single server for hours literally camping waiting to kill your helpless fresh spawn. This is especially bad with flying dinos who can hunt you down from across the map pick you up and cart you off or knock you out of the sky. 

I see that a lot of people are complaining about ""toxic"" players and I would say that this is only partially the case. There are some genuinely nice players, but the mechanics of the game force them to take easy prey or lose the dino they have put so many hours into. What is meant to be a nerf of large dinos becomes the driving factor behind killing players who are just trying to get started over and over until one party gives up. 

That said like other games of this nature there are outside groups that pride themselves on being ""good"" at the game. Don't be fooled by these people, this game has minimal skill involved the driving factor behind your health, damage, resistance, and general ability to survive is time and luck. Are you lucky enough to survive to adult? Do you know how to read and apply ability points? How many hours are you willing to spend with one dino? If your answers are yes, yes, and a lot then congratulations, you're good at BoB. Some of the most """"""Toxic"""""" players I encountered were from these groups.

 No, saying ""GG"" to the tiny dino you just two tapped does not make you a humble or like-able. Nor does targeting said dinos make you skilled at the game. More or less until some means of escape from predators is given to the baby and juvenile dinos this isn't a game for someone who is looking to do anything other than waste their own time. If you think having some friends or an adult dino to protect you will help then think again, you may be slightly more likely to survive but this advantage is slight, as soon as they log off or you log on without them you're easy pickings. 

Like all other games in this genre it's more or less plagued by the same ""growth"" problem. This game forces players into the position of killing helpless new players in order to survive which defeats the purpose of having the larger dinos need more food. Long story short, stay the hell away from this game unless you want to waste a whole lot of time to get nowhere.",1618376441,1618430779,False,12,0,0.591745555400848389,0,True,False,True

My favourite depiction is the Velociraptor - small, feathered, and can even climb trees like it would have in real life. Their Megalosaurus could use some work. It is covered in scales instead of proto-feathers. It looks like a plucked chicken!

The game start out with almost no instruction, but its pretty simple to understand and learn on your own what to do. In my opinion, every server has its own player community which can either positively or negatively effect your game. Have been on some great servers where meeting friend is very fun and is exciting to join packs with others and help each other. And then there are some server that have very toxic community and constantly complaining if someone is breaking a rule or upset when getting killed wasn't a fair game. (Whatever the case may be, be careful what community servers you join.) some are great, some not so great.  If your someone like me who don't care about others shenanigan, then you will love this game just like me.

Growth... It is quite difficult to grow on a lot of servers that have high traffic. Especially, if you are new to the game. Please be aware, that this an ecosystem and dying (as well as create new life) is natural part of this game. If you start playing game expecting to keep your new dinosaur around for a while, you might be disappointed. Please accept the fact from the very start that there is high probability it will die eventually (or soon). If you don't die from another player, starving, dehydration, floods or tornadoes can also be the end of you, too

Special or rare skins...... if you stumble upon a special skin in nesting such as a shimmer for example, they are temporary, but they make your avatar look special. However when you die, you will lose that skin and it won't save on your account. Enjoy it while it last. Feel like this is a great way to keep things interesting. ^^ What really love about being nest born instead of spawning, is that you never know what you will look like and each skin (gender included) is a surprise once you hatch! :D (talent inheritances included). You might look like your parents, or a mix of the two. Also think its great that the game offers players to edit the skin slightly as long as your still a juvenile. 

Some things would love to see added in future is possibly more animations when attacking. Think that the game lack stuff such is pouncing on a dinosaur back or maybe swinging arms and legs around to add more realism to the avatar (especially when sprinting or tired, hungry and stressed.) More animations to show the effects of these stats would be amazing! It's just some idea. And another idea... know that surviving is part of the game and there has to be a challenge but just feel that the fish in the sea is toooo skimpy. They should add just a little bit more around.

Do recommend this game? Hell yes! It's fun and addictive if you enjoy rp as a dinosaur, hunt or take care of others. If you enjoy more complicated game play with more goals and things to do aside from eat, drink, mate, fly, sniff, run around, burrow or sleep, then this game probably is NOT for you.

For example, herbivores benefit most from hunkering down in a cave and staring at their screens, periodically going to a nearby watering hole. That's what makes them grow the fastest, not exploring or picking unnecessary fights. However, a lot of players attack anything they see because that is most engaging, but that has the effect of just making the playerbase more toxic. If you find a fun group of people, it basically just turns into vrchat but with dinosaurs which is fine...I guess? In my experience, you inevitably run into someone who will attack for no reason and end it, though. This isn't even to mention the amount of racism and trolling in official servers. You're better off ignoring global chat if you decide to play there.

I went into this hoping to be able to choose peace most of the time, and I've always died because of it. Like sure, I expect pteranadons and land-dwelling carnivores to be hostile, but I did not expect herbivores to constantly be aggro too. Y'all know there is a battle game mode right? Like I said previously, it isn't even for their own benefit, as it does not make them grow any faster.

The game itself is a little on the rough side at this stage. That's to be expected from any early access game, but the one aspect that is difficult to overlook is the optimization. Beasts of Bermuda does not run as well as it should considering how it looks at this stage.

Overall, I'd suggest waiting on this one. Hopefully with time, the playerbase will mellow out and the game itself will be fleshed out more.",1617649641,1617649641,False,4,0,0.518348574638366699,0,True,False,True

if you play solo, you get killed by a group.  if you play in a herd, you sit in one place and chat with each other.

there is an idea of a good game in here somewhere, but this is not a dinosaur simulator or anything even close to that.  it's just a dinosaur-themed melee arena game with a growth mechanic.  there is nothing that encourages natural behavior in this game.  every scavenger and herbivore in this game has the intelligence, communication skills, and coordination abilities of human beings.  this leads to things like marauding groups of pachycepholosaurs and both species of pterosaurs picking off whatever they feel like at their leisure.

i can't blame the players for playing like this, because there's nothing in the game to discourage this behavior.  the private servers have attempted to correct this on behalf of the devs via individual server rules, but these rules are often bizarre, esoteric, and numerous to the point of comedy.  eventually i asked myself why i was going through the trouble of remembering all these rules in order to play a game i wasn't enjoying.

i also can't blame the players for getting bored and killing whatever they see, because that's really all there is to do in this game.  you have to eat and drink the food and water scattered across the map, that's it.  those are the only things that you are actually required to do in this game.  dead meat is even scattered on the map for the carnivores.  the only optional thing to do is kill other players.  it sucks losing an old character, but at least you didn't really have to put in any real work, just idle time.

right now this is an idle game that becomes an arena game once you've idled a character for a long enough time.  the next time i'm in the mood to sit around and do nothing while also playing a video game, i'll play Crusader Kings 3.  at least that's fun.",1617314052,1617314052,False,5,0,0.546142220497131348,0,True,False,True

I have been nothing but frustrated. The progression takes entirely too long, which is fair, but when the game has so many balancing issues, it's extremely demotivating when you are killed and have to start all over. I honestly feel as if the devs didn't even try to progress with each dino themselves before releasing it to the public. I would honestly speak more on this but after typing my thoughts and suggestions constantly throughout the discord, it's starting to get annoying and repetitive and I'm honestly fed up with it.

1. Herbivores are boosted, and when Im saying boosted, its REALLY boosted. As a carnivore, you cannot kill a herbivore because they literally have a shit ton of hp if they're grown and if they're not grown, they just dont give any meat
2. If you are getting attacked from behind, for example as a rex, you CANNOT walk backwards. What are you supposed to do then, you ask? You can literally do n o t h i n g.
3. As I said, herbivores are boosted, and the worst part is that almost everyone plays herbivores and packs together like pussies. So if you wanna get stronger, you gotta kill dinos to get food, usually from herbivores, but to kill herbivores you need to be strong, and to be strong you need to grow by not dying from starvation, and for that you need to kill herbivores, BUT YOU CAN'T SINCE YOU'RE NOT STRONG ENOUGH.

Pros:
- Dinosaurs
- Some survival elements (hunger, thirst, comfort)
- You can nest and invite people to be your hatchling or they can request
- You keep growing larger and larger as you play
- Weather system - There are floods, tornadoes, storms (more are planned)
- There are all kinds of animals to choose from (herbivores, carnivores, piscivores, fliers, aquatics, semi-aquatics)
- Talent tree - You can customize your animal's skills for all kinds of lifestyles
- The customization of your animal is only limited by set skin patterns. You can be a neon dino if you want
- Filters - The game gives you the ability to visually change said neon dinos to more realistic and toned down colors on your screen
- Colorblind filters
- Wide variety of UI language
- Nice graphics

Cons:
- Graphics are not as good as advertised, unless you have a NASA computer.
- Horribly optimized, although they are working on it and they made some progress in the past year. Now you can actually play with shadows on.
- There is no real difference between carnivore, piscivore, and fliers. All of them eat the same thing, fight the same way. No variety. Every carnivore plays like a rex basically. Just facetank it, bite it until dead.
- Horribly balanced. Apex carnivores are super OP, fliers are OP, aquatics are OP compared to terrestrial animals, herbivores were nerfed too much
- Talent tree does not make as much difference as one might think. OP animals remain OP even when choosing non-combat skills, while weak animals remain easy meals on wheels.
- No effort is put into balancing herbivores and carnivores in servers. No setting to set herbivore to carnivore ratio. This means most servers are 80% carnivore.
- Was advertised as a survival game, instead it is meant as a free for all dino style
- Every animal can kill every other animal is good in theory but badly implemented.
- Various UE4 crashes are very common and can prevent access to the game unless the PC is restarted.
- It is clear as day that people do not prefer the game's current settings and rather play on semi-realism servers with staff and rules but no real effort was made to automate some of their rules/settings that would make managing them easier.",1617005268,1617053164,False,2,0,0.483573615550994873,0,True,False,True

Growth: Growing in a survival game is fun not gonna lie but there is a diverence between unlimited growing and cap growing.
Personally I am totally not a fan of unlimited growth, the people who life at their home and do nothing in their life get rewardet in this game because it takes hours and hours of growing to even get to a fun size with ur Dino. 
The people who work and have real life's and maybe want to play the game can't enjoy it at all cause the people who don't have a life have creatures already godzilla sized and if u start small in a world where there are only big things YOU STAY SMALL.

Community: Holly shit this community man, I am not saying it's the worst community but it is pretty much high up there.
There are people who main some species of dinos and their is a big rivalry against carnivore and herbivore mains.
The herbivore players are mostly much more toxic cause they can mix pack with each other and feel big, and if u fail a hunt as a carnivore the herbivore players WILL mock u.
As a carnivore u need to hunt to survive that's totally normal but most players don't understand that carnivores eat meat and if u try to hunt something as a carnivore u will get targeted by a whole mega herd and u can't do anything about it.
On most servers there are even players who will use every opportunity to get u banned from the server because u are a good player 😊.
So all short the community is the worst community I have experienced.

Talent Tree: This is 1 thing I love in this game that u can make so many choices of how u want ur Dino to be.
But there is a con to this too and it is called NESTING 

Gameplay: So this game is from all the Dino games out there the best in gameplay I have to admit but now we come to the nesting part the game isn't in my eyes a survival game anymore it is a MASS PRODUCING DINO MAKER GAME. 
It's all about the inherteds when u hit 0.8 in the game with every creature u can start to mate with ur partner and get kids. 
The kids will get inherteds from the parents skill tree, what that means is nested baby's are much much more op then spawn dinos so u will be forced into nesting yourself once to have a chance against other players. 
So what I mean with that is the game isn't about survival and living like a dinosaur it's about being the best and the strongest and who has the biggest ego. 

So all in all its bad its just bad the game the idea is nice but the unlimited growth, inherteds really destroy in my eyes the gameplay. 
I would recommend this game for players who don't want to work and sit on their butt's 24/7.",1613661751,1616641325,False,3,0,0.546681046485900879,0,True,False,True

Most of your time playing Beast of Bermuda will be spent doing nothing and growing or just walking around trying to find a place to grow there is nothing interesting to growing its not fun its not enjoyable it takes a considerable amount of time which can lead to 2 things you either have a fun adult life hunting fight etc or you spend 3 hours growing just to die instantly and not get to enjoy the fun of being an bigger dinosaur the game is terribly optimized and I have an decent computer and I can pull 60-50fps on most o f my games but this game I have to run some of the lowest settings and I still only get 30-20fps not to mention sometimes freezing which ive noticed happens during combat or around other people the most which is the worst time for this to happen not to mention the sometimes confusing UI which information which is either not relevant to the game atm (Venom) or the fact that there are some things you just wont figure out unless you go to the wiki theres not much of a tutorial to atleast point you in the right direction of what you should and should not be doing and the growth times to get to the actual fun parts of the game take a considerable amount of time depending on what creature you chose

For the TLDR, basically I suggest not buying this game until it gets more content, or if it's on sale. 

The game has interesting ideas, such as: 

- The introduction of talent trees (though it's mostly the same tree for every dino
give or take a few perks).

- Being able to play as flying dinos. This is possibly the most fun I've had in the game. The flying felt good and being able to fly didn't feel overpowered. You die really fast and you have to be careful when fighting ground based dinos, because if you swoop in and hit a rock, you're probably dead.

- Storms, which allow sea based dinos to have a much wider area of dominance for the duration of the storm.

However, even with these interesting ideas, in it's current state I wouldn't recommend picking this game up at the moment unless it is on sale. This is due to but a few of the reasons I'll list below:

- The game currently doesn't have much longevity because it lacks things to do. The game's content most consists of, ""spawning, growing up, hunting for food, fight other players, find and drink water, maybe make a family, and die a lot"". So when the game has a lot of people to fight, then it can be enjoyable (though clunky) when fighting for territory or watering holes or hunting, but if the population dwindles, then there would be no reason to tough the game. 

- There isn't really an end goal besides becoming an adult, getting big and maybe having a family. The first few times I played I wanted to become as big as possible, but then soon realized, ""What's the point?""

- Technical issues. The worst issue I dealt with is the game crashing before it gets to the menu screen constantly. I was eventually able to fix this issue (it was because I changed the resolution. I was able to fix the crashing by deleting the ""saved"" file in the game's folder). 

- The growth system. I personally don't like it. It feels like a half hearted mechanic that doesn't really add much to besides being one of the few end goals. I say it's half hearted because while you're growing, you feel just like a weaker version of what you will eventually become. Now obviously that is the case, but my friends and I believe that there should mechanics in place that only work when you are young, such as being able to enter caves that only small monsters can fit in (and I don't mean the borrows.)  It takes a long time to become big and strong, which if you like looking for trouble like me, you will never get there.",1616107900,1616452676,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

There is a group system where you can join other herds on the server, this makes the game very accesable to solo players. Our first playthrough my friend and I made a group and ended up having another 4 people join us and we had a blast working together. Ever herd ive joined has been friendly and helpful.

The dynamic weather system is so cool!!!! For example we were playing during a drought one time and all of the watering holes started to dry up, causing a lot of migration and action, people that normally wouldnt bother each other were literally fighting over the watering holes. Another time we had a Monsoon that flooded our nest forcing us to move out. 

The graphics look really good and the game is well optimized, I have no issue running the game @ 2k w/high settings. The skin customization allows people to make some pretty ridiculous looking dinosaurs but apparently there is a filter you can turn on the dulls down the more vibrant ones.

One major thing I will say is if your one too get overly attached to a character or are prone to ragequiting this game may not be for you. YOU WILL DIE A LOT. No matter how big or strong you get, somthing out there can and WILL beat you. Sometimes its a pack of smaller hunters catching you out on your own, sometimes its a massive Mosa that grabs you while your sippin away at the watering hole. Dont get attached and you will save some tears.

The maps are huge and the process to grow and survive is long. It's essentially a dinosaur simulator. 

So, why am I downvoting the game, then? 
Well, I sunk just about eleven hours, near straight, in two separate playing sessions. I quite like the game. And assuming you know what to do, you'll get far. 
My only pet peeve is that there's no official tutorial on the game, yet. As I'm sure the developers are working on. 

But that's not my reason for downvoting.
My reason is simple. The game is great, the community; that is, the people who play on the servers; are often pig-ignorant, simple-minded dumb shitheads. 
Even in servers where they claim to have rules of being ""chill"" or, ""sport killing"", you'll still find hordes of flying dinos that will, and I quote, Will gang up on you for simply being alone, and even servers where when you're a fully grown big-ass Trex, somehow admins fail to see the glaring issue on allowing a single, small velociraptor to bite the ass of said Trex, regardless of how young it is, and it will win. It will. You can't run. You can't turn quick enough. You will not escape simply because they can chew on your ankle for the next five minutes straight until you're all out of health. And there ain't shit you can do thanks to admins saying, and I quote, ""It's valid hunting.""

1. While the graphics are beautiful, the movements of the dinosaurs are quite jerky at times, and the animations are lacking in quality comparatively. The dinosaur models are quite nice, but don't expect bleeding edge graphics here.
 
2. This game is NOT intuitive. There are no in-game tutorials. Controls, Traits, or anything else are described by little tooltips that pop up when the action is available, or your dinosaur is in danger of dying from one parameter or another. They often then disappear with no reference guide to recall the information. There are well written guides on the game that will tell you the basics, however, this is not a jump in and play game, expecting to be taught everything before you're set free into the world to live or die. [Beginner Tip: Check the key bindings before playing, make sure you identify ""Use"" and ""Rest"" buttons.]

3. Lack of NPC dinosaurs to hunt or interact with. Due to the fact that this game is all multiplayer, and therefore PVP oriented, there is sometimes a problem with finding other players to spend your dinosaur's hours with. This is especially true if you play in a non-US time zone. [A suggestion: Form a Single Player mode, and/or the addition of a NPC filled server, so that non-peak timezone players can still enjoy many elements of the game,]
    a. Further elaborating on this problem: It is a survival game, with the plot being: survive in an all pvp environment all the time. A nice concept, but it is quite possible to life your entire youth of a dinosaur without encountering another player. (It is to be noted, that this does not seem to be the norm unless you play at off-hours/days/dinosaur species) If this is the case, and one finds themselves all alone during their play times, the game becomes VERY simple at that point. Eat and drink until you gain adulthood. There are no other objectives. There is interest in builds to help expedite that process, but overall, it becomes less of a objective oriented game, and honestly more like an aquarium simulator.

4. Many reviews have mentioned the toxic communities and players. Personally, I have not encountered that many toxic players, but I believe this is an unfortunate side effect of having a purely pvp game. Players become upset when another player predates on them, or purposely steals or guards a resource, and its easy for it to get out of hand. 
Newcomers should know that this is a core mechanic of the game, and should try not to get too discouraged from being snuffed out when they just start. (Side Note: There is an incentive here to begin as another player group's egg, so that you have a bit of a trait boost, and the thought is that babies would have the protection of other players [the parents])

Still, despite its many, many flaws, if you're looking for a sandbox style dinosaur experience, its pretty fun for a little bit. I would just play in moderation if you live or play in non-peak US timezones, (mostly because the lack of content will get old fast). On the other hand, if you are a social butterfly and/or enjoy joining raid groups, it can be a much more interesting experience...going to hunt other players. Or just hatching out of someone's egg and becoming a family unit.

There are many great ideas thrown into this game, it just needs (likely more funding), polish, and would benefit from a Single Player/ NPC server mode. I could even see it branching off into a sort of Monster Hunter style game. All in all..its fun, get it, play it, but try and wait for a sale.

I bought it out of a combination of desperation and frustration to play a flier in a similar game (frustration caused by the Isle, specifically, if you hadn't guessed) and in my 1.6hrs of game play, I have been bored, confused, and dead. A lot. It seems as though the entire purpose of this game was to catch players like me: waiting for the features I'm so excited to see in other games and just too impatient to wait any longer. It has all the planned features of other EA games like weather events which effect your stats, mechanics wherein other animals simply being nearby can give you debuffs, a trait system, a fully fleshed out and customizeable skin set, diverse maps, fliers, aquatics, and the list goes on. What it doesn't have is quality. All of it feels half-assed, unbalanced, and at times illogical and simply in for the sole purpose of being able to say that they have it. I watched a neon green parasaur pick up a palm tree by the base and walk away with it today. It did not interact with the landscape, simply fazing in and out of the ground and surrounding objects, but it was casually walked up a mountain for no apparent reason with no visible effects or debuffs applied to the player for literally carrying a tree. I also had to huddle under a rock for an hour because there was a storm. For an hour. It also kills you within about 5 minutes from mere discomfort when not under a rock, in case you were wondering. Not long after I then stood on a sea stack out in the middle of the ocean and heard a fight between a neon pink and green sauropod and some large carnivore happening on the mountain sight just at the edge of my render distance as if it was right next to me. This is what I mean by unbalanced, irrational, and wildly confusing. 

This game has potential. A lot of features other games don't have are already in, and I didn't notice any bugs while playing, though nothing besides eating and running is exactly intuitive game-play wise so it was hard to test for any or even know what was happening half the time. It is also still in early access though, so I expect it to improve - which is the only reason I'm not refunding it - but it has a very, very long way to go.

I really hope they consider putting some effort into balancing it out so that playing as a juvenile is actually a rewarding experience. 

As it stands you basically have no chance to survive an encounter with an adult as a juvenile, adults are not only stronger than you, but faster. Yes you could hide, but is it enjoyable to spend hours hiding in a cave waiting to grow and reach ""the fun part of the game""? No, it's not, the entire juvenile period (which can take hours to get through) feels like a waiting room for the part of the game where your decisions can actually affect the outcome of the game somewhat. Yes, perhaps changing this wouldn't be very realistic, but neither is eating crystals to make you more comfortable, at the end of the day this a game and that shouldn't be an excuse for lazy design. 

I really want to like the game and growth as a concept, but even playing on ""realism"" servers with an entire plethora of rules of engagement hasn't stopped me being ganked by older and most frustratingly /faster/ groups of adults. The game cycle for a juvenile carnivore seems to be spawn, wander around finding food on the floor because you cannot hope to hunt anything at your size, until you get spotted by something twice your size that you cannot outrun, /or/ you get incredibly lucky and survive the waiting room. Can't help but feel that those who lose this arbitrary roll of the dice are basically sentient AI creatures for the lucky few to hunt. 

Please address this developers, there should be some recourse for young. Whether it be some temporary evasive abilities brought on by their small size, or just a tweak of stamina/speed. I don't mind losing from time to time, it's a survival game after all, but there's nothing worse than dying and feeling that there was never really anything you could have done about it anyway, especially when you have spent 3 hours patiently growing your creature and biding your time.",1616013222,1616014671,False,9,0,0.600595593452453613,0,True,False,True

The problem is the server stability completely limited our experience.  We spent more time getting disconnected, reconnecting and dealing with server crashes than we did playing the game (played official servers).  Going to check out ""The Isle"" now and maybe come back to this when the stability issues have subsided a bit.  Really unfortunate b/c it seems like it could be a really fun game.

EDIT: The server issues were apparently only on the server we were playing on and I was contacted by Starcatcher from the Q&A team over at Beasts of Bermuda who explained this and apologized for any inconvenience.  This was unexpected and much appreciated.  It seems the people working on this game actually care about it's community.

All herbies can mix pack leading to a completely unkillable herd that become super agro and just start killing any and all carnoviors in their general area. It is not uncommon for a random herbie to walk 1/2 mile out of their way to try and hit you while you are sleeping. I guess its because when you are in a group that cant be killed things get pretty boring 5 hours into you sitting still in a video game. Because of this, the only way you will get any action is if you play as a carnivores because the only killing that is going to be happening is carnivores killing carnivores with the occasional herbie fresh spawn kill before they make it to their herd. This wouldn't be so bad if there was ever an incentive for the herbies to ever leave their watering hole. The game does try to do this with the water draining, but either it rains soon enough for it to refill or an admin will just abuse and force a rain storm.

Which brings me to the next point, the mods and admins of this game are 100% completely pointless. I don't say this to be hyperbolic, I say it because according to them ""They cant do anything about it"". If we go back to my previous example of the hebie going out of its way to attack you, which is against most server rules, and the herbie ends up killing you the admins cannot do anything. Even if they see the even happen with their own eyes they cannot do anything. Why you may ask? Because most servers require you to be recording, that's right, recording ALL of your gameplay in the event that you get killed by 9 times out of 10 rule break kill. This become even more infuriating because that dinosaur that you had for 4+ hours that you lost to a rule break, ""Sorry bud, make sure you record it next time."" Which, side note, the game does not tell you who killed you unless they were stupid enough to type to you before rule breaking.

Which brings me to my final point, the combat in this game is GOD AWFUL. The hit detection alone would be enough for people to understand what I mean once you play this game. Not only that but the fact that dinosaurs the size of your leg bone being able to solo kill a water tower sized dinosaur is enough to send you over the edge. I have seen fights go on for 10+ minutes only for a 100% combat 1.2 growth T-rex lose to a bird.

Basically, the game play is garbage and the servers themselves are ass. I am going to leave the comments open because I would love to see the 500+ hour simps try to defend this pos game.

ORIGINAL REVIEW
So I gave this game a legit 3 full day try.  The game itself is riddled with bugs, poor animations, bad hitboxes.  What it shines in is mechanics, but majority of these mechanics are lacking in fluid structure and gameplay flow. 

What worst is the community behind this game -  The only 2 servers that have above 20 people playing. Which if you've ever played a survival game surviving on a DEAD server is the lamest thing you could do (because once you're grown there's NOTHING to do but AFK by yourself)

The 2 populated servers are The Beast and some Mercad server.  Both of which use DISCORD to ADVERTISE and monetize off the PLAYER BASE.  KEEP IN MIND - THE DEVELOPERS GET NO MONEY FOR DONATED MONEY TO THESE DISCORDS!!!!!!

It's literally the same guy that hosted battlefield 1942 server from his computer in the basement making disgusting money off these weebs.

$600 USD to equal out the same amount costed for 1 GROWTH???    Both servers run exactly the same way - the Admins give grows to their friends and their friends run a Monopoly on the map killing all new players not allowing them to nest or group, thus taking over the map.  

They will even mix pack with carnivore / herbivore / marine / Air.  .  Meaning there is no deversification, you have  a Pteradon doing servelance for Trex or water creatures. Completely breaking the mechanics of the game.

So you say OKAY - I'll go play OFFICIAL servers. . .  well theres the problem ONLY 2 SERVERS with POPULATION are private servers with Paid Grows -  Official server consistantly has less then 10 people on.",1583223539,1614844584,True,0,0,0.598321080207824707,0,True,False,True

719890,87383391,76561198079920713,0,10,2942,0,751,1704854032,"I will compare this to the isle here because the games are so similar it would be dumb to try and not do that. 

Gameplay: BoB's gameplay, compared to the Isle's gameplay, is insanely robust at first glance, but falls short of what you'd expect. It's got the same be-born, live, nest and survive baseline as the isle, but executes it much more effectively I think. For starters, your dinosaurs aren't lumbering hunks of titanium-based gravity-well-inducing lead-meat that can't trip over a small stone without causing a mass extinction event. The movement of all dinosaurs is solid, very solid, without being overpowered or too unrealistic. Things move as you expect them to, and it doesn't take 200000000000 years to get from one section of the world to the next. Also, caves are a thing, and there's purpose to them. Beyond that, the vast array of dinos is a nice thing. While the game lacks certain notable creatures like the Isle has, the ones in BoB are purpose-built and diverse which makes each one of them feel like you're playing a new game in a sense, as opposed to the isles ""Pick one of these big things that do the same thing just about"" approach to balancing their dinos. And with the wide array of builds you can create, in-depth color systems, and bloodline-traits, the game feels much more active and involved and you'll spend less time just sleeping to grow as in the isle. There's always something to be doing, and that's great. Plus, the little Oris can dig mincraft-worthy burrows, farm, and decorate so literally like... The isle has NOTHING comparable to that. It's awesome and I love that it was implemented, even if it is a bit OP.

Mechanics: Okay, so... Forget the isle, because the isle has like 5 mechanics and 2 of them revolve around exploiting turning-radius limitations so it's not even a battle there. OH MY GOD BOIS THIS IS THE GAME!!! Unique species-based traits can turn your lumbering T-Rex into Moby Dick's arch-nemesis of the seas, you can give your tanky-anky access to the f***ing speedforce from DCU and throw everyone off their guard. The number of potential builds here is just... It's crazy. And you can combine them all (should you survive that long) into a super-beast that rewards players for playing smart and actually surviving to that point. It's not as flashy as the elders-system of EVRIMA, but it works. That being said, it's not going to be as crazy as i've stated from the get-go. While you -can- make highly specialized builds, it takes a lot of time past the adult-stage and some commitment to get there. Effectively, this lets you optimize your dino for scavenging, escaping, defense, ect. but it can be expressed in those excessive ways if you hyper-specialize the stat changes of each trait. The comfort mechanic also mitigates greifing and tail-turn battles effectively, something the Isle needs to take note of. There are robust storms that force players out of their comfort zone and give some under-used ones huge advantages for short periods of time. There is so much more than just eat-drink-sleep in this game, it's realistic while still being manageable and I love that. On top of that, the growth mechanic is way better executed here than in the isle. No more will you spend that 6 hour grow time alt-tabbed watching bad porn to pass the time, you're pretty capable at-spawn to make use of all the game has to offer and there's a lot to keep you engaged while you grow. The color-scheme system also encourages camouflage tactics, which is really cool because you CAN actually hide in this game if you utilize it correctly.

Graphics: Meh. Not even close to as good as EVRIMA is, but even old-isle has better looks. Still, it's not the worst thing ever and is very playable.

Optimization: Eeeeeh.... It's aight. I mean I have a 2k series machine and it still stutters from time to time. But again, it's very playable and only really hindering in high-speed air battles.

Fun!: Abso-lutely. I had more fun playing this game in the last 12 hours than i've had playing the isle in years. There's just so much more to keep you engaged and active, and it's less of a ego-battle between different dino-mains due to the shorter grow times and different builds. Overall, 7/10. Love the game, can't wait to see it grow. Yes, EVRIMA will quite possibly make this entire game obsolete if they don't update the engine physics and overal textures, but EVRIMA -might- be complete by 2025. This is done NOW and the devs are way more active. Get it, no doubt.",1614211926,1614212200,True,137,10,0.890181303024291992,2,True,False,True

Beasts of Bermuda, also referred to as BoB, is an indie Dinosaur simulator/adventure game currently in Early Access (at the time of this review). 

I myself would recommend buying this game, however! I will have to note, this doesn't automatically dictate that this game should be purchased at first glance.
BoB has it's ups and downs, which can easily ruin the experience of the player and to which has ruined mine and others when comparing it to it's competition (The Isle and PoT, however I will acknowledge there are others to)

Here are a few positives that I myself and others enjoy about the game:
 - Color freedom
 - Water and the ocean
 - The good handful of differentiating playstyles and playables
 - Works well on low quality/cheap rigs

These few cherry picked pros of BoB make gameplay enjoyable, either with friends or without.
Some also make BoB different when compared to other games, eg. Color Freedom, with currently The Isle having zero color selection (Evrima build) and PoT's small skin selection with it's locked colors.
It certainly does bold and highlight the game in certain areas.

Here are a few negatives:
 - Giant (and I mean unnaturally giant) creatures
 - Ugly textures for a very cheap look

These two are a big thing for me and a few others. But nonetheless seems quite intentional for the time being.

I hope this review gives enough detail to if you should get BoB or not.

Pros:
- You won't find a dino game with as much customization as Beasts of Bermuda and the devs are always adding new skin patterns with nearly every update. You can go camo or be puke green if you want. 

- Instead of growing to adult and then being like ""what do I do now?"" growth is basically endless and as you continue to grow you are able to make your dino grow stronger through the points you are given to use in the skill tree. Unfortunately, this is no longer a pro....

- It's the little things like incubating in an egg instead of just spawning in as a baby, or being able to carry your little ones around that makes players really love this game. 

CONS:

- I came to this game because I was sick of the Isle dev team and how they treated their players hoping that the BoB team would be different, and at first I really had faith in them. Maybe I was blinded by my love for this game, I was sorely mistaken. The recent update has ruined the game, as they added things that no one asked for and took away things that no one wanted to be removed. I have quickly learned that the lead dev cannot take any criticism. The game is virtually unplayable in it's current state and I have seen private servers start to shut down and people start to quit. I have a friend on the QA team and apparently the update wasn't ran by them so she's quitting the game and the QA team completely. 

- The BoB team does not listen to their community. Instead of acknowledging that their players are hurt and upset, they guilt trip and pass blame. They make it difficult for players to run their private servers, as they like to micromanage them and if one server does something wrong or shady, the entire community is punished for it. For example: they removed enemyship in game, which shows the name of opposing players you are engaged in combat with claiming that it was requested by the community, when literally no one asked. They also removed the ability for admins to spawn growth storms which screwed over a lot of servers. The Community Leaders had to beg the devs to put these features back into the game. People are paying hundreds of dollars to run private servers for the community only to be screwed over by the devs at every corner. 

- If you want a team that is on the side of the community, you won't get that here. Discord moderators will white knight the dev team at every chance they get. 

- If you want a gameplay with meaningful endless growth like I stated previously, you won't find that here anymore. With the recent update, it is pointless to grow large dinos and the skill tree has been messed up as well. The lead developer, Pred, said that dinos aren't supposed to get to 5.0 but then why is that even a feature in your game if you don't like people growing that large? Make it make sense. 

Seeing as negative reviews can get you banned from the game, fingers crossed that my criticism doesn't anger them enough to warrant a dev ban. Seriously guys, do better.",1612111395,1612111395,False,46,0,0.786305248737335205,0,True,False,True

I would love to see it grow to be a success because I met so many amazing people on this game! This game is early access so you have to give it the benefit of the doubt at some points. Unfortunately, this game has taken a MASSIVE turn and it really hurts for me to say considering I have over 1k hours in this game. The main dev, his mods, and QA team don't seem to be as professional as you would think they would be. I have been targeted (and countless of my friends have as well) just because we have big dinos in the game, and it became very stressful to play. I have been accused of breaking rules that they have not found proof in or just wasn't true at all. I was almost banned for being in the background of a report ( for 5 secs NO JOKE) that had absolutely nothing to deal with me, but since I have a big dino and is well known by the server I was automatically accused and almost punished for being there. If you do try this game out, don't associate with a clan called FNG they are very toxic and are not new player friendly though they have stated they want to ""help"" the new player base out. It's all a show. Be careful who you trust.

As far as mechanic's go there are no tutorials SO don't expect people to help you out automatically. You have to ask the right people or you will have a hard time figuring things out like I did. Once you start getting a handle of things you will eventually figure it out but it takes time.

I am disappointed on how this game turned out to be but I hope in the future the led dev or anyone who has a word in for the future of this game starts to listen to the majority of the player base and understand why people are upset as much as they are with this new patch and the behavior of the Dev team, Mod team, and the QA team.",1572730811,1611951026,False,10,0,0.51677703857421875,0,True,False,True
719890,55680990,76561198068579602,0,9,7232,398,3474,1708569213,"To preface let me say that I have had some small moments of fun playing this game. It has a system to build your dino according to how you want to play. It's got a selection of dinos (i wouldn't call it wide). It's got decent ambiance.

The BIG problem is that between those few moments of fun are hours, and i do mean literal hours of nothing. The core aspect of the game is to make your creature, eat food, drink water, and not get killed to grow bigger. That's it. 

There is a breeding system that doesn't really do anything, it's there to give people the satisfaction of mommy daddy simulator and make you grow faster, that's about it.

The core gameplay loop of this game is to sit around doing nothing, literal nothing, so you grow bigger in hopes of becoming too big for a normal player to kill. Something which can take literal days. Not days of in game time, real life days spent sitting around doing nothing. Because when you die in the game you go back to square one, lose everything. Most people sit around doing nothing in the game out of sheer fear of losing their progress.

Another core problem with the game is the lack of npcs. The world feels very VERY empty. On average the biggest maps for this game (most populated) have at max maybe 50 players. On a normal day its more like 20. That's 20-50 players spread across massive maps, then divided into either land, sea, or air animals. It's perfectly normal in this game to not see another dinosaur for 3 or four hours in this game. IT very much needs npcs.

As if all that wasn't bad enough, the game is woefully imbalanced. Certain creatures in the game have special abilities, while others don't. AND there is nothing limiting whether apex predators can swarm in groups to kill people. This makes them overpowered by the default. I'm not gonna go into every detail about it, but suffice to say that playing this game if a hoard of rexes, tropeos, mosasaurs, KOS pachycephalosaurs don't kill you then you'll die of sheer boredom.

I keep coming back to try it after every new update comes out and I am continually disappointed. It just isn't a game. Games have things to do, they have features to keep a player engaged. This has none of those, it's not a game. This is a dinosaur themed sandbox for kiddos to play pretend in. It may become an actual game once it gets some npc dinos or a way to not lose all your progress on death so people won't be so damn scared to actually do things.",1571545180,1611890654,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

FR :

Ce jeu est incomplet, donc je vais le juger en sa qualité de produit en accès anticipé. 

Points forts :

- Amusant, beaucoup de possibilités absurdes. Le jeu ne se prend clairement pas au sérieux et ne se veut pas réaliste. Vous pouvez jouer un T. rex rose brillant si ça vous amuse. Les dinosaures ont des capacités privilégiant le fun mais absurdes à regarder. Point fort ajouté il y a peu, vous pouvez utiliser un filtre dans les options afin de dissimuler les couleurs trop vives des autres joueurs. Si vous aimez le réalisme, cela vous évitera de voir des dinosaures couleur arc-en-ciel.

- Possibilité de spécialiser son animal à sa guise. Vous avez le choix de booster un tas de talents utiles dans plusieurs situations. L'endurance et la vitesse par exemple, mais aussi la vitesse de nage, même en tant que T. rex ou apatosaurus par exemple, ce qui peut donner des trucs bizarres, amusants et polyvalents. Encore une fois, ne cherchez pas le réalisme là-dedans.

- Une grande variété d'animaux jouables. Vous pouvez incarner un théropode (dinosaure carnivore bipède) des plus classiques, tout comme un herbivore tel que le parasaurolophus par exemple, mais aussi des reptiles marins géants comme le mosasaurus, et autres ptérosaures volants. Le gameplay se veut varié, avec des animaux jouables aquatiques, volants, semi-aquatiques, et terrestres. Ajoutez à cela la possibilité de spécialiser son dinosaure pour certaines situations, et vous aurez des tonnes de manières de jouer différentes, même avec un seul animal.

- La croissance infinie. Vous n'avez pas de limites de taille (sauf sur les serveurs qui ont un cap de croissance, donc vous avez le choix). Plus longtemps vous survivez, plus gros vous serez. Bien évidemment cela prend du temps, beaucoup. Vous aurez accès à plus de points de talents, plus de santé, etc. Mais la route sera longue, difficile... C'est ce qui rend le jeu addictif à mon sens. 

- Les outils de chat. Le jeu est bien codé sur ce point, vous pouvez discuter avec un joueur précis en privé, parler en groupe ou en global. 

- La possibilité d'avoir plusieurs emplacements de créatures par serveur afin de ne pas être bloqué sur une seule. Ceci a cependant des points négatifs que je vais décrire plus bas. 

Points faibles : 

- Animations horribles. A part quelques unes, attendez-vous à voir vos animaux bouger comme des robots, en plus de ressembler à des jouets. Cela n'est pas très gênant, le jeu ayant un style très ''arcade'' selon moi, mais tout de même. 

- ''Maps"" ou cartes vraiment mal faites. Trop petites pour la plupart (sauf Ancestral plains), design à gerber, en particulier Rival Shores. Il est très facile dans ce jeu de traverser toute la carte avec un animal volant, repérer qui est où, et de changer de dinosaure pour aller sur un autre et tuer celui que vous aviez repéré un peu plus tôt avec votre créature volante.
 
- Failles à exploiter & changement de créature : Avoir plusieurs créatures par serveur et en changer rapidement et facilement a un point négatif. Vous pouvez par exemple révéler la position d'un autre joueur à un ami. Par exemple, jouez un pteranodon, allez en deux coups d'ailes voir si il y a des joueurs dans un coin, envoyez un petit message privé à vos potes T. rex adultes en disant ''Hé les gars, j'ai trouvé un troupeau près du marais, allez-y !''. Les clans utilisent souvent ça pour se faire la guerre. Vu la taille ridicule de la carte Rival Shores par exemple, on a vite fait de se faire tuer de la sorte, surtout quand on est un nouveau joueur solo.

- L'équilibrage quasiment inexistant : Ne vous attendez pas à une expérience de jeu parfaite. Vous serez témoin de choses absurdes et aberrantes. A chaque mise à jour, tout peut changer. Votre animal préféré peut subir le pire nerf de l'histoire du jeu, ou le nouveau dino ajouté peut être tellement fort que vous verrez des groupes entiers détruire toute vie existante sur un serveur.

- Si vous aimez la démocratie, n'allez pas sur ce jeu : Le développeur en chef a demandé à un joueur de supprimer son avis négatif sur le jeu car il parlait d'une rumeur dans les commentaires steam (la rumeur serait que le mappeur n'était pas payé à temps et aurait quitté l'équipe pour cela). J'ai vu des captures d'écrans non truquées de ces conversations, le joueur a été forcé de retirer son commentaire négatif pour être débanni (il a été banni de TOUS les serveurs !!!). Inacceptable selon moi. Si vous ne me croyez pas, soyez libre de me MP, je suis en possession de ces captures d'écran. 

Sans parler des histoires de clans favorisés par les devs, des abus des administrateurs sur les serveurs officiels et autres rumeurs de ce genre, toutes quasiment fondées de ce que j'ai pu voir des preuves matérielles.
Dommage, il y avait du potentiel. Allez jouer à the isle à la place. 

Bisous !


ENG : 

Good points :

- Fun (colors, mechanics, variety of possible builds, absurds things to do with animals like darting to the sky as an elasmosaurus, a long neck aquatic reptile).
- Addictive. Only because of the infinite growth. If you stay alive long enough, you can be gigantic. That's super addictive, really.
- Good variety of animals (flyers, aquatics, semi aquatics, land animals... And you can build creatures to go on another element. Like playing an aquatic tyrannosaurus, even if hard).
- Nice chat tools. You can speak in private messages, in group, in global, etc.
- Good looking new models. Tropeognathus, Tyrannosaurus and ichthyovenator new models are pretty nice, and somewhat ''accurate'' (or looks believable at least if you don't put BRIGHT PINK COLORS on them).


Could be an amazing game without :

- The total absence of balance even if you can build your dinos to flee most of the threats (or die lol).
- The small maps (and absence of a mapper. RUMORS said that he wasn't payed... Oof if that's true.) allowing people to scout you as a flying animal, switching to their big ones and going to kill you. Or DM your location to their friends.
- The abyssal optimization of the game. You will have to accept that the game will look like a 2008 Xbox 360 game. Except if you have a 2080 and 32 gb of ram, you might be able to play in full ultra. If not, you will see frames drops baby. A lot.
- Garbage level animations. I'm fine with it because FUN FIRST but... Animations looks horrible. Wanna travel back in time in mid 2000's ? Those animations will make you nostalgic of good old PS2 games !
- Clan-friendly game. People can scout you and find you EZ because the maps are so small... If a group of 2-3 organized players decide to kill you again and again until you leave the server, they can, easy, by scouting with a flying animal, reveal your location to friends, and go kill you with their big T. rexes for exemple. 

- If you love democracy, that's not a game for you. I saw screenshots, non falsified, of the lead developer DMing a player who wrote a bad review about the game. That player just talked about a rumor of a dev being unpayed (the mapper, who left the team recently... Sad, a new map is supposed to come).
The developer banned that player for that (wtf ?) and said to the player ''Hey, remove your bad review and i will unban you''. The player, scared, accepted the deal. I have screenshots of that as proofs. Me and a LOT of official servers's players. That's not normal at all. That's North Korea level.

Also, i've heard other rumors about admins abuse and a specific clan composed of dev friends having advantages and support from admins, mods, devs... I don't know if that's true. Proofs are needed. Maybe someone will release all of this soon ? I don't know. Until then, DON'T BUY THIS GAME IF YOU LOVE DEMOCRACY.

Sad, it has potential.

Isle better UwU

719890,85461679,76561198979887855,0,1,7752,0,7752,1606017811,"So. I'm posting this up since the information was censored by the lead dev, Predatoria, banning the person who originally posted the negative review with some information that was actually stated by the OP as being a word down the grapevine and not as a true fact. 

Lemme start by saying I really wish this game was better, I met so many awesome people in it and the friendship and basically family I got out of it was awesome. However I find it unacceptable for the original person who posted a negative review, with a ""this isn't fact we just wanna know what even happened"", to be banned by the lead dev for simply posting a negative review with the information that is simply floating around the community. 

1. So the big thing here is the question on if there is actually an issue where their lead map designer wasn't being paid for the work he had done. There was supposedly roughly 78% of the land done on the new map before hand when he was hired to do one map and then requested to do another. Issues arose by him asking to be paid to finish up and then left when he was refused. Again, I must stress, this is just kind word floating around and none of us as the player base are sure what happened. I think we're in the right to be worried about this game tracking toward going somewhere it doesn't need to go if things like this are happening. There's also been word that there was harassment, general rudeness, and unfair treatment to this mapper and his friends after the issues arose. I will once more stress that this is JUST word floating around the community and I know a large group of the player base is concerned that this kind of thing will make the game fail. We just wanna have transparency from the dev team.

2. Mod/Admin team seems to be made of mostly community. Which, technically would be really cool. If it weren't for the appearance that half of them do not do their actual mod job. The fact that ""if you need help simply make a ticket and a moderator will hop online to help you"" is the answer is bull. There's been multiple times where myself, or others have sat and waited for a ticket to even be looked at for well over a hour. Not to mention if you have issues even getting into a server for 2 whole months and the response is just ""Oh well that's a steam issue, it'll fix itself"" after having been asked if you've done basic tech support stuff. 

No mixpacking is allowed on official- mixpacking is specifically stated as groups of people not allowed to group together (acro and a rex for instance) assisting each other in hunting another creature. I've seen this rule broken before, many times- but no one stepped in, even with video proof, to make right the things that were targeted.

4. If you were to talk to the general populace, you'll find that most of them turn to other players for help instead of moderators. There little trust in the mods and admin to remain unbaised and not disclose my location to their friends to hunt me.

You should not fear the people who are supposed to help you.

5. The community. Like has been said, this is good and bad. The good is- friends. Absolutely friends. The bad? The unregulated toxicity that can run rampant, and has to be kept in check by players instead of the people supposed to regulate it.

The lead developer is pretty obviously in dislike for the people growing big dinos- and at every turn, more or less makes an update that manages to punish them. You don't get a good game, or keep a player base for long term, if you punish the people for doing what you made the game for- to play it and grow big. To have fun, make friends, and to create a unique social community within each server that's brought to life. Like newest update for the game punishing anything bigger than a 1.2 growth. Kind of a big ol' slap to the face of people who spent money on the game and spent time growing big, like the game is supposedly meant to allow you to do, just for something like a big krono to only be able to green lunge and do 400 dmg to a fresh spawn krono.",1611780297,1611781500,False,36,0,0.654395103454589844,0,True,False,True

Let me start by saying I believe they aim to be different style games within the genre in the end. So I don't want to say one is better. I will say in their current states I find BoB to be far more rewarding for my time spent, even if like The Isle it can all come crashing down in seconds. 

Starting with surface stuff. The Isle definitely has the better sound engineer, like honestly who did that for them is really good. BoB isn't bad but you'll need to tweak a few settings to reliably hear footsteps. 
The graphics in the isle are marginally better in that they appear slightly more crisp and real. While BoB looks more akin to Ark. That said, BoB has way more stuff going on in the water. Throw in the weather affects, lightning strikes, floods, extinction floods, tornadoes, heavy fog, general foul weather, soon to add forest fires. On the flip side night time isn't nearly as dark and there is no night vision mechanic. The map will keep you guessing, one moment you're chillin, next you're trying to outrun the water and the sea creatures coming with it.

Breeding is a thing in BoB. You can inherit colors from your parents, like really inherit not semi randomness. Color customization is nearly infinite and there is different patterns for each dino. You get talent points to spend on perks, some dino have special talents available to them. There is three trees you can spend into. You can grow past 100% (1.0). Parents growth level and talents will affect what kind of extra talent points you get to inherit, because up to 1.2 growth you have a chance to random inherit extra points. Positive or negative, usually positive though. As for growth it caps out (on our sever at 4.0) by then its literally impossible to keep up with food and water requirements. Growth slows as you get bigger and foor and water consumption goes up. BUT fear not, all that hard work surviving and growing isn't wasted. Find a mate make some eggs and hatch into one of your own to get your hard earned inherits. Also did i mention you can have 6 dinos per server? Also when hatched you come in as an egg not a hatchling. Parents can carry young, and eggs. They can also carry food back to nests.

Downside, to BoB over the Isle. Severs sizes are generally smaller but i've noticed servers upping player caps as the game gains popularity. Also the map feels smaller, but with the water level changes, ocean and caves you'll have plenty to check out.

Most of the combat mechanics are more involved as well. More than just tail riding and running around mashing left click. There are special abilities for each dino and most have a primary and secondary attacks.

Lastly the Dino selection is on par with the Isle if you consider the survival dinos they have finished, not counting the number of unfinished dinos. BoB offers 5 carnivores, 3 aquatic dinos (also carns), 2 flyers and 6 herbivores. Plus side they are all completed, full skill trees and life cycle. None of this half finished BS the Isle calls okay for years at a time.

Again in the end these games are in development by small teams, progress is likely to be slow. Both teams are doing great work and they aim to be different games. Looking forward to the future of both. That said, as is BoB is more worth your time invested. In my opinion anyway. They heavily under sell themselves and there a bunch of little mechanics to the game you'll never know about unless you play. If you're debating which way to toss your 20 dollars, I highly suggest BoB first, then later buy The Isle.",1598279571,1611591449,True,24,0,0.708963096141815186,0,True,False,True

When you first jump into the game, it will be a steep-ish learning curve.
Dinos basically have unlimited growth, which can cause a lot of servers to be unplayable on, and also cause you to lose your dino frequently, very frequently.
Most servers if not all have an extremely, extremely toxic community.
Toxicity rarely bothers me, but the community is insanely bad.
However, once you do find a good server to play on, with rules against toxic actions, you can have a very fun time on it.
It is still dependant on the group you're with, but even alone you will have some fun.

But oh my wow!, this game s*ck hard. I've seen TABLET survival games that are MUCH better than this one.

You'd think getting chase by a Rex would make you tense, but how the f I'm suppose to be ''scared'', or feel the thrill that I'm hunted by a predator, when they all look like giant popcicle!?!? 
Literally 99% of players choose fluo/flashy/glowing/sparkling as skin colors, like wtf, I feel like I'm in one of my daughter's ''My Little pony'' cartoon, or even worse, ''Avatar''. 
This is without talking about the mechanics, they're terrible! The growing system, while the skill tree is nice-ish, everything else make no sense. When I tried the raptor, - looks like a crazy goofy crazy chicken-, I was barely 10 minutes into the game with it, saw a rex, so I thought to myself alright, lets see how bad they are, well f me, I actually KILLED a rex with a JUVI raptor!! Like wtf!?! With the size I had, it would have been impossible to even go through the skin of a much bigger animal.

So yeah, as someone who thought players of ''The Isle'' were bashing this game for no good reason, I'm disappointed to see that they were right. The ONLY people who could like this game are kids, girls (since most like sparkling things) or someone ''fabulous''.
WORSE ''survival'' game I've ever tried, and I tried a LOTS. You'll get bored after 10 minutes, and if you're persistent, you'll try ALL the Dinos and be bored on the 2nd day. And don't expect this game to have a ''better future'', because it's as good as it never gonna gets.

Being a survival genera involving growth predicates who calls the shots and who gets stomped on.  An thanks to community imposed rules possible an even inevitable cannibalism or worse will occur.  After spawning in on a herbivore i had been growing for the past 2 DAYS coming home from work an wanting to experience the dangers of being on the food chain instead of a hunter I proceed to rejuvenate my chosen Dino on the near by flora.  I was then attack an pursued by other players who were not even carnivores (aka active enemy players who would benefit directly from taking out other players).  Perused an eliminated instead by fellow herbivores (aka active players that only benefit form eating greens an running or fighting off aggressors like carnivores)  for taking part in what can easily be seen as a readily an plentiful source of food and i was taken out by what should be friendly players.  Instead of a show of force an left to leave the immediate zone I am punished an ended, stealing away all my time an effort because another player started playing the game by what could be mere hours before me, an because they didn't agree with my actions.  No possible retrieval of lost progress an no way to possibly retaliate because players that came before you will ALWAYS be stronger an higher level than any new comer due to the growth mechanic in play.  To conduced only players that achieve a high level ""Early"" will remain at the top all others will be pushed to the bottom of the roster an never see a chance or experience a moment of accomplishment.  Other games allow solo an even new players to experience a ""high"" moment, to feel or experience what its like to be #1.  This game an its players will not allow that moment to happen it is an ever struggle to survive but not in the vain of predator and prey relations.  Instead one will encounter players cannibalizing there own kind to get ahead or be eliminated due to the whims of others with no lasting or immediate benefits.  This game has aspects that would allow it to be entertaining but i refuse to play any game that involves ""in fighting"".  Games should have predetermined lines drawn in the sand.  If other players can get away with what is basically TEAM KILLING with zero immediate reproduction designed into the game an not administer at a designated time of an ADMIN players with Superior stats (or timed played) dictate and determine the fate of other players.

I'd classify it as a multiplayer dinosaur survival game with some fantasy-esque elements (as opposed to semi-realism or realism). This works well in its favor, creating a fun gameplay experience. The developers have put a focus on the gameplay first, and then are going back to shape up graphics after, which I think is a great approach.

PROS:
- Huge color customization, custom color wheel for every marking, different skin patterns for every dino. Nested dinosaurs can get combinations of those skins.
- Dinos can take on different specializations with interesting skill trees, allowing you to customize your dino's ""build""
- Dinos can reproduce with the opposite gender and create eggs. Players can take these eggs, and those dinos can ""inherit"" points in these skill trees based off of their parents' builds, creating incentives to nest & be nested, with players frequently wanting and taking eggs
- Attentive and active development team -- this Early Access game has great, positive development leadership. They frequently release updates and fix major bugs quickly when they arise.
- Well-developed gameplay loop -- it's obvious what the developers were ""going for"" and what you need to do.
- Well-developed systems that allow for varied gameplay -- food, water, weather (rain, storms, tornadoes!!), floods, a dino ""comfort"" system all drive your actions as a dinosaur. What you do is dependent on your circumstances.
- No growth limit (unless on servers that implement it) means that with enough time, you can grow massive creatures!
- Being able to pick up things (food, offspring, etc.) adds a cool dynamic to the gameplay, especially social gameplay (grabbing food for people, carrying your offspring, etc.).
- Many dinosaurs are actively being remodeled.
- There's a skin filtering feature in the options that allows ""sparkle""/bright skins to be filtered to more natural colors.
- Many different servers with different rules for different styles of play! Usually something for everyone.
- Good server setting options, allowing for a lot of different rules and play environments.
- Ignoring growth, the roles of the carnivores and herbivores are pretty well-balanced. Each creature has its niche and its role, and typically some means of defending itself. Herbivores aren't a walking buffet like they are in some other games of the genre.
- Pleasant mixture of land, marine, and aerial dinosaurs, all with a different gameplay feel.

CONS:
- The lack of a growth cap means that this is a timesink game. You can choose dinosaurs that grow faster to help alleviate this, but ultimately, if you want to play the biggest creatures, you will have to sink in a lot of time. Sometimes the best way to do it is almost to just AFK (in the case of apatosaurus).
- Growth is king in the game -- skills and skill trees are useful and fun, but ultimately if you get caught by someone bigger than you, you will likely not survive. You're unlikely to be able to defeat larger dinos of your same species, even with different builds (some exceptions, but not many). In some servers, it's difficult to grow your own dino because it's already ruled by huge-growth players.
- Graphic fidelity has some pretty moments (their recently reworked ocean is gorgeous), but overall it doesn't look as ""realistic"" as other games on the dino market. Not necessarily a bad thing, and it doesn't look terrible (just a little goofy sometimes), but it matters to some who might be seeking a more realistic experience.
- Combat can be simplistic at times. I think it's definitely better than some others on the market -- knockback and injury definitely help to vary combat experiences -- but ultimately, it still sometimes just comes down to a bigger thing biting a smaller thing.
- Relatively small maps. The two available maps are fine, but somewhat limited. This is somewhat good because you're always able to find players, but also somewhat limits where you can stake out your habitat. There is another map in development, however!

Overall, I would still recommend Beasts of Bermuda -- many of its ""cons"" can be coped with or can be alleviated by playing some more small, fun, faster-growing dinosaurs, and I still have a lot of fun playing the game. I really admire its well-developed systems and the relative flexibility that the game offers. The developers seem very kind and like they earnestly want to create a fun experience, and put a lot of obvious love into the development of its systems and gameplay.",1609720493,1609720589,True,5,0,0.516537010669708252,0,True,False,True

This game includes amazing mechanics from extreme floods and tornadoes to bleed damage and comfort. There are many good servers to play on that will suit anyone’s tastes, from chill servers to realism! One of my favourite aspects of Beasts of Bermuda is the way the developers favour game-play over the quality at the time of writing this. Although a few people might see this as a downside, the developers have more time to focus on game-play mechanics instead of pesky little details in the quality of the game. 

The developers of Beasts of Bermuda have offered a variety of dinosaurs, from terrestrial to aquatic and aerial! The game also has plenty of dinosaurs for each diet (those being carnivore, herbivore and piscivore). Along with these dinosaurs, the skin system allows the player to choose from a plethora of skins depending on which one you'd like. Endless colour possibilities are also available; pink, blue, red, green, any colour you think looks good on your dinosaur! Sex choices are useful for if you would like your dinosaur to be female or male, but if you're not sure there is also a randomise button! 

Game-play is enjoyable if you find the right servers, but a lot of the communities are toxic and I see this as a bad downside (Will get to this in a moment). AFKing is also a large problem, but the developers are finding ways to try and lower the amount of people AFK growing. You start out as a tiny, baby dinosaur spawned in one of the random spawn locations on the map and search for food and water, and over time you get bigger. You're able to group up with your own kind and own diet (latter for herbivores only) to hunt down prey and to survive easier. It's a kill or be killed world in most servers, fight for your life using Combat talents, escape your enemies using Speed talents, and hide away from the predators looking for a meal using the Survival talents. Many mechanics aid in the fun game-play style Beasts of Bermuda has to offer. Beasts of Bermuda's quality may not be the best and for lower-end PCs/laptops you won't be able to set all the settings onto cinematic, but the developers are working on game-play over in-game quality at this point in time. The modellers are also working hard to make the dinosaur models as realistic and pristine as they can and any old models are planning to be remade in the future. 

Toxicity levels: High. Most servers have some toxic and salty people (I say this from experience). I am not calling out any servers nor suggesting which ones are best, because it's up to the player which server you'd like to play in. Lower-population servers are normally better than this but it's a lot more fun to play on a populated server where there are more challenges to survive.

There are various maps, a new one being worked on that's huge, but for now the main ones are Ancestral Plains and Rival Shores.
Ancestral Plains is the oldest of the two but it is still a good map, sporting waterfalls, huge ancient bridges, swamps and towering mountains.
Rival Shores is the newest and has four different terrain/areas: Forest (a waterfall is in this and it's linked to Desert, the middle island and Jungle), Snowy Mountain (A huge mountain connected to Forest that has a river with a waterfall at the start and a hot springs on top), Jungle (Huge wetlands area in the centre that's basically a swamp, surrounded by ginormous trees and a mountain with a huge cave that Apatosaurs can fit inside) and Desert (A mostly plain but pretty area covered in sand and cacti. An oasis is near the centre of this island and there's a mountain with another water source and a portal that takes you to a cave in Jungle).

As for my personal experience in Beasts of Bermuda, I've had the game since the 25th of December, 2018 (I believe around 2 or 3 days after the official release?) and at first I loved the game. I tried to grow big dinosaurs and always got hunted because I wasn't very skilled at fighting at this point, which is why I suggest starting out as a flyer or a smaller dinosaur such as Megalosaurus or Parasaurolophus. 
After a big fight with some rexes and an overall terrible admin group in a server that I think is now defunct, I stopped playing the game for around 6 months but came back (hence why I only have around 2000 hours and not more). 
I found a nice semi-realism server and stayed there until drama happened and I left the server. I took another big break from the game and came back on to play on a basically rule-less server, but as you probably guessed, more drama. So I went to the official servers as a last resort. Again! More drama. Moved away from that server and found a chill server that I am still playing on today. It's all personal choice in which server you will call home, sometimes it just takes a while to find like it did for me.
Having high population on servers causes lag and makes it a bit harder to play, so I recommend turning off Shadows in the settings to reduce this (shadows are a big source of lag).
Fighting is one-sided if you're alone but if you have skill you will be able to take down larger dinosaurs. Combat can go for a long time or a short time, depending on who you're up against and how many they are. For example, I was a 1.2 speed/combat tree Rex and 3 1.2+ Megalos found me, which they were either Speed or Combat, I can't remember. Anyway, the fight went on for a bit and I died. This would have been different if I was more skilled, but just be cautious around any other species of dinosaurs. In fact, don't even trust your own species if you're a carnivore. 
Growing for bigger dinosaurs is slow and painful once you get past a certain growth - for Apatos which are the slowest growth dinosaur ingame at the time of reviewing this, growth gets painful after 1.2. Which is why people AFK grow. Apatosaurs can live for about an hour with food and water and they'll only go down to half, but I do NOT in any way shape or form suggest AFK growing. Not only could you get killed by another dinosaur, flood, or bad weather, it ruins the fun of the game and isn't very supported in this sort of survival game where you're meant to be looking out for predators and moving around. 
I find the game to be most fun when you're in a voice chat/playing with friends you know either IRL or online, this adds to the friendship side of the game (grouping up with other dinosaurs of your species).

Let's compare the Pros and Cons of this game (Some I haven't brought up):
Pros:
- Customisation is good
- Different maps allow aerial, land, and sea creatures to interact
- Lots of possibilities with talents
- Dinosaurs have special abilities 
- Mix skins when nesting
- Comfort mechanics

Cons:
- Balance is kinda bad
- Toxic communities (Note that it's not the devs' fault for this, it's the community's fault)
- Stability in servers and in-game is good right now, but may change in the future
- Devs removing/changing commands/talents/etc. (Refunds for talents don't exist)
- Overpowered dinosaurs, especially big ones
- Can't avoid tornadoes if you don't have shelter or if you're not an apato or a huge dinosaur
- Lag in populated servers + lag with high quality settings on lower-end PCs
- Really old bugs that devs haven't fixed 

All in all, the game has its ups and downs. If I could put a ""maybe"" for the review I would, but I have put it as recommended in hopes for the game's future, which could be good or bad depending on the decisions the developers make.",1608193649,1608426687,True,19,1,0.687068164348602295,2,True,False,True

The Clans and Community: 
Despite some of the mechanics and the non-polished maps, the community is garbage. And I mean this in the worse way possible. Clans infest every server and basically run it. I know every game like this, usually has a handful of clans. But this is one a whole other level. 
They feed each other their dinos, use the mechanics to their advantage to grow to ridiculous sizes basically cheesing it out and then going on murder sprees unchallenged, (I disagree with the growth mechanic in this game whole-heartedly. But I'll get to that), are usually friends with the devs/admins of servers and even the game devs as I'm told, so they get away with everything (and also cash cows for some servers too) and they will WIPE OUT entire servers just because they don't like people in certain caves or areas :/ No matter what. You deal with clans taking over servers and then leaving when people go to other servers because of them. And so the cycle continues. Its super annoying. And as usual, they're toxic and act like children. 
And the people are just as toxic. They will follow you around lowering your comfort to kill you. And yes. Thats a feature. If you become too uncomfortable, you die. For example, a young rex will die when a larger herbie is sitting near by. Not doing anything. Just sitting. And people use that as a way to kill you without needing to fight or get close to you. The range on it can be stupid big. People come back as other dinos just to annoy you or cause discomfort, steal food etc. Fair fights over food or defense will usual involve the same dead person coming back as something bigger or just another fresh spawn to cause trouble.

The growing mechanics: 
I understand everyone wants to be a massive, powerful dinosaur. But the balance in this game does not exist in the slightest. Even when you're a giant apato, and I mean you've put weeks into one dino, a young rex pack and can easily wipe you AND your family of giants out. No problem. Players say its ""because people are bad at this game"". No. For real. The growth sizes are stupidly unnecessary. I feel like its more for a selling point than for fun game play or a general mechanic. Just something to plaster on their advertisement so it looks cool. It is interesting to become a big creature, but there's really no reward to it because there will always be a clan or one ridiculously traited player that will wipe out your gigantic dino. I've been killed as a big acro by a ptera because he dived from the sky and had a +3 piercing beak trait. Which adds damage with how fast you're going. And they're classed as SCAVENGERS. 

Other small notes: 
- Theres no night vision. I literally cannot see sometimes during storms or night-time. People use gamma, an obvious way around it, but I still class that as cheating. 
- The comfort mechanic is murderous. I like that you do become uncomfortable, but not to the part that you die from an apato walking past you. Or you don't have enough shelter from a rain-storm. If it was changed so it halted your growth, or made your food and water go down quicker, something like that, I'd understand. But not outright kill the dino. 
- The map is very... buggy and seems unfinished. There's alot of slopes that look like you can go up, and you do walk up it, but it gets to a point where there's an invisible wall or you start to slide. You die from fall damage in this game, so most mountainous areas you need to avoid unless there's distinct paths. Because even the slightest curve in a hill can be your downfall. 
- Aquatics have a trait that can make them invisible. And I mean INVISIBLE. And if they angle their camera so it looks through the creature, the murkiness of the water disappears and they can see everything. As if theirs no water whatsoever. This only works with the invisible trait and I found this out after being killed by clans multiple times and they finally told me how they found me in the murky ocean when I'm so far away from them. I thought it was cheating but most servers literally do not care. 
- Rexes are ridiculously overpowered and are the same growth times as classified mid-tier carnivores. Its clique to see a rex being overused because its cheese, but this adds a whole new level when you can reach adulthood very easily and get a damage boost upon reaching adulthood.

Things that are generally interesting about the game: 
I am giving this game a large dump of a review, but there are some cool things that I do like. 
- There are storms that raise the sea level and you have to climb to high ground or log off to survive it. It gives aquatics free reign over the map and its a terrifying experience. The water sources can run dry from long use or lack of rain. 
- Aerial combat is a little janky right now, but it is alot of fun to just dive bomb and snap at passing players. 
- The nesting and skin-genetics mechanics are pretty cool. Your parents colours and some traits can be passed on to you. 

This game needs a lot of work, and I disagree with a lot of its mechanics. But I got it on a christmas sale for cheap and its got dinosaurs in it. I'd wait a little bit till they polish it up and get a new map. But try it for yourself if it interests you.

More effort put into making the Store page screenshots look good than the actual gameplay good, only difference being everyone is usually bright pink due to custom skins.

This game is your jack of all trades, does everything, but does nothing well. 
If you wanna fly around or swim about or stomp some trees over, go for it. But the movement feels basic, no real weight, like a game made back in the 2000's, nothing feels grounded so to speak. 
All the feature feel bland and slightly rushed. So if that's your thing, by all means go for it. But honestly It feels shallow, like an ocean with no fish or a pond with no ducks.

This game could be great if it wasn't so base level. they think of a feature and add it at it's most basic level, then move on. At least that's what it feels like. Maybe they plan to make everything more detailed but as of now it feels like a tech demo without the tech and it isn't a demo. 

""Beasts of Bermuda is a multiplayer game hosting large servers in which the player grows up as a dinosaur or other prehistoric creature. The player becomes part of a living, player-created ecosystem. The ultimate objective is to survive on one of the islands within Bermuda.""

There's only really one gameplay loop: eat, grow, repeat.
Given food spawns for all creatures around the map there's no need to kill anyone unless you're the type that gets their rocks off of wasting other peoples time.

Beasts of Bermuda is a game that could be considered not for everyone as it is a heavily PvP oriented survival game (server depended) with prehistoric animals specifically dinosaurs.

You take the role of becoming a dinosaur of your choice, (I won't spoil the rooster of playable animals) You grow from a baby to adult, you eat and drink as it is expected ofc, but the real kicker here is that the enviroment itself plays a role on how your animal does throughout its life. 

The terrain itself around the map, trees, rocks and the like, provide shelter bonuses when you're close to them protecting you from harsh weather which is a amazing trait I have not seen anywhere else. (won't spoil weather stuff it's amazing)

The game is hardcore, Hiding is very hard, Each creature leaves a scent trail that is detectable almost by everyone that sniffs around so it takes a little bit of map awareness and memorization to learn how to hide where and when. Playing with friends is highly recommended, as growing together is safer allows you to grow bigger than others and you can practically dominate.

The devs are very active both in the community (Discord) and development wise. So, if you wanna be a tiny Velo that pecks a T rex on the ankle this is your game",1606464489,1606464489,True,0,1,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True

It has full customisable options to both let people express themselves or camouflage into their habitat for more realistic game play. The game is constantly having update patches, increasing the playable dinos, making patches and continuously growing. There is an official Discord where the staff team is dedicated to making everyone's game time the best it can be and keep all rules enforced to the best of their ability.
The game is pretty and currently progressing into something gorgeous with ever increasing designs, graphics and models.
The game is amazing for making friends and having a great time with them.
Bare in mind this is a PvP game - expect to fight for your life as a herbivore, fight for your food and land as a carnivore, drag in and fight meals in the sea as an aquatic and pick your moments as a flyer.
Playing in a group is great, you're safe in numbers - play solo to stealth your way for food.

This is an amazing all around game, be silly and charge in, spend points becoming a large fighter. The choice is yours.
There are many servers to play on, some even suiting to those who don't want to fight at all and just want to grow and chill with friends. There are servers with more rules for a more realistic game play and servers with barely any to have fun in, few have none at all and you can just have fun.

While there are some fun moments to be had with this multiplayer survival game, there are glaring issues that overshadow those moments.

A normal player experience is to login to a server, be scouted by a clan using fliers, and then bum rushed and killed, assuming you can even get away from a spawn point to begin with. This is not server specific, as it seems to happen on nearly every server.

The game balance is laughable at best in it's current state, with player characters taking upwards of 12 hours to reach full maturity only to be lost in a 1 second fight. One can expect invest hundreds of hours into a character, only to lose it in a scenario with zero counter play and be left with nothing. When you die, no matter how many thousands of hours you have invested, everything is lost.

Community wise, it has become extremely toxic. Every server is plagued with either clans that prevent anyone outside of them from playing or extremely restrictive rules or both. 

The official servers in particular are plagued with toxicity. With a rule breaking clan not only facing no consequences, but also being composed of members of the mod and QA teams in many cases, enforcing rules only when it is advantageous to their clan. 

The community servers are not any better, with clans and mod favorites and metagaming around rules all around.

It is unfortunate that a game with such potential is rendered practically unplayable by the community, balance, and glaring mechanical issues.

The problem with the flyers is the players themselves, I've never gotten much beyond 1.00 with out being attacked by gangs of other players, maybe they should use rules like the Isle does (the players on the Isle are the best) I've never witnessed such a terrible playing etiquette in my life. For me the game has been waste of time, I was looking for something a little more realistic but I wont find it on Beasts of Bermuda, it's too bad because the game could have a lot of potential.

For the length of time it's been available in Early Access, they have made great strides and has become (in my opinion) the leader in dinosaur survival games.  Updates are quick and often, and patches to fix new content in terms of balancing is usually out within days.  Updates are not just one good improvement or one new feature spaced out months in between each other, but are often packaged together, such as the last update with massive ocean improvements and a new dinosaur to play.

While other games in this genre used to boast a graphical edge, the last update brings Beasts of Bermuda into competitive range of truly being the best game to play in each category.  No more waiting two months for a skill of one dinosaur to be ""working as intended"".  In that time you'll get 3 dinosaur updates / remodels, 2 new dinosaurs, numerous balancing & bug patches, and improved graphics for the entire ocean / tides / weather effects.

Then there's the game play.  So much more is offered to a player, such that dinos of the same species can have remarkably different skillsets, never mind the huge skin patterns and colors one can play with in creating your perfect (if not a little silly) dinosaur, which never stops growing.  And at the peak, Beasts utilizes the Z axis in player movement, whether it's aquatic reptiles living in the ocean or pteras flying in the skies, while the tide can reach any depth in drought or completely wash out land in an extinction flood.  Whether it's the open ocean, it's depth, flying too high, or a lightning strike or being thrown by a tornado, there are many challenges than just hungry dinos.

This game has a few preferable aspects, as, it's more welcoming to people who are newer to this type of games, a better character editor (although I feel like the amount of options you get is a little much), and a much better, more interactive environment. Such as-weather implications, caves, water creatures and fish (you also get a skill tree, unlike other dino games I've played) . Although, this game is QUITE buggy, and the people can be pretty toxic. 
I came to change my review because I have grown bored of The Isle whilst waiting for the recode to continue (and right now the recode is actually pretty decent, for what it is and how it's still very early on in development)
In summary this game is-alright. But, I do feel as if I wasted my money. Growth is very hard for me to keep track of, and again, it's a very buggy game. The Isle may be difficult for new players, but is much more worth the money for what it is. 
Although, if this game fixes it's buggy maps, and a few of their game systematics then...it may just take the lead.

The skill point and inheratance system means each dino you grow will be different this makes it so if you do loose a dinosaur growing another one is still a fun experience.

Another thing which is a major positive in my eyes is its relativly fast to grow your dinosaur to adulthood depending on the creature you choose but once you get to adult size you still keep growing just at a much slower rate this keeps a constant sense of progression which means you never really feel like your wasting time.

Breeding also can pass on inheritence which creates a deeper more fleshed out breeding process.

There are updates to this game coming out consistly which just keeps improving the experience.

-Things i think need some work still
More underwater creatures, currently we only have 3 with 2 semi aquatics more semi aquatics or full aquatics should hopefully improve this my recommendation as well would be to have server slots for aquatics and slots for lands so it doesnt become unbalanced

You can make friends quite easily and they help you alot with growing and surviving, their are so many things to do, such as choosing talents, hunting for food, customising your dino to look exotic and beautifull or to blend in with nature, darting the seas as an itchy, escaping from massive apexes, mating, exploring the map and my favourite thing is that there are slots for each dino, meaning you can play different dino if you get bored of growing one! This is especially good when you lose a dino that you worked ages on, if you grew the same dino on another slot it would be like nothing happened. There are some negatives such as the graphics which IMO isn't too much of a worry, I personally don't mind it, infact it brings color and brings the game alive, if you don't  like the idea of bright colorfull pink dinos, there is always an option in settings to dim it out.

I would suggest looking at other games like Path of Titans or The Isle. Way better graphics, mechanics, systems, and overall content/gameplay. Not to mention how incompetent Beasts of Bermuda developers are at running such a game. They lack so many necessary quality traits needed to run a game like this. Very unprofessional, bias, irresponsible, uncoordinated and so much more. It's unbelievable to me how upsetting it is to see a team like this in which I thought had a good cause be so deceitful. I mean I guess the truth comes out eventually... Beasts of Bermuda officials CONDONE ACTS OF HARASSMENT TOWARDS MINORS!! Like really?! They allow this type of behavior to be displayed within their community? It's outrageous!! The fact that they allow this behavior has caused me and a large portion of friends to stop playing this game all together. Totally caught me off guard to see that they are willing to let someone who is well above the adult age that harasses minors to represent Beasts of Bermuda's community. Totally changed my whole vision of the game and the future it had. I enjoyed it for what it was and the progress they were making with such a small team until their true thoughts and intentions were shown. I do not want to be part of a community where the official staff not only allow but CONDONE this type of behavior. Beasts of Bermuda has lost my interest as well as many others. I do hope changes are going to be made because if not, this will severely damage the structural integrity of the game and next thing you know we are yelling Jenga....

then i played as a Mosasaurus, spent a good time exploring, found an Elamosaurus which got beached, then i beached myself and the Elasmo nibbed me, leaving me almost death, then i found a shaol of other mosas, they weren't friendly and with that, my mosa died.
then I tried with a Pteranodon, i learned how to flyer other the skies, but alas, my ptera got stressed, scared and started to lose health, then i died again.

This is the most absolutely frustratingly boring game I have played if you are just coming into it and do not belong to a group of veterans that can protect you, I will explain.
I have played a lot of The Isle and PoT before and because I really like dinosaur games I thought I would give this a try as well.  At surface level it has a lot more to offer than the previous games because you can play aquatic and flying dinosaurs, theres some cool skill level up mechanics and stuff that look like an mmo, but ironically that is exatly what brakes the game. It has this mega stupid growth system in which you grow indefinately, which sounds fun, but is horrible in practice. 
So this is the experience you have when you start the game: you create your happy dinosaur, you go out there to have fun, BOOM, instantly killed, so ok, that might have been a fluke, so you go and make a new one, BOOM, flying creatures swoop in out of nowhere, youre dead. You make a new one, you try to drink water for the first time, BOOM, youre grabbed by a sea creature that kills you in one bite. After a couple more tries you try to group with random people just to delay the inevitable, you and your group can be all killed by one guy who has afk grown to be 6 times your sizes. So after that, you try to afk grow as well, you hide behind a rock for 5 hours just to be a little big enough you think you might be able to fight off stuff. You are wrong, you die super fast as well. And every single time you have to create a completely new one and start over that process.
This is the broken thing that makes it unbearable, in games like the isle you can afk grow to become an adult, but once you do that its fair game, everyone is the same in the sense that they know how strong X dinosaur can be or not be. In BoB, not only things will always be bigger than you unless you grow for weeks and become the biggest in your server (which happens btw and if that person is an asshole he will bully every other of his species into being unable to play by killing everything they see, like a douche in the sea of Isla Nublar server), but there are also random chances of getting better perks/skills and whatnot, which again would maybe be cool if you wouldnt just instantly die to bigger stuff than you. 
So these are your choices when you play it:
a) hide under a rock for a couple of weeks while you go do other stuff,
b) find other big friends/people in game that can protect you until you grow, while you hide under a rock for weeks while you go do other stuff,
c)have a pool of dead creatures that never grow past 1.0 in this shit system.

If you are not already playing this, go play The Isle, it looks better and you will actually be able to play instead of just standing there afk. If this was the intention of the game creators on how the game was supposed to be played, seems like its the worst game design i have ever had the not pleasure of witnessing.",1602498727,1602498727,False,3,0,0.436597108840942383,0,True,False,True

- mixed feelings on the community
- confusing overall vision/goals
- mixed feelings on development team
- mixed feelings on mechanics

COMMUNITY
I will immediately premise that I have met and keep meeting extraordinary people while playing this game, but I'd like to also point out that it feels like the exception. Usually, the community experience is mostly toxic and intimidating, sort of a ""high-tension disrespectful PvP"".
I blame mostly the game mechanisms that tend to allow or outright encourage this behaviour. But I also notice dysfunctional attitudes from admins and devs towards the toxic behaviour that I feel only increases the cycle rather than break it. 

VISION/GOALS
So what am I really supposed to do in this game? I get that feeling - from just mechanics alone - that I should get as big and strong as I can then go kill anything I see on sight, get points for it, and keep travelling killing everything I see to keep getting more points, oh and make super babies to help me kill more things and get more points.
What is the vision for this game? Is this a 'Battle-Royale' with dinosaurs? If so then there are WAY too many mechanics in place and things to do, and it's confusing. Is it supposed to be a realistic yet accessible life cycle simulation? Then why is there so much focus on PvP and not on the cycle of life a.k.a. reproduction? I meet so many other players that constantly worry about killing other stuff to get bigger, stronger, get more points. That feels more like training us to be bullies than get the life cycle going...

DEVS
I remember from the QnA's answers like ""we want to make it for the realism servers"" and such, but then realism servers need to put in place 10,000 rules to keep people from just killing for points, which is one of the goals in the game. You had and keep having great ideas but I see them being wasted with poor vision and care and it comes across to me as confusing and disorganised and overall uncaring and dispassionate attitude towards your baby. I have started losing trust... I only wanna burrow minecraft-style, now, I don't care anymore for the rest.

GAME MECHANISMS
This is a very hard topic for me because I absolutely love the mechanics in this game. They are clever and varied and offer a lot of leeway for gameplay. I am a dev too and I can appreciate good ideas when I see them and I must admit I love how you implemented the comfort/stress mechanics to influence the creature's overall health and performance. It could be improved and expanded but it already does a great job so I am very happy about that. The talents I am not too happy about, I feel like it's a dysfunctional way of implementing a skill progression system, I noticed that it tends to promote toxic PvP competition and an obsessive compulsion to ""get better"" to the point of respawning a nested creature at 1.2 growth for the sake of that infamous -1 inherit or the lack of glorious +2 inherits. That is a silly reason to waste a life that maybe your parents have cared for, and that maybe have also gifted you with exciting experiences and memories.
I'd like to see the skill tree reworked to focus on ""actual learned skills"" rather than genetic traits. Traits aren't learned, they are inherent to your DNA, you don't collect them with time, you have them from birth, and they are neither good nor bad, neither a minus nor a plus, they are simply traits that can turn out to be useful or disastrous depending on the situation. Have that for skins and physique and maybe natural attitude towards a particular performance, eg. a baby that has a mutation that makes them more akin to an atheltic physique and to learn stamina-related skills.
PVP in its current form is toxic, full stop. Yes, there will always be bullies but the mechanics encourage bullies to be bullies which is just outrageous. Don't go complain if your community is toxic and needs a strict ban policy: you created this monster.

My suggestions?
- REMOVE the awarding of points for killing stuff. 
Game mode 'Life cycle' should be focused on keeping the cycle going. Award points for reproduction. Give bonus points when children make children of their own. Give even more points if those children make more children. And so on. Keep the bonus multiplier going so that the most prolific parents are rewarded for surviving to care for their kids, and their kids encouraged to grow to make more kids.
When your goal is to make kids you NATURALLY want to protect them, go out in the world to gather food for them, and in turn, you will FIGHT and KILL anything that threatens them, or - for predators - hunt and kill prey to feed your kids and yourself. Killing needs to be a challenge and a cost and risk, not a casual fun activity. This way, when you actually kill something, you do it for a HONOURABLE reason which is ensure your kids' survival, no toxicity involved, and the challenge makes it so much more rewarding than some useless points. The points will come from having your kids grow safely and in numbers. I assure you this attitude would totally reduce the amount of KOS/KFS and general toxicity down to more managable levels.

- Make killing stuff a CHALLENGE not a goal
If the main goal is to raise kids and keep the family tree going, remove the goal of going around the map to kill stuff as it is redundant as I explained above. Instead, make killing stuff even more challenging by expanding on stamina cost: turn Ability into 'Fatigue' and make is much slower. Stamina for immediate actions like sprint/jump/abilities, and Fatigue for continuous stamina use. eg. You are fully rested and u sprint to water, stamina down to 20%, fatigue down to 90%. You drink while catch your breath - stamina back up to 100%, fatigue no change. Someone attacks you, you defend, stamina down to 0%, fatigue down to 80%. You succesffully fend off attack but take extra fatigue cost for being super out of breath  - stamina 0% fatigue 60%. You catch your breath while keeping on scout for a bit - stamina up to 50%, fatigue no change. Then you sprint back halfway, stamina 0%, fatigue 50%. catch your breath stamina 50% fatigue no change. Then sprint rest of the way to den. Stamina 0% fatigue 40%. Now you sleep for the rest of the day, filled up on water and food, and while you sleep your food and water drains quicker as you regen both stamina to 100% and fatigue, slowly, also to 100%. Profit.
This is to allow for a lot more strategies, both for prey and predator and continuous inversion of roles. This also helps with reducing KOS/KFS by making predation a costly and risky challenge that will consume your energies usually more than what you get out of it. This encourages more strategy in predation, more use of varied tactics, and also encourages to value SCAVENGING a lot more, thus greatly helping realism server with body down rules etc.

- Family Tree
Life cycle means reproduction. Reproduction means family tree. ffs you have this already in the mechanics, why isnt this a thing already? it's a waste of potential as big as a skyscraper. GIVE US FAMILY TREES so we can keep track of our glorious legacies, stick with our kids, and value our relationships not only as characters but also as players. Focus on rewarding parenting behaviour a lot more because being a functional and successful parent will, in turn, encourage all other gameplays such as predation, migration, herding, and general pride for our game and what we do with it. Players want to be proud of their skins, of their inherits, of their family trees, of their legacy. Allow them to be. There is no honour in a kill list or a hall of fame that shows who's the top bully that kills everything in sight. There is a LOT of honour instead in being able to check your family tree and see your name somewhere in the middle of it, and all other names of characters before and after.

If you like dinosaur games that have a lot to offer with regular updates, don't mind some bugs that might kill you and can handle toxic players and losing a dinosaur you spent a long time growing, you should give this game a chance. If you are unsure, wait some time and once the game updates more try then. It might seem bad but this game has come a long way here, I got this game soon after launch in steam and it's a lot better now in many ways. Hope you can support the game to grow even better.

Long version:

With the lack of a good balanced review with pros and cons I made this. At the end of the review I made some ideas on how to fix some of the problems.

Pros:
+Weather system: Drought (if it doesn't rain in a long time some water sources might dry up from drinking), tornados, rain, storms and floods will keep you moving.
+Special ability: Some dinosaurs have special abilities for example megalosaurus can see stats of other players and parasaurolophus can highlight enemy players to the rest of the herd to see.
+Skill tree: Want a fast rex or strong maybe, in between? take your pick.
+Nesting: You can get the baby buff to boost your growth if you are near your babies. If you hatch from an egg and have big parents you have a better chance to get good +inherits (+ points in skill tree).
+Lot of action: Be careful there might be rexes walking behind that hill.
+Customation: You can make your creature have the colors of the rainbow, but if you don't like that you can turn filters on in the settings to have more natural colors around you.
+Burrows: Orys can make big tunnel systems with multiple entrances/exits and you can even farm food in them.
+Land, Air and Ocean: You can fly as pteranodon (tropeognathus is being worked on), walk on land as herbivore or carnivore, or swim in the oceans as mosa or other aquatic, can’t decide if you want to be on land or water there are 2 semi-aquatics you can play as.
+6 save slots: You can have up to 6 creatures in one server.
+Balance: Most of the creatures are well balanced but problems come with infinite growth.
+More creatures are being worked on
+Carry food and babies
+It’s actually FUN: There is a lot to do, play with your friends or find others in a group finder to play with you, most people are friendly and ready to help you.

For some can be Pros or Cons:
Infinite growth: I personally like this growing big and strong, but at the same time some bigger creatures will just rule the server not giving you a chance to grow big.
Not too realistic: For me a pro but not for everyone. Being able to jump to the sky as elasmo (aquatic) and pachy knocking megalo in air only for it to fall to its death and so on.
Growth: Even though not that long but some people don’t have the time to grow dinos like rexes that take time. You can play combat mode but it doesn't feel the same.
+Herbivores can mix group, some servers allow carnivores to do the same, ask admin to do it (but not fun when ptera mix packs with carnis to scout).

Cons:
- Bugs: Can be sometimes annoying, have almost drowned a few times because I was stuck.
- Not well optimised: Even with good computers can be hard to get good fps.
Toxic players: Sadly they have found their way here.
- Not enough players: Only a few servers are popular. We need more players to populate more servers so other kinds of game rules can be or not be made to please as many players as possible. (so get this game and play to fix this)
- Juveniles: They are so weak and can't do anything so many will just afk grow
- Stress from weather: Kind of realistic and gives a bit of challenge, but will often make players sit under a rock or in a cave.
- Scent: On ground level ok, but underwater it's bad. I know it's going to be redone at one point.
- Not new player friendly: Yeah
- Having to use other programs ( exmp. obs) to take a video of rule breaks in hope of getting your dino back.
- Not enough creatures to play as leaving some creatures in constant fight, for example the ocean realm with only 3 options 2 being apex and 1 that will swim and fly away from them and 2 semi-aquatic that can go on land. It's a mess.

One last Pro:
Communication between developers and players. During live streams most of the questions from viewers will be answered, some are kept secret for later. Successions on how to make something work will be heard and written down, some even implemented. Even in Discord developers sometimes talk in the chat and communicate with the players.

How to fix:
You can agree or not, there are just my ideas.

o Toxic players: ability to mute players, text they write wont show up but to avoid confusion their name will be in chat so you know who other people might be writing to.
o Revenge killing: 5-30min after being killed by someone/group not being able to kill them and them not being able to kill you when you switch to a new/existing dino.
o Scouting birds: If you play as any bird no matter the size of it there should be cooldown if you want to change it to.
o Infinite growth: More servers with cap. Maybe after a certain point the stamina pool will start to get a lot smaller so others have a chance to run away if seen far enough.
o Juveniles: More smaller creatures to kill and ai dinos. Maybe have more stamina or speed than adults being smaller and lighter. More places only they can go to hide.
o Stress from weather: Make weather resistance skill better, like when 3/3 walking outside during a growth storm would reduce comfort a lot slower so it would be easier to walk.
o New player friendliness: Make tutorial to controls, scent system and meaning of colors. Small hint for me, try combat mode servers first to see how different dinos work, read through the skill tree to see what it has (press t to open). Game mode is on the right side of the server list.
o Growth: Make it faster maybe until 1.2 growth then normal in a few servers so people who don't have all day long to grow dinos can enjoy survival mode.

In conclusion:
I personally enjoy the game and hope you would give it a change if not now then later as the game keeps getting regular updates. New map and creature models are being made and they are going to make this game look graphically a lot better so be patient and wait for it if graphics are your problem. Join the bob’s discord to keep in touch what’s coming. Meanwhile I will keep playing and watching as the game grows.

For all the people who are currently taking a break from the Isle, or even Path of titans,(i'm not saying they are bad, it's just if you want something else to play) Beasts of Bermuda is a witty and well crafted game. It features a smaller cast of dinosaurs, but it's a better pay off. There are gigantic dinosaurs such Apatosaurus, Acrocanthosaurus, and the Feared Tyrannosaurus rex. In the air, There are Pteranodon who gracefully fly through the skies, watching over the animals below them. And in the sea, giant marine reptiles have kaiju battles on a daily basis just to see tomorrow. This game is based on abilities. Each dinosaur/Pterosaur/Marine reptile has a different niche and role that ties them to the game. For example, the Apatosaurus can walk backwards to get a better shot at defending their herd. Pachycephalosaurus have great speed to ram into foes. And Ichthyovenator can swim as if it was a large dolphin.Along with that, You can unlock talents and invest in a certain build. You can become an absolute juggernaut in the combat tree, become fast and agile in the speeed tree, or become resourceful in the survival tree. Another feature of the game is MAJOR customization and breeding. Breeding has a lot of benefits. It gives the parent players ""baby buffs"" and gives the baby inherits. These inherits are additional points on the Talent tree. But be careful, sometimes they have negative effects. I'd absolutely 100% recommend this game. It may have a few flaws here and there, but the constant connection between the devs and the players can help with that over time.

Para can be two tapped easily no matter what growth its at. 
Pachy will nearly die if it takes a fall even a pixel higher than its jump height.  And it's supposed to run and fight like that.....yeah....
Also, apato plays like it's a trolling dino on the part of the developers. It moves like a sloth and it's mainly defenseless solo until 2.0.  It's also the main target of any and all overgrown preds.  You get to enjoy watching all the time you invested get  destroyed because preds can tank your tail, and you'll never land a stomp without talents.  
Herbis can be necrobombed because they can't move gore from their herding spots so carnis can just be cunts and leave drumsticks where they sleep. 
Acros can basically laugh damage off thanks to their broken healing, cut large distances faster than any herbi, and they can debuff you.

When the graphics are this subpar and a  3900 and GTX 2070 get 20-30 fps during gameplay it's simply sad. Note that is on MAX settings but their is no excuse for it being that bad. On the game's basic mechanics work as well as you could expect from an early access. One big note for a game like this is that you actually get skill points so you can customize your dino. For example you can customize a pteranodon to be either a baby snatcher, a water diving bird who hunts for fish or even a baby snatcher. Which I will admit is a ton of fun.Something cool is that your dino can also get stressed from being near other dinos not your species this keeps you from ""carebearing"" other species and make it feel more realistic. You get four main types of dinos to play withFlyer-A pteranodon or glorified vulture, you steal eggs or scavenge dead bodies. Aqua-You get to play multiple types of aqua creatures, swim around and eat AI fish and try not to get nomed by other players. Mosasourus is the main thing here. Carnivore-Land based, like T-Rex or Raptor. Herbivore-Land based herbis, apatosaurus, parasaurolophus and a few more. The Community- If you have been reading reviews i'm sure you seen this complaint before, but this community is mostly cancer. And that's coming from someone who has played the isle. I've never seen so many people be this rude or hostile to new players. Ask for help? Get told of and called an idiot for not knowing basic mechanics, because of course this game doesn't have tutorials so you are forced too ask. One thing that is odd here is how much other players attack their own species even as adults, most other dino games while this does happen, most communities bring people in so they have more friends to play with, not here. If you are looking for a dino game give this one a pass for now, look into Path of Titans it's making fast progress and could be something to sate your dream of being a dino.

Don't get me wrong; I love this game. But new players are at a huge disadvantage, especially when attempting to join a more active server. Younger dinosaurs are smaller, weaker, and often times much slower than older dinosaurs, and those bigger dinos are often grouped together which makes trying to counter them much more difficult. 

There's no incentive for players to leave young dinos alone. In fact, I could argue that it is even encouraged to hunt down young dinos, as engaging in any sort of combat gives players an adrenaline bonus and hunt points, even when the young dino is too small to leave behind any food.

There is very little player interaction outside of your own group (granted that you're in one). The chat box and your various calls serve as the only practical, non-violent forms of engagement between ungrouped dinos. This leaves little opportunity for empathy to be formed with other players, and that leads to some horrible toxicity within the community.

I've seen one of my favorite servers completely die out due to a small group of players who have grown Megs to an insanely large size, and they were able to slaughter countless other dinos without any repercussions, many of whom were far younger and offered little to no food.

As cool as this game is, it largely favors long time players over new players, to the point that it's a detriment to new players wanting to get into the game. Since younger dinos can't feasibly defend themselves against older dinos (who are encouraged to hunt them), this game can become super frustrating. Older dinos should be given incentives to leave younger dinos alone, so everyone has a more fair chance to play.",1599017023,1599017023,False,8,1,0.587524712085723877,0,True,False,True

It's similar in some ways to other survival sims of its type; you have the usual food, water, stamina management, and dinosaur growth from youth to adult (and beyond, as in the case of Beasts of Bermuda).  This game complicates issues by throwing a few curve balls such as having to manage your animals stress, feed it a proper diet, and shelter it when appropriate.  On several occasions, flash floods and storms have sent me scrambling for cover, or fleeing from caves I thought would give good shelter when they, too, flood.  On the whole, surviving is a pretty tense and engaging experience.

The variety of animal you can play also helps to make the experience more varied than the usual fare; you can live as a purely aquatic creature and rule the oceans, weaving through hidden caverns underground to reach and prey upon unsuspecting thirsty animals.  Or you can be a beastie of the sky; flying is particularly satisfying.

Among the current selection of dinosaur survival games, this one'd definitely be my top pick.  It has some issues and some bugs, but overall it's a lot of fun.  Definitely worth picking up.",1598814385,1598814385,True,1,0,0.519230782985687256,0,True,False,True

In this game you never truly stop growing. So there is really no way to stand your ground against a no-lifer than to no-life the game yourself.

Standard causal gamers can never compete with this and it just sucks you in hoping you can “one day be huge too” but you can’t unless you’re willing to play 10+ hours a day most of which will be growing while hidden afk hoping the huge 1000+ hour players don’t find you.

Firstly, straight to the point - I have 700+ hours logged in The Isle, and I was curious if this game would be able to hold my attention. It definitely can, and the different systems that the game employs are wonderfully varied yet still balanced enough for a fun experience, even as this game is still in early access. I'm not sure I could go back to The Isle again without missing the multitude of customization options and features that BoB offers, as well as BoB's amazing PvE which includes surviving thunderstorms, massive floods, wind and rain. 

It's the little things in BoB that makes the game more than the sum of its parts for me: 

- It's the fact that there's so many abilities depending on the dino you play, as well as the talent-system and the talents you choose. The talent-system is upgrades done right - they're stat-buffs, but also new abilities that you can employ in game, and there's real and meaningful strategizing involved in choosing your talents, as they roll in slower once you reach a certain growth.

- It's the fact that the game detects when you're inside or outside of cover, and by how much. This sounds insignificant, but it offers a lot of change to how you'd normally play a game like this. It's the difference between being safe or at risk from the elements (as well as other dinosaurs), and it's a wonderful boon of exploring the map to find caves, nooks and crannies that offer this protection, and learning how to move between them as needed.

- It's the comfort system, which is an amazing system and an ingenious addition to the survival sim genre. Your main goal is to keep your dinosaur comfortable, and every choice you make in the game affects how stressed or comforted your dinosaur is. You'll have to choose between losing comfort by searching for food in a storm, or wait out the storm at the risk of starving. You'll have to choose whether to stay hidden from potential danger or lose comfort to being close to other dinosaurs that stress out your dino. Likewise, you can gain comfort from being near friends and family, eating certain foods and staying safe and dry. The comfort system is wonderful in that it doesn't prohibit you from doing anything you want - it just adds consequence to your choices over time.

- It's the way nesting works, with stress levels affecting the egg and subsequently the talents of the hatched player, in both good and bad ways, and how having the right talents goes a long way to hatching strong offspring, making coupling up that much more interesting and meaningful. 

- It's the way that you can fly, climb and swim, all which drastically change the way the game is played, the things you experience, and the places you can go. These game modes are work in progress and thus not without glitches, but overall I'd say they work surprisingly well, and I've yet to find anything to deter me from the fun I'm having climbing around as a velo, gliding for speed as a ptera and exploring underwater caves as a mosa.

- it's the way all these little mechanics work together, not just as they are, but with their inherent possibilities for the future of this game. Already I'm looking forward to the implementation of even more weather events, such as droughts, and the addition of even more dinosaurs. This may be the single most important aspect of any EA title - it's potential towards becoming a full game. And I see plenty of this potential in BoB.


Of course the game isn't perfect. The following points are things that don't take away from me having fun with the game, but are things I hope to see improved and which are good to know when deciding whether to get this game:

I've yet to test if skin customization on nested dinosaurs is still buggy, but all of it is workable.

- The sound design. It's workable, but there's definite room for improvement. Players in The Isle seem more keen on using their calls to communicate, and I believe it's because these calls are more to the point and of higher quality - it makes sense to use them as a shorthand. As an example, I'll compare the Utah friendly call in the Isle with the Velo friendly call in BoB. The utah friendly call is short, well-made and gets the point across. The Velo friendly call is a 3-4 second animation involving several sounds which, while cute and interesting, isn't all that good as a shorthand. The use of calls brings life to the game world, and it would be wonderful to hear more of the dinosaurs in BoB. Same goes for the ambient and effect sounds in BoB which could be more immersive, as many of them still feel rather 'stock'.

I could go further into describing the different talents, the aesthetic character customization (limitless colors and so many skins to choose from to each dinosaur), the food system and how the freshness of food plays a role...but I'll leave it at this, and let you all go on to discover these things for yourselves.

Addition: I've seen several people say that the general, colorful aesthetics turn them off the game, and in some cases makes it look like a kids game. To the first point I say, it's a matter of personal taste, and no, this game does NOT look like your realistic dino sim. In that regard it plays better if you think of it as a fantasy game with dinosaurs. To the second point, I'm a full grown adult and I've played this game with many other full grown adults. I don't get the impression that the game is played mainly by kids, more that it's a game for pretty much everyone. Plus some dinosaurs are surprisingly challenging to keep alive. If you need your realistic dinosaur sim fix as well, I'd say play this game and Path of Titans, and get the best of both worlds. :)

If you're looking for a fun survival sim where your choices matter, you're rewarded for exploring and you're offered a LOT of different ways of playing the game and interacting with the world, I give this game a very high recommendation.",1565284965,1597393037,True,24,0,0.719008803367614746,0,True,False,True

Things such as weather, talents, inherits, and abilities make's BoB's game play exciting and replayable. Although I would recommend this game, it does have it's flaws and it is up to the player if they want to invest in it in it's current state. 

PROS:

- Fun to play with friends (playing alone is still fun and viable)
- Insane level of skin customization
- Infinite growth (PRO and CON): Your dinosaur does not stop growing and this can be a great challenge to see how big you can grow. If you get lucky and reach big sizes you get very powerful and it is very rewarding to be that strong. Anything smaller than you is usually not a threat and when you are big, almost nothing can kill you. However, as you grow so does your hunger/thirst and this provides a challenge even at high growths.
- Most dinosaurs have special abilities to make them unique from each other
- Talent tree allows you to spec into a gameplay style suited to you
- Random inherits can give you an advantage or disadvantage over other's (PRO and CON)
- Complex nesting system: having children gives a growth buff to the parents, being nested has a chance to inherit the parent's talents, skin mixing provides unique skins, incest debuff discourages incest
- Offer's marine, airborne, and terrestrial playstyles
- Weather system is unique and provides a survival challenge not yet seen in other games of the same genre

Cons:

- AFK heavy at times (although the devs are working on making the game less reliant on this)
- Bugs/Glitches that can ruin the game at sometimes, however most gamebreaking ones get fixed rather fast
- Infinite growth: If you are new to a server or just want to spawn a new dino there is a good chance that you will die over and over again to people who have grown their dinosaurs to extreme sizes. On almost every server I have played on there has been people of every species who are way bigger than anyone and can basically not be touched. If you run into them, there is a good chance you will die as their stats are better than you in every way. This can be very frustrating for new players as it really makes trying to grow anything feel impossible. 
- Inherit system: When you spawn in, you have a chance to have positive/negative inherits. In my opinion, this system is very fun to mess around with, but can be very unfair. Positive inherits can give you a very big advantage over others, while getting negative inherits can ruin your experience by giving a disadvantage. You could spend a couple hours growing something only to get a negative in a stat that your dinosaur needs. It is up to you whether you want to live with that disadvantage, or just respawn your dinosaur. 

When your dinosaur is nested, you get a chance to have a ton of positive inherits while having a low chance for negatives. This can make certain dinosaurs ""OP"" as it makes them very powerful even at low growths. A nested dinosaur is usually a lot better than a spawn as they will usually have way more inherits. 

- Balance between dinosaurs is very fragile, infinite growth causes balance issues
- Can be hard to survive alone
- Disadvantage if you are not apart of the dominant groups
- Graphics need work
- No in-game recording system, usually need an outside program to record in case of rule breaks 

Conclusion: 

Beasts of Bermuda is a game that I have gotten a lot of enjoyment out of despite it's flaws. It is worth $20 in my opinion and even though it can be frustrating, it is a fun and unique experience at the time of this review.

As an early access title there's still plenty of time and room for the developers to tweak the major weak points of the game, its pacing and user interface.

With several keys having major impact on gameplay, it would be useful if some indicator to when these have been pressed would do away with a learning curve to aspects of the game that just should not exist.

The ""6"" key turns on auto walk, useful for a game in which traversing the beautiful landscape will most likely take up the majority of your gameplay when you aren't walking.

The ""I"" key turns off group icons, leading you to lose track of your herd/pack/teammates at inopportune times and wondering if you've been booted from the group.

[strike]The ""P"" key turns on screenshot mode, which in effect makes it impossible for your character to move with any coherent direction. Some indicator in the UI would vastly help these stumbling blocks to the controls become complete non-issues.[/strike]  This UI issue has since been resolved.

Shadow quality being set to anything other than none renders aquatic gameplay impossible as tunnels become amorphous black voids on one's screen, and any reasonably coloured creature becomes impossible to trace.

The gameplay loop consists of spawning in as a juvenile dinosaur, or as an egg from a player character that has made it to adulthood. Nested spawns are more powerful on paper, but at the cost of spending a literal hour in a state that is incapable of exploring, defending itself, or surviving. To be honest, being a fresh spawn is absolutely no different. All gameplay settles into waiting for your character to grow, maintaining several resources to make said character grow faster, under the promise that eventually you'll be able to actually survive a hostile encounter with another player. This is, essentially, a matter of luck and waiting. Combat is clunky, with no feedback if you're doing it right, and the game's biggest selling point, the ""comfort"" resource, rapidly diminishes the moment this pile of coding approaches a game.

If you are looking for a game about dinosaurs fighting, keep looking. Long wait times for growth, slow movement speed,  cumbersome combat, resource management with poor reward mechanics and more ruin a gameplay concept that every person has ever fantasized about: playing a dinosaur in an open world, and getting into battles to the death with other dinosaurs.

Update as of approximately 240 hours of gameplay: After attempting to surmount this game's considerable learning curve, and seeing gameplay on more populated servers, I can say that this game improves slightly under the conditions of the server one plays on, or if you have a group that you can consistently join up with, however, balance issues pertaining to several species and the map itself keep the gameplay very static.",1591747081,1596910425,False,1,0,0.496941894292831421,0,True,False,True

The game is very fun, literally a week has gone by after purchasing and I was still discovering new features, mechanics etc. day after day. I would actually go as far as to say that it has actually impressed me and this game stands very well with it's competitors.

The only 2 bad things I would have to say about this game besides the cannibalism is, how brutal and punishing death is... Understandably you get what you pay for but I've never understood grinding 2-3-6 etc. hours of play time when on the other hand it only takes a few seconds to delete all of that progression away, it's a mechanic that almost seems like you don't want people to play your game :)

The second OP being the nesting system, if your a new player and you think like myself that you can jump in and just grow your character from the selection screen well your kinda wrong, you can do it sure but it's much smarter to get nested in because you can get powerful/helpful boost in many of your stats which of-course will rely on the stats that your nesters have. That being a major factor of this game it kinda becomes the situation where, your more powerful if you know the right people. 

However this community has one of the most respectful and open armed people I've ever seen on any game before, so even though there are no tutorials or immediate tips/tricks, the global chat is almost instinctively on any question you have, so that has had a huge impact on my experience with this game, because it's easy to meet nice people and just have a good time and in almost any case but to make it relevant, the community pretty much makes the game.

Imo BoB is the more fun game, because the survival mechanics are a bit more in depth, and there is an RPG aspect with skill trees that allows you to customize your gameplay more and gives you some end game goals to work for, where as in the Isle once you are fully gown there is not an actual inherent benefit from keeping that dinosaur alive any longer. In BoB you will continue to get stronger, and earn skill points as you age even after you are fully grown, but you also must work harder to keep yourself fed and satisfied. Though, on the official servers there is no actual growth limit, so this can cause some players to become way OP. BoB is also not as visually immersive or realistic, as the Isle. The graphics feel much more cartoony and a lot less polished. The textures, models, and animations are not as detailed and it can cause a loss of immersion, but I feel that the gameplay mechanics really outweigh this downside for me. Overall for $20 (or less if you get it on sale like me) its totally worth the buy if you like this type of game. The animal sim niche is somewhat under served and this is a really great addition to the genre, I really look forward to see where the game goes with more development.

Half the time i'm just sat in a group growing various dino's. And it gets dull, but at the same time there is something so fun about it that i keep doing it over and over. Though having a fun group to chat with makes all the difference.

Then there are times when i have died unfairly or servers have been wiped and i've hated the game for weeks.
But i always come back and i hate myself for it.

I tend to play on a few chill servers at the moment, which is both great- you won't get killed after spending several days growing. However it's also boring. Nothing to keep you on your toes, you just eat, drink. Maybe wonder around a bit and chat with everyone else. Half the time i'm barely playing the game, just afking and going on the internet. But at least my beautiful dino i spent what feels like four million hours growing shouldn't die.

On the not chill servers....... it's hit or miss. If you manage to snag an egg then your chances of survival are so much better. You'll have parents and possibly older siblings to care for you. You'll be in a nice group who'll look after you and not wondering around on your own as a baby dino that cannot protect itself against anything larger than it. If you do end up on your own, you might be okay till your bigger, especially if you do manage to find a group to take you in. But your almost as likely to find a group who'll kill you. Depends how active the server is at the time. Sometimes i've played for a while on my own, other times not.

------------

You're expected to invest time into improving your creatures skills and to breed with other players to get a lineage of animals with better skills.. But the developer has decided that having character profiles is not something this game needs, forcing its player base to make multiple steam accounts. Not only that, but upon getting your hard earned OP creature, you will end up being too scared to fight. Why would you want to die now when you've sunk in 5+ hours on this creature? Especially since you're set back to wild spawn stats once you die, with no way to get back anything you earned. The creatures are all incredibly slow except for a few, even the 'speedy' creatures feel quite slow and clunky. The models and animations are.. models and animations. There's nothing special about them and they all resemble something out of a bad phone port game of the same genre. They don't look horribly ugly, but theyre not very pretty either, with a lot of the animations being very unpolished and awkward.

Overall, The game is not developed enough or polished enough for me to recommend it. I tried, I put the time in, I wanted to like it.. but the game makes itself hard to like. Money well spent I suppose.",1571256425,1593265309,False,23,2,0.611668825149536133,2,True,False,True

Often a lot of hackers (a lot more then I see in other games of this genre)
Bad graphics
Bad animations
Buggy UI and game in general (you can lose your progress and growth by just logging in)
Slow updates
Takes a bit too long to grow
Most servers are a toxic mess

Conclusion:
I'd say if you really like this genre then this game *might* be worth full price. I'd suggest waiting for a sale though, or a good update that patches most of the bugs. As for the animations, if you're really fussy about that kind of thing don't get this game I'd suggest Saurian or The Isle for graphics and animation.

The basic idea of the game is very interesting, I mean who wouldn't enjoy a game where you get to be the dinosaur, grow and obtain skills, etc.? There is unfortunately a number of reasons of what I hope a potential customers being aware before purchasing this game. However just like any game it is perfect and understandably will have problems of its own. Which I wish to explain within this preview to hopefully help potential customers before buying and launching the game the first time.

1) There is no proper tutorials about explaining the talent tree system and many players, will get easily overwhelmed by the amount of icons appearing in the screen. Understandably the first five attempts will be the causes of a player choosing the wrong skills; many players do not realise the importance of [i]wheather resistance[/i], which is the most common cause of death. Unfortunately even if you did add 1 point into weather resistance, you are not guaranteed to survive if you spawn in the middle of a storm. This inexperience is not helped by various numbers of communities, who are generally very unforgiving for first-time players and new members in general.

2) The game has quite a lot of old bugs that have yet been fixed after months. While many compare this game being better than other dinosaur games, such as The Isle that is far more demanding with graphic cards regarding higher detail in its environment. Beasts of Bermuda trades it for lower detail with more talent and customization features. Do not take me wrong, as an early access game it is understandable to experience variety of bugs, I'm simply trying to say that there still exists almost year old bugs within the game, that have yet to be fixed and corrected in order for the game to perform better.

3) May 2020: penalties of using admin commands and community restrictions. With the most recent update arriving in May 2020 that is supposed to feature a new systems into the game, the developers announced new rules that bans Beast of Bermuda communities from trading in-game goods in exchange of currencies and Discord points. Server admins will have most of their admin commands removed and will no longer be able to growth boost others, without causing player penalties to breeding and inherits. This in resulting communities no longer being able to host events that would involve in-game goods, such as growth boosts, special skins, etc. Most servers being punished by this effect are supposed chill (PVE) servers, that used to be the first recommendation for first-time players to join, so they could get to know the game and talent trees. This is just my personal opinion but trying to forcefully restrict communities and thus, every single player to play a game in an exact same style is not healthy in the long run of things. Especially if you have to make methods for prevent certain types of servers from appearing at all.

4) I personally have not had had bad experiences with the developers, thought I have heard and witnessed couple bad performances from them. What goes to official Discord staff and other community servers thought could be further argued. Some official Discord staff pick and choose favourites. This includes some testers being treated poorly and even bullied out of the testing team. As I stated earlier most communities are not welcoming to new and first-time players. You are often made fun of and sometimes even in the official Discord, some people will purposely make you feel stupid for asking what certain feature does.

[h1]Overall View[/h1]
Despite having its issues in both game and player base, I do still think that Beasts of Bermuda has a lot to offer. It is a decent product and has a lot to discover, even if there is yet to see any lore related features or traits. While I do not personally recommend the game until it has received more attention with performance and bug repairs. I can understand and appreciate the game for what it is. If you want to walk around gathering food and waiting to receive new talent points, so you do not die from weather and other phenomenon, the game still reminds you of other players still being a threat to you as well. I do have to note that I particularly like the alliance and enemy statistics, where a carnivore of a different species cannot group together without admin commands.

Beasts of Bermuda has lots of room to grow and while its not the game for me at its current state. I'm sure and happy that some other people can find enjoyment from it for hours on end.

Just be aware that it is still in Early Access and so there are the occasional bugs, glitches and server wipes. While it could use more content and some polishing, it's in a state that I think you can still enjoy it.

What's good:
- Skill tree, you can choose what skills you want to focus on
- Skins, they're beautiful and there's a lot of variety, you can customize your dino's looks from a very natural look to bright rainbow colors. You can also change the skin/colors to a certain growth point which is nice
- Every creature has it's own set of skills, making the gameplay feel different for every species
- Comfort/stress system is neat
- Weather system is cool, has an actual impact on the gameplay

What's not so good:
- Combat feels clunky and could use some balancing
- Performance issues, changing the graphics doesn't seem to do too much about this and the rubber banding can be really frustrating
- There's not a whole lot to do in the game, about 30% of the game time I've actually been afk playing on my phone or something while waiting for my dino to get the next skill point
- On that note, there's not really a pay-to-win mechanic but pay-to-skip-the-grind where you can buy growth on some servers. If ppl are paying NOT to play the game, it's not really a good sign. The pace at which you grow and get skill points could use tweaking

What I hope to see in the future:
- Balancing of some of the skills, Health/Sturdy/Slippery feel pretty underwhelming if not useless atm
- More consistent lighting
- More AI animals would be nice, not only as a source of food but also to make the map seem more lively. I've played on servers with 70+ ppl and yet only ever seem to meet like 10 of them
- Reverse walking for all (terrestial) creatures would be nice, less walking accidentally off cliffs
- Some sort of info sheet with the creature's abilities and favorite food would be great for new players/when trying out different creatures
- Cannibalism debuff or some other form of punishment. I get it being an option because you gotta eat when you gotta eat, but I just hope it would be a poor option
- Have the option to turn off chat, or to set it to pack/local only. If ppl want to do Dino-Tinder in the chat go for it, but I'd prefer not to have to see it",1586775913,1586789848,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

I would prefer more dinos to choose from of course, but the diversity of flying/water dinosaurs on top of the typical choice between carnivore or herbivore is great.  I particularly love Icthy and Lurdu, having to switch between water and land for survival is exciting.  The game is glitchy, there is occasional server lag that prevents you from moving or rubberbands you.  I've seen several blades of grass or gore just floating in the sky.  But overall those are minor.  The player list for the server does not yet have a search function or a sort function by dinosaur, which I would prefer, but those are the kinds of things you expect early on.

Overall there's a reason I've put over 100 hours into the game in the past couple weeks.  The community is small, but a lot of the people running servers from The Isle have come over and know their shit.  Admins are lacking but that is okay, as it gives some breathing room to learn the game and grow; the server size compared to The Isle is generally about half if not less, and the population seems split among 5 of the most popular servers and spill over into probably about 10 servers that are populated with at least 10-30 players at any given time.  The focus is definitely on being nested in because of the advantages, which I LOVE, but the servers simply aren't populated enough for all species of dino to be nesting all the time yet.

- Diverse maps with different atmospheres all which are stunning (nights are not too dark)
- Maps aren't too large, just large enough so that you don't wander alone for days
- Survival mechanisms such as stress, comfort, and the elements that will challenge you (wind, storms, tornadoes, flooding, and in the future even wildfires will be added).
- Breeding and the ability to inherit skins and talents from your parents
- Ability to pick up and carry food and other dinos (babies too)
- Cool Skin mutations can happen!
- A Talent Tree so you can level up your dino and have different strategies of surviving
- Growth! The baby dinos actually change as they grow which is so neat to watch!
- Make your dino belt out a variety of roars and calls which mean different things (Call, Friendly, Aggressive, Submissive, Alarm).
- You can use Steam Share Family account in order to get multiple dinos on one server
- This game is just beautiful and a true work of ART.
- A large array of servers are available including official each with their own unique rules.
- Devs are always working on improved models, you should keep an eye out on their official Discord or Facebook. 
They offer contests and take suggestions from players, they really do listen to us!
- This game is 100x better than The Isle. I insist if you enjoy playing The Isle to give BoB a chance and you might just fall in love too.

Cons? Nah... not any in my eyes. This game is BETA so it is bound to have a few glitches, all of which the developers are working hard on perfecting. Most of the time server admins can help you around glitches or offer methods to prevent them in the meantime. :) Obviously not all the dinos are finished or available yet. I personally cannot wait for the Utahraptor!

Well, this review is getting long and I'm hopping back into the game now. 5/5 stars from me. <3

So, for start the game is nowhere near the same graphics as what the developers are showing on the store page. 

I ave not played much, what 10 minutes and already hate the game. It does look like in sometime it will be good. 

What I think is so crap:

UI: Looks like it was made years ago with basically no effort. Like come on, the developers are using UE4 which is so good for indie games. 

Servers: Hardly no pop, most in russian. 

Models/Animations: It like the developers thought fuck it we'll release it now. The game is hardly done, and shouldn't even be in early access or anywhere near that. The animations are off so much, and the models honestly suck a## doesn't even feel like your playing survival dino game at all.

I know the graphics are not everything but the developers have access to Unreal Engine, and megascans. Like come on, worst game so far and getting full refund o this poorly made game.

I must have refunded this game three times hopping in and checking performance and finding it to be unplayable and clunky. But the biggest change was the map, and the new map runs a MILLION TIMES BETTER. Don't play on any maps but Rival Shores, unless you're okay with iffy performance. 

Each dinosaur is unique and has their own playstyle, so far I love apatasaurus, but a lot of people don't because it is painfully slow. I just find it fun mowing down forests lol. 
As someone that loves The Isle, I wholeheartedly recommend this to people who also do. You can like both, and competition is good for the players because it drives both teams to try and one up another, and hopefully end in a very good games for us, the customers. This is less just eat and drink survival like The Isle, it has breeding, comfort mechanics, floods, tornadoes, water hole drainage, water creatures, flying creatures, breeding. Although The Isle will likely have such mechanics in the future, this game does them pretty well right now. I love the storms, they're awesome, it's immersive and fun <3
There's also a skill points system, and inherited skills through breeding, and sometimes when growing from spawn, so each time you die and try again, your dinosaur can be more focused in something you might find better, it also might randomly inherit skills. Like one of my first apas only survived because I inherited and added some for water survival. I would have been dead otherwise. 
The game allows for a lot of player customization, some dinosaurs have feathered options and featherless, so far only the rex, but in the future more will. I personally prefer making more subtle skins or realistic, but you can make them however you want, want to be super bright? Want to be literal eye-cancer? The game won't stop you lol. And if you breed your skins can be passed down, or combine with your mate, along with the chance of mutations.
All in all, I can't wait to see where this game goes, it's very fun. I think in the future I'd love to see Quetzalcoatlus, that would be super fun, if you guys had it, make sure it HONKS.",1581546315,1581546315,True,12,0,0.649724662303924561,0,True,False,True

Isle only has graphics going for it. You can definitely have fun time playing the game how ever it has few really bad problems.
Problems I noticed with the game are:
-Steam profile name is your character name. This creates problems because anyone can impersonate anyone and you really cannot keep track on who is trust worthy and who is not. Creatures need a permanent name badly because without it any kind of tribe formation or even social interaction is tedious and pointless because you cannot keep track who is who. Isle had same problem so this is really nothing new to this kind of game.
-Most server admins require video evidence if bug kills you. Requirement that you are forced to record every playtime is ludicrous. I suggest when you die game should have a kill camera that records few minutes before you die so if something absurd or buggy happens it is easy to prove. This would be especially required because creatures are killed permanently if they die.",1581503739,1581503739,True,2,1,0.496179699897766113,0,True,False,True

Yay.

If you're an old school fan of The Isle like I am, but now see The Isle for what it is (let's not get into that) then Beasts Of Bermuda is for you. Beasts Of Bermuda (or ‘BoB’) is everything The Isle has been promising for over three long years now, and they accomplished more in the span of 7 months than The Isle has in years. In my opinion, the only thing that The Isle has over BoB is the graphics. Apart from that one thing, it's no comparison. But I'll compare the pair anyway, because hot chips aren't the only thing I like to add salt to.
The developers of Beasts of Bermuda have had the luxury of watching The Isle make mistake after mistake, and therefore have been able to avoid travelling down the same road.
For instance:

-The updates are regular and large in size, with many improvements within each one

-The developers are extremely transparent and openly communicate with the community at all times

-New game features are teased and then actually released

-Developers don't p**s away their time by removing old features that you love for seemingly no reason and with no explanation (features that took, I assume, hundreds of man hours to create in the first place)

-Old maps that are loved by the community aren't removed for seemingly no reason and with no explanation (see above point)

-Developers don't spend precious time and money designing and implementing huge overpowered fictional monsters that only they can control (because f**k the community and the player-base that made all of this possible, right?)

-Developers actively listen to the community and act accordingly, based on what their fans would like to see

-Lead developer doesn't call his fans ""useless"" or openly say things like ""they don't know what they want"", ""they're idiots"", etc.

-Not a single server is run by Anthomnia and his brigade of (some) power-crazed moderators

-Community is genuinely a great place to be for the most part


If it feels like I'm comparing the two, it's probably because I am. The Isle was supposed to be 'the' dinosaur game, and for a while it was heading that way. But The Isle let me down, more than once, and BoB was there to rekindle my hope for a great dinosaur game. 

(TL;DR)

Great game with cartoonish graphics, longer you play the bigger and stronger you get, actual benefits to working with other players, massive advantages to nesting and joining herds/ grouping up, and countless other positives – Buy BoB.

If you want a heap of disappointing s**t that looks pretty, buy the other one.",1580902902,1580903000,True,10,1,0.550614416599273682,0,True,False,True

Speaking of elements, it has very interesting weather. I was on a map where it rained so hard, the area I was in flooded...and I mean, massive flood. It was pretty crazy. I watched a tornado throw trees all over the place. Also, water sources like ponds are not an infinite supply. I was very surprised when I realized the pond that the herd I had joined was using for drinking was getting smaller and smaller, and with no rain, it just about ran out. Pretty interesting stuff.

But the downside to this game is that :-
1.) Poor game mechanic, 
- they don't seem to have a proper tutorial for controlling some of the dinosaur. Controls are slightly hard to manoeuvre the dinosaurs.
2.) Animation.
- eating, drinking and attack animation can be improve.
3.) Servers
- in just 3 hours i had 6 dc moments, and sometimes some leg strength skill points from the game triggers this but this is just coincidence.

If you don't like The Isle, you'll probably like this game too if a dino survival sim is what you're after. At it's current point, there feels like theres just more content in BoB than there is in The Isle. let me just give a quick run down of what I think.
Pros:
-Functional weather that affects players
-awesome dino selection: land, flying, marine, semi-aquatic you name it. 
-on that note, also many different styles to play for each dino.
-interesting stats to maintain and keep track of other than the basic food/thirst/health
-you never stop growing
-abilities you can invest points in and eventually pass on to offspring
-functional nesting system requiring both genders to perform
-Completely customizable skins!
-You can pick up your babies!

Cons:
-Very buggy, but not unplayable. hey, it is early access after all.
-might feel too slow paced for some
-some mechanics may be confusing to new players based on lack of any sort of tutorial or info panels besides the one you get only once when you enter a server for the first time after playing for the first time. Again forgivable for now due to being early access, but I hope to see this issue resolved before full release.

Water and food sources can become scarce, or sea levels can rise and cause flooding which forces a migration. It's a fun little exercise, but ultimately it becomes tedious and boring once you've found a spot that can meet all of your food, water, and shelter needs, or if you can manage to join a large herd or pack to hunt with.

If you liked playing The Isle and you are curious about this game, I recommend it - it's not any better or worse, just different. 

If you're on the fence because it's Early Access, I do not recommend it - there are still bugs aplenty and the dinosaur roster is woefully inadequate. The gameplay for piscine dinosaurs is really in a poor place right now with fish being difficult to find without the aid of a flying dinosaur to scout for you, like a pteranodon. Scent also seems to glitch out occationally and not properly highlight food sources or other dinosaurs properly. Also, there are some UI bugs that can really interfere with gameplay, stuff like offset buttons and the mouse pointer not being locked to the game window.

That being said, I bought it hype as HELL to play with some friends that already had it. I had a blast learning the ropes and trial-and-error-ing my way through some number of poor dinosaurs. May they find peace in dino heaven after dealing with my dumb azz. 

THE GOOD NEWS IS:
•	The potential! It’s a unique game out there right now. Nothing else is doing the things these devs are trying to do.
•	The completely customizable skins, talent trees and specs, random inherits and diversity of dinos to play makes every creature you grow unique. For example, if you get lucky with inherits you can have a nested krono that can run along the beach with the rest of the land-dwellers! Or an acro that considers itself a shark!
•	The maps, environments and weather systems make for an interesting challenge and keep players on the move, along with constantly shifting tides.
•	Sniffing! And scent! It’s a really handy way to keep your wits about you and learn the map as you go. 

THE BAD NEWS IS:
•	The social aspect of the gameplay is very cool. So cool that playing on your own is pretty miserable.
•	Nothing is taken for granted in this game. When you first hop in, absolutely no information is given to you other than one-liners on the loading screens. Even looking at the controls and keybinds doesn’t enlighten you much.
•	The combat leaves a lot to be desired. No matter what my ping is, it always feels clunky and I’m rarely certain a hit has even landed, let alone the times I’ve timed out of a server mid-fight and came back to my dino being dead as a door nail.
•	The communities in this game are abysmal. Any servers with a decent playerbase either have admins that are stretched thin and never get around to managing reports, events and crashes, causing players to get more wound up, or they have admins constantly abusing their roles and bending all rules to suit them, that can do no wrong and are held to godly esteem by the common players, leading to a very stagnant playerbase.
•	The graphics and performance. My god, my pc HATES this game. With the lowest settings it starts screaming at me after about 20 minutes. That being said, even with the highest settings BoB doesn’t look good either so like, if you’re running on economy graphics you’re really not missing out on much.
•	The BUGS. And GLITCHES. There’s too many to count, and like other reviews have said, with every update there just seems to be more. Each one more game-breaking than the last. The menus and options don’t work properly. Each time you get disconnected from a server, you can’t rejoin until the second try as it will automatically time out. Sometimes you’ll just log in and your dino will be gone. Sometimes another player from across the map will pick you up with it only showing on your side, so you'll die from intimidation unless you log out. I get that it’s an early access game, but I really wish we didn’t all look at every update like “oh here we go again”. The community feedback seems to be a moot point too, especially after the patch to “fix” gore spawns by disabling every server’s ability to modify their frequency and size. I don't know what the devs' plans are for BoB in the future I can only hope they fix the booboos they made along the way already before adding anything new.

Anyway, it’s not bad for the price, and an interesting concept, but I can’t say I’ve found it fun after the first few hours.",1574808857,1575065350,False,183,19,0.818587303161621094,0,True,False,True

""Dynamic"" is the best way to describe BoB. What the game currently lacks in graphics or in optimization (Early Access), it makes up for with rich gameplay mechanics and replayability. These include:

- [b]Talents[/b]: As your creature grows it gains talent points. You can spec these into talents that make your creature faster, or stronger, or more resistant, etc. This makes every dino you play feel unique, and lets you choose your own playstyle

- [b]Tides & Weather:[/b] The maps have a high tide/low tide system. Sea levels will rise up and go down again on a half hour cycle. This will cut off or expose parts of the map - and requires you to plan your travels/migrations carefully. Storms also occur as a sunny day could turn into a hurricane. Storm floods may submerge the map and will have you desperately search higher ground, while Mosasaurs and Krono's are swimming through what used to be land!

- [b]Comfort:[/b]. The comfort system is a big part of the game. Having high comfort will help you grow, but being stressed can hurt you. Being in a herd or pack improves your comfort, being near hostile creatures lowers it (unless you specced some stress resistance talents). If a bad storm is stressing your creature out, use your surroundings to find shelter

- [b]Nesting:[/b] Nesting and breeding is very rewarding. Children may gain [i]inherits[/i]: permanent bonuses to a dino depending on what Talents their parents specced! On the flip side, the game keeps track of who is related and incest will punish your offspring with negative inherits making them weaker 

- [b]Infinite growth:[/b] Creatures do not have age stages - instead you just keep growing until you die. As you grow larger, growth gain will slow down and you will go hungry faster. Do you want to become a horrifying, monstrous giant? You can! It will take you literal [i]weeks[/i] of in-game survival, but the reward is worth it

The game has a friendly Developer team who - despite making the occasional bad decision - work hard to improve their game. Bug fixes, optimizations and new content gets released often, every 3-4 weeks or so

The main issues with the game are the bugs (frequent, but being worked on) and balance problems. Servers without pack/herd limits are especially annoying, because you'll find overpowered cliques of Rexes and Aquatics. I highly suggest playing on a (semi)realism server for this reason.

Jokes aside BOB is a really fun game offering a unique way to play as a prehistoric creature. Instead of having preset stats and abilities for everything it allows players to modify their chosen creature to fit whatever playstyle they prefer. Basically if I had to sum up this game it is ambitious, very ambitious so while it may not be the most high realism accurate animal survival game it still more than makes up for it in the fun factor.",1572745807,1572745807,True,2,0,0.533011257648468018,0,True,False,True

Let me tell you a little story.

Before I came to the community, I was looking for a dinosaur survival game, as I was tired of games that always involved humans. I saw two that took my interest, The Isle, and Beasts of Bermuda. I had heard a decent bit of negative things about The Isle, but I knew NOTHING about Beasts of Bermuda. That day, I decided to give these unknown Devs a chance. Boy, am I glad I did.

Beasts of Bermuda is a dinosaur survival game that takes place in the Bermuda Triangle, with that touch of mystery in the environment that makes you wonder ""What happened here?"" such as ruins or plane wreckage of times that have long since past. You have generally free selection to play any dinosaur that is available in the roster, and there is a decent variety currently, with many more planned to come. There are terrestrial ones such as Parasaurs and Rexes, you can take to the sky as a Pteranodon, or swim in the ocean as creatures such as a Mosasaurus or Kronosaurus, and those aren't even the full list of whats already in the game.

There are many mechanics such as weather, eating and drinking, grouping up in a pack or herd, or choosing skins for which you want to become, and customizing its colors to your liking. You can grow your creature bigger over time, and there is a talent tree from which you can make your creature faster, stronger, and survive easier. You can nest, and lay eggs, and raise children, and you can pick up those children, eggs, or even food items.

From the day I came in to the community, I was loving the game and what it had to offer, but then I fell victim to a bug. I soon discovered that they were seeking QA testers, and decided to try to help. This is where I learned about the Devs more than I expected to.

[b]This game is a passion project. They aren't in it for the money, they want to CREATE a world, a survival world in specific, and they just hope people will enjoy what they're making as they make it.[/b] This does not mean they do not listen to the community, however, as they do observe what people say, and consider their options when trying to balance things, and some ideas people come up with are rather exciting to them. Coding is one of the hardest parts of game development, and there are only two coders working on the game. They are human, not robots, they can't make it perfect, they have lives too and need a little bit of time to rest every now and again, and many of the negative reviews that are spouting such aggressive comments do so seemingly with the idea that they are robots, and should be perfect. Thats not how that works.

Atleast 80% of the negative reviews on this game are for one of the following reasons, which are not good reasons to completely avoid buying the game ever:
- They got caught and banned for hacking.
- They died to another player that played better than them (and therefore giving the game a bad review because they aren't good at it)
- They lost a dinosaur to a bug/balance issue which is in an Early Access game. (Don't buy the game quite yet if you worry this will ruin it for you).
- The Devs changed a game mechanic to better fit their actual design intentions, and the negative reviewer did not like it.
- The negative reviewer had an admin do something to them on a non-official server (valid or not), which is not the game Dev's fault.
- They like another dinosaur survival game and are trying to skewer the reviews on this one to ruin its reputation unfairly.

All in all, this game deserves credit. They do work hard, do try their best, and the game does have a lot of nice features to it, with the Devs spilling their blood, sweat, and tears into making it better in all ways that they can. If scared of the bugs, feel free to wait, but do consider coming back and giving it a chance later!",1570147549,1570147549,True,17,0,0.629219889640808105,0,True,False,True

I have bore witness to admin abuse\bug abuse and players being teleported to be murdered for food even but nothing is done. I STILL enjoy playing this game with a group in game though but be warned,this game is definitely frustrating for the wrong reasons and I suggest expecting to lose your hard work at any given time,but if you are casual about it it is still fun to pass the time for sure.


EDIT: After continuing playing and trying different servers due to massive packs of Meglos constantly killing everyone,I had finally joined the main server where the Mods and Admins focus and prefer to play. This map for some reason does not spawn food effectively for carnivores and people tend ot play herbivores in giant packs,where if you remotely get close even as friendly you will be instantly stomped to death. When bringing up the bug along with five other people on the map experiencing the same,we all had two moderators laugh at us and say tough luck,that since they were finding corpses (Not the spawned meat,but those left by players dying,mostly of the lack of spawn of food itself) that our bug was not a real issue,we all reported it anyway to where it needed to go in the discord with no response. 

I have not played the game much since this experience,though still fun it just really sucks when voices are not heard.

Been playing this game a few days with my husband,so far it is amazing fun and the developers keep up to date on it and pay attention to the community very well.

Being an EA game it is in a better state than 99% of them out there,although there are still some bugs,most of which though do not seem game breaking,except for the occasional (But absolutely hilarious) Ptera deathwheel bug.

Every few days they add new bug fixes for these problems.

CONS 
SPAWN CAMPING IS BECOMING A REAL ISSUE IN this game.
are it is best to have a friend or friends to play with,otherwise survival seems to be difficult.
Huge packs of Carnivores who eat other Carnivores
Hackers are finding this game but devs keeping up
Herbivores are able to single stomp any carnivore if big enough and have the right build

Be prepared to lose your dinosaur after a few days work due to people hunting in packs or accidents (fallin off cliffs, unable to find food in rain etc).

most private servers even though not inherently a problem with the game itself are unable to keep their own set rules in check (there doesnt seem to be good tools for that in the first place) giving you a false sense of security that will instead make you feel like you´re on a minecraft server run by fortnite kids resulting in you getting killed by ""kosérs"" for trying to play by the rules making you lose all the hours of progress you made by scavenging.

ohhh and if you fought about surpassing that player forget it the growth of your dino has no endgame meaning the bigger player will get even bigger (meaning a rex with a stupid amount of server time is pretty much twice as big as when your rex would reach adultstage meaning hes just faster by size.

Beasts of Bermuda takes place in the modern day somewhere in the Bermuda Triangle. You take control of a dinosaur or other mesozoic animal and attempt to survive in the face of hostile weather forces and other players.

There are three game modes. The main one most people play is Life Cycle. You begin at 0.4 size with 5 talent points, and gain an additional talent point every 0.04 points of growth. Every species has a different growth rate until 1.0, or adult size. Your growth then begins to slow down until 1.2 (elder size), after which all species follow an identical growth formula. Growth at this point slows down exponentially; you can reach 2.0 size in a couple weeks worth of gameplay, but 3.0 takes months. Much of how you survive the late game will be determined by the talents you took as a juvenile and adolescent, simply due to how slow growth (and by extension acquiring more talent points) becomes.

The second mode is combat. In this mode everyone is stuck at adult size. You start with 5 talent points the first time you join a server, and all talent points thereafter are acquired by surviving, eating blue crystals, and killing other players. You lose a few talent points if you respawn, die naturally, or get killed, and the latter will also give those lost talents to your killer. The talent tree in this mode is the same as in the other two modes, so some talents are a bit useless as a result.

The third mode is free roam. Once again everyone is stuck at adult size, and you get 20 talent points to spend as you please. You never get anymore. No one plays this mode.

Weather hazards include high winds, tornadoes, lightning, and floods. Particularly bad floods (known to players as extinction floods) can rise to cover nearly all of the land including tall mountains. Floods only occur during lightning storms, and your reward for surviving said storms is increased growth in the life cycle mode.

The talents I've mentioned take the form of a perk tree like you'd see in Skyrim or Witcher 3. There are three branches which can be roughly categorized as power, mobility, and survival. Every species has a slightly different set of talents geared toward their respective gameplay, and every talent can be invested up to three times (provided every prerequisite talent in invested by at least the same amount). Many players go deep into one branch with little or no points spent in the others, though some do elect to spread points out more. The survival tree is mainly oriented towards resource management, mobility towards speed and stamina longevity, and power towards damage and durability.

No two species play exactly the same, even without talents. Even similar animals will have differing special abilities to ensure that they do not feel [i]too[/i] similar to the player. Megalosaurus, for example, is a fast growing predator with the ability to view enemy stats. A pack can quickly grow large and mob targets, and can do so with little to no communication thanks to everyone being able to view detailed information on their target and each other. Contrast to Acrocanthosaurus, a much slower growing predator with the ability to inflict bleed damage and temporarily weaken enemy attacks. Packs will be small and slow to grow, and the players will prefer to take their time coordinating with each other and whittling down a target's health slowly over time.

It's a damned fun game, and though not without its share of hiccups it is definitely a worthy addition to any dino lover's gaming library.",1565296490,1565296490,True,0,0,0.47413790225982666,0,True,False,True

Positives: The survival mechanics are incredible. You don't just eat and drink, you also have a comfort meter to take care of alongside that. Food also spoils and there is changing weather like droughts and floods. Overall, the survival is actually fun and really makes the game more fun then just your basic survival game (Like another crappy dinosaur game that will be mentioned later)

Positive#2: The combat is actually fair and realistic. You don't get hit unless the hit actually connects with the model of your creature. The unique abilities of every creature also make the game's combat system realistic and fair. For example, a parasaurolophos is a creature most carnivores would think are easy prey, but it's ability: revealing the location of the creature the ability is used on, means that it can all for help. Alongside it's good stats, it can fight fairly against creatures like megalosaurus and younger acrocanthosaurus.

Positive#3: The talent screen adds so much variety, every person has a different playstyle and build. The talent screen means you can modify your creature to whatever you want. Want to be a fishing pteranodon? Just pump points into Aqua affinity and mobility skills. Want to be a ichthyovenator that can survive through thick and thin? Put survival talents in to help you stay alive. Want to be a all rounder? Just put talents into a few of every skill tree. This makes the game SO much more fun then it already is since you can play it how you want to play it

Positive#4: The skins are all vibrant and unique by default, but you can colour then however you want! You can make any colour of patterns or skins. The colour wheel and ability to colour each part of your skin how you want means that you can also make a skin bright or dull. Once again, every player probably has a different skin so you can create your own unique dinosaur masterpiece of a skin.

Positive#5: The creatures are all fun in their own ways due to their unique abilities and lifestyles that can be expanded by the aforementioned talent system. All of the creatures are fun to use and are different and varied. As well as that, all the creatures are well balanced. A herbivore can actually fight off a carnivore fairly in this game and T-rex is not a stupidly overpowered creature (Unlike another good dinosaur game). Everything is balanced as it should be.

Positive#6: The game is actually realistic with it's survival and models. I mentioned the survival earlier. But all of the models are quite realistic and nicely done


Now for the only negative I have with the game


Negative: The game is a bit glitchy at the moment, and this can often make the game a bit annoying at times. Some creatures also get boring over time if you don't like the way you play them. These 2 issues are not that big of a problem as server admins will often handle the glitches that affect players and you can just respawn if you are done with a creature you were using.

Just because you cant figure out the controls since the main developer accidentally gave his left-handed controls does not mean just to give up and refund. And don't go looking at the bad reviews, if you have discord join the official discord. It has screenshots of the awesome game-play. Yes, there's bugs, but that does NOT mean its a bad game. The Isle is just as buggy, and I'm sure you're all aware apparently anthomnia was paid by Dondi to diss this game. Give it a shot, try it out. It's a great game where you don't have to press a button to grow, and you incubate inside an egg when its laid (for non aquatics, aquatics give live birth) and the game lets you choose from 3 different trees to spec into. Survival lets you go longer without food or water, combat lets you have a stronger defense against hunting and predators, and speed lets you be able to catch up to prey and run away. But most importantly, is 99% of the servers have NO growth limit! Which means, you can grow to 4.0 if you can survive! And it has a variety of different skins you can freely choose the colors of and such, where with the isle you have a set color palette for each dinosaur. As you get bigger your meant to become louder and eat and drink more, making it more difficult to maintain such a large dinosaur. You can invest in most dinosaur's into a talent called Sneaky, which makes you quieter. However, the only dinosaur that doesn't have this so far is Apatosaurus, because it is the largest dino in-game and will always be noisy.
And you benefit from being nested in, too! However, instead of you sending out the nest invites, people come to you for egg invites! And not only that, you get inherits! Sometimes you get bad ones, yes, but these can be prevented with a talent known as Good Parent, which helps 'stress' (comfort) on your dino that it gets when gestating eggs. Sometimes you can get inherits from a spawned in dino, but you can only get a max of 5 inherits from spawning in. And not only is THAT a benefit, but you get inherits based off what your parents are speced into! Such as combat, speed, or survival. So after reading this, tell me if you'll give it a shot in the comments. And whats better, as well? You can make skins to suggest to be added to the game, or better yet, suggest dinos!

The herbivores in the game stand no chance the majority of the time to their counter parts which normally wouldnt be a problem if the servers u play on have no rules. 

Here is where the problems start arising. 

Offical rules are under populated most of the time, and if they are populated, it will usually be one server of 40ish people (not alot).

Unoffcial servers have a higher population on average, making it, obviously, a safer server to play on considering you want to play a game with other people, BUT, they have very strict rules. For example Herbis cant outright attack carnivores etc.

The problem here is, you can accept the balancing for the game based on OFFICAL rules ONLY.  Where basically if you are a big carnivore, you are killing EVERYONE, since you probably had a head start, and no rivals.

If you play on UNOFFICAL servers, there are rules restricting your game play based on what you pick and being a Herbivore is downright painful at these times since theres literally no incentive to play them vs a carnivore.

These balances, or nerfs to the weaker dinos only exasperates the situation to the point where you are now playing on servers where 99% of the playerbase is a carnivore, and where , if you are new, the entire server has a head start on you.

What this boils down to, is if you are a fan of lets say Parasuars, or Apato (brontos) etc, you are basically wasting time grown a dino that will not last very long, and depending on the herbivore you pick , you will alway be at a disadvantage when fighting a carnivore at the same size as you...nevermind the giant carnivores that will stomp you flat in a one bite.

The last comlaint I have of this game is the favoritism the DEVs have on their discord, this being their main source for giving out information and taking in opinions on how to change the game. If  you mention or try to spark a debate on what could be changed, you will have the DEVs contradict you, cause they think since they created the game their opinons are more important and then the fanatics will follow and gang up on you. Not a good feeling and definitly not a feeling of open community.  THe devs are a SUPER SMALL team of two people who actually have a real life job, this game NOT being it. So if you expect your opinion to change anything, forget about it, unless you are one of these lil kids who spends 100% of their time in their main discord brown nosing...so goodluck with that.

719890,49884766,76561198093363439,140,16,993,0,505,1666312468,"I'm going to be completely honest here; When I bought the game, I had a neutral opinion on it. I had seen very few gameplay videos, and I thought that if I ended up giving it a negative review it would be because it was a poorly made copy of The Isle. However, within the first hour of playing it, I realized that it's not really as similar to The Isle as everyone makes it out to be. Of course, the game does have a lot of good features that are overlooked, but with how the game is currently doing, the cons heavily outweigh the pros.
This game does really have a lot of potential. It has a ton of fun mechanics and features. The variety of different playable creatures makes it quite a bit more unique. And I don't specifically mean the species, I mean the types of dinosaurs. There are flyers, aquatic dinos, carnivores and herbivores. Each have their own unique skill trees suitable to the label.

I noticed right off that the game was really glitchy and bugged from the start. As a land-roaming dinosaur, I would run in to invisible walls on random parts of the map that others wouldn't run in to. Once I ran in to one, more started to appear out of random, and it would get so bad that I couldn't move from one spot, and my game would crash, or freeze, to the point where I would have to open task manager and force close the game. As a flyer, even if I barely touched a wall or something while in the air, my dinosaur would lose all animations and freeze up, and hit the ground and I couldn't move. Again, I would have to relog, and sometimes that wouldn't work, so I would have to respawn completely. Even now, these bugs still happen but not as often after the updates. Even compared to The Isle, which has A LOT more detail, textures, bigger maps, and more players on one map, I can run that game on all cinematic graphics with 30-50 FPS. This game however, with only a small amount of players per server, smaller maps, less details and textures, and even less foliage, I can hardly get up to 30 FPS on low graphics.

The developers also are a bit of a con in this game. I've noticed multiple times that they would announce an update that was suppose to come out the next day, but when the time came, the update wasn't there, and again an announcement that the update would be the NEXT day. Again, still no update.

The community itself is pretty toxic, as I've seen a lot of other reviews stating. Admins for servers usually encourage the behaviour, or, just don't do anything about it, making it seem to other players like it's completely fine to do so. If this were the only con to this game, I wouldn't be giving it a negative review, because the community shouldn't affect the overall review of a game. I thought that this should just be mentioned.

The game is also progressively unstable. Updates have made some of the maps completely unusable, and the maps that are still able to be used are extremely small. Even the biggest map in the game is painfully small, but bearable since servers can only support up to 50 players currently. I suspect that this will be changed later on since the game is still early access, but more work could definitely be put into the maps, regardless of their size. They're extremely bare and stale, with nothing that really makes them unique. Even the ruins that are found on a few of the maps are exactly the same. The ruins on one map has the exact same layout, details and even textures as on the other maps. Somehow, even though there isn't much actually to the maps, crashes are still extremely common and random, usually for no reason at all. I'll have great FPS, no lag, and without warning or even a drop in FPS, the game just closes itself out with a crash message.

Last but not least, the animations for pretty much all of the dinosaurs are stiff. There's little to no fluidity in the movements of the dinosaurs when walking, roaring, eating, etc. It seems as if minimum effort has been put into their models and animations. This also goes for the sounds that each dinosaur makes. The audio track for the roars don't blend at all with the rest of the sounds, and for some dinos, like the Pterodon, every sound it makes sounds almost the same. You can't tell which sound is friendly, aggressive, etc. Dinosaurs that have been in the game the longest are the only ones that are at least a little decent, like the Megalosaur. It has more calls than the other playable creatures. I believe it has 5 different calls, maybe 6, while other dinosaurs only have 3, or at most 4. 

Overall, as I said, this game does have a ton of potential, and I hope that in the future, the updates help it rather than make it worse. I definitely don't hate the game, or even dislike it. I just get very frustrated with it. I definitely don't plan on playing the game anymore until there are much more updates to fix it, so for now I'm going to uninstall and hope that it gets better sooner rather than later.",1554076943,1554077156,False,20,1,0.673438012599945068,1,True,False,True

Good things:

Nesting: Fun and rewards players for sticking with their dino and herding. Also is well balanced with you having to put some points into Good Parent if you want your babies to be able to do well.
Comfort: Makes it impossible for people to do one of the worst things that plagues multiplayer animal survival games- Carebearing. Also forces you to act like a dinosaur would and seek shelter. Makes storms especially tense.
Tide: Adds more difficulty to being a mosa (unless they're a land mosa). Makes people have to pay attention to the tide and to escape to other islands while they can.
Bonding: Rewards players for forming herds/packs. Also makes it so you have to be in a herd/pack with another player for a while before you can nest.
Updating: This game is getting better constantly. While I would like to get The Isle as well, I saw gameplay of BoB and knew I had to buy it. It's updating so much more than The Isle is and is fulfilling promises it makes instead of making them and forgetting about them for two years.
Underwater tunnels: Tunnels allow mosas to sneak into lakes unseen, making drinking from the water especially scary.
Herbivore gameplay: Herbivore gameplay is both fun and terrifying. Unless you make your way into a huge herd, you're always scared that you might get killed. Even when you do get into a huge herd, the conflicting needs of every species in it keeps it difficult, as there's always a time where you have to leave the herd alone to get food or water, leaving you vulnerable to predators.
Weather: The weather in this game makes it so that basic needs and avoiding enemies aren't the only danger. Weather picks off players who haven't put enough points into resistances or haven't been traveling to find safe places. The different type of weather: Tornadoes, rain storms, floods, and thunder storms make it impossible to be prepared for everything, constantly keeping you on your toes.
Fishing: Fishing is actually a thing you can do, making it rewarding to put some points into adapting to fish.
Player Freedom: Despite the confines of comfort levels, there is still a way to have plenty of freedom in the game thanks to perks. You can be a velociraptor that takes down much larger prey, or a battle-ready parasaurolophus, whatever you want.
Perks: Sadly underused in these types of games. They make you have to work for certain things on top of all the other challenges.
Iridescent feathers: A small thing, but I love how a velociraptor's black feathers are iridescent.

Bad things:

Glitches: This probably won't last forever, considering this game is EA and they are working on patching bugs. But it is annoying when you lose high-level dinosaurs to falling through the world or getting stuck in rocks.
Land mosas: Thanks to perks in the game, they can become so OP that they can crawl inland as far as they please as long as they take a dip every once in a while. They need to be much more difficult to unlock and need a way to counter it. They are very fast on the ground and resistant to drying out.
Fleshgrazer pteras: Again, perks in the game. A ptera with fleshgrazer can easily kill anything, and there's not exactly anything you can do to kill it thanks to how fast they are. They need to have a damage nerf to things in higher weight classes  and to slow down after biting something (since a ptera can't just vacuum the meat up, they'd have to carry it and make sure they don't drop it). Or, maybe another flyer (quetzalcoatlus?) that specializes in hunting them, similar to kronos specializing in hunting mosas, to make it so pteras aren't pretty much invincible and don't have to worry about getting picked off by other flyers.
Customization: I love the customization in this game, but it's annoying to have to endure eye-bleeding dinos. Maybe if players have especially bright colors or too many of them, they are more likely to get sick, or give the dinos around them a morale debuff? There should be some way to discourage it.
KOSing: There should be a way to discourage KOSing and spawnkilling in life cycle servers. Maybe players who KOS are much easier to detect, or louder?
Community: I know this isn't exactly the devs' fault, but there should be some more admins in official servers to keep people from constantly insulting each other. Kinda annoying for the first thing you see in the server to be people throwing slurs at each other and anyone who intervenes getting yelled at too.",1554061030,1554061030,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

I had massively hoped this would not turn into The Isle 2.0, but God how wrong was I! Game has not even been out half a year and ALREADY people are engaging in cancerous/ bad behaviour such as camping (usually with intimidation on), KOSing and similar things. 

Even the devs are starting to be undesirable people as a couple of months ago or so, I posted a thread about a strange bug I was having with the game where it seemed to work fine but when I joined a server and the creature selection screen was about to load, I would suddenly get booted back to the main menu without even a disconnect message. A few forum mods (IDK their names were yellow) were helpful with the issue but it seemed like a few others were having the same problem (Did manage to fix the problem but only for a short time.). 

HOWEVER some time later for absolutely no apparent reason at all, I was hit with a community ban with the false accusation of being toxic in the forums. You can imagine I got annoyed at this as I was no way toxic in the forums at all, so in response I joined the Discord server as I was pretty sure this was either a mistake or a false positive. I went ahead and contacted Predatoria being polite as I possibly could in hopes I could get the ban removed.

Boy was I wrong! Instead of professionalisim I was met with immediate anger and hostility, with Predatoria even saying ""The ban stays. You earned it."" Excuse me? This just goes to show that the game is already going down the shitter, and should be avoided since the devs and forum mods are starting to be needlessly hostile over people asking for simple bug fixes. Even if they do so politely might I add!

The overall game is sound. Albeit, a bit glitchy with a good number of bugs to work out. But the developers are working on that.
The graphics are decent enough. Not as good as The Isle, but still decent.
The gameplay is fantastic. If you like survival games and dinosaurs, this is definitely one to have in the library!

It has all these fantastic things going on for it and yet it is marginally let down by the community who play it.
Admins have complete control over the servers (and rightly so, admins should have complete control). But they often abuse their positions and if you are not on their friends list, expect a hard time getting anywhere in game. Most come across as spoiled children.
You will always have a group of 4-5 people (Usually close friends with the admins) who have huge dinosaurs, are always online and kill on sight. Expect to die a lot (They often use the excuse that they need to feed, but I have had large dinosaurs myself and it is not hard to keep well fed on random spawns). You will really need to be a patient person and not care too much about progress to enjoy this game.
Roleplay and realism servers often preach huge amounts of rules in order to make it more enticing for those (like myself) who enjoy the realistic aspects of playing certain types of dinosaurs, having a realistic lifecycle etc, and who like the idea of playing a ""dinosaur life sim"" but the admins rarely follow these rules themselves and there is a good number of people who abuse the bugs in the game purely to ""get bigger"", ""more growth"".
There is no growth cap. So you sometimes get very weird things happening, like a dinosaur that is meant to be tiny but manages to kill a T-Rex because it has lived for such a long time that it is bigger than one. A growth cap for all dinosaurs would probably be a good idea. Please take note developers. You guys are doing a fantastic job so far ;)
Servers often crash. Once every few hours on the ones that I frequent. Which can be annoying if you have stashed away food only to have it all wiped away each time a crash happens.
I have noticed a lot of people have complained about the ""Comfort"" mechanic. Personally I think it is awesome. It makes people very aware of the shifting weather and challenging when trying to find shelter (Saying that, you can just stand next to a large rock for partial shelter, so I really have no idea why people are fussing over this so much. It is not hard to survive the storms and it is a fun addition to the game which I think makes people more attentive to the survival aspects rather than just a ""whoever is the biggest wins the fight"" kind of feel that it so often has currently.

I have no idea what the future holds for this game. It is currently unbalanced and It is still being worked on. But it seems to be slowly trundling in a good direction and I doubt I will stop playing it anytime soon, despite how often I take a step back from the game due to frustration with the admins or the few individuals who seem hell bent on trying to ruin everyone's day.
But I highly recommend getting it if you enjoy this sort of game. It really is an awesome game. But I also recommend going into it with the idea of possibly investing in your own server. Because playing on other peoples servers tends to be a bit crap when you take into account everything I have mentioned above.

Of course, if things change for the better, so will my review :)",1552479260,1552479260,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

There are quite a few bugs present in the game, such as the crashing, but that's to be expected from an early access game, and I can overlook them relatively easily. There's also some slight balancing issues with some of the creatures, but again, that's to be expected from a relatively new game, and I'm sure they'll be sorted out in the future.

In my opinion, the game does a good job of offering a variety of play styles with each creature, and is pretty good at encouraging players to explore the world, either it be to find food or to find shelter to escape natural disasters like heavy storms and tornadoes. The community seems really nice too.

Customization is very cool. 
Talent trees are neat and give you something to look forwards to when you die and start over. 
Balancing the talent tree points and your food consumption rate against your total growth size is a neat way to soft-cap how big you can get.

Cons:
Lag is pretty bad while fighting sometimes and servers are crashing pretty regularly after 2-3 hours.
Group comfort bonuses are a tad on the strong side. 
Unofficial servers don't have a lot of rules, while unofficials might have ""weird rules"".
Glitches can and will kill you. People will break rules and kill you on unofficials when they shouldn't (not everyone reads the rules, most servers keep theirs on discord).
Graphics are stylized instead of realistic...? (I personally like it.)

With these no rule servers that almost everyone plays on it allows for mass kos from dinos that are 10 times your size and will kill you just cause they want to even if they have food. I have run into plenty of bugs and the devs seem to be working hard to fix them and yes this an early access game and yes it is a lot of fun but the no rule official servers and the fact that all servers with rules have no players just kind of killed my drive to play.

You can be a Birb and its working fine not like in an specific other game

- Performance : Needs some Attention (Better CPU & GPU Usage)
- Latency : Needs some Attention (Some players just Teleport or have lags/ruberbanding)
- Bugs : couple of
- Models : They are OK but an Overhaul/Update would not be wrong  (This Means Map & Dinosaurs)
- Foliage & Map : Needs to get a bit Updated some places have Invisible Water, Trees & Stuff. Some Terrain is to Sharp so you also stuck on that (abit more Using of the Smooth Tool) 
- Admins & Mods : Always Online on Official Servers, answering Questions and Take Feedback & Bug Reports aswell 
- Features : For being out Roughly 10 Days and having this kind of Features is a good start, hopefully Devs will not Stick on it and keep it only this way

This game hooked me immediately and I've quickly become a supporter for it to succeed. The dev's are very active in their community discord. They work hard to fix bugs that are found and game breaking balancing issues. Since I started playing there has been one or more patches per week for fixes (remember early access). At the same time as the bug fixes there are also separate people working on new map/map overhauls as well as new content. Performance issues may happen at times (again early access) and (currently)  with 40+ players on a server you can see and feel the teleporting lag (mostly during combat) however performance fixes are in almost every patch. Crashes happen at times but 9/10 of those only ~2.5 minutes of progress is lost.

I've found the graphics to be fine (or at least acceptable for an early access game) and the community to be very helpful for new starters, even on official servers. 

The perk system is a really nice mechanic that allows you to really build yourself to your playstyle, with three main arms - Combat, Survival and Speed/Utility, you gain perk points as you grow and you only stop growing when you are dead (though you will have increasingly diminishing returns as you grow past full size).

Obviously it is early access so rough around the edges as the devs focus on content / balance over optimisation and I am greatly looking foward to the new dinos to be added to the game (have a look at the suggestions sticky on the community hub for the list of confirmed dinos).

Yes, Isle has better graphics but the advantage ends there.
Bermuda > Isle in every way besides graphics 

Also BoB is ran on Unreal engine it has good graphics (turn ur graphics settings up bro)
The Isle is still a GREAT game and you should still play it (i have nearly 1,000 hours played on isle) 

Don't want to die on the Isle? Growing never stops on BoB, you'll want to live more than you did on Isle
Somewhat bored of land? Be a Pteradon and fly around or be a giant fish and swim around

Swim into low tide get stuck in puddle then get killed by a T rex
Be a giant fish that can grab dinosaurs and pull them into underwater caves to be eaten

Underwater caves are everywhere on the map, explore and learn where they go.
Unlike The Isle semi aquatic dinosaurs actually swim faster in water (real suchomimus)

That should be enough examples to prove Beast of Bermuda is the better game.

They put their focus away from the bells and whistles and attempt to focus on keeping the community and game stablization in check. So let's got on with this review, I guess. Sue me for it being in a bad format, for this is the first time I have reviewed the game.

[u][b]Positives[/b][/u]
[list]
   [*]Game is fairly stable with some lag and map glitches, though those are actively being looked into.
   [*]There is no limit to customization when it comes to skins. While you have a ""template"" to work with, preset markings, they can be any colour. Realistic or neon. However, neons don't often survive save for Apatosaurs and Pterosaurs.
   [*]Pretty big variaty. You not only have herbivores and carnivores, but also flying and aquatic creatures. More creatures are actively being planned, and paid for, for implementation into the game.
   [*]The better people in the community are willing to help and talk.
   [*]That staff is generally kind and understanding so long as you keep yourself from becoming a problem. If major issues arise, they are willing to listen and deal with the situation.
[/list]

[u][b]Negatives[/b][/u]
[list]
   [*]There seems to be people actively jumping onto the game in an attempt to ruin it for others. This leaves many of the official servers, and some non-official, to become toxic cesspools. It's best to steer clear of those servers if you can and join non-official ones that are actively being patroled with an heavy hand.
   [*]Bugs can sometimes be common, though they are often patched as soon as the develeopers lives can allow them to do so.
   [*]There seems to, sadly, be a void in power. There are no rules on official servers, even though not everything is there to set up mechanics to keep things such as Killing-on-Sight from happening. I would strong ask that rules do be impletmented for these things. (Note: that being said, there are rules about hate speech, slander, and the like.)
[/list]

So here are some final things.
[olist]
   [*]Don't get up in arms because someone happens to colour their skin in a way you don't like. Move out and ignore it. There is no point in complaining about something that is not in your control. If you cannot handle that, do not buy this game.
   [*][u]At the time of this review[/u] do not treat the game as a final product. Do not treat the game as a Triple-A release. It is neither. It is an indy game made by a small group of people that is still in development. There are going to be flaws, glitches, and crashes. If you cannot handle that, do not buy this game.
   [*]Do not come onto this game to spread lies and slander because someone told you that BoB stole code/skins/etc. from -insert other dinosaur game here-. It's slander. It is lies. If you honestly believe this slander, then don't buy this game.
[/olist]

I understand that this game is still in progress, however it seems like the devlopers are rushing to put incomplete mechanics in the game that are not fully polished or stabilized. The experience I've had playing this was extremely buggy and filled with different glitches and problems depending on the dinosaur you play as; I'm constantly having to log in and out as a pteranodon due to getting stuck on the ground, getting stuck in the flying animation, etc. As an apatosaurus I was instantly killed by merely touching a tree. As a kronosaurus I kept dying due to my oxygen bar never filling up despite going up for air among other bugs and problems I've constantly encountered which makes the game not very fun or enjoyable when constantly dying to glitches or being bugged out. A lot of the mechanics in the game seem to be done without much thought and just thrown in that are only half complete and not properly finalized or tested.

There are a lot of interesting mechanics in the game, I enjoy the idea of having weather, skill trees, etc. however right now as the game currently is it's really unplayable, and I'd highly suggest to the game devlopers to finalize things more before introducing or adding new things or mechanics into the game rather than just throwing it in half finished or barely working that bugs out the entire game.

To be honest, if the game lags so bad you can't even move you should probably refund and get better software, the games state is no reason to leave a bad review because of your system specs. It works just fine for me and I have an average computer. Also, The Isle has worked out their lags and glitches much better because it's been around for 3-4 years now while as Beasts of Bermuda only about 3 weeks. Give it time before leaving a bad review because it's ""too laggy"".



It has a lot of things to do but is punishing at death, fair, but punishing. The growth times are fair enough and the reason, mind you, why death is punishing is to actually make players care about their creature and actually want them to live. It's fair. What isn't fair are the mix packers in this game, the game GREATLY prevents mix packing but it's still a problem. Ptera scouts, land and water creatures teaming up, heck, I've even heard of semi-aquatics teaming up with ACTUAL aquatics which makes some deaths unfair and non-avoidable. People camp, as well of course, but spawn-camping has been prevented, THANKFULLY.

The game's good, the community isn't, the game tries its best to provide you the most efficient play-experience and I appreciate that and it does work for the most part, everything's fair, yet it's not easy. Grab it if you like dinosaurs & sandbox games. Many different playstyles to experience not just with every creature but with the talents and builds you set up. Also super fun in packs, not so much large herds, however.

You can fix this by putting talent points into weather resistance, while also becoming vulnerable to literally everything else on the map. I can understand if there were buffs to go along with stress but it shouldn't take health away because you'll probably die anyway to LIGHTNING. If you don't want to put points into weather resistance, you can find a cave to fix your stress if you're lucky. But there are hardly any caves within a reasonable distance of any drinkable water source, and ALL of them are filled with larger carnivores anyway. And even if you do find one that doesn't have a full grown rex in it, it'll get flooded by the rain anyway. But not just the cave will get flooded, the ENTIRE ISLAND will get flooded. And with the flood, come the mosasaurs who can leap out of the water to the tiny patch of land that's left, grab you, and pull you in. Also, it rains roughly once every 12 minutes and lasts for an hour. Now, I don't consider any of these ""problems"" problems. If they didn't have these challenges it would just be a ripoff of The Isle. And it would STILL be better. The reason I cannot recommend this game as of right now is because of the insane lag. Its fun to survive with all of these challenges alongside other players until I get killed by something that's a mile away on my screen. Other than that, good game so far. They better add more to it though.

I think it's because I live in South East Asia and the servers had really high ping. Plus it kept telling me to update which didn't make sense since I just got the game so it should already be up to date. So I refunded.

Then I started browsing the net n youtube n found BoB. I was really on the fence about getting the game since they just released. Fresh out of the oven. Or still cooking (since it's still early access).

Same problem for me since I'm in SEA, all the servers had high ping but I tried joining one of them anyways. To my surpirse, this game actually allowed me to play it. Yea it can be a bit laggy for me but it worked!

About BoB itself...

It has more features than the other dino game, it lets you customize your color, and people are kind enough to noobs like me.

Yes, the game isn't as pretty as the other game but it works. I haven't encountered any game breaking bugs and I think for an early access game, this is pretty good.

I hope in the future the devs will continue to update, bugfix and improve the game because I see potential. 

I recommend you try it n see for yourself.

Update:

I got kicked out of a server by the admin for protecting my herd.
So we were 2 Apatos (I'm one of them) and 4 Paras (1 adult) and we were attacked by 2 Rexes. The adult Paras was blocking the bridge to prevent one of the Rexes from crossing to get to us and the other Rex attacked my fellow Apato. So me, being the bigger Apato proceeded to attack the Rex. I whipped the Rex real good (could hear its bones crush).
The other Rex (the one who was blocked by the adult Paras) turned out to only want water so they let him through. Me, not knowing that and being in the heat of the moment (not reading chat) went on to attacking the other Rex that attacked first. I wasn't gonna kill it but weaken it enough to make sure it doesn't attack again. Turns out, something happened in the chat (I didn't really see cuz I was focused on protecting the herd) that led to me getting kicked. So the Rexes were crying to the admins telling them I was bullying it. I mean, it attacked first, how was I bullying it? So yeah, I lost my Apato. I was a bit sad about this cuz it's not easy being an Apato. It's slow asf. I'm not salty tho. I'm gonna play again.

Rather than just riff on the game though, I want to offer some constructive feedback. Lets assume you want to play as a carnivore, this is usually how gameplay goes; you spawn in, and you need water. You go to water. If at the water, or at any point along the way you are seen by any other dinosaur that has lived longer than you, it effortlessly runs you down and murders you. If you are lucky enough to avoid detection by another dinosaur (even a herbivore), you now need food. You don't deal enough damage to actually kill anything as a fresh spawn, so you probably have to scavenge. That means whatever killed the prey is probably still in the area, so you either starve to death or try to get food and get murdered (again, often by a herd of herbivores). That said, you will probably see carnivores when you play. So what's going on? Every single carnivore player I have met that wasn't a fresh spawn was in a pack, these range anywhere from a pair to over 5 or 6. The combat is horribly laggy and unbalanced, so if you are outnumbered you are guaranteed death. What this means is as a solo player, your only option is to be a herbivore, or play an aquatic and hope that there isn't a mega pack of mosasaurs near you.

Even if you play a herbivore, the game has a storm system that stresses you out. The only way to not be killed just by existing outside during a storm is to find a cave. There is no way to find a cave if you don't already know where one is, and I have never found one. These storms last as long as two hours, so for the entirety of that gameplay you are sitting in cave doing nothing. In addition, on official servers the devs/admins regularly abuse their powers. A user called 'Terror Panda' has created cyclones ontop of players who killed him to get revenge, and once when I killed him (not knowing who it was), he respawned ontop of me with a giant mosasaur and one-shot me (I was also a mosasaur at about 80% health), then dissapeared. I have even heard from the discord that the devs ban people from official servers just for killing them, but I would take this one with a grain of salt.

Aside from the obvious problems like lag, sever disconnects, crashes and bugs, along with the generally bad models and HORRENDOUS animations that look like they were taken from a mobile game, the gameplay seems designed to support armies of players who just have their buddies spawn as apatosaurs and feed them so they can dominate the server. 

I think a lot of changes need to be made to make the game actually enjoyable for a solo player, but I only listed the two most important ones here.

#1. Make Growth 'Stages' instead of staying as the same 'type'. Right now if you spawn as say, a t.rex, you are exactly the same as any other t.rex of any growth except you are weaker in every stat, -including- speed. This means if a bigger dinosaur sees you, there is noting you can do to get away, and you are too weak to fight it off. To combat this, I suggest having unique growth stages with set stats. So instead of getting, say, a 1% increase to all stats per growth tick (Not sure what the number is, this is just for example), you spawn as a 'Juvie' or 'Stage 1' Rex with flat stats, and once you have lived long enough you could advance to a 'Adolescent' or 'Stage 2' rex. This way, fights between dinosaurs of your size is fair, and more importantly it could be set that juvies are automatically faster than adults, or at least configurable by the developers. So a juvie rex, while far too weak to fight an adult, would be faster and able to escape. This is probably one of the biggest changes that needs to be made.

#2. Groups need major nerfs. Right now all that matters in a fight is how many buddies you have, and as such being in a group is purely a better choice than solo play. To combat this, I feel groups need some serious balancing. For a start, groups need a max cap. I have often seen mega packs of five, or six, or even more trexes. Such a number is impossible for a single rex player to ever combat, or even escape from, so rather than giving groups such a gigantic advantage, limit their numbers and apply stress/discomfort when more than the limit are present. However, this in itself doesn't fix the main issue, the pure power advantage of a group. Two rexes will still always beat one rex, no matter how skilled the solo player is, and two rexes will always have an easier time getting food than one rex. My solution is such: Tie growth more closely to feeding; this way one rex will get, say, 100% of the value of a carcass, and grow faster. Two rexes can only get 50% each (assuming they share), and so would each grow slower than the solo player.


*New Edit*

Apparently the apatosaurs in the game is literally worthless. It's stomp attack has such a long wind up that literally any other dinosaur can effortlessly defeat you just by staying in front you and biting, then backing up a few feet , then running in again. There is literally nothing you can do about it. The tail whip has such terrible collision that even if you attack from behind you aren't going to hit anything either.

*New Edit 2*

As of the current patch, the Pteranodon can do a metric shitload of damage which means swarms of them are going around and spawn killing everything. Once they see you they are too fast, laggy, and small to accurately hit and they easily two or three shot even larger dinosaurs like the Lurdusaurus. This has gotten so bad that I can't even play this game anymore until it is fixed",1545937539,1546196576,False,3,0,0.519940674304962158,4,True,False,True

The concept itself is great and I was excited when this came as I followed it for a while now, sadly I cant say I have been enjoying it a whole lot.

So yes, this game is early access and there are alot of bugs and glitches.. and with alot I really do mean alot. Not to forget the whole thing gets rather laggy if you are on a crowded server. Now these are things I can get over because these are all things thats not uncommon for an early access game.

Some of the good things about this game is a well done skill system, day/night cycle, weather system with tides and storms, comfort system and you can play in the air, on land and even in the water.

That being said, the graphics are mediocre at best, the world feels empty, there is no AI and there just isnt much to do at all... And one of the biggest things that annoyed me is the sounds.. Good lord they suck HARD. And you will hear a dino's footsteps like they are next to you even though they might be a mile away from you.

Your journey as a lone player will probably go like this: You start out as an infant, hope there arent bigger guys camping the spawn point and move on in the search for carcasses laying on the ground and a puddle of water to drink for using your scent. Then most likely after wandering around in a lifeless enviroment for a couple of hours hoping you'll grow soon you'll meet a gang of carni's you cant possibly outrun and be dead in seconds. Then you start over.. and repeat. 

Thats been my experience so far besides one time where I grew up as an adult megalo. Logged back into the server one day to find me rezzed next to a t-rex 5 feet away who again killed me in seconds.

So I doubt I will be playing this game anytime soon again but I'll keep an eye on it, but as for now this game is just not worth spending 20 euro's on and I cant possibly recommend it to anyone unless you can see past all the negative and have a few hardcore gaming friends to team up with.",1546094591,1546094944,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Everyone was running around killing each other, it was a load of fun, I spent several hours just obsessing over BoB and telling everyone this game had the superior gameplay.

The good
- You can fully costumize your dinosaur with a selection of skins, for some people it's a double edge sword because I have come across dinosaurs that are bright pink, purple, blue, which could be said ""ruins the immersion"". That being said most bright colored dinosaurs are the big strong ones like apatosaurus and a fully grown trex, things that don't really need to hide. You never see little animals as glow sticks because they are quickly eaten since they are a dinner plate beacon as well as defenseless, giving a reality to the phrase ""natural selection"".
- The enviroment changes are stunning, I myself, prefer to play a marine animal to enjoy the cycles of the tide. There is nothing more satisfying then swimming into a forest that would otherwise be dry land, as dinosaurs are struggling to keep out of the rising flood while a twister is flinging players through the air in the background.
- The pvp is a lot more relaxed and less constricting compared to BoB competitor (the isle), occasionally I have actually come out of a pvp situation where I am a the disadvantage, which is always a terrific feeling. Even dying is dare I say... more relaxing? Because you're not always at a massive disadvantage if someone is a little more grown than you but you are still able to play better than them.

The bad
I'm disappointed to write this part, because on release the game was really fun, and I wish it would have stayed that way.

- Your dinosaur never stops growing. At first, your thought might be, how could that ever be bad? You continue to grow, your stats continue to grow, you become a powerful almighty. Well your stats keep growing with your dinosaur, which means your food and water needs continue to grow. For example lets say a food source gives 100/100 food before it's depleted, as a baby trex your food will start off as 50/50, so you can eat half of a dinosaur before it's depleted. As an adult with 100/100 food you must eat an entire dinosaur to fill up. Well as you grow, suddenly your food bar is 200/200, which means you need to consume 2 full dinosaurs or 1 large dinosaur to fill up. 500/500 you'll need to eat 5 dinosaurs or 2 very large dinosaurs to fill up. While you're a powerful almighty, killing isn't much of an issue. Unless suddenly the whole server starts playing little dinosaurs or something that isn't terrestrial. Suddenly your dinosaur has a garenteed expiration date. From what I've heard from players who reach super big dinosaurs they have to have their friends spawning in as the largest playable dinosaurs to feed their friend, until eventually nothing fills you up.
I feel I know why this mechanic is in, I believe it's so that you don't see groups of super power players running around running a server. In other words there's always a bigger fish. But I feel like group control would be a better solution and make things overall more enjoyable.

- The comfort meter. This mechanic is a double edged sword, it actually does its job very well. Too well is the problem. The comfort meter, as I understand it, strengthens and weakens your stats depending. If your dinosaur is super comfortable, your stats are normalized, if your dinosaur is uncomfortable, stats are reduced accordingly. 0 comfort and you start dying.  The comfort meter encourages a lot of pretty good game-play. If you're out of your element, if it storms, if you overeat, if you're near an enemy you lose comfort. All stuff that encourages you to do natural behaviors to gain more comfort. For example you don't want to swim too long, you don't want to be out in a storm, you don't want to be buddy, buddy  snuggling with a trex if you're a large and juicy hadrosaur steak. These are all good things the comfort meter has done.

The downside to the comfort meter is it promotes large groups or (mega packs). The more group members you have around you the more comfortable your dinosaur becomes, and rightly so. What threat is there to a group of 4 large trexes? Or 6 large mosasurs?
Mega groups are immediately the worst problem a survival game could have. The elements are already against you, but if you're a solo player looking for friends, and no one's volenteering (which has been me plenty of times) then there's nothing you can do, you have no chance at growing if there's 4 large groups of dinosaurs who won't allow you into their clan because they only view you as a food source.
And as if the number disadvantage alone isn't already a great enough disadvantage, because the mega groups are grouped, they sit at max comfort all the time, with maxed stats growing faster than you do and ever will.
This problem is the worst for the marine dinosaurs, because most of their food is each other, since marine animals can't go on land and there's no other food source for them unless you happen to catch a lucky break and food becomes available during high tide or you happen to find a terrestrial dinosaur crossing the ocean.
But this problem otherwise completely removes you as a competitor in the game, you never get an oppertunity to grow, you're either forced to play as an herbivore since herbivore groups are much more inclined to take in any plant eater, or you quit the game.

And honestly the mega groups problem is the whole reason I'm even writing this review. The game is otherwise pretty fun for me, but it's no fun being forced to play as an herbivore because everyone runs around in groups and joining with them is an impossibility. So, I suppose my review won't mean much if you have a lot of friends and are good at making friends, but BoB is just another survival game suffering from 'biggest group of friends rules the server'. And I'm done with that.",1546053073,1546053273,False,100,0,0.80432891845703125,5,True,False,True

Pros it offers alot of progression with your growth with land flying and swiming creatures all getting there own stats and can even gain inharent points through there survival. Theres alot of space for you to wander with food strewn allover for ya to grab and horde you can carry pile of meat to your hidden domain wherever that may be.


Cons are opinions and facts as i know most have seen or experienced The commenity first off dont get me wrong there are clearly not all toxic swollen players roaming BUT dont expect to make friends with friendly calling some random player. Aside from constant death from greedy players (you know the type) my experience was to avoid everyone be the most reclusive thing possible until hopefully nothing kills you off.  Aside from the cannibalism and death youd have to deal with the massive ammouts of glitches from everything the game itself will break causeing you to get stuck and be killed or just for you to relog in which you log back in dead or about to die. I know we all know the game is very new but i think its clearly overrated given the animations and buggyness the UI is a mess aswell as most of the mechanics its fun but its not something id rush to play given how simple it is.

it maybe jumped the gun to fast the base game is there but it shouldnt be praised like its full and ready it clearly need ALOT of polishing. Im not disreguarding the fact that i didnt enjoy it i did im just making a point that the game just isnt as great as everyones making it seem and being unrealistic about it.

I am now playing Beasts of Bermuda since the release and I have to give a review for it. First of all the game is extremely fun to play. My main quickly became the Pteranodon, because lets face it, it's just quite amazing to be able to fly and explore the map from the birds viewpoint! I love the Ancestral Plains map, the mechanics of certain events that make surviving a bit of a challenge, speaking of: Tornadoes, Floods and Tides, Draught of lakes, until rain fills them again etc. 

Of course not to forget all the dinosaurs! Most dinos (players) I encountered were rather kind and did not KOS. But if you use the same skin on each Respawn, people get to recognize you, as you have your own unique identity for the time of life of your dinosaur. So some people such as a pair of Mosas came to befriend me, because I am the kind of Ptera who does not attack anyone for real. I fed them and they leave me be :) But there is of course also the other side! You could potentially make enemies and those will recognize you and try to hunt you down. Which is fun and challenging!

Now for an Early Access game I have to say, I am impressed, because BoB truly has so many functions, mechanics etc. that are a joy to play with! I did not get bored at all in the course of playing this game for the days after release. Yes there are bugs, glitches and fixes still needed to make it all work out perfectly. But this does not take the fun away from this game!

Graphics: If you played other games, you may need get used to BoB's graphics, in my opinion the graphics and environment is exactly what BoB needs, it's beuatiful and engaging! From decaying Carcasses, to draughts and floods! It all is so amazingly intervined! Love it!

Dinosaurs: BoB has tons of dinos you can play as, Flyers, Aquatics, Herbivores and Carnivores. 
More dinosaurs will follow and we will definitely get more flyers as well! 

My verdict: For an EA game I highly recommend it to new players! BoB has a bright future, those who can see this, will stick with the game, because the potential is definitely there!",1545695885,1545695885,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

I was scared that it might have server problems and crashes(which it did at times), lag(when over 50 players enter), and bugs(which is common), but overall it wasn't a bad game or a good game. It is a great game. 

You can play as  a Herbivore, Carnivore, Marine dinosaur or a Flyer, each with pros and cons behaviors and what they eat. What makes it so great is that you can select a skin that was made by the dev team or customize the colors of your own which I spent time on XD. I played mostly as a rex and the first thing the game throws is a tutorial which explains how to eat, your comfort, stamina, and attack ability. What blew my expectations was that the game had talent trees which I thought it was useless, but all of them were. For example, you can max out weather resistance to reduce chances of you getting struck by lighting, increase companionship which increases comfort, makes you grow faster and get talent points faster. So many possibilities you can throw on it. I can make my rex a tank, a speedy predator, a damage dealer, provide stress to any enemy dinosaurs I meet. And believe me, the comfort meter is very important, probably the most important thing in the game. If your comfort meter is low, you're more vulnerable to injury, stress, do less damage, lose stamina.

I tried the marine animals and my goodness the difference is night and day. The feeling of swimming around and killing other marine dinosaurs as a krono to being a mosa and just mimicking Jaws as you can just grab a land dino and drag it under the water. You can go through caves and find yourself in a lake and grab up poor souls that you catch drinking. It has happened many times when I was a land dino, seeing another drink water next to me and see a mosa speedily swim up and just grab one and drag it back in.

The best I loved about the game is the natural disasters like the flood and tornados. Predatoria whispered me about what it will be like and this blew me away. Like when the rain comes in and causes floods, forcing you to move to higher ground other wise you're a free meal for the marine dinosaurs. Or when the low tide kicks in and you see a marine dino beached in the middle of the land. And when the winds kick in and you see trees flying and landing near you and turning around and see a tornado targeting you. One spawned near me and I thought it was going to take me when it took a sharp left I just rand dodging trees and hoping it doesn't get me.

And finally the flying dinosaurs(mostly pteranadon). Is it a bit laggy, yes. A big bugged? Yes. But it works. The controls are great once you get it and I felt like an X wing fighter, pecking all the rexes. The funniest and golden moment of flying is the crashing. You wouldnt believe how hilarious it is to be flying at the fastest speed and crash into a tree, killing you and hearing every bone in your body break. Or moments when you body breaks in front of any dino and watch it end your suffering.

The problems with the game is of course rex gang/mosa gang/mega gang. I mean like it was to be expected, but once you have certain players grow to the highest level they control the server. They know the spawn points so they will camp and kill any unfortunate soul that cross their paths. And with talents that can increase their smell, you stand no chance of escaping the gang. But as I said it was expected since the Isle had the same thing with rex gangs/trike gangs/giga gangs/etc, and only hope was a group capable of taking them down or a server wipe. Another problem is of course the bug where the servers claim to be full when it isn't so you have to refesh it a couple of times in order to get the right number and when you get it the game would crash or freeze, so you either had to restart the game or restart steam. But it's to be expected becasue this is a Early Access game.

In conclusion, Beast of Bermuda so far IS better than the Isle, and most of the players cannot deny that, even most Isle players. Which is the sole reason why they slap negative reviews on this game, because they probably admitted that is better, and want to find excuses to hate on the game, and you can see how they write paragraphs on graphics, animations models and why Isle is better and how it's a ripoff. All they do is show how much hypocrites they are and how desperate the Isle dev team is. I mean they even threw a sale on The Isle, the day on release of this game! Most of my friends have played for 3 hours and 1 cant stop playing it, and most of us said that so far it's better becasue there is much more content than the Isle. The growth is great compared to the grueling boring growth time of the Isle( 6 hours to grow a rex?). Even this game throws crystals to boost growth on the dinos. Best part of it all as that there is so many choices and so many options to do. And B.o.B did what the Isle failed to do: Make a fun dinosaur game. And yes the Isle graphics are better, but B.o.B proves that graphics doesn't make the game. It's definitly worth the $20 bucks, and I can easily say that you can put 1000 hours into this game and still not get board. Hats off to the B.o.B team.

IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A SPOILER FREE EXPERIENCE, GO NOW.
If not, read on.

I've played quite a lot of dino games, heck, I think I might even own the most of them on steam and so far, BoB is the only one to make it actually feel like I am playing a dino and not a complete, boring mess.
Every dinosaur has a completely different feeling as to how it plays, offering a multitude of different lifestyles and actually building up an interacting ecosystem with players.
Here are some of the noteworthy things the game does:
-Nesting: with new players able to be ""born"" into the world as one of the parents eggs. This comes with genetics that can pass and parents that can care and bring food to their young, creating a unique way to interact with others.
You can even see the world a bit whilst in the egg! 
-Stress system: This right here is one of the best points. Being near other species or predators stresses your dinosaur, making you WANT to get away. Being near your own species raises your comfort and makes herds something you actually want to be a part in.
-Food isn't just food: As a predator, you need to find fresh food. You can eat rotting meat, but it might poison you and weaken you. It makes you look for the freshest meals or hunt your own! Herbivores meanwhile need to eat the plants meant for them or just as much suffer food poisoning. It makes you naturally migrate and search for the best food sources.
-Scent: Finally done right, you can smell where to find water and meat, as well as how fresh it is. You can also smell other players and even if they are male or female via scent. Sniffing for water has saved my butt a few times in my short playtime!
-Speaking of water: Water fills natural pools with rain and flooding and depletes when drank from. I really enjoy this mechanic because it dynamically changes the landscape, keeping you going.
-Weather: Tornados and storms cause flooding, stress and possible death. It's scary but that makes it fun.
-Land, Water, Air: You want it, BoB has a dino for that. Every type of dino is fun in its own way. Dive for fish as Ptero or pull other dinos into the water as anything aquatic and beasty.
-Skilltree: Offers you the ability to better your dinosaur and tweak it to fit your idea of playing even more.

Overall: BoB has a huge promise and I have seen the dev team (which is rather small) move forward swiftly and with a lot of effort put down. What they made is already amazing and I can't wait to see how it evolves in the future.

There are bugs, of course-- it's early access! There's already a hotfix being worked on to iron out the major gamebreaking issues as they're reported.

Compared to other dinosaur games I've played, this blows them all out of the water mechanically. The graphics might not be fully realistic, but the game doesn't TRY to be realistic. There's an element of fantasy with portals and crystals, which is a nice hint of mystery regarding the maps and Bermuda as a whole. The dev team is truly talented; there were some mechanics that made my friends and I stop and watch in amazement, and we continued talking about what we found impressive from a gameplay standpoint on and off during our entire play session.

One of the first experiences I had with the game was being a Para with one of them and trying to cross a land bridge that was covered by a high tide. She made it to the beach and climbed up without issue. However, right before her front legs touched the sand, she mentioned she saw a shadowy figure in the water behind us. I felt my heart jump when I looked behind and saw the blurred dark figure of a mosasaur approaching, and juuuust as I touched land, it actually grabbed me and pulled me further out into deep water. When my dinosaur struggled free from one mosa, one of its packmates surged forward and pulled me back out again as I was trying to paddle back to shore. All my friend could do was watch helplessly as they dragged me through the water twice, the event soon turning into a feeding frenzy.

A later experience I had was climbing up a steep ledge with my friends (yet again as Paras), but struggling. It was steep enough to slow our momentum to a crawl, and it almost felt like our poor parasaurs were going to slide backwards on the terrain. I was curious about something though and decided to test out the crouch-walk, where the para goes down on all fours, to see if it'd give any more traction compared to walking on two legs... And it did!! We were able to climb the slope on all fours much easier than we would have if we walked up on two. Simple things like that really make the game feel nice to play.

Other things we marvelled at include storms, the dynamic tide system, how water actually drains when you drink from it, the fun skin customization and how it let us identify players by looks alone, how entering sleep mode with certain dinosaurs actually rests their heads where you're currently looking (nice touch!), how meat visibly disappears on carcasses the more you eat, how smooth, fun, and easy to control flight feels (despite the occasional speed glitch), how it's relatively easy and simple to find your friends in the world, and so on.

The skill tree is also super fun to play around with-- one of my friends seems to like maxing out comfort and resistances, whereas I prefer boosting my speed and stamina. You can play as any dinosaur the way YOU want and not be punished for it in any unfair way.

Closing thoughts: This game is everything I missed about The Isle. Some might see the graphics as a downside, but I personally find them charming and nice to look at. The game is colorful and landmarks are plentiful (so long as there's no fog) and it's such a refreshing change of pace from gritty realism where everything is brown, gray, and black. I'm glad I could purchase day of launch and I can't wait to see where this game goes from here.",1545534106,1545534106,True,6,0,0.551122188568115234,0,True,False,True

This game is full of bugs and broken models/systems/etc, isn't optimized whatsoever, and even at the highest graphic levels looks flat and undetailed, more becoming of an early-gen PS2 game or mobile game than a PC developed game. Its broken, difficult to play and the experience when you DO get to play isn't anywhere near rewarding enough to justify the frustration and roadblocks encountered in normal play.

The game is currently in a state that isn't anywhere close to release-grade into EA. The framerate never goes above 25-30FPS even on a machine that's nearly double the requirements. The animations are very awkward and unrealistic, resulting in broken necks/tails and bow-legged gaits that make the dinosaurs appear totally weightless or toy-like. The sounds of the animals themselves are almost entirely unedited stock sounds and some seem to have been lifted from other sources (JP Rex roar, etc) that's ripe for copyright smackdowns. The sound system in general is extremely low quality; there's no directional hearing, sounds seem muted and muffled even when the source is extremely close, and for a game reliant on audio cues this makes for a terrible and frustrating experience.

Most of the models are decent enough, but a few (like the Icthy and ptera) are of sharply lower quality than the rest. Sounds and actions/animations aren't properly synced on almost every animal. Keybinding is difficult and only works half the time. The servers are highly unstable and crash repeatedly even when mostly empty. The lag is very, very noticeable. Half of all of the actions a player can preform come with no context or introduction, leaving to a confusing, conjested and disorienting experience that can span from the first few hours to longer. The maps are large but resources are spread thin and the topography is jagged and extreme to the point of annoyance; its insanely easy to fall and die or fall and get stuck resulting in waiting for death or a respawn that wipes the character.

The skin system is neat but there are so many choices that its confusing and intimidating at times. There are color options for parts that are completely invisible on the selection screen which makes customizing annoying. Bright neon colors are neat in theory but are jarringly out of place in a survival setting, and the lack of dimorphism makes grouping difficult. The different systems surrounding comfort are interesting and unique but can sometimes be so wildly out of the player's control as to be infuriating. Players can't control weather and other environmental factors, and for slower dinosaurs this means a long, drawn-out pointless death of vague ""discomfort"" just from being out in the rain or wind for too long.

The camera is jittery and results in breakneck swings and snaps that can make combat impossible. The flying and swimming cameras are particularly terrible and result in accidental drowning or fatal crashes often. The larger dinosaurs are so slow that playing them isn't particularly rewarding in the survival game mode. Scent is functional but nearly useless at night and uses up ability that can leave a dinosaur bafflingly vulnerable. Sure, carrying food and forming packs is easy enough and useful, but keeping an animal within a ridiculously razor-thin band of optimum ""comfort"" takes so much effort and sheer dumb luck as to greatly diminish the overall fun from playing.

There are very few dinosaurs and marine/flying reptiles to pick from and there are far less herbivores/prey than carnivores, leaving the player environment disasterously tilted towards the predator. Again, herbivores could be fun if they had more to offer from gameplay than a near constant need to eat and drink and few choices for socialization, interaction or goal reaching to reward the long, exhaustingly drawn-out playtime to grow them.

Comparisions to The Isle are inevitable, but I'd rather keep that kettle of fish well out of the home. There's obvious copying and mimickry of The Isle present, but the game isn't solid enough on its own to offer much of a unique experience besides the ""comfort"" quantifier that is completely unexplained, vague and nearly impossible to fullfil. Just having more systems to keep an eye on doesn't make the gameplay more exciting or fun, it just makes keeping track of everything harder and survival difficult and unrewarding.

The complete lack of an introduction, tutorial or other key to ease new players in leaves most confused and disoriented and easy pickings for other players. It makes for a frustrating, unrewarding experience. Some of the dino models are okay, the foliage looks okay in places and horrible in others, the tide and monsoon/drought cycle is neat but can be annoying, scent is jarringly oversaturated and impossible to keybind off of key movement keys. The skin system is cool to a degree but then becomes wildly unrealistic, and there aren't any in-game rewards to favor players acting in natural or environmentally building ways.

Its been a little over 24 hours and there's always room for improvement, but the game doesn't deliver on the promises it made out of the gate. It should have been released later in a more stable, complete state, as playing for 30 minutes only for the server to crash and take all progress with it?

But right now, sadly to write this negative review; I am unable to enjoy. 
In this state the game is only enjoyable if you have more than 1 friend to play with you. Because It is so hard to survive from gang attacks. 

I can’t describe the excitement for this game I had several months ago. 
And in this week both my friends and I went literally crazy and couldn’t wait. 
The game released, we sat in front of our computers, watched the game download, counted minutes and every megabytes. We were like little kids waiting to get their birthday presents. 
My game finished downloading first, I managed to play alone. Theres a sound problem I will explain later. But other than that I didn’t encounter major issues, got killed by 7 T-rexes’ pack when I was almost an adult. I didn’t go mad at all. I got used to this thanks to The Isle. 

After this my friends joined the game and we enjoyed A LOT. We loved the mechanics and everything about it and couldn’t stop complimenting! 
But what now?
I had thought at that time this game is relaxing and fun, till today. A day after the release. 
I know its so new, but I felt like I have to write review. 

Lets start why I don’t recommend the game:

Rex, Icthy and Megalo gangs exist. They are generally groups of 4-8 players. What is worse, they always camp at spawn places. 
Once they spot a freshly spawned dinosaur, that dinosaur is as dead as a fossil. No way of escaping because of the scent system. (It’s not like on The Isle, the fog directly shows where you went and are hiding.)
Even if you hide in bushes or under a tree, they will see you because the foliage is too slow to load, even if it does for you, players will see you anyways because it won’t load for them if they are a little away from you. 
Also since you start as a very young adult, you are not fast enough nor have enough stamina to escape. 
In addition to this even when you are crouching your foot steps are as loud as when walking/running.

Speaking of sounds, even if a player is 1km away from you, it sounds like its near your butt. When I first encountered this, made me paranoid I kept running and looking around but couldn’t see anyone. This still freaks me out lol. 

Spawn areas: they are the biggest issue for me. Somewhat reason the game loves to spawn you near the groups or maybe its because people know where the spawn spots are and camp there like I mentioned before. Today, I spawned 7 times (no kidding) right next to adults and/or mega packs. Every damn time I respawned I was ALWAYS NEAR THEM. 
3 times I thought I finally had got a good spawn, but I was wrong, since I walk too loud, They found me and killed me 2 minutes after. 
You can’t grow because of this. The adult dinosaurs are the ones kept killing everything spawned and camped near unlimited drinkable water source areas. 
It gets so annoying when you are keep dying before you could even move a muscle. 
I am known as a calm gamer, I have never in my life rage quitted, never ever. I always defended BoB development and was very optimistic about it. 
But today I really wanted to quit and delete the game forever. This isn’t my first EA game so I am actually very patient. So, congratulations for making me mad. 

Controls: Well this isn’t a big issue, I recommend you to set the keys if you are launching game for the first time because its mixed. 
Also I should mention, on first day Roars, Specials and food grabbing were working, but now they are bugged and not working for most of the players. Only 1, 3 and F roar is working right now. 

How do you fly the Pteranodon? To fly you have to press Shift+ Space at the same time. But no matter how many times I and some players tried, we couldn’t take off. 

Aquatic Creatures: Well, They are so boring to play. All you can do is sit and pray for someone to swim across the sea. This might take HOURS. 

Lag issue: I am not going to complain about this. Yes, it is true combatting is so hard because of extreme lag but the game is just out and there were around 50 testers tested BoB before the release. We had about 900 players playing first day and developer didn’t expect to have that many players. 

Comfort: Rain stresses you. Then your health drops, you need to find a cave and hide. Good luck on this. Even if you find one, there is %100 a rex pack waiting for their unsuspecting walking steak to enter the cave. 
I recommend adding big trees for this. Make them so they can protect you from rain or simply, lower the raining rate and damage. I realised that almost all players exit the server once they die from stress (caused by rain). 

I hate cartoonish games in general, but I am in love this game’s graphics. They are so cute and pretty in my opinion!
Love the color customisation but sick and tired of seeing neon pink, rainbow dinosaurs...
I can’t compare the graphics, models and maps of this game to The Isle’s. The Isle has been developing for so long. It has so much profit to hire experienced developers and buy models for at least 10k USD each. 
While BoB has just came out and developers dont have much money yet they are still doing their best. 

There are other minor bugs, but they are easier to fix and doesn’t ruin the gameplay. 

So, you should buy BoB if you are a patient player and okay with the things I mentioned. If not, I recommend you to give it some time.

Yes it still has a couple rough edges, bugs and other stuff, but with the amount of features, systems and thought put into each of them, none of the somewhat similar games can even remotely compare to BoB.

The graphics are pretty good for an indie game and the weather systems create interesting scenes while you survive. Another good point is that the Progression Skill Tree is nicely fleshed out and easy to understand, can be used to create unique experiences with the same dinosaur if you survive long enough to max out the appropriate skills, it also opens up the market for specific builds to deal with specific things allowing niches to form.

I would list some positive things about the game but I can't. Like not a single thing. So I guess here goes the bad things:

- First thing I noticed was the game looked very mediocre at best even with the settings turned to epic. 

-You'd think if it looks just okay it would atleast run pretty good right? Not at all, on medium settings (Which looks awful) the game runs at best of 60-80 fps. Keep in mind I have a GTX 1080 and an i7 six core processor. and sometimes the game would even drop down to the 30-40s range for no appearant reason.

-Next is the Dinosaurs themselves. A few of them look decent. Like the Velociraptor, The Trex, The Mosa, Apatosaurus, and a few others. But alot of the creatures look like trash. Especially the Megalosaurus, and the Para. They just look gross and not modeled well. The quality of the animals in this game seems very inconsistant. 

-Next the animations. Probably the worst part of this game. Only a few had good animations, some were decent but they were mostly bad. They feel stiff and unrealistic. The animations made gameplay feel gross alot of the time.

-Speaking of gameplay there isnt any. I wondered around this map for about 30 minutes with different creatures and the only time I came across anything was when I played as a pteradon flying over everything.

-The servers are bad and you constantly lag. Combine that with the bad animations and you have yourself some very choppy and stiff gameplay.

-Not only are the servers bad but they only host 50 people at the most.( One of the reasons I never found anyone most likley.) 

-There is obviously alot of things this game copied and pasted from the isle. Except The isle has better graphics, models, animations, framerates, less lag, and more gameplay. And for the same price. 

I really wanted to like this game, but I can't recomend it. The quality just isn't there. I might check this game out later down the line, in like a year or two. But as for now I refunded the game and will not be playing it until the quality is atleast half of what most other games are. Don't buy this game. If you're looking for an open world dinosaur experince get The Isle.

It is everything most people wanted from a dinosaur simulation game and more. It has only been out for a little of course so there's a few bugs here and there and some dinosaurs are currently unavailable, but in my experience the pros definitely outweigh the cons. It is unique compared to most other simulation games I've played and I am excited to pay and contribute to where this game is headed. The devs seem very courteous and very helpful and actually seem to care in the direction their game is going and it doesn't feel like it's going to stay in the shape it is in for very long, as in it will only improve with what I've seen so far.

I think it is worth buying now to give the devs/etc more money to work on their game, but that is my opinion. There is lots to do as both a herbivore and a carnivore. The playbase is so nice compared to that of the Isle and the toxicity is not nearly as prevalent.

There's limits for each server that you can set for pack/herd sizes which is a welcome addition as you won't now have a pack of ten T-rex's hunting one Parasaur or etc etc.

With the nesting system that takes you a lot of time, carrying out the eggs, repairing your nest and incubating your eggs it already won me over.
There are currently 3 different maps to play on each with it's own unique areas and caves to discover, but be careful! You are not alone in those caves sometimes.

Sound is a bit loud (stomping, calls etc.) but turning down your game volume help with that. It is a bit too dark for marine creatures right now, so you don't see too much unfortunately but alone with all the mechanics Bob has already it's gonna be a lot of fun!

Explore, fly, swim, hunt, survive fluds and storms, mate, lay eggs, raise offspring, choose from different premade skins and change their colors completely to your taste, go solo or pack/herd. You can literally do whatever you want to do here.

If you think of buying this game seeing the trailer, I would recommend to wait until this game is more updated.
Beasts of Bermuda is not in the state in which it would be playable as of the public early access release date.
There are simply too many bugs for this game to be viable. If you want to play a dinosaur simulator, there are plenty of others besides this one.
I suspect the reason why this game is buggy is simply because the development team was too ambitious, trying to include everything from the start, while the base game has a lot of problems. I'll give a short pro/con list below:

Pros:
- Terrestrial, as well as aquatic and aerial species
- Large amount of player freedom
- Balanced gameplay
- Good community
- A choice of near first person perspective

Cons:
- Bugs. A lot of them
- Some features are in the middle of implementation during release
- Rough animations and the transitions between animations
- Odd, glitchy physics
- Extremely loud sound effects

Some Pros: 
The maps are great and designed well
the models are very well done I can see that a lot of put into them
the fact that you can play as a sea creature and a flyer is what sold me to get this game, I love flyers and playing it is a joy 
So far the playbase is very friendly and helpful 
I very much like the modes, espcially the growth mode it's cool seeing your creature slowly grow and that egg state is super cool

Now to some cons: 
There's some bugs, mostly to the flyers, they tend to bug out quite often. like getting stuck after taking out and the debug doesn't work 
I really don't like the fact that you have to wait over a minute to respawn, it makes being a newbie at this game hard since you have to wait so long just to respawn, I really don't see a use for it (but that's my own two shoes) 
the sound design needs a bit of work I found the constant sniffing and the ear bleeding wind sound very annoying
